{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","PARTS LIST"],"p":["Reference is made to commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08\/222,583 filed concurrently herewith entitled \u201cDEFLECTION DEVICE INCLUDING GAS FLOW RESTRICTION DEVICE\u201d in the name of Michael S. Hanchak, incorporated herein by reference.","This invention relates generally to the field of digitally controlled printing devices, and in particular to continuous printing systems in which a liquid stream breaks into droplets at least some of which are deflected by a gas flow.","In printing systems, for example, inkjet printing systems, it is critical to provide systems having predictable and accurate printed drop placement in order to reduce image defects and maintain print quality standards. Conditions which may lead to reduced printed drop placement accuracy resulting in increased image defects and reduced print quality should to be minimized.","The present invention helps to provide predictable and accurate printed drop placement by reducing turbulent gas flow in printing systems that use gas flow to deflect drops. Drop deflection or divergence can be adversely affected when turbulence is present in, for example, the interaction area of the drops and the gas flow force. Turbulent gas flow may increase or decrease the angle of drop deflection or divergence for both printed and non-printed drops which may lead to reduced drop placement accuracy, image defects, and poor print quality.","According to one aspect of the present invention, in a printing system that uses gas flow to deflect drops, a laminar flow of gas that has uniform velocity and directionality across a nozzle array is provided in a drop deflection zone so that drop deflection occurs in a predictable and accurate manner.","According to another aspect of the invention, a continuous printing system gas flow deflection mechanism includes a nozzle array, a gas flow source, and a gas flow duct. The nozzle array has a width. The gas flow duct is in fluid communication with the gas flow source and includes an expansion region and a compression region. The expansion region has a cross sectional length and a cross sectional width and includes a first portion and a second portion. The first portion of the gas flow duct is coupled to the gas flow source. The expansion region of the gas flow duct gradually expands along its cross sectional length, for example, to at least the width of the nozzle array, such that the cross sectional width of the expansion region in the second portion of the expansion region is greater than the cross sectional width of the expansion region in the first portion of the expansion region. The compression region has a cross section sectional length and a cross sectional width and includes a third portion and a fourth portion. The third portion of the compression region is adjacent to the second portion of the expansion region. The compression region of the gas flow duct gradually contracts along its cross sectional length such that the cross sectional width of the compression region in the fourth portion of the compression region is less than the cross sectional width of the compression region in the third portion of the compression region.","According to another aspect of the invention, a method of printing includes providing a nozzle array having a width; providing a gas flow duct in fluid communication with a gas flow source, the gas flow duct including an expansion region and a compression region, the expansion region having a cross sectional length and a cross sectional width, the expansion region including a first portion and a second portion, the first portion of the gas flow duct being coupled to the gas flow source, the expansion region of the gas flow duct gradually expanding along its cross sectional length to at least the width of the nozzle array such that the cross sectional width of the expansion region in the second portion of the expansion region is greater than the cross sectional width of the expansion region in the first portion of the expansion region, the compression region having a cross section sectional length and a cross sectional width, the compression region including a third portion and a fourth portion, the third portion of the compression region being adjacent to the second portion of the expansion region, the compression region of the gas flow duct gradually contracting along its cross sectional length such that the cross sectional width of the compression region in the fourth portion of the compression region is less than the cross sectional width of the compression region in the third portion of the compression region; causing liquid to be ejected in the form of a drop having a first volume and a drop having a second volume; and causing a gas flow generated by the gas flow source to flow through the gas flow duct and interact with the drop having a first volume and the drop having a second volume.","The present description will be directed in particular to elements forming part of, or cooperating more directly with, apparatus in accordance with the present invention. It is to be understood that elements not specifically shown or described may take various forms well known to those skilled in the art. In the following description and drawings, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements.","The example embodiments of the present invention are illustrated schematically and not to scale for the sake of clarity. One of the ordinary skills in the art will be able to readily determine the specific size and interconnections of the elements of the example embodiments of the present invention.","As described herein, the example embodiments of the present invention provide a printhead and\/or printhead components typically used in inkjet printing systems. However, many other applications are emerging which use inkjet printheads to emit liquids (other than inks) that need to be finely metered and deposited with high spatial precision. As such, as described herein, the terms \u201cliquid\u201d and\/or \u201cink\u201d refer to any material that can be ejected by the printhead and\/or printhead components described below.","Referring to , a continuous printing system  includes an image source  such as a scanner or computer which provides raster image data, outline image data in the form of a page description language, or other forms of digital image data. This image data is converted to half-toned bitmap image data by an image processing unit  which also stores the image data in memory. A plurality of drop forming mechanism control circuits  read data from the image memory and apply time-varying electrical pulses to a drop forming mechanism(s)  that are associated with one or more nozzles of a printhead . These pulses are applied at an appropriate time, and to the appropriate nozzle, so that drops formed from a continuous ink jet stream will form spots on a recording medium  in the appropriate position designated by the data in the image memory.","Recording medium  is moved relative to printhead  by a recording medium transport system , which is electronically controlled by a recording medium transport control system , and which in turn is controlled by a micro-controller . The recording medium transport system shown in  is a schematic only, and many different mechanical configurations are possible. For example, a transfer roller could be used as recording medium transport system  to facilitate transfer of the ink drops to recording medium . Such transfer roller technology is well known in the art. In the case of page width printheads, it is most convenient to move recording medium  past a stationary printhead. However, in the case of scanning print systems, it is usually most convenient to move the printhead along one axis (the sub-scanning direction) and the recording medium along an orthogonal axis (the main scanning direction) in a relative raster motion.","Ink is contained in an ink reservoir  under pressure. In the non-printing state, continuous ink jet drop streams are unable to reach recording medium  due to an ink catcher  that blocks the stream and which may allow a portion of the ink to be recycled by an ink recycling unit . The ink recycling unit reconditions the ink and feeds it back to reservoir . Such ink recycling units are well known in the art. The ink pressure suitable for optimal operation will depend on a number of factors, including geometry and thermal properties of the nozzles and thermal properties of the ink. A constant ink pressure can be achieved by applying pressure to ink reservoir  under the control of ink pressure regulator . As shown in , catcher  is a type of catcher commonly referred to as a \u201cknife edge\u201d catcher.","The ink is distributed to printhead  through an ink channel . The ink preferably flows through slots and\/or holes etched through a silicon substrate of printhead  to its front surface, where a plurality of nozzles and drop forming mechanisms, for example, heaters, are situated. When printhead  is fabricated from silicon, drop forming mechanism control circuits  can be integrated with the printhead. Printhead  also includes a deflection mechanism (not shown in ) which is described in more detail below with reference to .","Referring to , a schematic view of continuous liquid printhead  is shown. A jetting module  of printhead  includes an array or a plurality of nozzles  formed in a nozzle plate . In , nozzle plate  is affixed to jetting module . However, as shown in , nozzle plate  can be integrally formed with jetting module .","Liquid, for example, ink, is emitted under pressure through each nozzle  of the array to form filaments of liquid . In , the array or plurality of nozzles extends into and out of the figure.","Jetting module  is operable to form liquid drops having a first size and liquid drops having a second size through each nozzle. To accomplish this, jetting module  includes a drop stimulation or drop forming device , for example, a heater or a piezoelectric actuator, that, when selectively activated, perturbs each filament of liquid , for example, ink, to induce portions of each filament to breakoff from the filament and coalesce to form drops , .","In , drop forming device  is a heater  located in a nozzle plate  on one or both sides of nozzle . This type of drop formation is known and has been described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,807 B1, issued to Hawkins et al., on Oct. 1, 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 6,491,362 B1, issued to Jeanmaire, on Dec. 10, 2002; U.S. Pat. No. 6,505,921 B2, issued to Chwalek et al., on Jan. 14, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,554,410 B2, issued to Jeanmaire et al., on Apr. 29, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,575,566 B1, issued to Jeanmaire et al., on Jun. 10, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,588,888 B2, issued to Jeanmaire et al., on Jul. 8, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,793,328 B2, issued to Jeanmaire, on Sep. 21, 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 6,827,429 B2, issued to Jeanmaire et al., on Dec. 7, 2004; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,796 B2, issued to Jeanmaire et al., on Feb. 8, 2005, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.","Typically, one drop forming device  is associated with each nozzle  of the nozzle array. However, a drop forming device  can be associated with groups of nozzles  or all of nozzles  of the nozzle array.","When printhead  is in operation, drops ,  are typically created in a plurality of sizes or volumes, for example, in the form of large drops , a first size or volume, and small drops , a second size or volume. The ratio of the mass of the large drops  to the mass of the small drops  is typically approximately an integer between 2 and 10. A drop stream  including drops ,  follows a drop path or trajectory .","Printhead  also includes a gas flow deflection mechanism  that directs a flow of gas , for example, air, past a portion of the drop trajectory . This portion of the drop trajectory is called the deflection zone . As the flow of gas  interacts with drops ,  in deflection zone  it alters the drop trajectories. As the drop trajectories pass out of the deflection zone  they are traveling at an angle, called a deflection angle, relative to the undeflected drop trajectory .","Small drops  are more affected by the flow of gas than are large drops  so that the small drop trajectory  diverges from the large drop trajectory . That is, the deflection angle for small drops  is larger than for large drops . The flow of gas  provides sufficient drop deflection and therefore sufficient divergence of the small and large drop trajectories so that catcher  (shown in ) can be positioned to intercept one of the small drop trajectory  and the large drop trajectory  so that drops following the trajectory are collected by catcher  while drops following the other trajectory bypass the catcher and impinge a recording medium  (shown in ).","When catcher  is positioned to intercept large drop trajectory , small drops  are deflected sufficiently to avoid contact with catcher  and strike the print media. As the small drops are printed, this is called small drop print mode. When catcher  is positioned to intercept small drop trajectory , large drops  are the drops that print. This is referred to as large drop print mode.","Referring to , jetting module  includes an array or a plurality of nozzles . Liquid, for example, ink, supplied through channel , is emitted under pressure through each nozzle  of the array to form filaments of liquid . In , the array or plurality of nozzles  extends into and out of the figure.","Drop stimulation or drop forming device  (shown in ) associated with jetting module  is selectively actuated to perturb the filament of liquid  to induce portions of the filament to break off from the filament to form drops. In this way, drops are selectively created in the form of large drops and small drops that travel toward a recording medium .","Positive pressure gas flow structure  of gas flow deflection mechanism  is located on a first side of drop trajectory . Positive pressure gas flow structure  includes first gas flow duct  that includes a lower wall  and an upper wall . Gas flow duct  directs gas flow  supplied from a positive pressure source  at downward angle \u03b8 of approximately a 45\u00b0 relative to liquid filament  toward drop deflection zone  (also shown in ). An optional seal(s)  provides an air seal between jetting module  and upper wall  of gas flow duct .","Upper wall  of gas flow duct  does not need to extend to drop deflection zone  (as shown in ). In , upper wall  ends at a wall  of jetting module . Wall  of jetting module  serves as a portion of upper wall  ending at drop deflection zone .","Negative pressure gas flow structure  of gas flow deflection mechanism  is located on a second side of drop trajectory . Negative pressure gas flow structure includes a second gas flow duct  located between catcher  and an upper wall  that exhausts gas flow from deflection zone . Second duct  is connected to a negative pressure source  that is used to help remove gas flowing through second duct . An optional seal(s)  provides an air seal between jetting module  and upper wall .","As shown in , gas flow deflection mechanism  includes positive pressure source  and negative pressure source . However, depending on the specific application contemplated, gas flow deflection mechanism  can include only one of positive pressure source  and negative pressure source .","Gas supplied by first gas flow duct  is directed into the drop deflection zone , where it causes large drops  to follow large drop trajectory  and small drops  to follow small drop trajectory . As shown in , small drop trajectory  is intercepted by a front face  of catcher . Small drops  contact face  and flow down face  and into a liquid return duct  located or formed between catcher  and a plate . Collected liquid is either recycled and returned to ink reservoir  (shown in ) for reuse or discarded. Large drops  bypass catcher  and travel on to recording medium . Alternatively, catcher  can be positioned to intercept large drop trajectory . Large drops  contact catcher  and flow into a liquid return duct located or formed in catcher . Collected liquid is either recycled for reuse or discarded.","As shown in , catcher  is a type of catcher commonly referred to as a \u201cCoanda\u201d catcher. However, the \u201cknife edge\u201d catcher shown in  and the \u201cCoanda\u201d catcher shown in  are interchangeable and work equally well. Alternatively, catcher  can be of any suitable design including, but not limited to, a porous face catcher, a delimited edge catcher, or combinations of any of those described above.","Referring to , an example embodiment of the present invention is shown. Generally described, the present invention relates to a gas flow duct structure, in fluid communication with a gas flow source, that includes an expansion region  and a compression region . Configuring a gas flow duct structure in this fashion helps to reduce and\/or control gas flow turbulence described above.","The gas flow source can be a positive pressure gas flow source  that directs a gas flow  toward the compression region  of a positive pressure gas flow duct structure . Alternatively, the gas flow source can be a negative pressure gas flow source  that directs a gas flow  away from the compression region  of a negative pressure gas flow duct structure . As such, the present invention is described herein with reference to a positive pressure gas flow source  and a positive pressure gas flow duct structure . However, it is to be understood that the present invention is also applicable to a negative pressure gas flow duct structure  and a negative pressure gas flow duct structure .","Printhead  includes nozzle array  having a width . A gas flow duct structure , in fluid communication with a gas flow source , includes an expansion region  and a compression region .","Expansion region , having a cross sectional length  and a cross sectional width A, B, includes a first portion  and a second portion . First portion  of expansion region  of gas flow duct  is coupled to gas flow source  through duct structure . Expansion region  of gas flow duct  gradually expands along its cross sectional length  to at least the width  of nozzle array  as viewed from first portion  of expansion region  toward second portion  of expansion region . Cross sectional width B of expansion region  in second portion  of expansion region  is greater than cross sectional width A of expansion region  in first portion  of expansion region  of gas flow duct .","As used herein, gradually expands means that, at a minimum, the width (from A to B) of the gas flow path is increased at a non-perpendicular angle  relative to a centerline  of the gas flow path. Preferably, the non-perpendicular angle of expansion  is less than 60 degrees relative to the centerline, and more preferably less than 45 degrees. Providing a non-perpendicular angle of expansion  reduces gas flow velocity and increases the cross section of gas flow while minimizing the introduction of turbulent gas flow into gas flow path. This can be contrasted with the abrupt and immediate expansion described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,712, issued to Lammers et al., on Oct. 27, 1981. As shown in FIG. 2 of the '712 reference, a gas  flows from conduit  to settling chamber . The angle of expansion is perpendicular relative to a centerline of conduit  which introduces turbulence into settling chamber .","It is preferable that the definition of gradually expands also include that the individual radii of the curvature ,  between different portions of the expansion region are greater than 0.5 times the cross sectional width A in the first portion of the expansion region  with adjacent curves ,  meeting at the tangent of the curves. More preferably, the individual radii of curvature ,  are greater than 2 times the inlet width, and more preferably, greater than 3 times the inlet width.","Gradually expanding expansion region  of gas flow duct  along its cross sectional length  preferably causes the length of the expansion region to be greater than 3 times the inlet width, and more preferably approximately 6 times the inlet width while still maintaining a relatively compact footprint.","Referring additionally to  and back to , compression region , having a cross section sectional length  and a cross sectional width A, B, includes a third portion  and a fourth portion . Third portion  of the compression region  is adjacent to second portion  of expansion region . Compression region  of gas flow duct  gradually contracts along its cross sectional length  as viewed from third portion  of the compression region  toward fourth portion  of the compression region . Cross sectional width B of compression region  in the fourth portion  of the compression region  is less than the cross sectional width A of the compression region  in the third portion  of the compression region .","As used herein, gradually contracts means that, at a minimum, the width (from A to B) of the gas flow path is decreased at a non-perpendicular angle  relative to a centerline  of the gas flow path. Preferably, the non-perpendicular angle of contraction  is less than 60 degrees relative to the centerline, and more preferably less than 38 degrees. Providing a non-perpendicular angle of contraction  increases gas flow velocity and reduces velocity variations while minimizing or even preventing the introduction of turbulent gas flow into gas flow path. For example, as shown in , the cross sectional width B of the fourth portion  of the compression region  is less than or equal to one half of the cross sectional width A of the third portion  of the compression region .","It is preferable that the definition of gradually contracts also include that the individual radii of the curvature ,  between different portions of the expansion region are greater than 0.5 times the cross sectional width B in the second portion of the contraction region  with adjacent curves ,  meeting at the tangent of the curves. More preferably, the individual radii of curvature ,  are greater than 1 times the cross sectional width B.","After the gas flow passes through compression region , it travels through duct structure  that includes a duct wall  that is parallel to wall  of the jetting module . This parallel flow region (defined by duct wall  and jetting module wall ) helps to maintain the uniform velocity and directionality of the gas flow. As the flow path moves through a curve or change in direction, a portion  of duct wall  is curved or otherwise appropriately shaped to maintain the parallel flow region and the uniform velocity and directionality of the gas flow in the area immediately adjacent to deflection zone .","In some example embodiments, cross sectional width A, B of expansion region  is a first cross sectional width A, B. Expansion region  also includes a second cross sectional width A, B. In these embodiments, expansion region  of the gas flow duct  expands along its cross sectional length  as viewed from first portion  of expansion region  toward second portion  of expansion region . The second cross sectional width B of expansion region  in second portion  of expansion region  is greater than second cross sectional width A of expansion region  in the first portion  of expansion region  (also shown in ). In these example embodiments, the cross sectional width A, B of compression region  and the second cross sectional width A, B of the expansion region  are viewed in the same plane (typically, a plane perpendicular to the direction of drop path , for example, the plane shown in ).","As described above, third portion  of compression region  is adjacent to second portion  of expansion region . In this sense, third portion  of compression region  can be either positioned next to second portion  of expansion region  (as shown with reference to negative pressure gas flow structure ) or a third region  can be positioned between second portion  of expansion region  and third portion  of compression region  (as shown with reference to positive pressure gas flow structure ).","Third region  of gas flow duct  has a substantially uniform cross sectional length  and a substantially uniform cross sectional width . Providing third region  with a substantially uniform cross sectional length  and a substantially uniform cross sectional width  facilitates positioning a flow conditioner(s)  in third region  of gas flow duct  and changing the direction of gas flow . As shown in , flow conditioner(s)  includes a first screen  and a second screen  positioned perpendicular to the direction of gas flow  through third region  of the gas flow duct . First screen  and a second screen  should be uniformly tensioned in both directions along the cross sectional width  and cross sectional length  of the third region  of gas flow duct . Additionally, the weave of the screen should be at a non-perpendicular non-parallel angle relative to the walls of third region  of gas flow duct . For example, the weave of the screens is preferably between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, and more preferably approximately 45 degrees. The resolution of the weave of the screen is preferably greater than 0.75 times the width of the nozzle array.","Flow conditioner(s) , for example, first screen  and second screen , help to make the gas flow velocity uniform across the nozzle array width  by providing a static pressure drop across each screen. It is also believed that the build up of back pressure behind flow conditioner(s)  helps to reduce the likelihood of gas flow detaching from the duct walls in expansion region  which also helps to reduce turbulent gas flow. Screens  and  can be made from metal, nylon, polyester, or other polymer materials.","Alternatively, flow conditioner(s)  can include flow straighteners, open celled foams, or combinations of any flow conditioners previously mentioned. Third region  of gas flow duct , commonly referred to as a settling chamber, is also shaped to change the direction of gas flow  (represented using arrow ).","Referring to  and , the example embodiment of the present invention described above with reference to  is shown along with schematic cross-sectional views of the example embodiment taken along the corresponding section lines shown in .","Duct structure  is typically used to extend the path of gas flow  so that positive pressure source  can be conveniently located. The cross sectional width of the gas flow path in duct structure  is the same as the cross sectional width A of expansion region  in first portion  of expansion region  of gas flow duct .","Duct structure  is typically used to extend the path of gas flow  so that negative pressure source  can be conveniently located. The cross sectional width of the gas flow path in duct structure  is the same as the cross sectional width A of expansion region  in first portion  of expansion region  of gas flow duct .","As shown in FIGS.  and A-K, first portion  of expansion region  of positive pressure gas flow duct structure  has cross sectional width A () that gradually expands () along its cross sectional length  until cross sectional width B () of second portion  of expansion region  is at least the width  of nozzle array . Cross sectional width B of second portion  of expansion region  is greater than cross sectional width A of first portion  of expansion region .","Third region  of gas flow duct  has a substantially uniform cross sectional length  () that is essentially equivalent to cross sectional width B of second portion  of expansion region  and maintained through the cross sectional width A () of the third portion  of the compression region . Compression region  of gas flow duct  then gradually contracts along its cross sectional length  until cross sectional width B () of the fourth portion  of the compression region  is less than the cross sectional width A of the third portion  of the compression region .

Instead, the expansion of the gas flow path in expansion region  is a gradual change from the initial cross sectional width to the final cross sectional width (as described above).","Referring back to , gas flow duct  (and ) is typically assembled from a plurality of individual flow ducts, typically, made from a polymer material. In order to further reduce turbulent gas flow, it is important to minimize steps or discontinuities when assembling the individual ducts. Additionally, the interior surfaces of the individual duct portions are polished, for example, to less than a 65\u00d710inch RMS roughness in order to minimize turbulent gas flow. This degree of surface roughness is very important in the positive pressure gas flow duct structure  in order to minimize turbulent gas flow after the gas flow passes through flow conditioner(s)
