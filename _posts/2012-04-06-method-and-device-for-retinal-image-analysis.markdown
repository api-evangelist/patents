Technical Field","The present application generally relates to a method and device for diagnosing and\/or predicting the presence, progression and\/or treatment effect of a disease. In particular, the present application relates to a method and device for diagnosing and\/or predicting the presence, progression and\/or treatment effect of a disease characterized by retinal pathological changes in a subject.","2. Description of the Related Art","Color retina image is the only way with direct inspection of blood vessel and its pathology change through the whole body. It not only reflects retina disease but also reflects risks of systemic diseases, such as stroke.","Large epidemiological studies showed many retina characteristics which related to long term hypertension and\/or diabetes were associated with stroke incidence or prevalence. Those retina characteristics detected included retina vessel diameter, arteriole-venule nipping, retinopathy, etc. However, there are new retina characteristics that could provide more information on stroke patient classification, such as vessel tortuosity, vessel asymmetry. Furthermore, the interaction of the retina characteristics also provided very important information to classify patients with stroke from those without stroke. We have shown in our clinical study that the result contributed to the classification of patients with stoke from those without stroke using retina vessel tortuosity and asymmetry and interactions of retina characteristics.","Apart from the new retina information we detected manually for stroke classification, computerized automatic analytical system based on fractal analysis, high order spectral analysis, and statistical texture analysis can also classify patients with stroke from those without stoke based on the analysis of color retina images. The data extracted from the automatic system correlated well with the clinical retina characteristics and their interaction. With such correlations, we demonstrated that the automatic analytical system captured the clinically important characteristics over and above the level that can be done manually, this can be expanded to other eye diseases with possible clinical interpretation.","The retinal pathological changes have been shown to be associated with many diseases, including systematic diseases, e.g. stroke, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease and cerebral vascular disease; and eye diseases, e.g. glaucoma, retinopathy due to prematurity, papilloedema, macular hole, and age-related macular degeneration.","Many important eye diseases as well as systemic diseases manifest themselves in the retina. Cardiovascular disease manifests itself in the retina in a number of ways. Hypertension and atherosclerosis cause changes in the ratio between the diameter of retinal arteries and veins, known as the A\/V ratio. A decrease in A\/V ratio such as thinning of the arteries and widening of veins, is associated with an increased risk of stroke [b1]. Recent research has also shown that the branching pattern of retinal arterial and venous systems have fractal characteristics [b2]. For instance, Patton N, Aslam T and et al., suggested that retinal vascular image analysis is a potential screening tool for cerebrovascular disease. They mentioned that the fractals offer a natural, global, comprehensive description of the retinal vascular tree because they take into account both the changes in retinal vessel caliber and changes in branching pattern. Other studies related with retinal vessels' characteristics are also provided by Mainster M. A., and Daxer A., they pointed out that the retinal arterial and venous patterns have fractal dimensions of 1.62+0.05 and 1.7+0.07, also the fractal dimension of retinal vessel patterns with neovascularisation at or near the optic disc (NVD) is about 1.8 comparing with the control group of about 1.7 [b3-4]. However, MacGillivary T. J., Doubal F. N. and et., compared monofractal and multifractal analysis of human retinal vasculature and they indicated that multifractal approach is more efficient for detecting small changes to the retinal vasculature. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that monofractal and multifractal analysis of human retinal vasculature are both necessary. Hence, fractal geometry provides a global and more accurate description of anatomy of the eye than classical geometry. Fractal patterns characterize how vascular patterns span the retina and can therefore provide information about the relationship between vascular pattern and retinal disease.","Recently Hsu W., Lee M. L. and Wong T. Y. have developed a platform (patented) for automated analysis of a retinal image, including automatically tracing one or more paths of one or more vessels of a retinal image, and such obtained information may be useful in forming a diagnosis of a medical condition [b5]. It also developed an automated retinal image analysis system and\/or used the fractal analysis technique to provide disease risk prediction, such as hypertension. However, the approach of tracing vessels is quite retinal image quality dependent comparing to other approaches. Also, the zone defining vessel measurements lack flexibility in practical applications, i.e., the image has to have the optic disc in the middle of the image, it may not cover all useful information if the optic disc is not placed in the middle. Moreover, some useful (or partially useful) non-retinal vasculature related information may have been missed and more importantly almost all of retinal image analysis ignored the effect from the interactions between factors of the vessel measurements, and\/or with other factors such as High order spectra (HOS) and texture analysis related risk factors. Acharya R., Chua C. K. and et al., have found the application of non-linear features of the HOS was more suitable for the detection of shapes and thus they apply this technique for the identification of diabetes Retinopathy stages [b6]. Dobrescu R., Dobrescu M. and et al., applied the method based on combined texture and fractal analysis automatic to detect the malignancy of skin lesions [b7]. However, until now there is no comprehensive technique\/approach using retinal images to provide disease risk prediction based on their complexity of characteristics (i.e., interaction between shapes, intensity, directionality and etc.).","We developed an automated disease detection system using retinal images. We first generate all possible risk factors from color images that may associated with diabetes retinopathy, stroke and\/or other diseases. This includes some characteristics from the aspect of intensity changes, such as high order spectra, entropy and etc., and also from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (or Haralick) and run-length matrix Texture Features. For instance, our previous study for retinal vessel patterns with neovascularisation detection has shown that there are number of significant of interactions among some high order spectra features and features related to the shape of vessels. Secondly, we stored all generated factors and applied penalized supervised logistic regression to reduce the dimension (or use random forest approach to extract important features). This procedure is used to generate potentially significant features associated with stroke and other diseases. Next we applied multi-model inference with Generalized Linear Models (MIGLM) to select the best model that generated all possible factors with their pairwise interactions. Finally we applied the Random Forest to assess its stroke classification performance. The advantage of using penalized supervised logistic regression and MIGLM are their interactive effects preserving properties. Random Forest approach is considerable a suitable method for non-linear classification in high-dimensional space [b8].","In one aspect disclosed herein, there is provided a method for diagnosing and\/or predicting the presence, progression and\/or treatment effect of a disease characterized by retinal pathological changes in a subject, comprising the steps of:","(a) obtaining a retinal fundus image from the subject;","(b) converting the image to a gray level image and\/or extracting vessels from the image to obtain the gray level image and\/or the vessel image;","(c) performing one or at least two or more analyses on the gray level image and\/or the vessel image, and generating one or more factors, wherein the one or at least two or more analyses are selected from the group consisting of","fractal analysis,","statistical texture analysis,","high order spectra analysis,","abnormal pattern analysis,","and any combination thereof; and","(d) comparing the one or more factors obtained from step (c) with those of a control, a change of the factors is an indication of the presence, progression and\/or treatment effect of the disease in the subject.","In another aspect, there is provided a method for generating one or more factors associated with retinal image changes in a subject, comprising the steps of:","(a) obtaining a retinal fundus image from the subject;","(b) converting the image to a gray level image and\/or extracting vessels from the image to obtain the gray level image and\/or the vessel image; and","(c) performing one or at least two or more analyses on the gray level image and\/or the vessel image, and generating one or more factors, wherein the one or at least two or more analyses are selected from the group consisting of","fractal analysis,","statistical texture analysis,","high order spectra analysis,","abnormal pattern analysis,","and any combination thereof.","In one embodiment of the methods disclosed herein, step (b) includes using mathematical morphological operations and\/or dual tree complex wavelet transform technique.","In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein comprise performing fractal analysis on the image and generating features associated with the fractal.

For example, Osareh, A., . PhD thesis. Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, 2004 described the identification of optic disc based on its compactness feature: Compactness=(region border length)\/area, wherein a boundary-tracing algorithm (see, Sonka, M., V. Hlavac, and R. Boyle, Image processing, analysis, and machine vision. 2nd ed. 1999, PWS Pub) can be employed to obtain the region border length. Alternatively, roundness detection with Hough circle method, geometrical structured (ellipse location) method or highest intensity region detection can be employed to detect and locate the optic disc in retina images.","In a preferred embodiment, locating the optic disc is carried out by morphological analysis which preferably comprises using dilation and erode preprocessed image with structure element on disk shape for filtering non-circular shape like spots.","In certain embodiments, the macular detection is based on similar means to those for detecting optic disc, excepting for reversing the background color (grey level) and then applying the constant distance (2.5 diameters) from OD to find darkest region, as the macular usually appears as a darkened region, and at a distance of approximately 2.5 times the optic disc diameter from the centre of the optic disc. It is known in the art that localization of macular contributes to early detection of lesions that threaten visual acuity and increase accuracy of lesion detection.","In one embodiment, the system or method for screening or grading retinopathy further comprises a module or a step of extracting and removing vessels prior to the detection of abnormal patterns so as to facilitate the accuracy of abnormal pattern lesions detection. The imaging of vessels can take place by means of optical imaging technique with optical-electronic image conversion, or by means of electronic image generating technique, e.g., scanning of photographic vessel images. Furthermore, dilatation measurements of vessels in the back of the eye can be based on the use of optical, precision measurement techniques in an ophthalmoscopic image, the use of precision optical measurement techniques and densitometry of the photographic negative or based on photoelectric measurement methods. Other devices or methods for identifying vessels are known in the art (see, for example, Suzuki, Y. Surv. Ophthalmol. 1995, May 39 Suppl. 1: 57-65; Schack et al. Mustererkennung 1994, Springer-Pub., 475-481; DE 3,839,272; U.S. Pat. No. 5,031,632; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,621,917).","Alternatively or additionally, examples of the vascular-based techniques can include, for example, mathematical morphological operations with dual tree complex wavelet transformation (DTCWT) methodology, morphological filters, matched filters, and combinations thereof.","In another preferred embodiment, the system or method further comprises a module or a step of analyzing the texture in the retina image in order to detect the abnormal patterns including HE and exudates accurately. Texture can be described as an attribute representing the spatial arrangement of the gray levels of the pixels in a region of a digital image. In texture analysis, its tasks are to carry out classification, segmentation, and synthesis. For example, statistical geometrical features and tree-structured wavelet transform can be used for texture analysis and classification. (see, for example, Chen, Y. Q., M. S, Nixon, and D. W. Thomas, Texture Classification Using. Image Processing, 1994: p. 446-450 1050; and Chang, T. and C. C. J. Kuo, Texture analysis and classification with tree-structured wavelet transform. Ieee Transactions on Image Processing, 1993. 2(4): p. 429-441).","In another preferred embodiment, approaches for analyzing texture can include, but not limited to statistical texture analysis techniques, structural texture analysis techniques, model-based texture analysis techniques, and transform-based texture analysis techniques.","Specifically, examples of statistical texture analysis techniques can include, but not limited to a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) approach which is based on the use of second-order statistics of the grayscale image histograms, and run length matrix (RLM) approach which encompasses higher-order statistics of the gray level histogram. Example of the structural texture analysis include using different shapes of structuring elements and conceiving real textures as distorted versions of ideal textures (see, for example, Indahl, U. G. and T. Naes, . Journal of Chemometrics, 1998. 12(4): p. 261-278). Example of model-based texture analysis techniques include autoregressive (AR) models, Markov random fields (MRF) (see, Cross, G. R. and A. K. Jain, 1983. 5(1): p. 25-39), and fractal models. Transform-based texture analysis techniques convert the image into a new form using the spatial frequency properties of the pixel intensity variations. Preferable examples of such techniques include Gabor filters, wavelet transforms analysis and Angle measure technique (AMT). Particularly, features derived from a set of Gabor filters can be used in texture analysis for image segmentation. Wavelet transform methods of feature extraction can be used to characterize texture and to treat the problems of texture segmentation and classification. Furthermore, AMT can be used to extract textural features from unfolded image pixel values in order to characterize and predict externally measured reference textures using multivariate statistical techniques.","In a preferable embodiment, the texture in the retina image is analyzed by statistical texture analysis techniques such as GLCM and RLM, and higher order spectral (HOS) features from digital fundas image, for example, the 3rd moment of threshold feature's intensity. It will be understood by the skilled person in the art that the expected area of threshold intensity value for extracted features over whole image area (i.e., mean or probability of intensity) can be considered as the 1st order statistic. GLCM can be a 2nd order measure because it measures the relationship between neighborhood pixels.","In a more preferable embodiment, a combination of wavelet transformation and HOS is used to analyze the texture in the retina image. Most preferably, the texture is analyzed by the wavelet-based Radon transform in combination with HOS. It is known that HOS consists of moment and cumulant spectra and can be used for both deterministic signals and random process. There are total six HOS parameters (features) which can be extracted based on bi-spectral invariants. The bi-spectral invariants contain information about shape of the waveform within the window and are invariant to shift and amplification. Five parameters are Entropy1 (entropy mean), Entropy2 (entropy variance), Entropy3 (entropy 3rd moment), Entropy phase, Entropy magnitude. The extra information provided by HOS would lead to better estimation of parameters and shed light on nonlinearities in the source of signal. Furthermore, the use of higher order spectra can result in good noise immunity.","In a preferred embodiment, detection of abnormal patterns also comprises quantitatively counting the number, area and location of the abnormal patterns.","Preferably, abnormal patterns as defined herein are detected and analyzed by a wavelet approach. In a more preferred embodiment, the abnormal patterns are detected by the wavelet processing in combination with higher order spectral analysis. Most preferably, the wavelet processing is wavelet-based Radon transform or dual tree complex wavelet transform, and higher order spectral feature is the 3rd order spectral analysis.","As described above, the abnormal patterns include, but not limited to, hemorrhage, exudates, new vessels, microaneurysm and proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Such patterns have clear definition in size, shape, roughness, edge sharpness, brightness, and color (Table 1) (see, Yen, G. G. and W. F. Leong, .

In a preferable embodiment, a morphology-based technique is used for detection of hemorrhages. The technique applies morphology opening and erosion for the binary mask of dark regions produced as the output in the segmentation phase.

There were 64 patients with prevalent stroke have their color retina image record in this screening program. Another 58 stroke cases were acute stroke patients from Acute Stroke Unit in Prince of Wales Hospital from January 2010 to July 2010. These patients were diagnosed as either ischemic stroke or hemorrhage stroke and they had adequate sitting balance to tolerate retinal photography.

Stroke subtypes of cardioembolic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Control: Patients without Stroke Event.","122 controls were selected to compare with the stroke cases. Controls were from two sources: patients without stroke in diabetic retinopathy screening program in Prince of Wales Hospital. Other controls were patients without stroke and obvious eye diseases that influenced retina vessel structure or spot patterns in Eye Outpatient Clinics in Prince of Wales Hospital. The mean follow-up period from the date of retina image capturing to July 2011 was 4.3 years. The proportion of diabetes patients in stroke cases were high in this case control study. And diabetes has special characteristics in retina, which is called diabetic retinopathy. As described in the introduction, about 40% diabetes patients got diabetic retinopathy after ten year history of diabetes, whereas, very small amount patients without diabetes got retinopathy.

Six largest arterioles within the circle 0.5 to 1 diameter apart from the edge of optic disc were selected. A line perpendicular to the edge of vessel walls was drawn and measured as the diameter of the arteriole. With these six diameters, we summarized one parameter \u201cCRAE\u201d by Knudtson's formula to represent the arteriole diameter of the retina. Similarly, \u201cCRVE\u201d was used to summarized the venule diameters. AVR (arteriole-venule ratio) was calculated as the ratio of CRAE to CRVE.","Arteriole-Venous Nicking","This sign was marked as the narrowing of venule at the crossing point of arteriole.","Measurement of Pattern Characteristics Hemorrhages, Exudates","Hemorrhage and exudates were recorded as either exist or not.

The other retinopathy's occurrence in the images was very low. Hemorrhage and exudates were key determinants for the severity of diabeteic retinopathy, they were found to be associated with stroke and they are less suffered from interobserver variability. That is why hemorrhages and exudates were extracted from the color retina images","The sample size was not large enough to demonstrate the association of the severity of the spot characteristics with stroke.","Measurement of Tortuosity","Tortuosity was assessed by visual grading of one fovea-centred and one disc-centred fundus image from each eye displayed on a computer display and viewed by a medical doctor (first of this paper) with 3 years of experience in ophthalmology research, especially trained in evaluating retinal blood vessels in fundus photographs. A grading scale was developed for the study based upon a preliminary inspection of the study photographs, which indicated that an acceptable reproducibility could be achieved using a two-level scale for arterial tortuosity. The grading levels for retinal arterial tortuosity were (): Category 1 (predominantly straight arteries); Category 2 (mild to severe tortuosity with at least one inflections of at least one major artery); The first author examined all images twice at an interval of 2 months in random order, masked to disease status. The intra-observer variability Kappa is 0.869.","Bifurcation of Arterioles and Venules","Branching coefficient (BC) or \u201carea ratio\u201d is the ratio of the sum of the cross-sectional areas of the daughter vessels of a bifurcation to that of the parent stem. Branching angle is the angle between the two daughter branches. Asymmetry index (AI) is the ratio of diameters of two daughter branches. Their calculation is below:\n\n=()\/.\n\n,\n","Where D, D, Dare the diameter of trunk, the smaller branch and the larger branch of one bifurcation point.","Niall Patton et alshowed that the bifurcation coefficients of different bifurcation of vessels in the same retina image did not correlate to the eccentricity to the edge of optic disc. So not all bifurcations of the all branches of arterioles or venules were selected to calculate to bifurcation coefficients. The population in this study were elderly aged from 50 to 80 years old, with mean age of 66 years old. The optic media was opaque to some extent. The smaller branches of vessels were not visualized clearly in most of the images. The vessels that were smaller than 4 pixels were difficult to measure correctly. Lastly, the methods to summarize diameter \u201cCRAE\u201d and \u201cCRVE\u201d focus on the vessels near optic disc. In this study, we focus on summarizing the information of larger branches, so we extracted the bifurcation of three sets of branches of arterioles and three sets of bifurcation of venules which were closest to optic disc.","Parameter Description:","The continuous retina parameters include the information of vessel diameters and bifurcations. The perimeters of optic disc were used as scale to adjust the magnification effect of retina cameras. There might be more than one bifurcation information in one retina, to relatively reduce the selection bias of the bifurcations, the mean of bifurcation coefficients and bifurcation angle and branch asymmetry were used for the analysis. The meaning of parameters were summarized below:","CRAE: diameter equivalent of arterioles;","CRVE: diameter equivalent of venules;","OD: perimeter of optic disc;","AdjustedCRAE: the ratio of CRAE to OD;","AdjustedCRVE: the ratio of CRVE to OD;","AVR: arteriole to venule ratio, the ratio of CRAE to CRVE;","BCA: mean bifurcation coefficient of arterioles;","BCV: mean bifurcation coefficient of venules;","Aangle: mean bifurcation angles of arterioles;","Vangle: mean bifurcation angles of venules;","Aasymmetry: mean asymmetry index of arterioles; the lesser the value, the bigger of arteriole asymmetry;","Vasymmetry: mean asymmetry index of venules; the lesser the value, the bigger of venule asymmetry;","Retinal Photography and Image Analysis Procedure","Canon-non-mydriatic retinal camera CR-1 with the angle of view of 45 degree was used in the diabetic retinopathy screening program. Topcon Retinal Camera TRC-50IX with angle of view of 50 degree was used in eye outpatient clinics to take color retina image. Photographs of the retina were taken of 1 randomly selected eye after 5 minutes of dark adaptation.","Magnification Adjustment of Images from Different Sources","Retina images were from two sources where two different retina cameras were used. The original retina images taken by Canon-non-mydriatic retinal camera CR-1 were stored originally as TIFF format with 1536*1024 pixels. And the retina images taken by Topcon Retinal Camera TRC-50IX were originally stored as JPG format with 1365*1024 pixels. The parameters of bifurcation coefficient, bifurcation angle, branch asymmetry, aterio-venule ratio were dimensionless parameters. They were not influenced by magnification of retina images. The parameters of spot characteristics, such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates, cotton wool spots, new vessels were judged as existence or not. They were also not influenced by the magnification of retina photos. The parameter of CRAE or CRVE was influenced by the magnification of retina images. Even for the same retina photos, different axial length, refractive error and eye to camera distance would have effect on the magnification, which made the direct comparisons of CRAE or CRVE between different subjects not accurately. To adjust the magnification effect and directly compare the difference of CRAE and CRVE which were probably correlated to stroke event among different subjects, we first resized and adjusted all retina images into JPG format with 1365*1024 pixels. Then we assumed that the diameter of optic disc was the same among different subjects. And the ratio of CRAE or CRVE to the diameter of optic disc was calculated as \u201cadjusted CRAE\u201d and \u201cadjusted CRVE\u201d. We used the \u201cadjusted CRAE\u201d and \u201cadjusted CRVE\u201d to represent the arteriole diameters and venule diameters of retina images and compare them in different subjects directly.","Software Used to Quantify the Retina Characteristics.","All continuous parameters are measured by ImageJ by pixels. Retina images were adjusted to the same resolution of 1365*1024 pixels by ImageJ. The length and angle measurement tools of ImageJ were used to measure the length and angle of vessels.","Statistical Analysis","Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to test the intra-observer reliability of the parameters measured by software ImageJ, including CRAE, CRVE, bifurcation coefficient of arterioles, bifurcation coefficient of venules, branching angle of arterioles, branching angle of venuels, asymmetry index of arterioles, asymmetry index of venules, diameter of optic disc.","For univariate analysis, the continuous parameters were compared between cases and controls by two sample independent t test. The categorical data was analysis by chi-squire test. Logistic regression was used to select variables that were different between the two groups controlling for the demographic data. All data were analyzed by SPSS 16.0.","Results","Reliability Test","Eighteen color images were randomly selected from the control to test the intra-observer variability.

In general, the clinical usefulness of an image is highly dependent on its quality. In the image processing techniques (), we mainly focus on image quality assessment and enhancement. Previous studies on retinal images that do quality assessment, focus mainly on two aspects: image clarity and field definition. These aspects depend on features of various diseases. However, almost all of these studies (image clarity and field definition) are based on a numerical quantification of image sharpness and illumination. In this project we develop an automatic method to carry out the quality evaluation on quality of digital fundus photographs.","At first, we use the techniques for the automatic image quality assessment of retinal fundus image based on structural criteria and generic criteria. Structural criteria include the level of recognition of optic disc structure and vessel structure. Generic criteria include level on homogeneous illustration and also, bright and high-contrast background. Other than applying some clustering method, sharpness metric and texture features (Haralick texture features), we developed a new assessment method based on fractal analysis from both grey level images and vessel extracted binary (black and white) images. The detailed procedure is given in the following:","Step 1: Preprocessing the original input image (convert to gray level image) in simply removed noise without shift variance problem by using dual-tree complex wavelet (DT-CWT) technique.","Remark: We can enhance the qualified image contrast with color histogram and dual tree complex wavelet-transform (DTCWT). This technique will benefit almost all features extracted for Stroke in the retinal image. The reason we applied color histogram with statistical properties because of its well presenting of color properties. The DTCWT method (transform without decimation) can overcome the problem of the traditional (ordinal) discrete wavelet transform because it is not shift invariant and the decimation operation during the transform can be dealt with. A small shift in the input signal can cause very different output wavelet coefficients. This will provide benefit for the denoising process and enhance the contrast at the same time. In other words, we can keep the detailed information of the features without having the noise involved.","Step 2: Automatic image quality assessment from two aspects: on gray level image and on vessel extracted image. For gray level image, we apply the method consists of a sharpness metric, Haralick texture featuresand fractal analysis related parameters. For the extracted vessel image, we apply the fractal analysis again. All of these results (parameters) will be generated and used to classify the level of acceptability of the qualified image (AQI\/NAQI), while AQI\/NQAI is provided by professional Ophthalmology experts justified from their screening results.","Step 3: Finally we will apply some statistical methods such as logistic regression, generalized linear model or improved logistic regression method supervised penalized logistic regression and Random forest to determine important parameters. At the same time, a prediction model with these parameters is obtained. validation using the ROC curve with the area under ROC curve plus the sensitivity and specificity will be provided to justify the results.","Study on the Automatic Quality Control Process","A dataset of 143 subjects are classified by an experienced eye specialist.

We also obtain a sensitivity of about 94% and a specificity of about 98% as detected by the automatic system. To obtain this result we first applied supervised penalized logistic regression method to extract significant features from total 26 texture and fractal features. Five of the significant features such as maximum probability, Sum average, correlation from texture related features and Hausdorff dimension from binary retinal image of vessels, box-counting with Fourier fractal dimension (slope) and intercept from gray level retinal image (fractal analysis) that are extracted. The validation of classification based on random forest is given and the accuracy is measured by the area under the ROC curve This result is considered as excellent accuracy for classification of the quality of the retinal images for the diagnosis purpose.\n\n","In addition, the wavelet-based multi-fractal analysis approach will applied to improve the result as well in future study.","Stroke Related Features Extracted from Vessels","Abnormalities of retinal vasculatures may indicate poor health conditions in the body. The width ratio of arteries and veins (A\/V ratio) on the retinal fundus images may help physicians in diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy, which related to stroke. Other features related to stroke include bifurcation and tortuosity. Referring to previous study, retinopathy vessel diameter, arteriole-venule nicking, artery occlusion, venule occlusion have been reported to be related to stroke. Since two components of the Central Retinal Artery Equivalent (CRAE) and the Central Retinal Vein Equivalent (CRVE) involve most of the above information. We will focus on CRAE, CRVE or AVR where AVR=CRAE\/CRVE. Rest of stroke-related risk factors will be obtained from other two methods: texture analysis and fractal analysis.","Recall that the manual computation of AVR is a tedious process, since it involves repeated measurements of the diameters of all arterioles and venules in the region by human graders. To facilitate large-scale clinical use, an accurate, rapid and efficient system to compute AVR is required. This project simply used the vessel network traced by a vessel tracking algorithm and then the vessel caliber is estimated. Vessels are then classified as either arteries or veins and AVR parameter is then obtained. The detailed procedure is given as follows:","Step 1: After Vessel segmentation (extracted) using techniques in previous project (diabetes), we work on thinning the vessel (centerline detection) and find the optic disc center point to obtain the region of interest (ROI: a circle within 0.5 to 1 diameter apart from the edge of optic disc). Then each vessel width measurement is obtained within the ROI by using Ai\/Li, where Ai is the total area for vessel i and Li is the pixel length for center line of that vessel.","Step 2: Artery-Vein (A\/V) Discrimination","To enable separate analysis of the arteries and the veins in the image, the previously detected vessel segments need to be assigned to one of these two classes. We used a supervised system such as Random Forest improved logistic regression method, i.e. trained with examples. After a one-time training procedure the method can be used to classify previously unseen centerline pixels into either artery or vein (AV classification). Notice that an expert indicated whether a given major vessel was an artery or vein for each of the training images. Referring to the method inwith Random Forest, it improved on the logistic regression as we can classify Artery-Vein (A\/V).","Step 3: AVR Estimation","From the arteriolar and venular calibers estimated by the above steps, the CRAE and CRVE parameters can be computed by the formula: AVR=CRAE\/CRVE. Notice that the AVR can provide an indication of a possible generalized arteriolar narrowing. Simply the widest 6 veins and arteries (these do not have to be paired) are entered although fewer total numbers of widths can be used in case not enough measurement points are available.","Step 4: Compare to the tested manual AVR Estimation and after validation we can use it for the detection of stroke.","Texture Analysis","Efficient feature extraction is one of the most significant aspects of texture analysis in computer vision applications. Most existing feature extraction methods provide efficient tool for shape and pattern classification in the images (Chen, Nixon, & Thomas, 1994; Pietikainen, Ojala, & Xu, 2000; Tianhorng & Kuo, 1993). But the situation becomes complicated, while both size and shape of particles in the images come into a focus of public attention.","Although one can intuitively associate several image properties such as smoothness, coarseness, depth, regularity, etc. with texture, there is no formal or complete definition of texture. Many researchers have described texture using various definitions. Russloosely defined image texture as a descriptor of local brightness variation from pixel to pixel in a small neighborhood through an image. Alternatively, texture can be described as an attribute representing the spatial arrangement of the gray levels of the pixels in a region of a digital image. Texture analysis, its tasks are mainly classification, segmentation, and synthesis.","The approaches for analyzing texture are very diverse, and differ from each other mainly by the method used for extracting textural features. Four categories can be defined: (1) statistical methods, (2) structural methods, (3) model-based methods, and (4) transform-based methods.","Statistical texture analysis techniques primarily describe texture of regions in an image through higher-order moments of their grayscale histograms. Probably, the most frequently cited method for texture analysis is based on extracting various textural features from a gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The GLCM approach is based on the use of second-order statistics of the grayscale image histograms. Alternatively, the run length matrix (RLM) encompasses higher-order statistics of the gray level histogram. The RLM texture analysis approach characterizes coarse textures as having many pixels in a constant gray level run and fine textures as having few pixels in such a run. Besides traditional statistical texture analysis, multivariate statistical methods have also been proposed for textural feature extraction. Considering an image as a matrix, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) spectrum is a summary vector of image texture represented by its singular values. The SVD spectrum has been used as a textural feature vector for image classification.","Structural texture analysis techniques describe a texture as the composition of well-defined texture elements such as regularly spaced parallel lines. The properties and placement rules of the texture elements define the image texture. Various structural texture analysis approaches have been proposed, ranging from using different shapes of structuring elementsto conceiving real textures as distorted versions of ideal textures. However, these methods appear to be limited in practicality since they can only describe very regular textures.","Model-based texture analysis techniques generate an empirical model of each pixel in the image based on a weighted average of the pixel intensities in its neighborhood. The estimated parameters of the image models are used as textural feature descriptors. Examples of such model-based texture descriptors are autoregressive (AR) models, Markov random fields (MRF), and fractal models.","Finally, transform-based texture analysis techniques convert the image into a new form using the spatial frequency properties of the pixel intensity variations. The success of these latter techniques lies in the type of transform used to extract textural characteristics from the image. Indhal and Naesillustrated the use of spectra from 2-D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude images for textural feature extraction. Image classification using Multi-way Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) on 2-D FFT magnitude images to extract features from various images was used by Geladi. The Gabor or Wavelet transforms have been preferred recently in image texture analysis due to their space-frequency decomposition abilities. Features derived from a set of Gabor filters have been widely used in texture analysis for image segmentation. Wavelet transform methods of feature extraction have been used to characterize texture and to treat the problems of texture segmentation and classification. The Angle Measure Technique (AMT) has been used to extract textural features from unfolded image pixel values in order to characterize and predict externally measured reference textures using multivariate statistical techniques.","Therefore, we may consider Texture is a representation of the surface and structure of an image. It is also defined as a common pattern on a surface. Image textures provide information about the spatial arrangement of colors or intensities such as tone variation, shape, size, color, brightness etc.","In this project we proposed a novel method for stroke detection using a combination of texture and higher order spectral (HOS) features from digital fundas image. Statistical texture analysis techniques such as GLCM and RLM, and the 3moment of threshold feature's intensity are used. At first, statistical texture features for the image samples are grouped according to their classes (herein, we have the classes of control and stroke, the classes for grading of stroke will be considered in future study), normalized and into independent t-test (or Analysis of Variance) to test the hypothesis between the classes. At this stage, we first extract Gray-level Co-occurrence Matric Texture features, which include mean of Homogeneity, Energy, entropy, Contrast, Symmetry, Correlation, 1Moment, 2moment to 4moment and etc. Other features come from the difference statistical features such as Angular 2moment and etc., features from Run Length Matrix Texture including Mean Short (Long) Run Emphasis and etc., total about 32 features and the most significance features from all GLCM and RLM related that are highly associated with stroke. In fact, the RLM are shown to be more useful for image quality assessment but not in stroke detection. On the other hands, for HOS features extraction we used similar approach as we did in diabetic retinopathy study, HOS elicits both amplitude and phase information of a given signal. It offers good noise immunity and yields good results even for weak and noisy signals. It consists of moment and cumulant spectra and can be used for both deterministic signals and random process. First we applied image enhancement techniques using DTCWT with histogram equalization, and Random transform was performed for HOS feature extraction. Notice that Radon transform is used to detect features within an image. There are total six HOS parameters (features) can be extracted based on bi-spectral invariants. The bi-spectral invariants contain information about shape of the waveform within the window and are invariant to shift and amplification and robust to time-scale changes. Five parameters are Entropy1 (entropy mean), Entropy2 (entropy variance), Entropy3 (entropy 3moment), Entropy phase, Entropy Magnitude.","Remark:","One of the advantages of using HOS would be that the extra information provided by HOS leads to better estimation of parameters and sheds light on nonlinearities in the source signal. It can also be useful because they suppress addictive colored Gaussian noise of an unknown power spectrum. They identify non-minimum phase signals. They are useful in extracting information that cannot be done by other methods. Lastly they detect and characterize nonlinear properties in signals. The use of higher order spectra results in good noise immunity, as verified with synthetic and real images.","The early study (A Case-control) result based on this approach is provided as follows (Texture and high order spectra related automatic extracted features):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0292","num":"0298"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00009","num":"00009"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"AFTER 20 RUNS (RANDOM SAMPLED BY 70% AS TRAINING"},{"entry":"DATASET AND 30% AS TESTED DATASET) OF RANDOM"},{"entry":"FOREST CLASSIFICATION, WE HAVE THE SUMMARY"},{"entry":"FOR THE ROC RESULTS:"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Texture-detected","High order spectra-"]},{"entry":[{},"features","detected features"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["T","AUC","Sens.","Specs.","AUC","Sens.","Specs."]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1","0.76","0.98","0.53","0.73","1","0.5"]},{"entry":["2","0.77","1","0.46","0.71","0.97","0.49"]},{"entry":["3","0.71","0.79","0.61","0.66","0.84","0.53"]},{"entry":["4","0.72","0.63","0.73","0.67","0.17","1"]},{"entry":["5","0.66","0.95","0.4","0.7","0.84","0.6"]},{"entry":["6","0.8","0.7","0.78","0.78","0.79","0.68"]},{"entry":["7","0.69","0.89","0.51","0.67","0.97","0.38"]},{"entry":["8","0.75","0.76","0.66","0.7","0.79","0.59"]},{"entry":["9","0.7","0.86","0.53","0.63","1","0.34"]},{"entry":["10","0.75","0.92","0.51","0.75","0.92","0.59"]},{"entry":["11","0.78","0.92","0.6","0.73","0.95","0.49"]},{"entry":["12","0.74","0.84","0.67","0.63","0.84","0.44"]},{"entry":["13","0.65","1","0.43","0.7","0.97","0.46"]},{"entry":["14","0.78","0.84","0.7","0.75","1","0.46"]},{"entry":["15","0.77","0.6","0.82","0.59","1","0.33"]},{"entry":["16","0.7","0.97","0.45","0.74","0.97","0.5"]},{"entry":["17","0.8","1","0.54","0.81","0.97","0.6"]},{"entry":["18","0.68","0.95","0.42","0.61","1","0.39"]},{"entry":["19","0.68","1","0.44","0.63","0.95","0.41"]},{"entry":["20","0.83","0.66","0.85","0.7","0.94","0.59"]},{"entry":["Ave","0.74","0.86","0.58","0.69","0.89","0.52"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"With a total 244 sample size of Case-control study for stroke disease, including 122 samples are control and 122 samples are strokes.

auto-similar features, with details that can be noticed at any scale of representation. Biofractals are the fractal textures\/contours in biology (tissues, neurons, leaves, etc.). The similarity between fractals and the natural objects suggests that fractal properties, such as fractal dimension, may be used as a classifier in biology. Since many natural phenomena are so complicated and irregular that they cannot be modeled well using traditional classical techniques. Those irregular sets and functions can be regarded as a class to which a general theory can be applicable, known as \u2018Fractal geometry\u2019. This class represents many natural phenomena much better than figures of classical geometry do and theory provides us with the concepts and practical techniques needed for the analysis of these phenomena. Many studies have been proposed that retinal vessels are fractal and that fractal analysis could be applied in automated diagnosis for retinal diseases. Some of related studies are proposed. In many studies, the Box-counting method has been largely used to estimate fractal dimensions of measures, but this procedure has been pointed out as problematic due to memory and time limitation (Hou et al., 1990). It definitely will cause the problem when used in automatic computer system to detect stroke signs. Traditionally, vascular patterns have been described using variety of simple measures, including the mean diameter of vessels, mean length of vessel segments, branch angle, vessel area density (the fraction of image area occupied by the vessels), and vessel length density (the fraction of image area occupied by the skeleton of the vessels).","The recent study for Fractal Analysis of the Retinal Vasculature is proposed by Azemin M. Z., Kumar D. K., Wong T. Y., and et al.] They proposed the method of Fourier Fractal dimension on these preprocessed images and do not require any segmentation of the vessels. This method can be used to extract the complexity of the retinal vasculature enhanced at different wavelet scales and a model was formulated for stroke prediction.","Based on the spirit of this approach and the advantage of wavelet transform over Fourier transform on multiscale analysis (Wavelets often give a better signal\/information representation using Multiresolution analysis, with balanced resolution at any time and frequency). In this project we have used two approaches to work on stroke prediction problem. One is based on qualified enhancing gray-level image to apply the wavelet-based fractal analysis to extract the most important features to detect stroke. The technique we used is complex wavelet Leader multifractal analysis, since wavelet Leader multifractal analysis (WLMF) allows us to perform an accurate, complete and low computational and memory costs multifractal characterization of textures in images. The other approach is to apply multifractal spectrum (MFS). This method can provide an efficient framework combining global spatial invariance and local robust measurements. Besides these, some parameters of monofractal analysis will also be generated. Overall, all fractal analysis related parameters will be integrated and to classify the stroke cases. Finally, the important (significant) factors will be gained (also see ).","Remarks: Fractal analysis related parameters will be used in the detection of vascular change as a result of conditions such as stroke disease. At previous stage we mainly use three fractal parameters: average intercepts and average slope (dimension) determined from all 24 directions of retinal gray level enhanced image (Fourier Fractal dimension technique is used). Also, the parameter of Hausdorff dimension is in a similar way determined as in above two parameters except it applies in a binary image for vessels. In the future study, we will apply more advanced and accurate method based on the above mentioned wavelet techniques.","Similar to the above Case-control study with texture analysis with HOS for stroke disease, the supervised penalized logistic regression method is used to extract significant features from fractal-texture combined features. Three of the significant features such as Hausdorff dimension (Hdfdimension) from binary retinal image of vessels, Sum average (savgh) and Cluster Shade (cshad) are extracted. The validation results using the classification based on Random Forest is given and the accuracy is measured by the area under the ROC curve, which is about 0.755 with standard deviation of 0.039 (see Table 14, third column).

There is strong scientific rationale of the relationship of vascular circulation on the relationship between retina and brain where it is likely that stroke can be predicted by observing the retinal images. We have already tackled the automation problem using retinal images for diabetic retinopathy. A similar approach is now extended to this application including novel characteristics determined specifically for stroke, for example, vessel bifurcation, vascular bifurcation angles, vascular tortuosity and number of vessel branches.","We have also carried out manual assessment to evaluate the concept of using manually quantified parameters for the detection of stroke using existing and novel parameters we developed. The results of the case-control study using retinal assessment alone have an AUC value of 0.73 under the ROC curve. The sensitivity is about 0.73 with a specificity of 0.73. Including the clinical information, the sensitivity was increased to 0.76.","The automatic computer method we developed in this project included image quality assessment process. The program will then process four components of analyses, including blood vessels parameters, texture approach, fractal analysis, and diabetic retinopathy related parameters. With the information extracted from the program, a classification is then performed to evaluate if the patient is likely to have a stroke. We used the case-control study data for validation. The results using just the stroke characteristics determined in this project have an AUC value of 0.81, with a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.49. However, if we included the diabetic retinopathy parameters the AUC value increased to 0.88, with a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.76.","Since the random forest method is a more conservative, we also carried out the SPSS cross-validation analysis as a comparison to the manual classification.
