{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention was made with Government support under contract No. F04701-00-C-0009 by the Department of the Air Force. The Government has certain rights in the invention,","The present application is related to applicant's copending application entitled Glass Ceramic Spacecraft Ser. No. 10\/742,058, filed Dec. 19, 2003, by the same inventors.","The invention relates to the fields of industrial art for making glass and ceramic components, tool and die arts for making molded glass and ceramic components, photostructurable arts for laser milling glass and ceramic components, semiconductor arts for fabricating semiconductors and hybrids, and for depositing conductor traces in an electrical communications grid, microelectromechanical arts for making active and passive MEMS devices, wafer flip and bond art for encapsulating electrical devices, MEMS devices, and optical devices, electrical arts for making batteries, power converters, and RF antennae, electronic arts for making processors, electronic components, optoelectronic interfaces, RF transmitters, RF receivers, and despreading correlators, electromechanical arts for making active gyros, and accelerometers, photonic arts for making optical transceivers, optical detectors, mirrors, splitters, reflectors, polarizers, lenses, and optical fibers for communicating and processing optical signals for use in an optical communications grid, all for use and incorporation into a new field of integrated glass ceramic systems having structural elements formed from molded and patterned glass ceramic materials with internally communicated optical and electrical signals while also having encapsulated electronic, photonic, electrical and microelectromechanical system devices intercommunicating through an internal electrooptical communications grid.","There are a vast variety of conventional fabrication methods and devices used from a variety of operational systems. As examples, industrial arts have been used for making glass and ceramic components. The tool and die arts have been used for making molded glass and ceramic components. Molded components include poured, injected and stamped glass ceramic components. The semiconductor arts have been used for fabricating semiconductors, chips, and hybrids. During fabrication, depositing conductor traces and with feedthroughs are used to form an electrical communications grid about the semiconductor components. The microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) arts have been used for making active and passive MEMS sensors and actuators, among others devices. The wafer flip and bond arts have been used for electrically connecting and encapsulating electrical devices, MEMS devices, and optical devices within flip-bonded semiconductor and ceramic substrates. The electrical arts have been used for making batteries, power converters, communications processors, and RF antennae, among others. The electronic arts have been used for making power supplies, electronic devices, optoelectronic devices, RF transmitters, RF receivers, and despreading correlators, among others. The electromechanical arts have been used for making active gyros, and accelerometers, among others. The photonic arts for have been used for making optical transceivers, optical detectors, mirrors, splitters, reflectors, polarizers, lens, and optical fibers, among others, for communicating and processing optical signals for use in an optical communications grid. While there is a vast array of technologies available, system integration of various technology is limited due to operational compatibility and fabrication feasibility.","One example of an intertechnology integrated system is a conventional satellite. A satellite can be made of silicon for exploiting strength, high thermal conductivity, infrared transparency, and radiation-shielding properties of silicon along with established silicon microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems fabrication techniques to create satellites composed of silicon components. Silicon is an excellent choice as the main material for a spacecraft, but bulk mechanical, thermal, and optical properties cannot be significantly modified.","Glass materials have an amorphous state that is a noncrystalline state. Ceramic materials have a crystalline state. Ceramic materials are tougher than glass but also tend to be more brittle than the glass, and hence not generally suitable as a support structure in high tensile stress application. Glass is weaker than ceramic, and susceptible to breakage during wide temperature operating range variations, but glass has superior optical transmission characteristics and can be brittle. Ceramics can withstand higher temperatures than the glass, but have poor optical transmission characteristics. Glass and ceramic materials differ in material properties, such optical transmission, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and chemical resistance, offering operational incompatibility, and unsuitability for common use in a given application. Glass materials have been annealed to reduce internal stresses and prevent cracking and breakage during cooling, especially for thick components. This is typically accomplished by heating glass to its softening temperature, followed by a slow cool-down process. Annealing decreases the overall strength of glass, but also makes the glass less brittle. Ceramic materials can also be annealed, but it is usually used to improve strength. Ceramic annealing changes crystal grain size. Glass materials have been tempered to increase internal compressive stresses for increasing the strength of the glass to external tensile loads. This is typically accomplished by heating glass to its softening temperature, followed by a rapid cool-down process. Ceramic materials are not tempered.","Glass ceramic materials have portions in the amorphous state and portions in the crystalline state. Glass ceramic materials incorporate an in-situ nucleation process that results in the crystallization of the amorphous glass phase. This conversion process is nominally called devitrification. Typically, glass stock is produced with additional ingredients that upon heating above a specified temperature, induces ceramization of the material. The bake method provides a material that is controllably devitrified, that is, a controlled in situ precipitation of crystalline material within an amorphous glass body. Beyond the known advantages of glass and ceramics, glass ceramic materials offer cost-effective manufacturing of shaped ceramic parts. The initial material in the glass phase is melted and molded into the desired shape and then converted to the crystalline ceramic state. Because the resulting material is not 100% crystalline, but a composite of amorphous and crystalline phases, it is less brittle than true crystalline ceramics. Glass ceramic materials are used in a wide range of applications from specialized optics to consumer cookware. Some well-known trade names are Macor which is machinable ceramic Corning Corporation, Dicor which is a biomaterial from Corning Corporation, Zerodur which is an expansion material from Schott Corporation, ML-05 which is a magnetic material from Nippon Electric Glass Company, and Pyroceram which is a cookware material from Corning Ware.","A special category of sensitized glass ceramic material is the photostructruable glass ceramic materials, also called photositalls and photocerams. Photostructruable glass ceramic materials differ from most glass ceramic materials in that photosensitive agents are incorporated into the raw material. Upon photo excitation, these agents initiate a reaction that can lead to nucleation and crystallization, that is, ceramization, of the glass during a controlled bake process. One set of bake cycles leads to the formation of a metastable crystalline state which is soluble in hydrofluoric acid (HF). Another set of bake cycles leads to the formation of a stable crystalline state that is resistant to etching by both acids and bases. Photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be photolithographically patterned, and upon baking, only those patterned areas would be converted to one of the ceramic states. The exposure process is typically done using a flood-fill light source through an opaque mask resting directly on top of the photostructurable glass ceramic material. Patterning of the photostructurable glass ceramic material can be done by creating the metastable state and etching away this state in HF. An additional flood exposure and bake to the stable crystalline state will result in a patterned ceramic component. One example of a photostructurable glass ceramic material is Foturan of Schott Glass Works, Mainz, Germany that requires ultraviolet light for photoexposure and baking to temperatures above 500C.","Photostructurable glass ceramic materials can also be patterned using lasers that selectively expose parts of the material. Photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be micromachined with three-dimensional precision as an optically patterned component by direct-write laser milling, direct-write laser exposure followed by a chemical etching step to remove exposed volumes, or by photolithographic patterning followed by a chemical etching step to remove patterned areas.","The photostructurable glass ceramic material can be used to make components for various applications. For example, photostructurable glass ceramic materials have been used as a substrate and structure component in a multi-thruster propulsion system for a spacecraft also having metallic structural components with coupled semiconductor electronics on printed circuit boards. The propellant tank, propellant feed lines, and thrusters are all composed of micromachined photostructurable glass ceramic material, while the remaining components include batteries, electromagnetic solenoid valves, the pressure and temperature sensors, the fill and drain valves, and the electronics. The glass ceramic thruster substrate is supported in a metallic support structure providing structural support for the spacecraft. One problem associated with conventional metallic support structure is the mix of various supporting components and their various differences in thermal expansion coefficients, thermal conductivity, and optical properties that need to considered over the operational temperature ranges. In addition, silicon and metallic support structures require the use of harnesses and cables to route electrical lines about the spacecraft. In addition, silicon and metallic support structures block visible optical transmission, limiting optical communications paths about the silicon or metallic support structures. Further, silicon and metallic support structures have different material strengths rendering portions providing uneven structural strength about the support structure. Further still, silicon and metallic support structures have limited molding and precise patterning manufacturing methods. These and other disadvantages are solved or reduced using the invention.","An object of the invention is to provide an integrated glass ceramic system having mixed glass ceramic components being molded and patterned glass and ceramic components for providing a variety of structural shapes.","Another object of the invention is to provide an integrated ceramic system having a support structure consisting of glass and ceramic components.","Yet another object of the invention is to provide an integrated glass ceramic system having glass ceramic composite components with tempered and untempered glass portions for providing enhanced structural strength.","Still another object of the invention is to provide an integrated glass ceramic system having a plurality of glass ceramic support structures integrated together for supporting an electrical and electronic communications grid.","A further object of the invention is to provide an integrated glass ceramic system having a plurality of glass ceramic support structures that are transmissive to various optical wavelengths for providing an optical communications grid.","Yet A further object of the invention is to provide an integrated glass ceramic system having a plurality of glass ceramic support structures that are transmissive to various wavelengths for providing an internal optical communications grid and for supporting an internal electrical and electronic communications grid combined as an electrooptical communications grid that includes structured glass sensors and actuators.","The invention is directed to integrated glass ceramic systems, in the general form, having patterned glass ceramic components having tempered and untempered portions within composite components, which when integrated together, form a glass ceramic support structure supporting an electrooptical communications grid while encapsulating and supporting operational components, such as photonic, electronic, electrical, and microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices. The direct-write glass ceramics components can be laser-milled, laser exposed and etched, or photolithographicly illuminated and etched glass ceramic components. In a preferred form, an integrated glass ceramic system is a glass ceramic spacecraft having a plurality of molded and patterned components integrated together for forming a support structure through and on which is supported the electrooptical communications grid.","The unique attributes of photostructurable glass ceramic materials include adapting the material for high transparency in the visible through the near IR wavelengths, designing the material for multifunctionality by locally altering a physical property, and by processing the material for patterned metallization. These attributes permit a wide range of functions that can serve the structural, thermal, electrical, and optical requirements of an integrated glass ceramic system. By selectively controlling the material processing, the photostructurable glass ceramic materials can simultaneously function as support structures, thermal control systems, radiation shields, optical conduits, multichip substrates, photonic supports, electronics supports, antenna supports, sensor structure, sensor support, actuator structure, actuator support, and microelectromechanical systems supports. This multifunctionality allows an entire integrated glass ceramic system to be substantially fabricated from a single material while supporting a plurality of integrated photonic, electronic, electrical, and MEMS devices. These capabilities offer predetermined consistent material strength, optical properties, electrical properties, thermal properties, and chemical properties. Composite ceramic structures can be fabricated through localized ceramization down to the micron scale. The photostructurable glass ceramic materials can have a glass phase that can be used for visible through near infrared optics passing wavelengths typically between 0.35 \u03bcm to 2.8 \u03bcm. Photostructurable glass formulations can be designed to enhance or extend these wavelength ranges. The photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be manufactured using molding and patterning methods to any dimension and to any shape.","The glass state in photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be tempered for improved strength by using a rapid cool-down process after baking. Another way to increase tensile strength is by selective exposure to light with subsequent baking to create crystalline domains in the glass. The crystalline domains in this composite material are stronger than the glass and their decreased density, compared to the glass state, generates a local compressive stress.","Glass ceramic materials include sensitized glass, thermally-tempered glass having increased internal stress for increased strength, crystal-tempered glass ceramic composites for increased strength, annealed glass having decreased internal stresses and smooth surface for enabling system integration, and ceramics having crystalline states made from sensitized amorphous glass. Glass and ceramics can have increased tempering in areas where high mechanical strength is desired, and can have reduced tempering in areas where mechanical or vibration compliance is desired or where a clearer optical path is desired or properties are desired that are more commensurate of the glass state of the original glass formulation. Ceramics can withstand higher temperatures and stresses than glass. A composite glass ceramic material can also be thermally-tempered to provide a more uniform stress response to a given load for improved mechanical toughness.","Photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be used to make spacecraft support structure, insulated circuit substrates, multichip module supports, actuators, sensors, and thermal control systems providing simultaneous multifunctionality. Almost all of the dry mass of a spacecraft, except for batteries and propellant, for example, can be composed of photostructurable glass and ceramic materials supporting operational photonic, electronic, electrical and MEMS devices. In the glass state, photostructurable glass and ceramic materials can be molded into any shape using low cost forming techniques, micromachined or macromachined to micron tolerances, metalized for forming an electronics communications grid, and then assembled into an integrated glass ceramic system through fusion bonding. The multifunctional properties of the photostructurable glass and ceramic materials and available low cost fabrication techniques enable photostructurable glass and ceramic materials to be used as a support structure in low-cost reproducible satellites. When tempered, the photostructurable glass and ceramic materials have substantially increased reliability against tension-induced fracture. Localized tempering can provide additional strength in a support structure where additional support strength is desirable. Tempered photostructurable glass and ceramic materials are electrical insulators, thermal insulators, and are transparent to visible through near IR light in the glass and glass ceramic composite phases.","That is, the photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be molded and patterned into any shape and composition, resulting in a wide range of structural, thermal, electrical, and optical properties. This multifunctionality allows almost an entire integrated spacecraft to be fabricated from photostructurable glass ceramic material. The photostructurable glass ceramic materials are amenable to material handling requirements found during conventional manufacturing. The photostructurable glass ceramic materials do not outgas chemicals, have zero porosity, and can be handled using clean-room protocols, and are therefore amenable to system integration using standard microelectronics fabrication processes. Valves, sensors, and actuators could also be fabricated using photostructurable glass ceramic materials with applied metal or polysilicon layers to provide electrodes or resistive structures for sensing and actuation.","A satellite can be made primarily of photostructurable glass ceramic materials with supported electronic, electrical, photonic, and MEMS devices. Spacecraft photonics and electronics are preferably integrated onto and encapsulated by glass ceramic substrates that multifunction as circuit boards. The encapsulation provides limited prevention of contamination. For example, a stack of integrated glass ceramic substrates can multifunction as a support structure while providing interface layers on which and through which are deposited conducting interconnects for forming an electrical communications grid about the support structure, and while providing internal optical paths for optical communication between optical transceivers for forming an optical communications grid about the support structure. Optical communications between and through the glass ceramic substrates of the support structure is enabled due to the wide transparency range of the glass phase of the photostructurable glass ceramic materials. Specific regions and volumes of the support structure are converted into the ceramic phase to provide enhanced dielectric properties for microwave circuits or to provide additional strength, while other regions and volumes are converted into the glass phase to provide enhanced internal optical communications.","The spacecraft thermal control for a glass ceramic satellite is very different from a silicon or metallic satellite. Photostructurable glass ceramic materials can have a low thermal conductivity of 1.35 W\/m-K for the glass phase which is less than stainless steel or aluminum used in conventional spacecraft. Due to the optical and near infrared transparency of the photostructurable glass ceramic materials, less than ten percent of received solar energy will be absorbed in the material while almost all of the infrared energy from the earth will be absorbed. This thermal absorption smoothes the temperature ranges for a satellite in Earth orbit where a significant fraction of the orbit is in eclipse. The high thermal insulating aspects of photostructurable glass ceramic materials can be thermally limiting for high power components, such as microprocessors and communication circuits. Fabrication of three-dimensional micro heat pipes, which are metalized and help to direct the heat away from these sources, can mitigate this thermal limitation of the photostructurable glass ceramic materials. These and other advantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.","An embodiment of the invention is described with reference to the figures using reference designations as shown in the figures, Referring to , a glass ceramic phone, such as a cellular phone, can be adapted to include a variety of glass ceramic components in an all glass ceramic system. As used herein, a glass ceramic material is a material comprising glass or ceramic components, or both. A molded glass ceramic cover , a laser milled glass ceramic strut , and a laser milled glass ceramic base  form the structural components of the phone and collectively provide internal cavities for supporting encapsulated internal components. Internal to these structural components is a power converter  and a communications processor  connected together by horizontal interconnects . A thin film battery  is charged through an external power adapter  adapted for interface connection through a power cover feedthrough and a power base feedthrough  for connecting the power from the adapter  to the power converter . An internal antenna  is disposed in an antenna cover feedthrough  and an antenna base feedthrough  for transceiving telecommunications to the communications processor . The antenna can be a conductor of a predetermined length to radiate RF energy. The antennas can be composed of patterned electrically conducting materials to optimize RF radiation. The antenna  can be metallic or semiconducting. Discreet antennas can be patterned in the glass and ceramic materials using direct-write laser patterning or photolithographic techniques. Laser-patterning can provide complex three-dimensional structures such as a helical coil. When the glass and ceramic material has a high metal dopant concentration, the helical shape can be an embedded conductor to function as an antenna. When the material does not have the added dopant, the exposed material is then baked and etched to remove material to make a hollow helical structure which is then back filled with a conducting material.","Vertical interconnects  extend from the power converter  through vertical interconnect feedthrough  for distributing power and control signals. The feedthrough  is a channel or via that encapsulates a conductor. The interconnects  provide connectivity for RF and electrical signal in the vertical direction. Molded shape glass ceramic cover  is first molded to have appropriate overall design and then patterned to have optical feedthroughs or transparency for the transmission of optical signal and have acoustic feedthroughs for transmission of acoustic energy. The cover  protects the interior from the outside environment while providing an ergonomic shape for handling. The cover  protects the interior against contamination of dust, dirt, water, and chemicals when baked and tempered into the ceramic state. The glass ceramic materials, such as Foturan, can be first shaped with a mold in an oven at 300\u00b0 C. to 460\u00b0 C. The cooled shaped molded component is then transferred to a direct-write UV laser or UV light photolithography machine to expose areas to be removed. The molded component is then rebaked using a second baking cycle up to 600\u00b0 C. maximum and then etched in about 5% hydrofluoric acid bath that is nominally at room temperature. The previously exposed regions are etched away. The sample is then baked a third time in an annealing oven of 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. to make optical paths more transparent. The cover  houses all the internal components providing IR, acoustic, and visual transparency, as well as electrical feedthroughs. The strut  provides mechanical support, visually clear in the glass state, that is an insulator at DC but also a very poor electrical conductor at high frequencies. A laser, preferably an ultrafast laser, such as a picosecond or femtosecond pulse width laser, is used to ablate and mill the glass to shape. Depending on whether the final structure is to be more like a ceramic or more like a glass, the milled structure is volumetrically exposed with UV light and baked to over 700\u00b0 C. to become a ceramic, or simply baked at 500\u00b0 C. followed by a rapid cool down in an oven to be tempered glass. The strut can function as an electrical substrate for electronic components while providing mechanical support and high optical transmission in the visible and IR for internal optical free-space communications. The base  provides additional support but has integral feed through vias for electrical and RF components. Via processing is also done using UV light patterned exposure, but can then be backfilled with conducting solid, paste, or gas, and then heated to make integral conducting vias. The base  is an electrical substrate for electronic components while providing mechanical support and high optical transmission in the visible and IR for optical free-space communications. The cover , strut , and base  form a glass ceramic support structure.","The power converter  converts one voltage to another as required by encapsulated electronic components. An electronic power converter circuit, preferably an integrated circuit, is disposed on the base . A recess, not shown, can be made in the base for securely mounting the power converter . The computer processor chip  controls the communication system through optical radiation or RF communications. A processor chip is preferably mounted in a recess made, not shown, in the glass and ceramic base . The communications processor  can be an RF integrated circuit or a multichip module with an RF coplanar waveguide, not shown, made in the substrate base . For an optical communications processor chip, the base  can be annealed to improve transparency for passing optical signals. The horizontal interconnects  are used for communicating electrical or RF energy on a horizontal plane between electrical and RF components. The interconnects can be a thin film conductor, but could also be a coated waveguide or a co-planar waveguide for high frequency through microwave frequency applications greater than 10 GHz. There are several techniques for patterning electrical conductors onto or into glass ceramic materials, including conventional standard microelectronics processing such as patterned sputtering, laser ablation and laser forward transfer process that deposits metal from a metalized ribbon, laser annealing following a direct write ink paste pen where the paste has conducting material, or glass and ceramic material doping with a high concentration of metal atoms where a laser is used to form thin metalized lines within the glass by laser coagulation of metal. For the RF communication where the interconnects  comprise waveguides, trenches are laser milled using the variable laser exposure technique followed by a bake and etch for where the material is to be removed. The trench is then coated with metal to function as a waveguide. The horizontal interconnects provide conduits for electrical and RF energy flow and communications about the integrated glass ceramic system. Thin film batteries provide local and distributed power to the encapsulated electrical devices. Thin film batteries can be made by laser ablation and depositing multiple materials using a patterning method by sputtering multiple layer of battery compounds through masks. The power adapter  permits charging of the battery  from an electrical outlet. The adapter can be a direct wire plug connector as shown, but because the integrated system can be made to be transparent to visible and IR light, the system could be powered by solar or other light power sources. The power cover feedthrough  enables the transfer of energy from an outside electrical power source to charge batteries as well as protecting inside components from contamination. For an optical power line, the system can be powered by a directed beam source, such as a laser. To fabricate an optical power adapter, a laser is used to create waveguides. An ultra fast laser is used to expose the material which is then baked at less than 500C to create an index of refraction change that will guide laser light through the glass and ceramic material. The power base feedthrough  is mated to the power cover feedthrough  either by direct electrical contact or by proximity contact for optical power transfer. As such, the integrated system has a power adapter and power storage elements for use with an electrical grid for power components distributed within the integrated glass ceramic system.","A received optical image , such as a terahertz or millimeter wave image, is received through an optical image lens , communicated through a portion of the molded cover, and received by an optical terahertz or millimeter wave image sensor , such as CCD camera, CMOS photosensor chip, microbolometer array, or a direct deposited thin film photosensor that converts light into electrical signals for receiving the received optical terahertz or millimeter wave image , such as a still image when the CCD camera operates as a still image camera. Light can be modulated or unmodulated, such as an unmodulated image or a modulated IR beam with encoded information. There are several approaches to make a lens. A diffractive lens is made by using a laser to laser mill or to expose followed by a bake and etch process to generate circular grooves of appropriate diameter, kerf width, and pitch, after the material has been removed. The lens is baked a second time to smooth out the kerf for making a diffractive planar lens that will focus onto the image sensor . Another approach is to create annular regions of metastable or ceramic material using a UV laser exposure followed by a bake cycle. The exposed portion will expand by a few percent and push clear glass within the annulus to create a convex surface, which will focus optical, terahertz, or millimeter wave optical signals below, Another approach is to use laser milling to shape a lens of any shape by directly removing material. The milled material is then baked for annealing and minor surface defect removal.","A transmitted optical image  is transmitted through a transmitter optical image lens  and originates from an optical display  for transmitted or displaying the transmitted optical image . The glass ceramic material between the display  and the outside is annealed to insure high-resolution low-loss optical transmission through the support structure. The lens  serves to focus incoming light onto a photosensor for efficient energy coupling. The display can be a typical cell phone readout, such as displaying a currently called telephone number and elapsed time of a conversation. The device can be make to communicate optical signals through the glass ceramic materials. The display can be an optical emitter with light passing through the glass ceramic material in the glass state. The glass and ceramic material in the glass state provides a vertical path to communicate optical signals or to transfer power.","A received audio signal  is received through received audio apertures  and sensed by an audio microphone processor  for receiving an audio signal such as a voice audio signal occurring during a typical telephone conversation. The audio signal could be encoded with digital information for information transfer. The audio apertures channel acoustic energy and focuses the acoustic energy to an electrical audio amplifier of the processor . Laser UV exposure and bake and etching is used to shape the three-dimensional apertures . Laser Milling can also be used to construct cylindrical via holes. A transmitted audio signal  is transmitted through transmitted audio apertures  and originates from an audio speaker processor  having speakers for generating the transmitted audio signal such as the reply conversation from a phone user to which the glass ceramic phone is currently communicating. Of course additional elements, such as a touch tone key pad, not shown, can be incorporated, as well as other desired buttons and controls.","The glass ceramic phone is characterized as having an all glass ceramic structural supports that are molded, patterned, or laser milled serving to internally encapsulate active operational components while enabling internal optical communications between the active components and physically through a portion of the structural support. In the preferred form, the converter , processors , battery , microphone , camera  and speakers  are all active components encapsulated within the glass ceramic components , , and , with internal optical communications extending from the display  to and including the lens , and through a portion of the structural components, and particularly through a portion of the molded cover . The upper molded cover  and lower base can be made of tempered glass for improved structural strength about the exterior of the phone.","Referring to , another example of an all glass ceramic system is the glass ceramic spacecraft. The spacecraft includes structural elements, such as a laser milled and molded glass ceramic dome , a laser milled glass ceramic thruster substrate , a laser milled glass ceramic sensor substrate , a laser milled glass ceramic optical substrate , a laser milled glass ceramic battery substrate , a laser milled glass ceramic processor substrate , and a laser milled glass ceramic antenna substrate . The dome  and substrates , , , , and  are bonded together to form a single all glass ceramic rigidly-integrated support structure in which is encapsulated many active and passive components and through which is communicated optical signals. Laser patterning composed of exposing, baking and etching, can also be used to replace or augment laser milling.","The dome  is a molded glass ceramic component in that molten glass is injected or poured, for examples, into a mold, not shown, for providing the substantially curved inner and outer surfaces of the dome . The dome  is shaped to efficiently serve as a pressure tank and a radome while providing feedthroughs for power and RF signals. The dome  provides a three-dimensional structure for mounting antennas, a radome for external or embedded antennas, and a pressure containment system. The convex shape also enables wide beam-pointing angles for phased array antennas, or the use of multiple antennas pointing in different directions. The glass and ceramic material, such as Foturan, is first shaped with a mold in an oven at 300\u00b0 C. to 460\u00b0 C., then cooled and transferred to a UV laser or UV light lithography machine to expose areas to be removed. The molded shape is then rebaked to 600\u00b0 C. maximum and then etched in about 5% hydrofluoric acid bath nominally at room temperature. The exposed regions are etched away. The sample is then baked a third time in an annealing oven from 300\u00b0 C. to 500\u00b0 C. to make the optical paths more transparent.","The thruster substrate  has shaped channels that guide gas, fluid, or particle flow in either subsonic or supersonic flow to thrusters or pneumatic components. The thruster substrate  also provides structural support. The thruster substrate  can be milled with an ultrafast picosecond or femtosecond pulse width laser to efficiently ablate the glass with very high precision. The laser beam is directed across the substrate surface using CADCAM control software. The thruster substrate  can be made by etching when nozzle shapes and fluid channels are fabricated in the material by direct-write UV laser patterning or UV photolithography. The material is then baked at a maximum temperature of 600\u00b0 C. and then etched in about 5% hydrofluoric acid to remove the exposed regions. The channels and nozzles can be fabricated on the top or bottom surface using either the UV photolithographic or UV direct-write laser approach. Embedded channels can be made using the direct-write approach when the laser is focused within the substrate and the beam dose is controlled so that it only exposes the material in the focal volume region where the laser beam comes to a focus.","The sensor substrate  serves as a holder for electrical die and components and can be a multichip module substrate that also functions as part of the spacecraft support structure. Power and data are routed via electrical feedthroughs and optical paths among the sensors, actuators, and control processors. A layout and interconnection pattern is first generated, and a surface topography pattern is created based on component layout on the surface and individual component heights. Recesses of various depths can be used to provide cleared volumes for various components between the sandwiched glass and ceramic substrates. The glass and ceramic material is patterned by UV laser direct-write exposure and baked and etched while an ultrafast laser is used to pattern sections that have to be milled and cannot be baked and etched. When the material is to be etched, it is first baked then etched. When milled, the material can annealed by baking using a low temperature bake cycle of less than 450\u00b0 C. The die and supporting components are placed into the recesses in the substrate. Solder bump or other space-qualified component interconnect technology such as conductive epoxies can be used to affix the die and other components in the recesses of the substrate. Interconnecting lines for conducting electrical signal can be patterned. When the interconnect is for an optical emitter, then no processing is required as the glass will pass the light, When the interconnect is for RF or electrical feedthrough interconnection, then there are several techniques for patterning electrical conductors onto glass and ceramic materials. Conventional photolithographic patterning of a deposited layer, laser ablation and material forward transfer processing, laser annealing following a direct-write ink paste pen where the paste contains conducting material, doping glass ceramic material with a high concentration of metal atoms where a laser is used to form thin metalized lines within the glass by metal precipitation, or laser or photolithographic patterning of the surface followed by conductor deposition and chemical and mechanical polishing to leave conductive trenches, can be used. For RF waveguides, trenches can be made using the variable laser exposure technique to expose and bake and etch the material where materials are to be removed. The trench is then coated with metal. The sensor substrate serves as a complex multilayer electronic and photonic substrate that also provides structure and thermal heat-sinking of sensor components.","The optical substrate  supports optical processing components. Recesses are formed in the substrate for optical processing devices. Optical waveguides that direct the light beam to a particular direction or free-space transmission regions where a light beam is directed within the glass, are then patterned, For the waveguides, an ultrafast laser with low power is used to expose the glass locally in the pattern of the waveguide shape with vertical lines and horizontal lines. The glass is then baked so that it partially crystallizes at less than 600\u00b0 C. that causes a change in the index that is sufficient to guide red light or IR light over many centimeters. Free-space communication in the glass ceramic material is also possible in the visible or IR. Where it is necessary to change the direction of the laser beam, a slot is cut either by laser milling or by UV exposure and bake and etch.
