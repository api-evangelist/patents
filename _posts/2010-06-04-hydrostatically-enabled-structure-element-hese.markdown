{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e)(1), this application claims the benefit of prior co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/237,358, Hydrostatically Enabled Structure Element (HESE), by Welch et al., filed Aug. 27, 2009, and incorporated herein by reference.","Under paragraph 1(a) of Executive Order 10096, the conditions under which this invention was made entitle the Government of the United States, as represented by the Secretary of the Army, to an undivided interest therein on any patent granted thereon by the United States. This and related patents are available for licensing to qualified licensees. Please contact Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113.","Structure elements comprising \u201cinflatables\u201d are known in the art. See, for example, the AirBeams\u2122of Vertigo, Inc. at www.vertigo-inc.com. One such element is an arch that is made of a woven fabric exterior and an internal membrane that is pressurized with air. The arch further comprises \u201ccohesionless\u201d particles that are compressed against the fabric exterior by air pressure inflating the internal membrane. This \u201chydrostatically enabled\u201d arch, when stabilized by suitable guy wires, is able to support an SUV hanging from its center, much more than otherwise possible without the addition of the particles. Tension straps on the top and bottom are used for additional reinforcement to support the heavy loads.","This demonstration of the concept has led to plans for further development by the U.S. Army, specifically the Inverse Triaxial Structural Element (ITSE) Project with a goal of developing a practical demonstration of the use of very high performance tensile fabrics. The approach is to develop and test the concept using existing fabrics, using structural test results to calibrate and validate and develop a finite element model (FEM) of structure. A validated FEM model would then be used with a continuum model to predict enhancement of fabric materials, in particular those employing carbon nanotubes (CNT), and structure using the CNT fabric.","In support of the ITSE Project, the Army developed a test structure for testing the basic concept of \u201chydrostatic enablement.\u201d The concept of the test structure is illustrated in . Refer to , showing a top view of a test apparatus  with the center section  further depicted for illustration purposes only. A test device  incorporating a reinforced rigid external cylinder  incorporates a center  comprising a flexible tube filled with cohesion-less particles , such as dry sand, the cylinder  filled with water . The water  is pressurized to a pressure represented as \u03c3to enable the center column to withstand a load represented as \u03c3. As the value of \u03c3increases to a pre-specified amount the available loading capacity of \u03c3also increases to a pre-specified amount as the center column of particles  stiffens under the increasing compressive force \u03c3. This is best seen in  in which a first \u201cdifferential\u201d stress-strain curve  depicts the relationship between \u03c3and \u03c3for a \u201cnominal value\u201d of \u03c3. As \u03c3is increased by increasing the water pressure in the cylinder , the value of \u03c3also increases as indicated by the differential stress-strain curve  and the dashed curve  indicating the significant increase in slope of the differential curve  with an increase in \u03c3. This follows the Mohr-Coulomb relation for cohesion-less soils:\n\n\u03c4=(\u03c3\u2212\u03bc)tan(\u03c6)+\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere:\n","\u03c4=shear strength (stress)","\u03c3=normal stress","c=cohesion (intercept of failure envelope with \u03c4 axis)","\u03c6=slope of the failure envelope (angle of internal friction)","\u03bc=hydrostatic pressure","The U.S. Army has investigated using thin wall structures for \u201chydrostatically enabled\u201d structure elements. Refer to . In , a \u201csupport column\u201d  of cohesion-less particles , such as dry sand, encased in a flexible membrane , such as butyl rubber or the like, is compressed and made more rigid by the use of pressure, \u03c3\u2032, equally impressed over its length.  is a top view of the thin-walled tube  showing the opposing force, \u03c3\u2032, inside the thin-walled tube, the relationship to tensile force, T, given by:\n\n\u03c32\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhere:\n","T=tensile force in a thin-walled cylinder","d=diameter of a thin-walled cylinder","t=thickness of the thin wall","\u03c3\u2032=hydrostatic pressure applied","Eqn. (2) may be used to design appropriately sized systems based on the basic theory of the Mohr-Coulomb relation of Eqn. (1) and pre-specified loads, \u03c3, expected. For example, a designer can specify the thickness, t, and diameter, d, of a thin-wall tube based on how much hydrostatic pressure will need to be applied to support a pre-specified axial load, \u03c3.","An alternative depiction of the effect of \u201cstiffening\u201d of cohesion-less particles is shown in , a stress-strain curve, indicating how a low applied hydrostatic pressure, \u03c3\u2032, exhibits a significantly lower load, \u03c3\u2032, than a higher applied hydrostatic pressure, \u03c3\u2032, at the same slope of the failure envelope, \u03c6\u2032.","Refer to , a test configuration  for the ITSE. The filled tube  comprises an outer membrane  of abrasion resistant material, such as woven Kevlar\u00ae or the like, an inner bladder  of flexible material, such as urethane, butyl rubber or the like, and a \u201cfill\u201d of cohesion-less particles , such as dry sand of medium density. A suitable fluid , such as air, is employed to inflate the inner bladder  and provide the necessary pressure to stiffen the particles  into a rigid mass impressed against both the bladder  and the outer membrane .  is a loading layout of the configuration  of , the configuration  emplaced upon supports , prior to impressing a load, \u03c3. Testing demonstrated the viability of the ITSE concept. The filled tubes for the test were about 10.2 cm (four inches) in diameter and about 61 cm (two feet) in length. They had a compliant internal urethane bladder and an external membrane of polyester bias braid, the same material as the air arch that supported an SUV. The internal bladder was inflated to 100 psi, providing axial loading to full mobilization of the shear strength of the particulates, dry sand, or of either membrane. A 3-point bending test was conducted to full mobilization of the shear strength of the soil or of either the internal bladder or external membrane.","Test results are shown in the graphs of .  shows results for two test units in compression, showing less than about 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) extension for a load in excess of 4,000 lbs and less than about 4.4 cm (1.75 in.) extension for a load of about 5,400 lbs, making the unit able to carry a load about 12 times greater than a tube filled only with dry sand.  shows a linear deflection curve of flexural force (psi) vs. deflection (in.), topping near 1000 psi at a deflection of only about 5.1 cm (two inches).","U.S. Pat. No. 6,463,699, Air Beam Construction Using Differential Pressure Chambers, to Bailey, describes a closed tubular cylindrical shell of air impermeable fabric having fixed within the shell an \u201cI-beam envelope\u201d comprising flexible, air impermeable walls sealed to the interior of the shell. The I-beam envelope extends the length of the shell and defines air chambers in communication with an inflation valve. Compressible material is dispersed throughout the interior of the I-beam envelope. When subjected to compressive forces by pressurization of the air chambers the material becomes rigid, thus able to support increased loading, albeit horizontal in the normal orientation of I-beams. The filled envelope is either vented to atmosphere or connected to a vacuum source.","The above demonstrates the feasibility of hydrostatically enabled structure elements but does not address many of the practical considerations for use of the technology. One such consideration is use of these structure elements in addressing damages to existing structure to mitigate further catastrophic deterioration, injury or loss of life. Select embodiments of the present invention address this and other practical applications.","Select embodiments of the present invention provide a transportable, readily deployed system for providing temporary support to damaged structure, for assuring safe access to partially collapsed structure, and for stabilizing existing structure in anticipation of catastrophic failure.","Upon deployment, select embodiments of the present invention comprise one or more pressurized compartments, these pressurized compartments immediately adjacent one or more sections containing cohesion-less particles that upon pressurizing the compartments become a rigid mass capable of supporting loads significantly greater than when the compartments are not pressurized.","Select embodiments of the present invention envision a structural element comprising: one or more first components comprising a top; a bottom; one or more elastic tubes of a first type sealed to the top and bottom; and one or more valves affixed to a tube of a first type to permit pressurization thereof; an elastic tube of a second type sealed to the top and bottom and incorporating one or more openings for filling the tube, the tube being co-extensive with, and adjacent to, the one or more tubes of a first type, the tube of a second type establishing one or more chambers of a first type between the one or more first components and the elastic tube of a second type while also establishing a chamber of a second type, the external dimensions of which chamber of a second type are defined by the internal perimeter of a tube of a second type and the top and bottom; one or more ports for access both near the top and near the bottom of the tube of a second type; and cohesion-less particles, such that upon pressurizing the at least one chamber of a first type and filling the chamber of a second type with the cohesion-less particles, the structural element becomes a rigid mass capable of supporting loads significantly greater than when the one or more chambers of a first type are not pressurized.","In select embodiments of the present invention the one or more chambers of a first type further comprise first and second chambers of a first type, the first chamber of a first type external to the chamber of a second type and the second chamber of a first type centered within the chamber of a second type, concentric and co-extensive with the long axis of the chamber of a second type, the boundary of the second chamber of a first type defined by a third elastic tube sealed to the top and bottom.","In select embodiments of the present invention the first and second chambers of a first type are in fluid communication with each other.","In select embodiments of the present invention the cohesion-less particles comprise man-made material. In select embodiments of the present invention the cohesion-less particles comprise dry sand.","In select embodiments of the present invention the top comprises a cylinder of height much less than its diameter, the cylinder incorporating passages for transferring the cohesion-less particles.

Select embodiments of the present invention comprise a system  that comprises a top  and bottom  support for a contained flexible, compressible structure comprising an outer abrasion resistant \u201cskin\u201d  attached to both the top  and bottom  supports that may include \u201cfolds\u201d that \u201caccordion\u201d () to allow employment along a longitudinal axis and reduction in size along the same axis for storage and transport. The skin  may be deployed by inflating a first internal cylindrical bladder  attached to the top  and bottom  supports and adjacent the inside surface of the skin . The first internal cylindrical bladder  is suitable for providing a tensile force via fluid pressure that inflates the bladder  against both the skin  and a second internal bladder , the second bladder  attached to both the top  and bottom  supports, the second bladder  wholly internal to the first bladder . The second internal bladder  may be deployed along the longitudinal axis via inflation of the first bladder . Upon deployment of the system , the first bladder  is inflated via a compressor B and hose B attached to a valve G connected to a port C at the bottom of the first bladder  to extend the system  to a pre-specified \u201cworking length\u201d along its longitudinal axis. Upon extension of the system  to its working length, a pump A, such as a centrifugal pump, pumps \u201ccohesion-less\u201d particles , e.g., dry sand or manmade particles of pre-specified characteristics such as density, diameter, and the like, from a vessel  via a second hose A and a second valve D into a port H at the top of the second bladder . Once the second bladder  is filled to a pre-specified height, typically the working length of the system , the first bladder  is pressurized to a pre-specified pressure to establish a pre-specified tension on both the skin  and the inner bladder . In select embodiments of the present invention, the pre-specified pressure is selected to support an expected load along the longitudinal axis of the system . In select embodiments of the present invention the load is applied directly along the longitudinal axis at the top of the system  when deployed. Thus, e.g., the system  may be deployed between the flooring supports and ceiling joists of a structure to support a ceiling that is anticipated to collapse.","Refer to , depicting the part A of the system  of  that is in its stored or transported configuration. The hoses A, B are simply disconnected after the cohesion-less particles  are evacuated from the bladder  by reversing the pump A and the pressurizing bladder  is evacuated by reversing the compressor B, permitting the skin  to be \u201caccordioned\u201d down to a suitable size for transport and storage.","Refer to  illustrating an alternative system  to that of . The system  will fold for shipping in much the same manner as that of the system , i.e., it will take approximately the same configuration as that of the storage\/transporting configuration A. The system  contains an extra internal bladder  filled from a port F at the bottom of the bladder  that both reduces the amount of cohesion-less particles  required and provides a \u201cback-up\u201d to the first pressurizing bladder  should the external skin  be punctured together with the pressurizing bladder . The extra internal bladder  may be filled via the compressor and hose B of the system , requiring only another valve J to insure proper filling and maintenance of pressure. Further, in addition to the advantage of using less particles , the extra internal bladder  will allow the pressure to be applied to the \u201chollow column\u201d of particles  from two sides of the rigidized column of particles , allowing a quicker and possibly more uniform \u201cpacking\u201d of the particles . This would be particularly advantageous in situations in which the system  needs to be deployed quickly. As noted above, the extra protection of the extra internal bladder  afforded by the packed particles  surrounding it, provides a measure of security not available with having only the first internal bladder  of the system . Further, the fluid  used in the bladder  need not be air, but could be an inert fluid, e.g., nitrogen or even water, in rare cases where flammables dictate the need for extra caution when using hoses B that may be susceptible to rupture or puncture due to hostile actions.","Refer to  depicting the reversal of the process shown in . The system  for de-pressurizing and transferring the cohesion-less material  (as shown by arrows ) back to a source vessel  merely reverses the direction of the pump A connected via a passage way  to the base of the chamber  to allow the material  to be pumped through the conduit A back to a source vessel .","The abstract of the disclosure is provided to comply with the rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher to quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure of any patent issued from this disclosure. 37 CFR \u00a71.72(b). Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.","While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for use in supporting damaged structures, it may be used for any type of portable structure where quick installation is desired.
