{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["None.","Not applicable.","Not applicable.","The present invention relates to the accessing of services and information within an enterprise. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention allow customers of a telecommunications provider to access the telecommunications provider's services and information in a secure and consistent manner.","A telecommunications provider might offer services such as local, long distance, and wireless services that might include text messaging, three-way calling, and location-based services, as well as more traditional telephony services. Such services can be referred to collectively as network systems, network capabilities, or network services. The telecommunications provider might wish to allow access to these network systems to other enterprises that are customers of the telecommunications provider. The telecommunications provider might also wish to allow its customers to have access to business data maintained by the telecommunications provider such as billing data, customer information, and product information, for example. Such data can be referred to collectively as data systems, back office information, or back office applications. Security measures would typically be put in place to ensure that customers are allowed access only to the network systems and data systems to which they are authorized. A customized set of security measures might be implemented for each customer, resulting in numerous different types of access procedures and security protocols.","A service access architecture to enable customer access to telecommunications provider services is provided. The service access architecture includes a service layer providing a standard interface for communication with customer applications to access network systems and data systems of the telecommunications provider. The service access architecture also includes a device\/data layer maintaining the network systems and data systems of the telecommunications provider. The service access architecture includes an adaptation layer coupled to communicate, via at least one broker of the adaptation layer, with the service layer and to communicate, via at least one adapter of the adaptation layer, with the device\/data layer, the adaptation layer operable to interface between the service layer and the device\/data layer.","An alternative embodiment is a method for an application of a customer of a telecommunications provider to access the telecommunications provider's services. The method includes sending a request, by the customer application, to a service layer provided by the telecommunications provider, and the service layer sending the request to an adaptation layer provided by the telecommunications provider. The method provides for the adaptation layer sending the request to a device\/data layer provided by the telecommunications provider, and the device\/data layer fulfilling the request.","Previously existing architectures for exposing network systems and data systems to external customers have several limitations. First, inadequate security mechanisms may exist to restrict access to the network systems and data systems. Also, the interfaces to the network systems and data systems may be non-standard, requiring customized procedures to set up communication. In addition, the protocols needed to interface with network devices may be highly complex. Also, there may be no central means of managing access to the network systems and data systems. Finally, there may be no consistent way to track customer usage of the network systems and data systems.","As an example of previously existing architecture, an outside company might establish a virtual private network (VPN) with a telecommunications provider as a means of securely accessing the telecommunications provider's services and data. The outside company might connect through the VPN directly to the telecommunications provider and use a customized application solution to obtain the desired service or data. A different company might have to establish another VPN and the custom solution, such as direct connection to a device, is typically not reusable by others.","Since these types of connections are made directly to the devices, knowledge of low-level network communication protocols would typically be needed on the part of the outside companies. If the telecommunications provider changed devices, the outside companies would typically need to employ different communication protocols for the new devices, possibly requiring the rewriting of large quantities of low-level programming code.","A multi-tiered approach that can be referred to as service access architecture addresses the above problems by managing access to business data and network capabilities in a centralized, controlled, and secured manner. The service access architecture provides an infrastructure that allows a telecommunications company to expose its network systems and its data systems to external customers as a set of services.","In this manner all customers are exposed to a consistent set of interfaces when accessing the telecommunications provider's network systems and data systems. The interfaces to the network and data systems are based on open standard technologies such as HTTP, XML, Web Services, or other common protocols. Layers of the service access architecture below these common interfaces handle the communications with the network systems and with the information repositories, or back office applications, that hold the business information. Thus, developers in the outside companies only need to know how to code to these common protocols. Knowledge is not needed of low-level network protocols and details of events at the layer where the network systems and data systems reside.","The outside companies can build their own applications to communicate with the interfaces to retrieve business data and use the telecommunications provider's services. This arrangement can eliminate the need for the telecommunications provider to create communications applications and customized security measures for the customers. This also decouples outside companies from the telecommunications provider's network capabilities and business data in the sense that changes in these back end services do not affect the customers.","Devices that can access the interfaces include wireless and wireline telephones, stand-alone and networked computers, PDA's, and other communication devices. The devices can use various operating systems such as Palm, J2ME, Pocket PC, and Microsoft Windows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","16","18","10","20","30","40"]},"The applications  of customers  that are using the service access architecture  reside in the application layer . This layer is located physically in a network that is external to that of the telecommunications provider . The applications  are typically next-generation, telecom-enabled applications.","One or more firewalls  may be present between the customers' applications  and the internal network systems and data systems of the telecommunications provider . That is, the telecommunications customer  may have a firewall protecting their network and the telecommunications provider  may have the firewall  protecting their network as well. The telecommunications provider  might have its own applications inside its firewall , allowing it to use the same services. For example, a web site for use by the customers  might be placed on the inside of the telecommunications provider's  firewall , but still within the application layer .","The service layer  exposes the telecommunications provider's  network systems and data systems as a set of services. Customers  are provided with a common set of interfaces with which to access the services in the service layer . The interfaces to the services and data are based on open standard technologies such as HTTP, XML, Java, Web Services, or other common protocols.","The service layer  consists of a network services domain , a data services domain , and a common services domain . The network services domain , which can also be referred to as telecom services, contains a set of services that provide access to the telecommunications provider's  network systems. A customer application  attempting to gain access to a particular network system via a network service can find the appropriate reference to the network service in the network services domain  by looking up the network service in a directory service .","The data services domain , which can also be referred to as information services, contains a set of services that provide access to the telecommunications provider's  data systems, such as customer data and product data. A customer application  attempting to gain access to a particular data system via a data service can find the appropriate reference to the data service in the data services domain  by looking up the data service in a directory service .","The common services domain  contains a set of common services that support the services in the other two domains. Components of the common services domain  can include a directory service , a security service , and an accounting service .","The security service  performs authentication and authorization when customer applications  attempt to access the network systems and data systems. All customer applications  pass through the same security service  regardless of whether the applications  are attempting to reach a network system or a data system.","The directory service  provides a means for an application  to locate and obtain a reference to a service so that the application can invoke methods on that service or make service invocations. Applications look up services using publicized names.","The accounting service  provides the telecommunications provider  with data regarding the level of usage of the service access architecture  by customer applications . This information can be used for billing purposes.","In the embodiment of , the service layer  is implemented on a Web Services platform , but other platforms could be used.","The adaptation layer  provides standardized interfaces between the service layer  and the device\/data layer . It acts as a bridge between the specific protocols of the network systems and data systems on the device\/data layer  and the network services  and data services  in the service layer . This provides a high degree of decoupling between the network\/data services ,  and the actual network and\/or data systems being accessed. The adaptation layer  can consist of a network broker  and an information broker .","The network broker  component of the adaptation layer  provides the service layer  with a standardized interface to the underlying network systems. The interface provided by the network broker  is independent of the network system to which a request is being sent. The network broker  routes network requests to the appropriate network systems via a set of network adapters . The network broker  may consult a metadata repository of routing information to make routing decisions.","The network adapters  associated with the network broker  provide an abstraction layer to the actual device level protocols needed to interface with the network systems. That is, the network adapters  translate requests from the standard format received by the network broker  from the network services  into the low-level networking protocols used by the network systems. The network adapters  then send the requests to the appropriate network systems as directed by the network broker . This decoupling of the network systems from the network broker  allows the service access architecture  to support a plug-and-play approach to the connection of new network devices.","The information broker  component of the adaptation layer  provides the service layer  with a standardized interface to the underlying data systems. The interface provided by the information broker  is independent of the data system to which a request is being sent. The information broker  routes information requests to the appropriate data system via a set of data adapters . The information broker  may consult a metadata repository of routing information to make routing decisions.","The data adapters  associated with the information broker  provide an abstraction layer to the actual back office application programming interfaces (APIs) needed to interface with the data systems. That is, the data adapters  translate requests from the standard format received by the information broker  from the data services  into the APIs used by the data systems. The data adapters  then send the requests to the appropriate data systems as directed by the information broker . This decoupling of the data systems from the information broker  allows the service access architecture  to support a plug-and-play approach to the connection of new back office applications.","In the embodiment of , the adaptation layer  is implemented on a J2EE platform , but other platforms could be used.","The device\/data layer  contains the network systems and data systems that the telecommunications provider  wishes to expose to its customers . In the embodiment of , the network systems are local network systems , long distance network systems , and wireless network systems , but other types and quantities of services could be present. The data systems shown are billing systems , trouble management systems , and customer information systems , but other types and quantities of applications could be present.","The network adapters  typically use various low-level network protocols such as SS7, LIF, AAL5, SIP, and X.25 to access the network systems , , and . The data adapters  typically use various APIs such as CORBA, ODBC, MQSeries, and RMI to access the data systems , , and .","When communication is established between a network adapter  and a network system , , or , a customer application  is able to access the system , , or  via the network services  and the network broker . Similarly, when communication is established between a data adapter  and a data system , , or , a customer application  is able to access the data system , , or  via the data services  and the information broker .","In an example, a customer application  might request access to a wireless network system  of a telecommunications provider . The request would pass from the application  to the firewall  set up by the customer. If the customer authorizes the request to pass through their firewall, the request is routed to the firewall  of the telecommunications provider . If the customer application  is authorized to cross the firewall , the request continues on to the service layer . The security service  of the service layer  then determines if the customer application  is authentic and is authorized to have access to the requested system .","If the customer application  is authenticated and authorized, the application  uses the directory service  to obtain a reference to the desired network service . The customer application  then uses the reference to send a request to network services. The network service then forwards the request to the network broker  in the adaptation layer . The accounting service  in the service layer  might record that the customer application  has made the request.","Upon receiving the request, the network broker  consults its metadata repository to determine the network system to which the request should be sent. In this example, the request is being sent to a wireless network system . After determining the appropriate network system, the network broker  sends the request to the network adapter  for that system. The network adapter  translates the request from the format in which it was received from the network broker  into the format of the wireless network system . The network adapter  then sends the request to the wireless network system  and the application  is thus given access to the requested system .","Any data that might be provided to the customer application  by the network system  would be returned to the application  along the same path through which the request flowed. A status describing whether or not the request was completed successfully might also be returned to the customer application  along the same path by which the request was sent to the network system . In cases where the network system  performs a function without returning any data to the customer application , the status alone might be returned.","A request from a customer application  for information in a data system , , or  would be handled in a similar manner. That is, after passing through the firewall , the request would be sent to the service layer . Upon the security service , directory service , and accounting service  performing the functions described above, the request is sent to the information broker  in the adaptation layer .","Upon receiving the request, the information broker  consults its metadata repository to determine the data system to which the request should be sent. After determining the appropriate data system , , or , the information broker  sends the request to the data adapter  for that data system , , or . The data adapter  translates the request from the format in which it was received from the information broker  into the API of the appropriate data system , , or . The data adapter  then sends the request to the data system , , or  and the customer application  is thus given access to the requested data system , , or .","As described above, any data that is returned to the customer application  and any statuses regarding the success or failure of a data request would be returned to the application  along the same path through which the data request flowed.","In this way, outside companies are allowed to use the network capabilities of a telecommunications provider and to have access to data held by the telecommunications provider. Instead of each customer having its own pipeline with customized technology and security for accessing data and services, the service access architecture provides a common, cohesive form that is the same for all customers. A customer can make a request in a standard, high-level language and the service access architecture can fulfill the request without the need for the customer to be aware of the low-level details that occur within the network devices and back office applications belonging to the telecommunications provider. Further, the present disclosure allows each of the layers, particularly the service layer , adaptation layer , and device\/data layer  to evolve and be modified or upgraded without impacting the other or adjacent layers.","Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described, it should be understood that the present invention may be embodied in many other specific forms without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present invention. The present examples are to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive, and the invention is not to be limited to the details given herein, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
