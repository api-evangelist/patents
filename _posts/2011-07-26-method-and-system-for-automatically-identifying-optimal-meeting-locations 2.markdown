In some embodiments, the identifiers and the meeting objective can be provided using a tool or a command. The participant profiles are stored at a server, for example the server , and are retrieved as required. In one example, the server can be a centralized server or a distributed server of Yahoo!\u00ae.","At step , a list of optimal meeting locations relevant to one or more of the meeting parameters is identified. The list of optimal meeting locations is identified by performing one or more steps of estimating a cost factor for each meeting location in a plurality of meeting locations, checking eligibility of each meeting location, identifying one or more deals in vicinity of each meeting location, calculating an average distance from a centroidal location associated with the one or more participants to each meeting location, determining if the interests of each participant match each meeting location, and detecting a meeting history of each meeting location.","In some embodiments, the cost factor can be estimated based on travel time, weather conditions, and traffic conditions.","The meeting locations are associated with a plurality of business listings that are stored in the server, for example the server . The list of optimal meeting locations is identified from the meeting locations. Each business listing includes, but is not limited to, a geographical location, a category, deals, age restrictions, timings, rules, and regulations. Examples of the category include, but are not limited to, entertainment, travel, education, real estate, and hotels.","Examples of the eligibility of each meeting location include, but are not limited to, entry restrictions for males or females, age group entry restrictions, and entry restrictions for stags.","In some embodiments, the list of optimal meeting locations can be identified using a search algorithm.","At step , the list of optimal meeting locations is ranked. Each optimal meeting location in the list of optimal meeting locations is ranked based on the cost factor, the eligibility, the deals, the average distance, the interests, and the meeting history. In one example, an optimal meeting location in the list of optimal meeting locations can be ranked first if the cost factor of the optimal meeting location is within a particular budget, if the participants are eligible to enter the optimal meeting location, if a sale or a discount is present in the vicinity of the optimal meeting location, if the average distance from the centroidal location to the optimal meeting location is satisfactory, if some of the interests of each participant match the optimal meeting location, or if some of the participants have previously visited the optimal meeting location. Similarly, other optimal meeting locations in the list of optimal meeting locations are subsequently ranked.","In some embodiments, the list of optimal meeting locations can be ranked using the search algorithm.","The list of optimal meeting locations, which is ranked, is subsequently displayed to the user.","In some embodiments, the list of optimal meeting locations is displayed in extensible markup language (XML) format or in hypertext markup language (HTML) format. The list of optimal meeting locations can also be presented in an application programming interface (API).","At step , the user is enabled to select an optimal meeting location from the list of optimal meeting locations as desired.","In some embodiments, the user can then invite the participants to the optimal meeting location by sending one of a short message service (SMS), an electronic mail, and an invite on a social networking site. The participants can also be invited via a phone call.","In some embodiments, the user invites the participants excluded from the list of participants. The one or more participants can be in vicinity of the optimal meeting location.","In other embodiments, the user can be notified if the one or more participants enter the optimal meeting location, the one or more participants being excluded from the list of participants.","In some embodiments, the user can obtain reservations at the optimal meeting location either automatically, by making a phone call, or by sending an electronic mail to a manager. The user can also check reviews and ratings of the meeting location, sometimes provided by the one or more participants, before obtaining the reservations. The user can also obtain the reservations by being directed to a corresponding website via a link.","In some embodiments, the travel time to the optimal meeting location is determined for each participant and can be displayed via maps, for example Yahoo!\u00ae maps.","In one example, an employee of Yahoo!\u00ae, situated in a first office building, needs to schedule an official meeting with two colleagues, situated at a second office building. As Yahoo!\u00ae employs intranet in each of its office buildings, profile information associated with each employee is usually kept updated. Examples of the profile information include, but are not limited to, geographical location, interest groups, and cube number. The employee can enter names of the two colleagues in an email application, for example Microsoft Outlook, via an office computer and provide a meeting objective to create a meeting invite. The server, for example the Yahoo!\u00ae server, retrieves the profile information corresponding to the two colleagues. A list of optimal meeting locations that are relevant to the profile information are then identified and ranked. Optimal meeting locations that are available in the second office building can be ranked higher as the two colleagues are situated in the second office building. The employee then selects an optimal meeting location from the list of optimal meeting locations. The employee can further send the meeting invite to the one or more colleagues and perform other related functions.","The present disclosure automatically identifies optimal meeting locations by using available information, for example participant profiles and business listings. Users can save time and hence be motivated to use different technologies, for example Yahoo! technologies, for staying connected, scheduling meeting invites and sending electronic mails. The users are also provided with a list of optimal meeting locations based on local deals and offers. Click revenue is thereby improving as the users can visit locations of the local deals and offers and make a purchase. Revenue is also improved as each business listing can be sponsored.","It is to be understood that although various components are illustrated herein as separate entities, each illustrated component represents a collection of functionalities which can be implemented as software, hardware, firmware or any combination of these.
