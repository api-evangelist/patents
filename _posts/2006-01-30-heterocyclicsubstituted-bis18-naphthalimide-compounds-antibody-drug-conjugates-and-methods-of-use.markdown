{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This non-provisional application filed under 37 CFR \u00a71.53(b), is a continuation-in-part, claiming the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7120 of U.S. non-provisional application Ser. No. 11\/311,591, filed 29 Nov. 2005, and which claims the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/632,613 filed on 1 Dec. 2004, both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The invention relates generally to compounds with anti-cancer activity and more specifically to heterocyclic-substituted bis-1,8 naphthalimide chemotherapeutic drugs and bis-1,8 naphthalimide chemotherapeutic drugs conjugated to antibodies. The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Improving the delivery of drugs and other agents to target cells, tissues and tumors to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity has been the focus of considerable research for many years. Though many attempts have been made to develop effective methods for importing biologically active molecules into cells, both in vivo and in vitro, none has proved to be entirely satisfactory. Optimizing the association of the drug with its intracellular target, while minimizing intercellular redistribution of the drug, e.g. to neighboring cells, is often difficult or inefficient.","Monoclonal antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer, immunological and angiogenic disorders. One example, HERCEPTIN\u00ae (trastuzumab; Genentech, Inc.; South San Francisco, Calif.) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd=5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor2 protein, HER2 (ErbB2) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,337; U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297; U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213; U.S. Pat. No. 6,639,055; Coussens L, et al (1985) Science 230:1132-9; Slamon D J, et al (1989) Science 244:707-12). Trastuzumab is an IgG1 kappa antibody that contains human framework regions with the complementarity-determining regions (cdr) of a murine antibody (4D5) that binds to HER2. Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells. Because Trastuzumab is a humanized antibody, it minimizes any HAMA (Human Anti-Mouse Antibody) response in patients. Trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2 (Hudziak R M, et al (1989) Mol Cell Biol 9:1165-72; Lewis G D, et al (1993) Cancer Immunol Immunother; 37:255-63; Baselga J, et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2825-2831). Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, ADCC (Hotaling T E, et al (1996) [abstract]. Proc. Annual Meeting Am Assoc Cancer Res; 37:471; Pegram M D, et al (1997) [abstract]. Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res; 38:602). In vitro, Trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. HERCEPTIN\u00ae as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein and who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. HERCEPTIN\u00ae in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein and who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. HERCEPTIN\u00ae is clinically active in patients with ErbB2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy (Baselga et al, (1996) J. Clin. Oncol. 14:737-744).","The use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), i.e. immunoconjugates, for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer (Syrigos and Epenetos (1999) Anticancer Research 19:605-614; Niculescu-Duvaz and Springer (1997) Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26:151-172; U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,278) theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors, and intracellular accumulation therein, where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated (Baldwin et al., (1986) Lancet pp. (Mar. 15, 1986):603-05; Thorpe, (1985) \u201cAntibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review,\u201d in Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, A. Pinchera et al. (ed.s), pp. 475-506). Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as well as drug-linking and drug-releasing properties. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies (Rowland et al., (1986) Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 21:183-87). Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and vindesine (Rowland et al., (1986) supra). Toxins used in antibody-toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin, plant toxins such as ricin, small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin (Mandler et al (2000) Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 (19):1573-1581; Mandler et al (2000) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. Letters 10:1025-1028; Mandler et al (2002) Bioconjugate Chem. 13:786-791), maytansinoids (US 20050169933 A1; EP 1391213; Liu et al., (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:8618-8623), and calicheamicin (Lode et al (1998) Cancer Res. 58:2928; Hinman et al (1993) Cancer Res. 53:3336-3342). The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding, DNA binding, or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.","ZEVALIN\u00ae (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen\/Idec) is an antibody-radioisotope conjugate composed of a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant B lymphocytes and In or Y radioisotope bound by a thiourea linker-chelator (Wiseman et al (2000) Eur. Jour. Nucl. Med. 27 (7):766-77; Wiseman et al (2002) Blood 99 (12):4336-42; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20 (10):2453-63; Witzig et al (2002) J. Clin. Oncol. 20 (15):3262-69). Although ZEVALIN has activity against B-cell non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), administration results in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. MYLOTARG\u2122 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), an antibody drug conjugate composed of a hu CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, was approved in 2000 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by injection (Drugs of the Future (2000) 25 (7):686; U.S. Pat. No. 4,970,198; U.S. Pat. No. 5,079,233; U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; U.S. Pat. No. 5,606,040; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762; U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,116; U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,285; U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,001). Cantuzumab mertansine (Immunogen, Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the huC242 antibody linked via the disulfide linker SPP to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is advancing into Phase II trials for the treatment of cancers that express CanAg, such as colon, pancreatic, gastric, and others. MLN-2704 (Millennium Pharm., BZL Biologics, Immunogen Inc.), an antibody drug conjugate composed of the anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) monoclonal antibody linked to the maytansinoid drug moiety, DM1, is under development for the potential treatment of prostate tumors. The auristatin peptides, auristatin E (AE) and monomethylauristatin (MMAE) synthetic analogs of dolastatin, were conjugated to chimeric monoclonal antibodies including: cBR96 (specific to Lewis Y on carcinomas); cAC10 (specific to CD30 on hematological malignancies); and other antibodies (US 20050238649 A1) and are under therapeutic development (Doronina et al (2003) Nature Biotechnology 21 (7):778-784).","DNA intercalation is a proposed mechanism for inhibiting the progression of tumorigenesis. Bis-1,8 naphthalimide compounds strongly bind DNA and may disrupt the DNA-topoisomerase II complex (Bailly et al (2003) Biochemistry 42:4136-4150) by stacking with purine nucleobases on opposite strands (Gallego et al (1999) Biochemistry 38 (46):15104-15115). Bis-1,8 naphthalimide compounds have been investigated for their anti-cancer properties (Brana et al (2004) Jour. Med. Chem. 47 (6):1391-1399; Brana et al (2004) J. Med. Chem. 47:2236-2242; Bailly et al (2003) Biochemistry 42:4136-4150; Carrasco et al (2003) 42:11751-11761; Brana, M. F. and Ramos, A. (2001) Current Med. Chem.-Anti-Cancer Agents 1:237-255; Mekapati et al (2001) Bioorganic & Med. Chem. 9:2757-2762; U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,782; U.S. Pat. No. 5,376,664). The investigational antitumor drug bis-1,8 naphthalimide mesylate (LU79553, also known as elinafide dimesylate, N,N-bis[1,8-naphthalimido)ethyl]-1,3-diaminopropane bismethane sulfonate; or N,N\u2032-Bis[2-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benz[de]isoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]-1,3-diaminopropane dimethanesulfonate; 2,2\u2032-Propane-1,3-diylbis(iminoethylene)bis(2,3-dihydro-1H-benz[de]isoquinoline-1,3-dione) dimethanesulfonate, (Abbott Laboratories, Knoll A G, Ludwigshafen, D E)), is composed of two tricyclic 1,8-naphthalimide chromophores separated by an aminoalkyl linker chain and designed to permit bisintercalation of the drug into DNA (Villalona-Calero et al (2001) Jour. Clinical Oncology 19 (3):857-869; Bousquet et al (1995) Cancer Res. 55:1176-1180; U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,863; U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,089; U.S. Pat. No. 5,616,589; U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,418; WO 95\/05365). Clinical trials with Elinafide were conducted in Germany (Awada et al (2003) Euro. J. of Cancer 39 (6):742-747). Unlike most other known topoisomerase II inhibitors, elinafide does not cause significant DNA cleavage suggesting Elinafide inhibits topoisomerase II via a different mechanism. This could mean that cancer cells resistant to coventional topoisomerase II inhibitors may not be cross-resistant to elinafide. Elinafide also inhibits topoisomerase I isolated from calf thymus with and IC50 value of 5 \u03bcMolar assessed by a supercoiled DNA relaxation assay. In mouse xenograft models, repeated dosing regimens with elinafide demonstrated antitumor activity and did not demonstrate a strong schedule dependency (Bousquet et al (1995) Cancer Res. 55:1176-1180). In human xenograft models, complete regression of MX-1 (mammary carcinoma) xenografts was observed when LU-79553 was administered iv for five daily doses at 20 mg\/kg (2 cycles, beginning on days 6 and 20), or every 3 days for two doses at 55 mg\/kg (2 cycles, beginning on days 6 and 13) or weekly for four doses (Bousquet et al (1995) Cancer Res. 55:1176-1180). Elinafide has been shown to be curative also in human melanoma (LOX) models and give partial and complete tumor regression, as well as some cures, in human lung (LX-1) and human colon (CX-1) carcinoma xenograft models.","It is desirable to test further analogs of bis-1,8 naphthalimide compounds for their anticancer properties. It is desirable to discover such analogs with optimized biological in vivo properties such as pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, metabolism, potency, safety, and bioavailability. It is also desirable to discover such analogs with optimized physical properties such as increased aqueous solubility and stability.","It is further desirable to the known anticancer properties of bis-1,8 naphthalimide compounds by conjugation to antibodies in order to improve their delivery to target cells, and achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity.","The present invention provides novel compounds with biological activity against cancer cells. The compounds of the invention may inhibit tumor growth in mammals.

While the invention will be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. The discussion below is descriptive, illustrative and exemplary and is not to be taken as limiting the scope defined by any appended claims. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein, which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described.","Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, and are consistent with: Singleton et al., (1994) 2., J. Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y.; and Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York.","When trade names are used herein, applicants intend to independently include the trade name product formulation, the generic drug, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the trade name product.","Unless stated otherwise, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings:","The term \u201cantibody\u201d herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies may be murine, human, humanized, chimeric, or derived from other species.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of a full length antibody, generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, CDR (complementary determining region), and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens or microbial antigens, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.","An \u201cintact antibody\u201d herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains, as well as complete light and heavy chain constant domains.","An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody.","The term \u201cantibody,\u201d as used herein, also refers to a full-length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full-length immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof, such targets including but not limited to, cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), class (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2) or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species. In one aspect, however, the immunoglobulin is of human, murine, or rabbit origin.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al (1975) 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The \u201cmonoclonal antibodies\u201d may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597; for example.","The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al (1984) 81:6851-6855). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include \u201cprimatized\u201d antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, Ape etc) and human constant region sequences.","Various methods have been employed to produce monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Hybridoma technology, which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody, uses the cells of various species, including mice (murine), hamsters, rats, and humans. Another method to prepare MAbs uses genetic engineering including recombinant DNA techniques. Monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include, among others, chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. A chimeric antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than one type of species. For example, a chimeric antibody may derive the variable region from a mouse and the constant region from a human. A humanized antibody comes predominantly from a human, even though it contains nonhuman portions. Like a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody may contain a completely human constant region. But unlike a chimeric antibody, the variable region may be partially derived from a human. The nonhuman, synthetic portions of a humanized antibody often come from CDRs in murine antibodies. In any event, these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen. While useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies, murine antibodies cannot be administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response. This response, called Human Anti-Mouse Antibody (HAMA), occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as foreign and attacks it. A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or even death.","Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies. Furthermore, chimeric and humanized antibodies can have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity.","\u201cAntibody fragments\u201d comprise a portion of an intact antibody, e.g. comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032)2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s).","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variant thereof.","The intact antibody may have one or more \u201ceffector functions\u201d which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g., B cell receptor; BCR), etc.","Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \u201cclasses.\u201d There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \u201csubclasses\u201d (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b3, and \u03bc, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide antibodies include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTGF\u201d), such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen-of-interest. For example, for the production of polyclonal antibodies, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including but not limited to rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, and including but not limited to Freund's (complete and incomplete) adjuvant, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a viral antigen, a microbial antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to an antigen-of-interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by K\u00f6hler and Milstein (1975, 256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, 4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, , Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","Useful monoclonal antibodies include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, or chimeric human-mouse (or other species) monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (e.g., Teng et al., 1983, 80, 7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 1983, 4, 72-79; and Olsson et al., 1982, 92, 3-16).","The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Milstein et al., 1983, 305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules, of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule, which is usually performed using affinity chromatography steps, is rather cumbersome, and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion may be with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain, comprising at least part of the hinge, C2, and C3 regions. The first heavy-chain constant region (C1) may contain the site necessary for light chain binding, present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","Bispecific antibodies may have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (WO 94\/04690; Suresh et al., 1986, 121:210; Rodrigues et al., 1993, 151:6954-6961; Carter et al., 1992, 10:163-167; Carter et al., 1995, 4:463-470; Merchant et al., 1998, 16:677-681. Using such techniques, bispecific antibodies can be prepared for conjugation as ADC in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof (EP 105360; WO 83\/03679; EP 217577).","The antibody can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens, viral antigens, or microbial antigens or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay) (See, for e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, , Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Kabat E et al., 1980, 125 (3):961-969).","Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as, but not limited to, F(ab\u2032)2 fragments, which contain the variable region, the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule, and Fab fragments, which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. Other useful antibodies are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423-42; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; and Ward et al., (1989) Nature 334:544-54), or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in WO 87\/02671; EP 184,187; EP 171496; EP 173494; WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; EP 12023; Berter et al., 1988, Science 240:1041-1043; Liu et al., 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:3439-3443; Liu et al., 1987, J. Immunol. 139:3521-3526; Sun et al., 1987, Proc.

Immunol. 141:4053-4060; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Completely human antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; 5,545,806; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Abgenix, Inc. (Freemont, Calif.) and Genpharm (San Jose, Calif.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. (Jespers et al. (1994) 12:899-903). Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries (Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581 (1991)).","The antibody may be a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, such as at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody. The antibody or fragment thereof may be covalently linked to the other protein at the N-terminus of the constant domain.","Antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","The antibodies in ADC include antibodies having modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular, antibodies include antibodies having modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the anti-Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially, for example, from Genentech (San Francisco, Calif.) or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.","The antibody of the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may specifically bind to a receptor encoded by an ErbB gene. The antibody may bind specifically to an ErbB receptor selected from EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4. The ADC may specifically bind to the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibit the growth of tumor cells which overexpress HER2 receptor. The antibody of the ADC may be a monoclonal antibody, e.g. a murine monoclonal antibody, a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody. A humanized antibody may be huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 or huMAb4D5-8 (Trastuzumab). The antibody may be an antibody fragment, e.g. a Fab fragment.","Known antibodies for the treatment or prevention of cancer can be conjugated as ADC. Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like it, the literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing. Examples of antibodies available for the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer; R\u00ae (rituximab; Genentech) which is a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; OvaRex (AltaRex Corporation, MA) which is a murine antibody for the treatment of ovarian cancer; Panorex (Glaxo Wellcome, NC) which is a murine IgGantibody for the treatment of colorectal cancer; Cetuximab Erbitux (Imclone Systems Inc., NY) which is an anti-EGFR IgG chimeric antibody for the treatment of epidermal growth factor positive cancers, such as head and neck cancer; Vitaxin (MedImmune, Inc., MD) which is a humanized antibody for the treatment of sarcoma; Campath I\/H (Leukosite, MA) which is a humanized IgGantibody for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); Smart MI95 (Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized anti-CD33 IgG antibody for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); LymphoCide (Immunomedics, Inc., NJ) which is a humanized anti-CD22 IgG antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Smart ID10 (Protein Design Labs, Inc., CA) which is a humanized anti-HLA-DR antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Oncolym (Techniclone, Inc., CA) which is a radiolabeled murine anti-HLA-Dr10 antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Allomune (BioTransplant, CA) which is a humanized anti-CD2 mAb for the treatment of Hodgkin's Disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Avastin (Genentech, Inc., CA) which is an anti-VEGF humanized antibody for the treatment of lung and colorectal cancers; Epratuzamab (Immunomedics, Inc., NJ and Amgen, CA) which is an anti-CD22 antibody for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and CEAcide (Immunomedics, NJ) which is a humanized anti-CEA antibody for the treatment of colorectal cancer.","Other antibodies useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against the following antigens: CA125 (ovarian), CA15-3 (carcinomas), CA19-9 (carcinomas), L6 (carcinomas), Lewis Y (carcinomas), Lewis X (carcinomas), alpha fetoprotein (carcinomas), CA 242 (colorectal), placental alkaline phosphatase (carcinomas), prostate specific antigen (prostate), prostatic acid phosphatase (prostate), epidermal growth factor (carcinomas), MAGE-1 (carcinomas), MAGE-2 (carcinomas), MAGE-3 (carcinomas), MAGE-4 (carcinomas), anti-transferrin receptor (carcinomas), p97 (melanoma), MUC1-KLH (breast cancer), CEA (colorectal), gp100 (melanoma), MART1 (melanoma), PSA (prostate), IL-2 receptor (T-cell leukemia and lymphomas), CD20 (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), CD52 (leukemia), CD33 (leukemia), CD22 (lymphoma), human chorionic gonadotropin (carcinoma), CD38 (multiple myeloma), CD40 (lymphoma), mucin (carcinomas), P21 (carcinomas), MPG (melanoma), and Neu oncogene product (carcinomas). Some specific, useful antibodies include, but are not limited to, BR96 mAb (Trail, P. A., et al Science (1993) 261, 212-215), BR64 (Trail, P A, et al Cancer Research (1997) 57, 100-105, mAbs against the CD40 antigen, such as S2C6 mAb (Francisco, J. A., et al Cancer Res. (2000) 60:3225-3231), mAbs against the CD70 antigen, such as 1F6 mAb, and mAbs against the CD30 antigen, such as AC10 (Bowen, M. A., et al (1993) J.

E., et al Cancer Biother Radiopharm. (2000) 15:459-76; Murray, J. L., (2000) Semin Oncol., 27:64-70; Breitling, F., and Dubel, S., , John Wiley, and Sons, New York, 1998).","Known antibodies for the treatment or prevention of an autoimmune disorders may be conjugated as ADC. Autoimmune disorders include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, immune thromobocytopenia, and multiple sclerosis. Antibodies immunospecific for an antigen of a cell that is responsible for producing autoimmune antibodies can be obtained by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. SLE is marked by the overexpression of interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) cytokine genes (Bennett et al (2003) Jour. Exp. Med. 197:711-723). Type-1 interferons (IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of lupus (Santiago-Raber (2003) Jour. Exp. Med. 197:777-788). Knockout mice (-IFN-\u03b1\/\u03b2) showed significantly reduced anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies, erythroblastosis, hemolytic anemia, anti-DNA autobodies, kidney disease, and mortality. These results suggest that Type-1 IFNs mediate murine lupus, and that reducing their activity in the human counterpart may be beneficial. Anti-IFN Ab conjugated to bis 1,8 naphthalimide drug moieties may be effective therapeutic agents against SLE and other autoimmune disorders.","In another embodiment, useful antibodies in ADC are immunospecific for the treatment of autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, Anti-Nuclear Antibody; Anti ds DNA; Anti ss DNA, Anti Cardiolipin Antibody IgM, IgG; Anti Phospholipid Antibody IgM, IgG; Anti SM Antibody; Anti Mitochondrial Antibody; Thyroid Antibody; Microsomal Antibody; Thyroglobulin Antibody; Anti SCL-70; Anti-Jo; Anti-URNP; Anti-La\/SSB; Anti SSA; Anti SSB; Anti Perital Cells Antibody; Anti Histones; Anti-RNP; C-ANCA; P-ANCA; Anti centromere; Anti-Fibrillarin, and Anti-GBM Antibody.","Antibodies of an ADC can bind to both a receptor or a receptor complex expressed on an activated lymphocyte, such as one associated with an autoimmune disease.

The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, ErbB 1, HER1), HER2 (ErbB2 or p185), HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4 or tyro2). A panel of anti-ErbB2 antibodies has been characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SKBR3 (Hudziak et al., (1989) 9 (3): 1165-1172.

Antibodies against HER1 are described, for example, in Murthy et al (1987) 252:549-560 and in WO 95\/25167.","The term \u201cERRP\u201d, \u201cEGF-Receptor Related Protein\u201d, \u201cEGFR Related Protein\u201d and \u201cepidermal growth factor receptor related protein\u201d are used interchangeably herein and refer to ERRP as disclosed, for example in U.S. Pat.

The term \u201cerbB2\u201d refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and \u201cneu\u201d refers to the gene encoding rat p185neu. ErbB2 may be a native sequence human ErbB2.","\u201cErbB3\u201d and \u201cHER3\u201d refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,884 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,968 as well as Kraus et al., PNAS (USA), 86:9193-9197 (1989). Antibodies against ErbB3 are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat.

Antibodies against HER4 are described, for example, in WO 02\/18444.","Antibodies to ErbB receptors are available commercially from a number of sources, including, for example, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., California, USA.","The term \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d refers to polypeptides having amino acid sequences that differ to some extent from a native sequence polypeptide. Ordinarily, amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70% sequence identity with at least one receptor binding domain of a native antibody or with at least one ligand binding domain of a native receptor, and preferably, they will be at least about 80%, more preferably, at least about 90% homologous by sequence with such receptor or ligand binding domains. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions at certain positions within the amino acid sequence of the native amino acid sequence. Amino acids are designated by the conventional names, one-letter and three-letter codes.","\u201cSequence identity\u201d is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that are identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. One such computer program is \u201cAlign 2,\u201d authored by Genentech, Inc., which was filed with user documentation in the United States Copyright Office, Washington, D.C. 20559, on Dec. 10, 1991.","The terms \u201cFc receptor\u201d or \u201cFcR\u201d are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. An exemplary FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a FcR may be one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the Fc\u03b3RI, Fc\u03b3RII, and Fc\u03b3 RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc\u03b3RII receptors include Fc\u03b3RIIA (an \u201cactivating receptor\u201d) and Fc\u03b3RIIB (an \u201cinhibiting receptor\u201d), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc\u03b3RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc\u03b3RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain. (See review M. in 15:203-234 (1997)). FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 9:457-92 (1991); Capel et al., 4:25-34 (1994); and de Haas et al., 126:330-41 (1995). Other FcRs, including those to be identified in the future, are encompassed by the term \u201cFcR\u201d herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 117:587 (1976) and Kim et al., 24:249 (1994)).","\u201cComplement dependent cytotoxicity\u201d or \u201cCDC\u201d refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g., an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g., as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., 202:163 (1996), may be performed.","\u201cNative antibodies\u201d are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.","The term \u201cvariable\u201d refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions (FRs). The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a \u03b2-sheet configuration, connected by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases forming part of, the \u03b2-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies (see Kabat et al (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.). The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).","The term \u201chypervariable region\u201d when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \u201ccomplementarity determining region\u201d or \u201cCDR\u201d (e.g., residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al supra) and\/or those residues from a \u201chypervariable loop\u201d (e.g., residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917). \u201cFramework Region\u201d or \u201cFR\u201d residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.","Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding fragments, called \u201cFab\u201d fragments, each with a single antigen-binding site, and a residual \u201cFc\u201d fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F(ab\u2032)2 fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen.","\u201cFv\u201d is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen-binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen-binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.","The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fab\u2032 fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab\u2032-SH is the designation herein for Fab\u2032 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F(ab\u2032)2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab\u2032 fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.","The \u201clight chains\u201d of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (\u03ba) and lambda (\u03bb), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.","\u201cSingle-chain Fv\u201d or \u201cscFv\u201d antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. The Fv polypeptide may further comprise a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pl\u00fcckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994). Anti-ErbB2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO 93\/16185; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,571,894; and 5,587,458.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (VH) connected to a variable light domain (VL) in the same polypeptide chain (VH-VL). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. Humanization is a method to transfer the murine antigen binding information to a non-immunogenic human antibody acceptor, and has resulted in many therapeutically useful drugs. The method of humanization generally begins by transferring all six murine complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human antibody framework (Jones et al, (1986) Nature 321:522-525). These CDR-grafted antibodies generally do not retain their original affinity for antigen binding, and in fact, affinity is often severely impaired. Besides the CDRs, select non-human antibody framework residues must also be incorporated to maintain proper CDR conformation (Chothia et al (1989) Nature 342:877). The transfer of key mouse framework residues to the human acceptor in order to support the structural conformation of the grafted CDRs has been shown to restore antigen binding and affinity (Riechmann et al., (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224, 487-499; Foote and Winter, (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 224:487-499; Presta et al., (1993) J. Immunol. 151, 2623-2632; Werther et al., (1996) J. Immunol. Methods 157:4986-4995; and Presta et al (2001) Thromb. Haemost. 85:379-389). For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,407,213; Jones et al (1986) Nature, 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta, (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 2:593-596.","Humanized anti-ErbB2 antibodies include huMAb4D5-1, huMAb4D5-2, huMAb4D5-3, huMAb4D5-4, huMAb4D5-5, huMAb4D5-6, huMAb4D5-7 and huMAb4D5-8 (HERCEPTIN\u00ae) as described in Table 3 of U.S. Pat.

The parent antibody may comprise a native or wild type sequence. The parent antibody may have pre-existing amino acid sequence modifications (such as additions, deletions and\/or substitutions) relative to other native, wild type, or modified forms of an antibody. A parent antibody is directed against a target antigen of interest. Antibodies directed against nonpolypeptide antigens (such as tumor-associated glycolipid antigens; see U.S. Pat.

Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In certain embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, or more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a gas phase protein sequencer, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.","An antibody \u201cwhich binds\u201d a molecular target or an antigen of interest, e.g., ErbB2 antigen, is one capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful in targeting a cell expressing the antigen. Where the antibody is one which binds ErbB2, it will usually preferentially bind ErbB2 as opposed to other ErbB receptors, and may be one which does not significantly cross-react with other proteins such as EGFR, ErbB3 or ErbB4. In such embodiments, the extent of binding of the antibody to these non-ErbB2 proteins (e.g., cell surface binding to endogenous receptor) will be less than 10% as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation (RIA). Sometimes, the anti-ErbB2 antibody will not significantly cross-react with the rat neu protein, e.g., as described in Schecter et al., Nature 312:513 (1984) and Drebin et al., Nature 312:545-548 (1984).","Molecular targets for the antibody drug conjugates (ADC) encompassed by the present invention include: (i) tumor-associated antigens; (ii) cell surface receptors, (iii) CD proteins and their ligands, such as CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD34, CD40, CD79\u03b1 (CD79\u03b1), and CD79\u03b2 (CD79b); (iv) members of the ErbB receptor family such as the EGF receptor, HER2, HER3 or HER4 receptor; (v) cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1, Mac1, p150,95, VLA-4, ICAM-1, VCAM and \u03b1v\/\u03b23 integrin including either alpha or beta subunits thereof (e.g. anti-CD11a, anti-CD18 or anti-CD11b antibodies); and (vi) growth factors such as VEGF; IgE; blood group antigens; flk2\/flt3 receptor; obesity (OB) receptor; mpl receptor; CTLA-4; protein C, BR3, c-met, tissue factor, \u03b27 etc.","Unless indicated otherwise, the term \u201cmonoclonal antibody 4D5\u201d refers to an antibody that has antigen binding residues of, or derived from, the murine 4D5 antibody (ATCC CRL 10463).

For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","The term \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A \u201ctumor\u201d comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (\u201cNSCLC\u201d), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","An \u201cErbB-expressing cancer\u201d is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An \u201cErbB2-expressing cancer\u201d is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof, such that an anti-ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.","A cancer \u201ccharacterized by excessive activation\u201d of an ErbB receptor is one in which the extent of ErbB receptor activation in cancer cells significantly exceeds the level of activation of that receptor in non-cancerous cells of the same tissue type. Such excessive activation may result from overexpression of the ErbB receptor and\/or greater than normal levels of an ErbB ligand available for activating the ErbB receptor in the cancer cells. Such excessive activation may cause and\/or be caused by the malignant state of a cancer cell. In some embodiments, the cancer will be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and\/or overexpression of an ErbB receptor is occurring which results in such excessive activation of the ErbB receptor. Alternatively, or additionally, the cancer may be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and\/or overexpression an ErbB ligand is occurring in the cancer which attributes to excessive activation of the receptor. In a subset of such cancers, excessive activation of the receptor may result from an autocrine stimulatory pathway.","A cancer which \u201coverexpresses\u201d an ErbB receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of an ErbB receptor, such as ErbB2, at the cell surface thereof, compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. ErbB receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the ErbB protein present on the surface of a cell (e.g., via an immunohistochemistry assay; IHC). Alternatively, or additionally, one may measure levels of ErbB-encoding nucleic acid in the cell, e.g., via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; see WO 98\/45479), southern blotting, or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, such as real time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR). Overexpression of the ErbB ligand, may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand (or nucleic acid encoding it) in the patient, e.g., in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC, FISH, southern blotting, PCR or in vivo assays described above. One may also study ErbB receptor overexpression by measuring shed antigen (e.g., ErbB extracellular domain) in a biological fluid such as serum (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,933,294; WO 91\/05264; U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,638; and Sias et al., (1990) 132: 73-80). Aside from the above assays, various other in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example, one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a radioactive isotope, and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated, e.g., by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.","The tumors overexpressing ErbB2 (HER2) are rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell, and can be determined biochemically: 0=0-10,000 copies\/cell, 1+=at least about 200,000 copies\/cell, 2+=at least about 500,000 copies\/cell, 3+=about 1-2\u00d710copies\/cell. Overexpression of HER2 at the 3+ level, which leads to ligand-independent activation of the tyrosine kinase (Hudziak et al., (1987) 84:7159-7163), occurs in approximately 30% of breast cancers, and in these patients, relapse-free survival and overall survival are diminished (Slamon et al., (1989) 244:707-712; Slamon et al., (1987) 235:177-182).","Conversely, a cancer which is \u201cnot characterized by overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor\u201d is one which, in a diagnostic assay, does not express higher than normal levels of ErbB2 receptor compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type.","The term \u201ccytotoxic agent\u201d as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and\/or causes destruction of cells.

One utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins, typically through fusions to either PIII or PVIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman, 3:355-362 (1992), and references cited therein. In monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a phage coat protein or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type protein. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells, 3:205-0216 (1991). Phage display includes techniques for producing antibody-like molecules (Janeway, C., Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) 5th Ed., Garland Publishing, New York, p 627-628).","A \u201cphagemid\u201d is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.","\u201cAlkyl\u201d is a C-Chydrocarbon moiety containing normal, secondary, tertiary or cyclic carbon atoms.

In various embodiments, a linker is specified as L. Linkers include, but are not limited to, a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an aryldiyl, a heteroaryldiyl, moieties such as: \u2014(CR)O(CR)\u2014, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine\u2122); and diacid ester and amides including maleimide, succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide.","The term \u201clabel\u201d means any moiety which can be covalently attached to an antibody and that functions to: (i) provide a detectable signal; (ii) interact with a second label to modify the detectable signal provided by the first or second label, e.g. FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer); (iii) stabilize interactions or increase affinity of binding, with antigen or ligand; (iv) affect mobility, e.g. electrophoretic mobility, or cell-permeability, by charge, hydrophobicity, shape, or other physical parameters, or (v) provide a capture moiety, to modulate ligand affinity, antibody\/antigen binding, or ionic complexation.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and I or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt,\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of an ADC. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counterion.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable solvate\u201d refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.","The following acronyms, terms, and abbreviations are used herein and have the indicated definitions:","Boc is N-(t-butoxycarbonyl), cit is citrulline (2-amino-5-ureido pentanoic acid), dap is dolaproine, DCC is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, DCM is dichloromethane, DEA is diethylamine, DEAD is diethylazodicarboxylate, DEPC is diethylphosphorylcyanidate, DIAD is diisopropylazodicarboxylate, DIEA is N,N-diisopropylethylamine, dil is dolaisoleuine, DMAP is 4-dimethylaminopyridine, DME is ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether (or 1,2-dimethoxyethane), DMF is N,N-dimethylformamide, DMSO is dimethylsulfoxide, doe is dolaphenine, dov is N,N-dimethylvaline, DTNB is 5,5\u2032-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, DTT is dithiothreitol, EDCI is 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, EEDQ is 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, ES-MS is electrospray mass spectrometry, EtOAc is ethyl acetate, Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl), gly is glycine, HATU is O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, HOBt is 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, HPLC is high pressure liquid chromatography, ile is isoleucine, lys is lysine, MeCN (CHCN) is acetonitrile, LC\/MS is liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, MeOH is methanol, Mtr is 4-anisyldiphenylmethyl (or 4-methoxytrityl), nor is (1S,2R)-(+)-norephedrine, PBS is phosphate-buffered saline (Ph 7.4), PEG is polyethylene glycol, Ph is phenyl, Pnp is p-nitrophenyl, PyBrop is bromo tris-pyrrolidino phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, SEC is size-exclusion chromatography, Su is succinimide, TFA is trifluoroacetic acid, TLC is thin layer chromatography, UV is ultraviolet, and val is valine.","Antibodies: HERCEPTIN\u00ae (trastuzumab)=full length, humanized antiHER2 (MW 145167), trastuzumab F(ab\u2032)2=derived from antiHER2 enzymatically (MW 100000), 4D5=full-length, murine antiHER2, from hybridoma, rhu4D5=transiently expressed, full-length humanized antibody, rhuFab4D5=recombinant humanized Fab (MW 47738), 4D5Fc8=full-length, murine antiHER2, with mutated FcRn binding domain","Linkers: MC=6-maleimidocaproyl, MP=maleimidopropanoyl, val-cit=valine-citrulline, dipeptide site in protease-cleavable linker, ala-phe=alanine-phenylalanine, dipeptide site in protease-cleavable linker, PAB=p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (\u201cself immolative\u201d portion of linker), SPP=N-Succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridylthio) pentanoate, SMCC=N-Succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1 carboxylate, SIAB=N-Succinimidyl (4-iodo-acetyl) aminobenzoate","Antibody Drug Conjugates","The compounds of the invention include those with potential utility for anticancer activity, treatment of hyperproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease. In particular, the compounds include an antibody conjugated, i.e. covalently attached by a linker, to a 1,8 bis-naphthalimide drug moiety where the corresponding drug when not conjugated to an antibody has a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect. The biological activity of the drug is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. The antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention may selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity, i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved, than upon delivery of the same dose of the 1,8 bis-naphthalimide compound not conjugated to an antibody.","In one embodiment, the bioavailability of the ADC of the invention, or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC, is improved in a mammal when compared to a 1,8 bis-naphthalimide compound comprising the 1,8 bis-naphthalimide moiety of the ADC.

Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drugs (D) per antibody (Ab or mAb). Compositions of ADC of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs, from 1 to 20. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","For some antibody drug conjugates, p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading, e.g. p>5, may cause aggregation, insolubility, toxicity, or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.","Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Also, only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds of the invention exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT), under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally, the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by dual ELISA antibody assay, specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy, and separated by HPLC, e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography (\u201cEffect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody-drug conjugate\u201d, Hamblett, K.

This method involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody, annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides, and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.","Alternatively, a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody can be generated from a suitable source. If a clone containing the nucleic acid encoding the particular antibody is not available, but the sequence of the antibody is known, a nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be obtained from a suitable source (e.g., an antibody cDNA library, or cDNA library generated from any tissue or cells expressing the immunoglobulin) by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence.","If an antibody that specifically recognizes a particular antigen is not commercially available (or a source for a cDNA library for cloning a nucleic acid encoding such an immunoglobulin), antibodies specific for a particular antigen can be generated by any method known in the art, for example, by immunizing a patient, such as a rabbit, to generate polyclonal antibodies or, by generating monoclonal antibodies, e.g., as described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256:495-497) or, as described by Kozbor et al. (1983, Immunology Today 4:72) or Cole et al. (1985 in , Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Alternatively, a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody can be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries (e.g., as described in Huse et al., 1989, Science 246:1275-1281) for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries (See, e.g., Clackson et al., 1991, Nature 352:624; Hane et al., 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:4937).","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least the variable domain of the antibody is obtained, it can be introduced into a vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the antibody (see, e.g., WO 86\/05807; WO 89\/01036; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,464). Vectors containing the complete light or heavy chain that allow for the expression of a complete antibody molecule are available. Then, the nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be used to introduce the nucleotide substitutions or deletion necessary to substitute (or delete) the one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond with an amino acid residue that does not contain a sulfhydyl group. Such modifications can be carried out by any method known in the art for the introduction of specific mutations or deletions in a nucleotide sequence, for example, but not limited to, chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis (Hutchinson et al., 1978, 253:6551).","In addition, techniques developed for the production of \u201cchimeric antibodies\u201d (Morrison et al., 1984, 81:851-855; Neuberger et al., 1984, 312:604-608; Takeda et al., 1985, 314:452-454) by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., humanized antibodies.","Alternatively, techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423-42; Huston et al., 1988, 85:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989, 334:544-54) can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge, resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used (Skerra et al., 1988, 242:1038-1041).","Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example, such fragments include, but are not limited to, the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments.","Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody has been obtained, the vector for the production of the antibody can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include, for example, in vitro recombinant DNA techniques, synthetic techniques, and in vivo genetic recombination. See, for example, the techniques described in Sambrook et al. (1990, 2Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) and Ausubel et al. (eds., 1998, , John Wiley & Sons, NY).","Polyclonal antibodies may be raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl, or RN\u2550C\u2550NR, where R and Rare different alkyl groups.","Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier \u201cmonoclonal\u201d indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., 256:495 (1975), or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, , pp. 59-103, Academic Press, 1986). Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al., 5:256-262 (1993) and Pl\u00fcckthun, 130:151-188 (1992).","Monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al (1990) Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628; and Marks et al (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity (nm range) human antibodies by chain shuffling (Marks et al (1992) Bio\/Technology, 10:779-783) as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries (Waterhouse et al (1993) Nuc. Acids. Res., 21:2265-2266). Thus, these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.","The DNA also may be modified, for example, by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison, et al (1984) Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851), or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non-immunoglobulin polypeptide.","Humanization can be performed by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody (Jones et al (1986) Nature 321:522-525; Riechmann et al (1988) Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al (1988) Science 239:1534-1536). Accordingly, such \u201chumanized\u201d antibodies are chimeric antibodies (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567) wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies (Sims et al (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2296; Chothia et al (1987) J. Mol. Biol., 196:901; Carter et al (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:4285; Presta et al., (1993) J. Immunol., 151:2623).","Various forms of the humanized antibody are contemplated. For example, the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment, such as a Fab. Alternatively, the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody, such as an intact IgG1 antibody. The murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 which specifically binds the extracellular domain of ErbB2 is produced, as described in Fendly et al (1990) Cancer Research 50:1550-1558, from NIH 3T3\/HER2-3cells (expressing approximately 1\u00d710ErbB2 molecules\/cell), as described in Hudziak et al (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 84:7158-7163 and harvested with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 25 mM EDTA and used to immunize BALB\/c mice. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for ErbB2-binding by ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation.","As an alternative to humanization, human antibodies can be generated (Jakobovits et al (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:2551; Jakobovits et al (1993) Nature, 362:255-258; Bruggermann et al (1993) Year in Immuno. 7:33; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,669, U.S. Pat. No. 5,589,369, U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807).","Alternatively, phage display technology (McCafferty et al., (1990) Nature 348:552-553) can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable (V) domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors (Johnson, Kevin S. and Chiswell, David J., (1993) Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:564-571; Clackson et al (1991) Nature, 352:624-628). Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,610 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,229,275). Human anti-ErbB2 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,772,997 and WO 97\/00271.","Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments (Morimoto et al (1992) Journal of Biochem. and Biophys. Methods 24:107-117; and Brennan et al (1985) Science, 229:81; Carter et al (1992) Bio\/Technology 10:163-167; WO 93\/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,894; U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458; U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,870).","Amino acid sequence modification(s) of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and\/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody expressing nucleic acid, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and\/or insertions into and\/or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processes of the antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.","A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of an antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called \u201calanine scanning mutagenesis\u201d (Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and\/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants include the fusion to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody to an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the serum half-life of the antibody.","Peptide sequences which specifically bind to albumin may be fused or conjugated to the antibody which comprises the antibody drug conjugates (ADC). Plasma-protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules, such as antibodies or ADC. Serum albumin binding peptides (ABP) can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins, including alteration of tissue uptake, clearance, penetration, and diffusion, and increase serum half life. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence (US 20040001827 at [0076]). A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening (Dennis et al. (2002) J Biol Chem. 277:35035-35043 at Tables III and IV, page 35038; WO 01\/45746); and WO 01\/45746 at pages 12-13, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions, but FR alterations are also contemplated.","Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:","(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;","(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr;","(3) acidic: asp, glu;","(4) basic: asn, gln, his, lys, arg;","(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and","(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.","Non-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.","Any-cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment).","It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function, e.g. so as to enhance antigen-dependent cell-mediated cyotoxicity (ADCC) and\/or complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally, cysteine residue(s) may be introduced in the Fc region, thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and\/or increased complement-mediated cell killing and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). See Caron et al J. Exp Med. 176:1191-1195 (1992) and Shopes, B. J. Immunol. 148:2918-2922 (1992). Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti-tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross-linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53:2560-2565 (1993). Alternatively, an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti-Cancer Drug Design 3:219-230 (1989).","To increase the serum half life of the antibody, one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody (especially an antibody fragment) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,277, for example. As used herein, the term \u201csalvage receptor binding epitope\u201d refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, or IgG) that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half-life of the IgG molecule.","Some antibodies are glycosylated at conserved positions in their constant regions (Jefferis and Lund, (1997) Chem. Immunol. 65:111-128; Wright and Morrison, (1997) TibTECH 15:26-32). The oligosaccharide side chains of the immunoglobulins affect protein function (Boyd et al., (1996) Mol. Immunol. 32:1311-1318; Wittwe and Howard, (1990) Biochem. 29:4175-4180), and the intramolecular interaction between portions of the glycoprotein which can affect the conformation and presented three-dimensional surface of the glycoprotein (Hefferis and Lund, supra; Wyss and Wagner, (1996) Current Opin. Biotech. 7:409-416; Malhotra et al., (1995) Nature Med. 1:237-243; Hse et al., (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:9062-9070; U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,335; U.S. Pat. No. 5,510,261; U.S. Pat.

ADC can be conveniently prepared using a Linker having a reactive site for binding to the Drug and Antibody. In one aspect, a Linker has a reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a nucleophilic group present on an antibody. Useful nucleophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl and amino groups. The heteroatom of the nucleophilic group of an antibody is reactive to an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker unit. Useful electrophilic groups include, but are not limited to, maleimide and haloacetamide groups. The electrophilic group provides a convenient site for Antibody attachment.","In another embodiment, a Linker has a reactive site which has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include, but are not limited to, aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include, but are not limited to, hydrazide, oxime, amino, hydrazine, thiosemicarbazone, hydrazine carboxylate, and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.","Carboxylic acid functional groups and chloroformate functional groups are also useful reactive sites for a Linker because they can react with secondary amino groups of a Drug to form an amide linkage. Also useful as a reactive site is a carbonate functional group on a Linker, such as but not limited to p-nitrophenyl carbonate, which can react with an amino group of a Drug, such as but not limited to N-methyl valine, to form a carbamate linkage. Typically, peptide-based Drugs can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and\/or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schr\u00f6der and K. L\u00fcbke, \u201cThe Peptides\u201d, volume 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.","As described in more detail below, the ADC of the Invention are conveniently prepared using a Linker having two or more reactive functional groups for binding to the Drug and Antibody.

The drug linker, e.g. MC-val-cit-PAB-bis 1,8 naphthalimide in DMSO, dissolved in acetonitrile and water at known concentration, is added to the chilled reduced antibody in PBS. After about one hour, an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the ADC, e.g. trastuzumab-MC-vc-PAB-bis 1,8 naphthalimide, is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS, filtered through 0.2 \u03bcm filters under sterile conditions, and frozen for storage.","1,8 bis-naphthalimide Compounds","Heterocyclic-substituted 1,8 bis-naphthalimide have structures according to Formula XV:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0416","num":"0495"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00054","num":"00054"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00054","he":"32.34mm","wi":"104.06mm","file":"US07947839-20110524-C00054.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"Y is N(R), C(R), O, or S;","Ris independently selected from H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, \u2014N(R), \u2014N(R), C-Calkylhalide, carboxylate, sulfate, sulfamate, sulfonate, \u2014SOR, \u2014S(\u2550O)R, \u2014SR, \u2014SON(R), \u2014C(\u2550O)R, \u2014COR, \u2014C(\u2550O)N(R), \u2014CN, \u2014N, \u2014NO, C-Calkoxy, C-Ctrifluoroalkyl, polyethyleneoxy, phosphonate, phosphate, C-Calkyl, C-Csubstituted alkyl, C-Calkenyl, C-Csubstituted alkenyl, C-Calkynyl, C-Csubstituted alkynyl, C-Caryl, C-Csubstituted aryl, C-Cheterocycle, and C-Csubstituted heterocycle; or when taken together, two Rgroups on the same carbon atom form a carbonyl (\u2550O), or on different carbon atoms form a carbocyclic, heterocyclic, or aryl ring of 3 to 7 carbon atoms;","Ris independently selected from H, C-Calkyl, C-Csubstituted alkyl, C-Calkenyl, C-Csubstituted alkenyl, C-Calkynyl, C-Csubstituted alkynyl, C-Caryl, C-Csubstituted aryl, C-Cheterocycle, and C-Csubstituted heterocycle;","where C-Csubstituted alkyl, C-Csubstituted alkenyl, C-Csubstituted alkynyl, C-Csubstituted aryl, and C-Csubstituted heterocycle are independently substituted with one or more substituents selected from F, Cl, Br, I, OH, \u2014N(R), \u2014N(R), C-Calkylhalide, carboxylate, sulfate, sulfamate, sulfonate, C-Calkylsulfonate, C-Calkylamino, 4-dialkylaminopyridinium, C-Calkylhydroxyl, C-Calkylthiol, \u2014SOR, \u2014S(\u2550O)R, \u2014SR, \u2014SON(R), \u2014C(\u2550O)R, \u2014COR, \u2014C(\u2550O)N(R), \u2014CN, \u2014N, \u2014NO, C-Calkoxy, C-Ctrifluoroalkyl, C-Calkyl, C-Ccarbocyclyl, C-Caryl, C-Cheterocyclyl, polyethyleneoxy, phosphonate, and phosphate;","m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6;","n is independently selected from 1, 2, and 3;","X, X, X, and Xare independently selected from F, Cl, Br, I, OH, \u2014N(R), \u2014N(R), \u2014N(R)C(\u2550O)R, \u2014N(R)C(\u2550O)N(R), \u2014N(R)SON(R), \u2014N(R)SOR, OR, OC(\u2550O)R, OC(\u2550O)N(R), C-Calkylhalide, carboxylate, sulfate, sulfamate, sulfonate, \u2014SOR, \u2014SOAr, \u2014SOAr, \u2014SAr, \u2014SON(R), \u2014SOR, COR, \u2014C(\u2550O)N(R), \u2014CN, \u2014N, \u2014NO, C-Calkoxy, C-Ctrifluoroalkyl, polyethyleneoxy, phosphonate, phosphate, C-Calkyl, C-Csubstituted alkyl, C-Calkenyl, C-Csubstituted alkenyl, C-Calkynyl, C-Csubstituted alkynyl, C-Caryl, C-Csubstituted aryl, C-Cheterocyclyl, and C-Csubstituted heterocyclyl; or Xand Xtogether, and Xand Xtogether, independently form \u2014CHCH\u2014 or \u2014CHCHCH\u2014; and","at least one of X, X, X, and Xis nitrogen-linked C-Cheterocyclyl having the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0425","num":"0504"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00055","num":"00055"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00055","he":"11.51mm","wi":"13.29mm","file":"US07947839-20110524-C00055.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where the wavy line indicates the site of attachment to a 1,8 naphthalimide carbon;","with the proviso that when at least one of X, X, X, and Xis nitrogen-linked C-Cheterocyclyl at the 3 position of the 1,8 naphthalimide, and each of Ris H or C-Calkyl, then Y is not N(R).","For descriptive purposes herein, each of the 1,8 naphthalimide aromatic carbon atoms are numbered according to the structure:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0429","num":"0508"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00056","num":"00056"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00056","he":"28.79mm","wi":"28.96mm","file":"US07947839-20110524-C00056.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The nitrogen-linked C-Cheterocyclyl substituents include at least one nitrogen atom.

For example, two equivalents of an anhydride in toluene are treated with one equivalent of the corresponding polyamine in ethanol. The mixture is heated at reflux until the reaction is complete. The bis 1,8 naphthalimide is isolated, e.g. by filtration and crystallization, as the free base and converted to a salt, such as the mesylate with methanesulfonic acid, or as the trifluoroacetate with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and washed with an organic solvent, according to the method of Brana et al (2004) J.

After deprotection of the terminal amino group of the mono 1,8 naphthalimide intermediate, a second 1,8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be reacted to form the bis 1,8 naphthalimide product. By this route, asymmetric bis 1,8 naphthalimide compounds can be prepared, i.e. where Xand Xare different than Xand X. Suitable amino protecting groups include mesitylenesulfonyl, dinitrobenzenesulfonyl, BOC (tert-butyloxycarbonyl), CBz (carbobenzoxy), or those detailed in , Theodora W. Greene (1991) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, or later editions thereto. Alternatively, the terminal amino group for coupling to the second 1,8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be generated by reductive amination of a carbonyl group such as aldehyde or ester, or by reduction of a nitrile group.","In vitro Cell Proliferation Assays","Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of a compound of the invention is measured by: exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins, e.g. HER2, to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC of the invention.","The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay (). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.), homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,713 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,670). This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88, U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay was conducted in 96 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC, or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally, cells treated briefly, i.e. 3 hours, showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates.

A difference in the amount of total antibody and ADC indicates cleavage of the linker and separation of the antibody from its drug moiety.","In vivo Efficacy","Efficacy of the antibody-drug conjugates of the invention was measured in vivo by implanting allografts or xenografts of cancer cells in rodents and treating the tumors with ADC. Variable results are to be expected depending on the cell line, the specificity of antibody binding of the ADC to receptors present on the cancer cells, dosing regimen, and other factors. For example, the in vivo efficacy of anti-HER2 ADC was measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft may be propagated from the Fo5 MMTV transgenic mouse which does not respond to, or responds poorly to, HERCEPTIN therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC and monitored over 3-6 weeks to measure the time to tumor doubling, log cell kill, and tumor shrinkage. The ADC of the invention showed only modest efficacy in slowing the progression of tumor growth. For example, an IV administration of 10 mg H-MC-af-PAB-(bis 4-imidazolyl E) 203 per kg animal showed only a slight increase in the time for mean MMTV\u2014HER2 Fo5 tumor volume doubling in athymic nude mice relative to control (injection vehicle, PBS buffer). Follow up dose-response and multi-dose experiments may be conducted.","Rodent Toxicity","Antibody-drug conjugates and an ADC-minus control, \u201cVehicle\u201d, may be evaluated in an acute toxicity rat model (Brown et al (2002) Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 50:333-340). Toxicity of ADC may be investigated by treatment of rats with the ADC and subsequent inspection and analysis of the effects on various organs. Based on gross observations (body weights), clinical pathology parameters (serum chemistry and hematology) and histopathology, the toxicity of ADC may be observed, characterized, and measured. Clinical chemistry, serum enzymes and hematology analysis may also be conducted periodically; concluding with complete necropsy with histopathological assessment. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss, considering that weight loss, or weight change relative to animals dosed only with Vehicle in animals after dosing with ADC, is a gross and general indicator of systemic or localized toxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be measured by: (i) elevated liver enzymes such as AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (g-glutamyl transferase); (ii) increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures; and (iii) hepatocyte necrosis. Hematolymphoid toxicity is observed by depletion of leukocytes, primarily granuloctyes (neutrophils), and\/or platelets, and lymphoid organ involvement, i.e. atrophy or apoptotic activity. Toxicity is also noted by gastrointestinal tract lesions such as increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and degenerative entercolitis.","Administration of bis 1,8-naphthalimide Drug Compounds, Antibody Drug Conjugates and Pharmaceutical Formulations","The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally, i.e. infusion, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural. The heterocyclic-substituted bis 1,8-naphthalimide compounds may be administered parenterally or orally.","Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody drug conjugates (ADC) of the invention are typically prepared for parenteral administration, i.e. bolus, intravenous, intratumor injection with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients, and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). For example, lyophilized anti-ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97\/04801, expressly incorporated herein by reference.","The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile, which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.","The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcelluose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxy-benzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are disfavored due to hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut, formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations include a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Treatments","It is contemplated that the compounds of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders, e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors; leukemia and lymphoid malignancies; other disorders such as neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic, glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal, blastocoelic, inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.","The compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell-based assays can be further tested in tumor-bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed similar to the clinical trials testing the efficacy of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody HERCEPTIN in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anti-cancer therapy as reported by Baselga et al. (1996) J. Clin. Oncol. 14:737-744. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens, such as radiation and\/or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and\/or cytotoxic agents.","Generally, the disease or disorder to be treated is cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.","The cancer will generally comprise HER2-expressing cells, such that the ADC of the present invention are able to bind to the cancer cells. To determine ErbB2 expression in the cancer, various diagnostic\/prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment, ErbB2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC, e.g. using the HERCEPTEST (Dako). Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a ErbB2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows: Score 0, no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10% of tumor cells; Score 1+, a faint\/barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10% of the tumor cells, the cells are only stained in part of their membrane; Score 2+, a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells; Score 3+, a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells.","Those tumors with 0 or 1+ scores for ErbB2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing ErbB2, whereas those tumors with 2+ or 3+ scores may be characterized as overexpressing ErbB2.","Alternatively, or additionally, FISH assays such as the INFORM\u2122 (Ventana Co., Ariz.) or PATHVISION\u2122 (Vysis, Ill.) may be carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent (if any) of ErbB2 overexpression in the tumor.","The cancer to be treated herein may be one characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor, e.g. HER2. Such excessive activation may be attributable to overexpression or increased production of the ErbB receptor or an ErbB ligand. In one embodiment of the invention, a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether the patient's cancer is characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor. For example, ErbB gene amplification and\/or overexpression of an ErbB receptor in the cancer may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplification\/overexpression are available in the art and include the IHC, FISH and shed antigen assays described above. Alternatively, or additionally, levels of an ErbB ligand, such as TGF-alpha., in or associated with the tumor may be determined according to known procedures. Such assays may detect protein and\/or nucleic acid encoding it in the sample to be tested. In one embodiment, ErbB ligand levels in the tumor may be determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC); see, for example, Scher et al. (1995) Clin. Cancer Research 1:545-550. Alternatively, or additionally, one may evaluate levels of ErbB ligand-encoding nucleic acid in the sample to be tested; e.g. via FISH, southern blotting, or PCR techniques.","Moreover, ErbB receptor or ErbB ligand overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay, e.g. by administering a molecule (such as an antibody) which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label (e.g. a radioactive isotope) and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.","For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated, as defined above, the severity and course of the disease, whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 15 mg\/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg\/kg) of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 \u03bcg\/kg to 100 mg\/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg of patient weight.","For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg\/kg, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg\/kg of the anti-ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.","Combination Therapy","A compound of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second compound having anti-cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen may have complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.","The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent, cytotoxic agent, cytokine, growth inhibitory agent, anti-hormonal agent, and\/or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin-forming inhibitor, a topoisomerase inhibitor, or a DNA binder.","Alternatively, or additionally, the second compound may be an antibody which binds ErbB2 and blocks ligand activation of an ErbB receptor. The second antibody may be monoclonal antibody 2C4 or humanized 2C4. The second antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent, e.g., a 1,8 bis-naphthalimide moiety. For example, it may be desirable to further provide antibodies which bind to EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, or vascular endothelial factor (VEGF) in the one formulation or dosing regimen. An exemplary combination therapy of the invention is a Formula I ADC and bevacizumab (Avastin\u2122, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.).","Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","In one embodiment, treatment with an ADC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein, and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents, including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents, optionally along with treatment with an anti-ErbB2 antibody, such as trastuzumab. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes (such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel) and\/or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed., M. C. Perry, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md. (1992).","The anticancer agent may be combined with an anti-hormonal compound; e.g., an anti-estrogen compound such as tamoxifen; an anti-progesterone such as onapristone (EP 616812); or an anti-androgen such as flutamide, in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer, the patient may previously have been subjected to anti-hormonal therapy and, after the cancer becomes hormone independent, the anti-ErbB2 antibody (and optionally other agents as described herein) may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant (to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy) or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes, the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and\/or radiation therapy.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e. serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","Metabolites of the Compounds","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically may be identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g. Cor H) ADC, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well-known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic.
