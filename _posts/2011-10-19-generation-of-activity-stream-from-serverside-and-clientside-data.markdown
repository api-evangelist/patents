title: Generation of activity stream from server-side and client-side data
abstract: In particular embodiments, the newsfeed is rendered to a particular user using the locally stored copy of the resource, instead of pulling it back from the server-side. Thus, a user may see his or her content even before it is completely uploaded to the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the user may interact with the content, for example, by adding comments, captions, “likes”, etc. to the content even before it has been completely uploaded to the social networking system. In this manner, the user is provided an increased feeling of responsiveness that is independent of the current wireless link condition.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to a social networking and mobile devices and, more particularly, to the generation of an activity stream utilizing content provided by a remote server in conjunction with content cached or queued for transmission on a client.","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a user profile, in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user's demographic information, communication channel information, and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user's relationship with other users in the social networking system (e.g., social graph), as well as provide services (e.g., wall-posts, photo-sharing, or instant messaging) to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a webpage, or a newsfeed, for a particular user, comprising the recent activities of the user's first-degree connections on the social network. Users utilizing mobile devices having data connections to the social networking system may upload photos or perform actions remotely that appear on his or her news feed when the content is completely uploaded to the social networking system.","Particular embodiments relate to a social networking system that includes features directed to automatically generating a newsfeed that includes both server-side content and content that is stored on a client at least some of which is queued for transmission to the social networking system stored on the client-side device. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.","The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process steps and\/or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition, while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments, it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary, the description is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.","A social networking system, such as a social networking website, enables its users to interact with it, and with each other through, the system. Typically, to become a registered user of a social networking system, an entity, either human or non-human, registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter, the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing, for example, a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein, a \u201cuser\u201d may be an individual (human user), an entity (e.g., an enterprise, business, or third party application), or a group (e.g., of individuals or entities) that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.","When a user registers for an account with a social networking system, the social networking system may create and store a record, often referred to as a \u201cuser profile\u201d, in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems, including the social networking system, relating to activities or actions of the user. For example, the user may provide his name, profile picture, contact information, birth date, gender, marital status, family status, employment, education background, preferences, interests, and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user's friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user's profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example, if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another, Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If, on the other hand, Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam's posted content items, but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob, a one-way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob's connection, but Bob is not Sam's connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections (e.g., friends of friends). Connections may be added explicitly by a user, for example, the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend, or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users (e.g., users who are alumni of the same educational institution). The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user's profile.","The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user (such as contact information and interests) at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example, when the user moves, or changes a phone number, he may update his contact information. Additionally, the user's interests may change as time passes, and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user's activities on the social networking system, such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system, may also provide information that may be included in the user's profile. Again, such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user's most-recent activities. Still further, other users or so-called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user's profile. For example, a contact may add the user as a friend (or remove the user as a friend). A contact may also write messages to the user's profile pages\u2014typically known as wall-posts. A user may also input status messages that get posted to the user's profile page.","A social network system may maintain social graph information, which can generally model the relationships among groups of individuals, and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition, the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.","A social networking system may support a variety of applications, such as photo sharing, on-line calendars and events. For example, the social networking system may also include media sharing capabilities. For example, the social networking system may allow users to post photographs and other multimedia files to a user's profile, such as in a wall post or in a photo album, both of which may be accessible to other users of the social networking system. Social networking system may also allow users to configure events. For example, a first user may configure an event with attributes including time and date of the event, location of the event and other users invited to the event. The invited users may receive invitations to the event and respond (such as by accepting the invitation or declining it). Furthermore, social networking system may allow users to maintain a personal calendar. Similarly to events, the calendar entries may include times, dates, locations and identities of other users.","The social networking system may also support a privacy model. A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third-party applications, or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third-party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third-party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example, a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user and\/or select settings that apply globally or to categories or types of user profile information. A privacy setting defines, or identifies, the set of entities (e.g., other users, connections of the user, friends of friends, or third party application) that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity, such as by specifying particular entities in the social network (e.g., other users), predefined groups of the user's connections, a particular type of connections, all of the user's connections, all first-degree connections of the user's connections, the entire social network, or even the entire Internet (e.g., to make the posted content item index-able and searchable on the Internet). A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally, a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.","Social networking system may maintain a database of information relating to geographic locations or places. Places may correspond to various physical locations, such as restaurants, bars, train stations, airports and the like. Some places may correspond to larger regions that themselves contain places\u2014such as a restaurant or a gate location in an airport. In one implementation, each place can be maintained as a hub node in a social graph or other data structure maintained by the social networking system, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/763,171, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. Social networking system may allow users to access information regarding each place using a client application (e.g., a browser) hosted by a wired or wireless station, such as a laptop, desktop or mobile device. For example, social networking system may serve web pages (or other structured documents) to users that request information about a place. In addition to user profile and place information, the social networking system may track or maintain other information about the user. For example, the social networking system may support geo-social networking system functionality including one or more location-based services that record the user's location. For example, users may access the geo-social networking system using a special-purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user (or a web- or network-based application using a browser client). The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System (GPS) or other geo-location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user's current location to the geo-social networking system. In addition, the client application may support geo-social networking functionality that allows users to check-in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. A check-in to a given place may occur when a user is physically located at a place and, using a mobile device, access the geo-social networking system to register the user's presence at the place. A user may select a place from a list of existing places near to the user's current location or create a new place. The user may also provide comments in a text string when checking in to a given place. The user may also identify one or more other users in connection with a check-in (such as friends of a user) and associate them with the check-in as well. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/574,614, which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes, describes a system that allows a first user to check-in other users at a given place. An entry including a comment and a time stamp corresponding to the time the user checked in may be displayed to other users. For example, a record of the user's check-in activity may be stored in a database. Social networking system may select one or more records associated with check-in activities of users at a given place and include such check-in activity in web pages (or other structured documents) that correspond to a given place. For example, social networking system may select the check-in activity associated with the, friends or other social contacts of a user that requests a page corresponding to a place. U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/858,718, incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes, describes an example geo-social networking system that can be used in connection with various embodiments of the present invention. The check-in activity may also be displayed on a user profile page and in news feeds provided to users of the social networking system.","In particular embodiments, the social networking system may provide a single webpage that displays the recent activity of the user's first-degree connections' actions on the social network. This type of view, also called a \u201cnews feed,\u201d allows a user of the social network to quickly view and access pertinent and temporally relevant information about his friends, interests, and pages the user has expressed an affinity to. The news feed, in particular embodiments, also includes story entries from the user's own actions on, and uploads to, the social networking system (such as status updates, wall posts, photo uploads, check-ins to a geo-social networking system). In particular embodiments, the stories in the news feed are organized chronologically. In particular embodiments, the stories in the news feed are organized based on a social relevancy score calculated by the social networking system.","In addition to geo-social functionality, the mobile device as described above may permit a user to remotely upload content, and perform other actions on the social network over a mobile data network. In particular embodiments, the user may, through his or her mobile device, upload photographs to the social networking system. The rate of upload is limited by the rate, quality, and coverage of the data connection of the mobile client device. In particular embodiments, the newsfeed is rendered to a particular user using the locally stored copy of the resource, instead of pulling it back from the server-side. Thus, a user may see his or her content even before it is completely uploaded to the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the user may interact with the content, for example, by adding comments, captions, \u201clikes\u201d, etc. to the content even before it has been completely uploaded to the social networking system. In this manner, the user is provided an increased feeling of responsiveness that is independent of the current wireless link condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","102","102","103","104","101","102","103","104","120","122","121","122","122","122","120","120","120","121","122"]},"In particular embodiments, location database  may store an information base of places, where each place includes a name, a geographic location and meta information (such as the user that initially created the place, reviews, comments, check-in activity data, and the like). Places may be created by administrators of the system and\/or created by users of the system. For example, a user may register a new place by accessing a client application to define a place name and provide a geographic location and cause the newly created place to be registered in location database . As discussed above, a created place may correspond to a hub node, which an administrator can claim for purposes of augmenting the information about the place and for creating ads or other offers to be delivered to users. In particular embodiments, system front end  may construct and serve a web page of a place, as requested by a user. In some embodiments, a web page of a place may include selectable components for a user to \u201clike\u201d the place, check in to the place, upload photos related to the place (in connection with a check-in or at a later time). In particular embodiments, location database  may store geo-location data identifying a real-world geographic location of a user associated with a check-in. For example, a geographic location of an Internet connected computer can be identified by the computer's IP address. For example, a geographic location of a cell phone equipped with cellular, Wi-Fi and\/or GPS capabilities can be identified by cell tower triangulation, Wi-Fi positioning, and\/or GPS positioning. In particular embodiments, location database  may store a geographic location and additional information of a plurality of places.","In particular embodiments, users may utilize client device  to upload content or perform actions on the social network, such as status updates, wall posts, check-ins, and the like. Typically, these actions must be transmitted through mobile data network  to system front end , after which, when the user requests a newsfeed, the social networking system generates a news feed solely from server-side content. Thus, any content or actions that have not been fully uploaded to the social networking system will not appear on a user's news feed, regardless of when the user initiated the upload. Upload times may be delayed significantly due to the state of the user's mobile wireless data link. For example, if a user desires to upload a photo while traveling, and the data connection is interrupted, the user will be unable to write a caption or comment on the photo until it is fully uploaded. In particular embodiments, the client device itself may decide to queue one or more of the activities for upload at a later time in order to, for example, conserve battery life.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":"122"},"At Step , the user of client device  chooses to view his or her news feed. In one implementation, the news feed may be embedded in a web page or any other suitable structured document that a client application can consume, parse and\/or render. In particular embodiments, the user does this by invoking a specialized application, such as \u201cFacebook for Android\u201d, on client device . In particular embodiments, the client application utilizes a browser engine (e.g., WebKit, etc.) to access a remote host associated with the social networking website, for example, www.facebook.com. In particular embodiments, the user may utilize a specialized mobile WAP browser to access a mobile version of the social networking website, such as m.facebook.com or touch.facebook.com. In particular embodiments, the browser application on client device  includes an application programming interface that connects to the social networking website, regardless of the address requested by the user, for example, Rockmelt for iPhone. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of initiating a request to view a news feed. While this disclosure describes the generation of a newsfeed, a news feed is not required. The requested page may be any sort of web page, such as a photo gallery, forum, calendar, or message board. This disclosure contemplates any suitable web content that incorporates both server side and client side data to be uploaded to the server.","At Step , the server receives the request from client device  to view the user's newsfeed. In particular embodiments, the request includes the social network user identifier (UID) of the user associated with client device . In one implementation, the social network user identifier may be contained in a browser cookie appended to the request. In other implementations, the UID may be a parameter encoded in a URI string. In particular embodiments, the request includes authentication information to prevent unauthorized access. In particular embodiments, the server will only respond to a request after the user has performed an authentication procedure such as logging in. In some implementations, access tokens can be embedded in browser cookies upon successful authentication. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of identifying a specific social network UID for a given request.","At Step , the social networking system begins to generate a webpage representing the newsfeed for the requesting user. The webpage may be generated as HTML, XML, JavaScript, XHTML, or any other suitable markup language. The web page may be generated by system front end , a dedicated newsfeed generation application residing on one or more servers of the social networking system, a web server, or any other software application module residing on one or more servers of the social networking system. The web page created in Step  includes an embedded script (for example, a JavaScript having a .js file extension) that interacts with the local java interface of client device . Although this disclosure describes an embedded JavaScript object, in particular embodiments, the embedded object may be any scripting language or subset of JavaScript, such as AJAX, Action Script, CoffeScript, JScript, ASP, or VBScript.","At Step , the social networking system pulls entries from the server database to populate the web page representing the requesting user's newsfeed. In particular embodiments, the content may be pulled from an aggregate dynamic activity stream of all users maintained by the social network. In particular embodiments, stories or entries from the activity stream are matched against privacy policy DB  before insertion into the generated webpage. In this manner, the user is not allowed to view any content or activities from dynamic activity stream from users who have designated the user should not see. In particular embodiments, the server pulls content and activities directly from user profile DB , event DB , and location DB , subject to privacy policies stored in privacy policy DB . In particular embodiments, recent actions from the requesting user's first-degree contacts are inserted into the news feed. In particular embodiments, updates from hub pages, businesses, and other entities that the user has \u201cliked\u201d or otherwise expressed an affinity toward are inserted into the website generated in response to the user's newsfeed request. In particular embodiments, the user may specify newsfeed settings designating particular users, applications, or other entities whose stories should not be displayed. Further description of news feed generation may be found in the commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,669,123, titled, \u201cDynamically providing a news feed about a user of a social network,\u201d herein fully incorporated by reference in this disclosure. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of generating and managing the content of a particular user news feed.","At Step , server front end  transmits the generated web page representing the requesting user's news feed to client device  over network . Network  may comprise a plurality of different networks of varying transmission media, such as a wired fiber network and a wireless cellular network. In particular embodiments, system front end  transmits the webpage over a secure tunnel, such as a secure socket layer (SSL) tunnel or virtual private network (VPN) tunnel. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of transmitting the generated newsfeed to client device . The transmitted webpage includes both the server-side stories pulled from the social networking system's dynamic activity stream or individual DBs -, as well as the embedded script described above.","At Step , client device  receives the transmitted web page representing the requesting user's newsfeed. In particular embodiments, the JavaScript object embedded in the transmitted web page invokes a call to the local Java interface to pull client-side stories or actions in local DB . As previously explained, local DB  stores an activity stream of user content and actions that have not been fully uploaded to the social networking system. For example, if a user had previously initiated the upload of a photo and then immediately requested to view his or her newsfeed, at Step  the local Java interface requests the stream stories stored in local DB  to display the photo story in the user's newsfeed as if it had been uploaded instantaneously. In particular embodiments, the embedded JavaScript may be invoked by an onLoad, onClick, or other event, so that new client-side content may be pulled into the news feed any time the page is reloaded, or any time a user clicks a link. Although this paragraph describes a Java interface, this disclosure contemplates any suitable means of pulling local data for rendering. In particular embodiments, the transmitted web page utilizes a browser API extension to pull client-side stories or actions in local DB . In particular embodiments, the transmitted web page utilizes a URL callback to pull client-side stories or actions in local DB .","At Step , the local Java interface retrieves the locally stored stream stories and actions from local DB . In particular embodiments, local DB  stores a copy of the content to be uploaded or in the process of being uploaded to the social network. For example, if a photo is stored on local storage of client device  separate from local DB , an exact or modified copy of the photo is stored in local DB . In particular embodiments, local DB  stores a stream story in accordance with a predetermined format specified by the social network and a pointer to the content, for example, a pointer or link to the photo in client device 's photo storage memory. In particular embodiments, actions on content to be uploaded is also stored in local DB . For example, a user may include comments, captions, or \u201clikes\u201d on any given piece of content to be uploaded. In particular embodiments, these actions are stored along with a link or pointer to the content in local DB . Alternatively, the actions may be stored along with an exact or modified copy of the unuploaded content in local DB . This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of storing content and actions, or pointers thereto, in local DB .","In Step , the social networking application on client device  renders the received webpage including the stories pulled from local DB . As previously discussed, the social networking application may be a specialized social networking application, a standard internet browser, a lightweight mobile WAP browser, or a specialized browser interfacing with the social networking system. The application displays the newsfeed to the requesting user as if the stories and the content in local DB  were instantly uploaded to the social networking system, even if they have not completed, or even begun, uploading to the social networking system. In particular embodiments, the social networking system arranges the server-side and client-side stories in chronological order. In particular embodiments, they are displayed based on a relevance score. In particular embodiments, the relevance score is calculated based on a coefficient score between the user and the user generating the story. The coefficient score may take into account the degree of interaction between the two users, their similarity, their geographic proximity, and their affinities. This disclosure contemplates any suitable manner of organizing the ordering of stories in the received news feed.","In particular embodiments, the application on client device  rendering the news feed includes an upload progress indicator below each story or piece of content currently being uploaded. In particular embodiments, the progress indicator is a progress bar. In particular embodiments, it is expressed as a numerical percentage. In particular embodiments, the user is provided a set of visual controls permitting the user to pause or cancel the upload. For example, if a user uploads a set of photos from a foreign country where his or her client device  lacks a data connection, and later decides not to upload one or more of the photos, he or she may select a \u201ccancel\u201d option to prevent the content from ever reaching the social networking system servers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300","301","306","300","302","303","304","305","303","305","122","303","305","302","301","306"]},"In particular embodiments, photos - may have progress indicators , , and , respectively. Progress indicators graphically or numerically display the upload progress of a particular piece of client-side content. Whereas textual content, such as comments, \u201clikes\u201d, and check-ins, is uploaded fairly quickly, photos and videos take a substantial amount of time to upload, particularly where the mobile data connection is slow. Thus, the user may upload a photo, and at any time, request a view of his or her news feed and see a photo story such as  before the photo is actually uploaded to the social networking system's servers. The user may also interact with the content by using the comment button  or the \u201clike\u201d button . Thus, the user perceives the upload to be substantially in real-time; the moment he or she decides to upload content, the user may interact with it as if it were already existing on the server. Thus, the disclosed embodiments enhance user experience by masking delays in the uploading of content or other interactions by displaying a rendered representation of the locally stored data in connection with the server side content. Additionally, reloading a web page representation of a newsfeed may cause the embedded script to retrieve additional content from the client side. Such an invention gives the perception of instanteous, real-time uploading of content and interactions.","In particular embodiments, newsfeed  includes, for photos -, pause button  and cancel button . This permits a user to pause or cancel the upload of a piece of content. For example, a user may inadvertently upload an incriminating photo. At any time during the upload process, the user may cancel the photo through cancel button  to prevent the file from ever reaching the social networking system's servers. Therefore, in particular embodiments, the invention enhances the user experience by removing delays in uploading content or other interactions via the display of a rendered representation of the locally stored data in connection with the server side content. Additionally, a \u201creload page\u201d may cause the javascript or requested webpage to retrieve additional content from client side prior to its upload to the server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400","400","400","400","400","400","400"]},"In particular embodiments, computer system  includes a processor , memory , storage , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , a communication interface , and a bus .
