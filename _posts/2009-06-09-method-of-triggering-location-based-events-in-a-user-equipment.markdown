{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention relates to methods and components, such as UEs (user equipment), server hosts, client applications, server computer programs and computer program products. These methods and components can be utilized by e.g. an LBS (Location Based Service).","LBS are becoming more and more popular in mobile stations. These services are typically based on three different positioning technologies: GPS (Global Positioning System), position triangulation with the help of RBS:s (radio base stations) and positioning with the help of communications network cell-ID (cell identity or cell name\/number), where the cell-ID typically is a unique number of a cell of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)\/UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System)\/LTE (Long Term Evolution) for a given operator. Each positioning technology has advantages and disadvantages. GPS gives a relatively exact position under favourable conditions, but requires dedicated hardware, i.e. a GPS receiver circuit, on the client side and is generally not working indoors or in tunnels. Network Cell-ID based positioning, where a mobile station knows which network cell in the mobile communications network it is closest to, generally requires no extra hardware. However a database of mappings between network cell-IDs and a geographical area is needed. In comparison with GPS, positioning systems that utilize network cell-IDs typically does not give as high positioning accuracy and the database needs to be created and updated, which could be especially cumbersome if the database owner is not the network owner\/operator. Triangulation with the help of RBS:s typically gives a better accuracy, but far from the accuracy typically given through GPS and requires support from the network owner\/operator.","There exist a lot of different applications exploiting positioning systems and a common feature is POIs (points of interest). This feature basically means that certain attractions that are considered to be of interest to a user are displayed on a map in a UE, such as a navigation system in a vehicle or a mobile station. For instance, modern navigation systems for vehicles are typically adapted to show on a displayed map area all gas stations as small gas pump icons. Another beneficial functionality of LBS is the possibility to trigger events\/actions based on the location of the UE. A problem when implementing this kind of functionality is that the UE should constantly be aware of its location in order to trigger events. To know its position the UE must either utilize GPS technology or any other satellite based positioning system, such as GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and GALILEO, or make frequent connections to a server in order to either lookup its current network Cell-ID in a database of Network Cell-IDs mapped to geographic positions or request to be positioned by a radio base triangulation service. As stated before, GPS technology does not work appropriately indoors and frequent connections to a network server demands network- and UE capacity. Furthermore the battery powering the UE is discharged faster.","WO-2007\/051223-A1 discloses a system which may enable service differentiation based on current location. For example, if a mobile station subscriber is in a home zone, which may be a smaller zone than a network cell, the tariffs of services utilized by the mobile station may be smaller than if the subscriber is outside the home zone. According to the system a zone may be stored in a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card, which in practice makes the system rely on integration with an operator network.","It is an object of the invention to enable a way or components for the way, which may decrease the energy consumption for a service, e.g. LBS, for activating actions based on the position of the UE.","It is another object of the invention to enable a way for activating actions, e.g. LBS, without revealing the position of the UE.","A first aspect of the invention relates to a method performed by a UE. The method comprises the steps of:\n\n","Hereby is achieved that cell-identities, such as those relating to POI:s for a specific LBS can be saved in the UE and compared in the UE with a current network cell-identity without contacting an LBS server every time the UE needs to check on whether there are POI:s in the current network cell.","The method may comprise the step of requesting the at least one network cell-identity before receiving the at least one network cell identity from the first server host. Hereby is achieved that the UE can request updates of network cell-identities when it is appropriate and thereby enable a designer of a service to strike the right balance between an updated database in the UE and the number of cell-ID updates being sent to the UE and the first server host.","The method may comprise the steps of:\n\n","Hereby is achieved that also content associated with e.g. POI:s in a certain network cell is stored in the database. Thus the UE does not have to request another entity for at least that content. Provided that the UE enters a network cell with a network cell-identity and associated content stored in the database, this saves communication energy and reduces response times for the service, thus leading to improved user satisfaction.","The method may comprise the step of requesting further content from the first server host or a second server host based on the content associated with one of the network cell-identities stored in the database. This enables a designer of an LBS to strike the right balance between downloading and possibly storing of the content in the database in advance and retrieval of the further content more on-demand. The further content may typically have a larger file size than the content stored in the database, but it may of course depend on the service. In a future scenario where UE:s are expected to have much larger memory capacity, the UE:s may be preconfigured for LBS:s and already have a lot of content stored in the database already when the UE is purchased by a consumer.","The method may comprise the step of, if the current network cell-identity is the same as at least one network cell identity stored in the database, checking if the content or further content associated with the current network cell-identity has previously been used for alerting a user of the UE.","The method may comprise the step of displaying a message or an icon on a display of the UE, said message or icon corresponding to the content or further content associated with the current network cell-identity.","A second aspect of the invention relates to a client application comprising computer readable code means which when run on a UE causes the UE to:\n\n","A third aspect of the invention relates to a computer program product comprising computer readable means and the client application, which is stored on the computer readable means.","A fourth aspect of the invention relates to a method performed by a UE.

This enables the developer to define a geographic position or area in which the mobile device should alert the application to perform a specific action if the user enters that position\/area.","In a UE equipped with a GPS support for JSR 293's proximity events is trivial since the mobile device knows its position. However in a device without a GPS receiver an alternative method of positioning must be used (as described above).","It might be also be good to use cell-id based proximity events even in the case where the UE  has GPS support.

However, although not shown in any figure, the means and the timer function  illustrated in  may also be enabled\/implemented at least partly by special hardware circuits such as ASICs (Application Specific integrated Circuits).","An embodiment of the invention involves three basic activities:\n\n","According to an embodiment of the UE  comprising the client application , the UE  comprises the following features:\n\n","An embodiment of a system implementation of the invention will now be described in more detail in conjunction with . First a mechanism to update the client application  with a data structure holding the information about which Network Cell-IDs that are associated with POIs is needed. In a first step S an update of information to be sent from the first server host  to the UE  is triggered. The triggering can according to the invention be performed in different ways, e.g. the client application , which may \u2018run in the background\u2019 of the UE , may as in the case of , be adapted to cause the UE  to at regular time intervals trigger an update of information. This can be done by incorporation of a second timer function  in the client application . Alternatively or in addition thereto the UE  may be caused to trigger the update by manual initiation by the user via the client application , i.e. the client application  may have a module\/feature which allows the user of the UE  to initiate an update by e.g. pushing a physical or virtually displayed button of the inputting means .","In a second step S, the client application  causes the UE  to fetch the information from the first server host  with the request message , e.g. an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Get message to get a hashtable.","In a third step S, the first server host  receives the request message  and in its turn send a request for personalized information, e.g. a customized\/personalized hashtable for a certain UE\/user, from the server database . The server database , which may be an SQL database, comprises a \u201ccomplete\u201d set of network cell-IDs and associated\/mapped POIs, i.e. preferably more network cell-IDs and associated\/mapped POI than being stored in the database , and in a fourth step S returns the requested personalized information, e.g. as a customized hashtable including network cell-IDs. In , the first server host  and the server database  has been illustrated as being comprised in different hosts, the first server host  and the database host  respectively, but the embodiment according to the steps above of course comprises embodiments where the server computer program  and the server database  are comprised in the same host. Also, the first server host  and the database host  may together be seen as the same node in a network node architecture and in that respect the first server host  and the database host  respectively may not be single devices\/computers, but may of course be a server cluster\/farm that share the workload and is working as one node as seen from the other nodes that may communicate with the server cluster.","The personalized information and customized hashtable may be generated, stored and retrieved in different ways known to a person skilled in the art. It is a general task which of course is dependent on the LBS that can utilize the invention. However, three examples will be mentioned in the following:","In an embodiment A, the service is to give users of the service information from different shops. In such a service the user can select, e.g. via the UE  or via an interface of a second UE (not shown), such as a PC at home, from which shops he\/she would like to receive information. The selected shops are stored as relations\/associations\/edges\/links between the user and the selected shops in the server database . When the UE  starts to use the service or wants to update the database , due to e.g. the addition of yet another single shop or multiple shops, the first server host , via the lookup means  in the first server host , retrieves all the shops that the user has selected and build a table\/list comprising associated network-cell ID:s for the shops. In other words, multiple stores, i.e. more than one retail enterprise under the same ownership or management, are associated with network cell-IDs. Those network cell-IDs are chosen by the first server host  dependent on the home network operator used by the UE .","B: Another way is to let the users of an LBS answer a number of questions when they subscribe to the LBS and then, based on the answers to the questions, generate user preference values and connect these preference values with e.g. related shops. Each shop may then be associated with one or more than one preference. Nevertheless, the end result is the same as in the above embodiment A: a connection between shops and users\/UEs is established.","C: A third conceivable example is to utilize a machine-learning function comprised in e.g. the first server host  and calculate connections\/associations between users and shops based on stored electronic tracks or actions, which can be stored in log files, that the user\/UE  or any apparatus of a service provider generates, such as visited web pages, sent e-mails or e-mail addresses in contacts database, called telephone numbers, electronic social network connections and positioning data.","In a fifth step S the first server host  receives and forwards the personalized information to the UE . This can, for example be accomplished by pushing a file with the personalized information to the UE  or sending the personalized information in one or more messages, such as USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), one or more SMS (Short Message Service) messages or MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages addressed to the client application . Thus, preferably, the messages addressed to the client application  should not be stored and displayed in an inbox folder for messages intended to be displayed to the user, i.e. not in a typical \u201cmessages application for a user\u201d with an inbox and outbox for SMS etc.","In a sixth step S the UE  receives the personalized information and updates the database  with the personalized information. After that a confirmation message that the update has been performed may be generated for an internal log file of the client application  and\/or as a visual message displayed on the display  for the user. The latter message can be advantageous as a response to a manually initiated update. The confirmation message may comprise information not only of the update itself, but also how many records that has been inserted, updated, deleted etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0208"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["3","2","1","14","14","11","3"]},"In a second step S, the first server host  sends a WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) push message to the UE , wherein the WAP push message indicate to the client application  that there is updated information to be retrieved from the first server host , e.g. by including a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to the first server host . Hereby the first server host  makes it possible for the UE  to always have updated, cached network Cell-ID information. The use of a URL in the message could be advantageous in the case where the service require relatively much information to be downloaded.","In a third step S, the UE  sends an update request to the first server host  in the same way as described with respect to S. Optionally, if the received WAP push message comprises a URL or require relatively much data to be downloaded from the first server host , the displaying means  may cause the UE  to display an update question to the user and wait for a confirmation before sending the update request.

If it is determined that a subscriber to the service should be sent updated information, the server in a third step S request updated information based on the subscriber\/user\/UE profile from the server database , e.g. in the same way as described with respect to step S above. A fourth step S corresponds to step S, a fifth step S corresponds to the steps S and S and a sixth step S corresponds to the steps S and S.","Although shown as three separate embodiments, yet other embodiments of a system according to the invention may have the feature of all or any combination of the triggering alternatives disclosed in the description. In other words embodiments may comprise both trigger events triggered in the UE  or in the first server host , or even by another computer connected to the first server host for e.g. administering the service, profiles and updating the database. Regarding the triggering by the timer function  or the first timer function , embodiments of the invention may comprise the feature of having a counting function to determine how long the UE  has been in one network cell. If the UE  is determined to have been in one network cell longer than a predetermined time, the timer counter for triggering the update request can be extended (set to a larger value than the current value), so that update requests are triggered with longer time intervals if the UE  is relatively stationary in comparison with a UE that frequently is moved around in different geographical areas.","The UE  needs to \u201cconstantly\u201d, i.e. at predetermined time intervals or by continuously running a checking loop, check if the UE  has moved to another geographical position which is associated with a new network cell-ID. This can be accomplished by looking up\/searching for the current network cell-ID in the database , which as stated above may be a hash table containing network cell-IDs as keys and their associated POIs as values. An embodiment of this will be described more in detail in conjunction with .","In a first step U shown in  a network cell-ID correspondence check is triggered, here, as an example only, by the timer function .","In a second step U the client application  causes the UE  to obtain the current network cell-ID by checking the current network cell-ID, i.e. the network cell-ID of the cell with which the UE  is associated, which usually is the network cell-ID of an RBS with which the UE  has or is allowed to have the strongest communication connection with in case the UE  may have the possibility to receive signals from more than one RBS. The network cell-ID of the current network cell  can be retrieved and stored in the UE  via a so-called Cell search, which is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency synchronization with a cell and detects the cell-ID of that cell in e.g. UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and E-UTRAN.","In a third step U, the client application  causes the UE  to search the database  for the current network cell-ID obtained in the second step U. The database  may comprise at least one lookup table, which may be implemented in a number of different ways. If the client application  is implemented as a Java ME (Micro Edition) Midlet a suitable data structure would be a hashtable. The hashtable would preferably have network cell-IDs as key and the POI:s as associated values. The hashtable may also store information, e.g. in the form of a true or false flag, whether a user has been alarmed already about a POI before. This \u201calarmed already information\u201d may in the hashtable also be associated with a time stamp. If this \u201calarmed already information\u201d is stored, the client application  comprises marking means\/routine  that updates such information in the hashtable once a POI message (displayed and\/or audio message and\/or a signal to another application in the UE  or even another device for triggering of a UE external action) has been generated or initiated by the UE , optionally with associated time stamps indicating the time when the POI message was generated or initiated. The client application  may also comprise means configured to cause the UE  to change or reset the \u201calarmed already information\u201d to \u201cfalse\u201d (or something with the equivalent function known in the art) if a certain time has passed by comparing a current time with the time stamps at regular time intervals. This certain time may be set either by the service provider or alternatively or in addition thereto by the user via a GUI (graphical user interface) displayed by the UE . The client application  here also comprises the checking means  which adapts the UE  to check whether a POI message already has been generated or initiated for a certain network cell-ID\/POI. Through the \u201calarmed already information\u201d the client application  is able to avoid that the user is alarmed twice about the same POI, at least within the certain time mention above.","By letting the database  comprise a hashtable the data structure would be appropriate for lookups based on a network cell-ID. Network cell-IDs may exist in different formats depending on if an RBS belongs to e.g. a GSM network, 3G\/UMTS network and LTE network. A GSM network cell-ID contains 4 hexadecimal numbers, e.g. 07ed, and a 3G network cell-ID contains 8 hexadecimal numbers, e.g. 0015066a. However, as will be discussed more in detail further down in conjunction with , this \u201clocal\u201d or network operator dependent cell-ID name may for some embodiments and LBS:s not be enough to clearly, i.e. collision-free, distinguish one network cell from another. In other words the definition of a network cell-ID according to this invention does not only comprise the 4 hexadecimal numbers of a GSM network cell-ID or the 8 hexadecimal number of a 3G network, but any data used to identify network cells and comprising the \u201clocal\u201d network cell-ID name.","The kind of content  that the hashtable will tie to the network cell-IDs respectively, can depend on the nature of the service that utilizes the invention. As an example, a common content type could be a URL pointing to more information about a POI. This is illustrated in table 1 below, where \u201cVISITED\u201d is a column for information\/data related to whether the visited site\/file\/media corresponding to the associated URL has been displayed before or relatively recently or whether information about that site has been displayed before or relatively recently.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0220"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"CELL_ID (key)","CONTENT (value)","VISITED"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0015066a","http:\/\/localhost\/image.jpg","false"]},{"entry":[{},"0015066a","http:\/\/localhost\/text.html","true"]},{"entry":[{},"07ed","http:\/\/localhost\/video.mpg","true"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In the example described above in Table 1 any content , such as text, images, sound, and video can be connected to the POI. This is interesting for services associating rich media to the POI. On the other hand there are other services that associate relatively little information to each POI, such as a short text or an icon for a POI category, typically POI category formats for vehicle navigation systems. In services of the latter example, the client application \/service could actually store all available information about the POI in the actual lookup table in the UE . Then the format of the lookup table would not store a URL, instead the table and the format could look like in Table 2 below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0123","num":"0222"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"CELL_ID (key)","CONTENT (value)","VISITED"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"0015066a","Gas Station","false"]},{"entry":[{},"0015066a","Hotel","true"]},{"entry":[{},"07ed","Museum","true"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Since a subscriber of a specific operator only will access RBS:s from that specific operator (if roaming and mixed networks are excluded) the list of Network Cell-IDs sent to the UE  can be optimized by the server side by only including Network Cell-IDs belonging to the home network of the operator of the UE . This also means that it will be necessary for the server side of the system to keep multiple network cell-IDs for each POI, in order to guarantee that mobile subscribers from different operators can access the information.","The searched\/looked up cell-ID may be found in the database  or may not be found in the database . If not found the client application  in a fourth step U determines that the current network cell-ID is not found and in a fifth step U set a new timer and go back to a sleeping mode.","In case the current network cell-ID is found in the database  the client application  in a sixth step U retrieves the content  associated with the current network cell-ID in the database  provided that it is not indicated that the content  shall not be disclosed (since it may have been displayed previously). If the database  comprises content  in the form of URLs as illustrated in Table 1, the associated URL is retrieved from the database , for some embodiments provided that \u201cVISITED\u201d is not \u201ctrue\u201d.","In a seventh step U, provided that the content  comprises a URL, the client application  causes the UE  to request further content  from the first server host , the second server host  or any other server associated with the received URL.","In an eighth step U, the first server host , the second server host  or another server send the requested further content  to the UE , which receives the further content .","In a ninth step U the client application  causes the UE  to display the content  received from the database  and\/or the further content  received from the first server host , the second server host  or another server associated with the URL received from the database .","The embodiments above described in conjunction with  have substantially been described with the database  containing the content  and that the content  is sent from the first server host . However, in other embodiments the content  does not necessarily have to be stored in the UE  or be sent from the first server host . Furthermore, the network cell-ID:s from the server database  are sent openly from the first server host  to the UE  in the embodiments illustrated in . The latter may cause security problem, especially in the case where a predefined geographical area is sent in a request to the first server host  and cell-IDs are sent openly in response to the predefined geographical area. By sending the information about the location of the network cells, the cell-ID data is exposed and can be stored by a malicious user. This would increase the risk of someone gradually stealing the cell-id data and building their own cell-id database.","Therefore according to different embodiments of the invention, proximity alerts, i.e. Cell-ID Driven alarms, as a service is provided by providing an open API (application programming interface) where applications wanting to download information about which cells to trigger events on can request cell-ids of cells covering a geographical coordinate and download cryptographically hashed values, e.g. hashed values, of those cell-ids for storing in the database  instead of \u201cplain\u201d network cell-ID:s. The client application  can then hash the obtained current network cell ID cell-ids according to the same hash function and detect when matching cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0231"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["11","3","1","2","11"]},"In a first step V, a client application implemented in J2ME\u2122 needs to subscribe to events triggered by an occasion where the UE  is in predefined vicinity, which is the choice of an LBS provider, of the coordinates: latitude=59.19434 and longitude=18.4196 (Stockholm city centre). The coordinates can be obtained by the UE  in a number of ways, e.g. inserted manually via a GUI of the client application  or retrieved more or less automatically via an API. One way is that the user of the UE  look at an announcement provided by a shop, said announcement having the geographical coordinates explicitly stated thereon and then input the geographical coordinates via a GUI. Another way is for the user to simply ask for the geographical coordinates when he\/she visits the shop or makes this request via a web-service having a database with postal addresses mapped to their corresponding geographical coordinates. Yet another way is that the UE  is provided with the GPS receiver circuit  and that the GPS receiver is turned on to retrieve the geographical coordinates and then turned off to save energy. One possible scenario within the scope of this \u201cGPS-way\u201d is that a user is standing on a balcony or roof of a house, where he\/she can receive signals from GPS satellites with the UE  and wants a location based action\/application\/service to start when he\/she enters the house. Such an action could even be to turn off the GPS receiver, since the GPS signals from GPS satellites are generally too weak or too inaccurate to be relied upon when the UE  is inside the house. Still another way to obtain the geographical coordinates is, if the UE  comprises an NFC (Near field communication) tag reader (not shown), to read an NFC tag provided with data comprising the geographical coordinates or, e.g. a link to a site where certain geographical coordinates can be retrieved.","In a second step V, the client application  via the UE  sends the request message , e.g. via HTTP WAP, to the first server host . The service could be that the client application  shall see to that the UE  receive an advertisement when the user is in an area near the coordinates.","In a third step V, the lookup means  causes the first server host  to send a lookup request to the database host  for matching the geographical coordinates received from the UE  to at least one network cell-id and receives cell-id:s that cover the position associated with the geographical coordinates. The server database  comprises network cell-ID:s mapped to geographical coordinates for this purpose. Similarly to previously described embodiments, although the server database  here is stored in the database host , the server database  may in other embodiments be stored in the first server host .","In a fourth step V, a lookup in the server database  is made in order to retrieve at least one matching cell-ID for a cell that covers the geographical coordinates received in the request from the first server host .","In a fifth step V at least one matching cell-ID is sent from the server database  to the first server host , in this embodiment exemplified by two network cell-id:s:\n\n","In a sixth step V, the first server host  determine, either implicitly by receiving the two cell-ids from the cell-id database  or explicitly by e.g. checking the validity of the two received cell-ids by comparing them to cell-id:s in a second cell-id database (not shown). Also, in order to save bandwidth when subsequently communicating with the UE , some numbers in the cell-ID name determined as unnecessary may be removed. In this case \u201c000\u201d in the local names of the two examples a and b, thus becoming:\n\n","In another embodiment, the removal of \u201c000\u201d may already have been made by the database host  before sending the lookup answer to the first service host  in the fifth step V.","In a seventh step V the first server host  concatenates the received cell information\/ID:s into one string for each cell-id. In other words all received parameters for each cell-ID are added to each other, the result being in this example:\n\n","In order to decrease the possibility of cell-ID collision, a delimiter between the mnc, mcc, lac and cellid may optionally be introduced, resulting in:\n\n","In an eighth step V the two strings are cryptographically hashed using e.g. a cryptographic hash function such as MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) with a 128-bit hash value typically expressed as a 32 digit hexadecimal number. The MD5 is as such known via RFC 1321 and therefore not explained more in detail. The two resulting cryptographically hashed strings are in this example:\n\n","In a ninth step V the cryptographically hashed strings are sent from the first server host  to the client application  of the UE .","In a tenth step V the cryptographically hashed strings are stored in the database . In an eleventh step V, the UE  obtains the current network cell-id.","In a twelfth step V, the client application  causes the UE  to concatenate the cell-Id of the current network cell  in the same way as was done by the first server host  in the seventh step V.","In a thirteenth step V  the client application  causes the UE  to hash the concatenated cell-Id of the current network cell  using the same cryptographic hash function as used in the eighth step V. The hashed concatenated cell-IDs may in one embodiment be stored in a second UE database (not shown) in the UE , but in another be deleted once a fourteenth step V has been performed.","In the fourteenth step V the client application  retrieves the two resulting cryptographically hashed strings stored in the database  in the tenth step V  and compare these two strings, and other strings already having been stored before the two strings, in the database  with the cryptographically hashed concatenated cell-ID of the current network cell  as generated in the thirteenth step V. If it is detected that some of the values, here in the form of hash values, are identical, an event is triggered in a fifteenth step V, in this example downloading the content  in the form of an advertisement to the UE , which is illustrated in  with a sixteenth step V of requesting the advertisement from a server entity, which may be the second server host  or the first server host  and in a seventeenth step V receiving the advertisement from that server.","Although the JSR 179 and JSR 293 are very well suited frameworks for an implementation of this embodiment, they are only examples. The mechanism described herein could be implemented using any mobile development environment that can read the current cell-id and communicate with the first server host .","Three exemplary use cases for the invention will now be described. In a first exemplary use case, where a service which advertisers, such as owners of stores and restaurants, can use to advertise information about their business and where the users of the service can find information about the advertisers' businesses marked on a map. In such a service, one functionality could be to let users subscribe to information about certain businesses in order to have information sent to the user's mobile phone when the user is close to the location of the business. The following use case is in one embodiment of the invention part of such a service.\n\n","The second exemplary use case considers a navigation system\/service for vehicles. Users can use this navigation system to receive notifications when they are in a geographical area with high way speed cameras. The following use case is a part of such a service.\n\n","There are of course several other vehicle associated LBS that could utilize the invention. For example, if the UE  is connected to a vehicle internal network, it could, upon determination that a current network cell-ID corresponds to a network cell-ID in the database , send a message to a node in the vehicle internal network, which causes the node to initiate an action in the vehicle, such as: alerting the driver by e.g. an audio message through loudspeakers in the vehicle  or a visual alert on the dashboard;","adjust a speed limiter so that the maximum possible speed of the vehicle is decreased or increased;","adjust the engine  of the vehicle  in order to affect e.g. noise and pollution;","adjust parameters in an automatic gearbox computer  such that e.g. the gears are shifted at different engine speeds than before the adjustment; and","adjust the belly clearance of the vehicle .","The UE  can connect to a node of the vehicle internal network via a USB (Universal Serial Bus) or a Firewire interface known in the art or wirelessly via e.g. Bluetooth or UPnP. Alternatively the UE  may be an embedded telematics unit in the vehicle  that always is connected to the vehicle internal network via e.g. CAN (Controller Area Network) bus and a FlexRay bus.","The third exemplary use case is a service which users can use to automatically report their current location to a system (or other users) when they are in certain predetermined areas. Such a service could, for instance, be used by a taxi company to keep track of when their taxis are getting close to a location, e.g. an airport, and will soon be free to pick up new passengers. The following use case could be part of such a service.\n\n","To sum up, having described some embodiments of the invention, several advantages of the invention or embodiments of the invention should be apparent, such as:\n\n","To further sum up,  show flow diagrams for an embodiment within the scope of the first aspect and the second aspect respectively of the invention.
