title: System and method for assessing TV-related information over the internet
abstract: The system retrieves information from the internet using multiple search engines that are simultaneously launched by the search engine commander. The commander is responsive to a speech-enabled system including a speech recognizer and natural language parser. The user speaks to the system in natural language requests, and the parser extracts the semantic content from the user's speech, based on a set of goal oriented grammars. The preferred system includes a fixed grammar and an updatable or downloaded grammar, allowing the system to be used without extensive training and yet capable of being customized for a particular user's purposes. Results obtained from the search engines are filtered based on information extracted from an electronic program guide and from prestored user profile data. The results may be displayed on screen or through synthesized speech.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to interactive television and information retrieval. More particularly, the invention relates to a speech-enabled system whereby a users spoken requests for information are recognized, parsed and supplied to a search engine for retrieving information pertinent to the user's request.","The number and variety of TV programs available to viewers is growing rapidly. Thus viewers require a rapid, user-friendly way of searching for broadcasts that suit their tastes and needs. Much information about TV programs is available on various Internet sites, but access to those sites requires logging onto a computer and typing in key words.","Ideally, the user would like to be able to obtain information from Internet sites while he or she is using the television, by making spoken requests to the television and having it obtain the requested information. Thus a user could simply tell the television what he or she wants to see: \u201cShow me any international water polo event\u201d, for example, and the TV would access the Internet to find out when and on what channel such a program is broadcast. Using the information as downloaded, the TV would also be able to answer questions about the broadcast such as \u201cWhat teams are playing?\u201d","By way of further example, the user, viewing a particular program about mountain climbing, might want more information about the tallest mountain peaks and when they were first climbed. The user would like to be able to ask the television to find answers to these questions and then display the results on screen or through synthesized spoken response.","Unfortunately, this type of sophisticated interaction with the television has not been possible. The present invention breaks new ground in this regard. The invention provides a speech recognition system with associated language parser that will extract the semantic content or meaning from a user's spoken command or inquiry, and formulate a search request suitable for supplying to one or more internet search engines. The parser contains a reconfigurable grammar by which it can understand the meaning of a users spoken request within a given context. The grammar itself may be reconfigured via the Internet, based on knowledge of what the user is currently viewing. This knowledge may be supplied by electronic program guide or as part of the digital television data stream.","The results obtained from the search engines may be further analyzed by the parser, to select the most likely candidates that respond to the users original inquiry. These results are then provided to the user on screen or through synthesized speech, or both.","For a more complete understanding of the invention, its objects and advantages, refer to the following specification and to the accompanying drawings.","Referring to , a presently preferred embodiment of the speech-enabled information access system comprises a speech recognizer  to which input speech is supplied through suitable microphone interface. In this regard, the microphone can be attached by cable or coupled through wireless connection to speech recognizer . The microphone may be packaged, for example, within the handheld remote of a television or other information appliance.","The output of speech recognizer  is coupled to natural language parser . The natural language parser extracts the semantics or meaning from the spoken words, phrases and sentences supplied by the user. As will be discussed more fully below, natural language parser  works with a set of pre-defined grammars that are preferably constructed based on goal-oriented tasks. In the presently preferred embodiment these grammars may be categorized as one of two types: a fixed grammar  and a downloaded grammar .","The fixed grammar represents a pre-defined set of goal-oriented tasks that the system is able to perform immediately upon installation. For example, the fixed grammar would allow the natural language parser to understand sentences such as \u201cPlease find me an international water polo event.\u201d","Expanding upon the fixed grammar, an optional, downloaded grammar  can be added to the system, giving the natural language parser the ability to understand different classes of sentences not originally provided for in the original package. These additional downloaded grammars can be used to expand the capability of the system periodically (when the system manufacturer develops new enhancements or new features) or to add third-party enhancements that the user may be particularly interested in.","For example, if a particular user is interested in playing chess interactively with users around the world, the downloaded grammar can be augmented to include the necessary grammars to give chess move commands to the system.","Much of the power underlying the system comes from its ability to access the rich information content found on the internet. The system includes a search engine commander  which receives semantic instructions from natural language parser . The search engine commander lies at the hub of a number of information handling processes. The search engine commander is coupled to the internet connection module , which has suitable TCP\/IP protocols necessary for communication with a suitable service provider giving access to the internet . The search engine commander formulates search requests, based on the user's input as derived by the natural language parser . The commander  formulates search requests to be suitable for handing off to one or more search engines that are maintained by third parties on the internet. In  three search engines are shown at . Examples of suitable search engines include: Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, GoTo, and so forth. In essence, the search engine commander  communicates with all of the search engines in parallel, sending each of them off on the task of locating information responsive to the user's spoken inquiry.","The search engines, in turn, identify information found on the internet that respond to the user's request. Typically, search engines of this type return a priority score or probability score indicative of how likely the retrieved information is responsive to the user's request. In this regard, different search engines use different algorithms for determining such probabilities. Thus having the ability to access multiple search engines in parallel improves the richness of the information retrieved. In other words, not all search engines will return the same information for every inquiry made, but the combined effect of using search engines produces richer results than any single search engine alone.","The search engines return a list of links (e.g., hypertext links or URL addresses) that are responsive to the request. Typically, the returned information is sorted by probability score, so that the sites most likely to contain relevant information are presented first.","The returned results are fed back to search engine commander , and search engine commander , in turn, passes the results to the search results processor  for filtering. Typically a user of this system does not want to see every piece of information identified by the search engines. Rather the user is typically interested in the best one or two information resources. To filter the results, search engine processor  may have optional information filters  that are based on user-defined preferences. These filters help processor  determine which responses are likely to be more interesting to the user and which responses should be discarded. The presently preferred embodiment updates these information filters on a per-user basis, based on historical data gathered as the user makes use of the system.","A very important item of information in filtering the search results comes from the knowledge of what the user is currently viewing. This information is extracted from an electronic program guide, which may be locally stored as at 30 for access by the search engine commander. The electronic program guide contains information about each program that is available for viewing over a pre-defined time interval. The guide includes the date and time of the program, the program title, and other useful information such as what category the program falls into (e.g., comedy, drama, news, sports, etc.), what actors star in the program, who directed the program, and so forth. Often this information is relevant in determining what information the user is interested in retrieving.","For example, if the user is watching a movie starring Marilyn Monroe, the user may be interested in learning more about this actress' life. The user could thus ask the system to \u201cTell me more about the main actress' life\u201d and the system would ascertain from the electronic program guide that the actress is Marilyn Monroe.","The information contained in the electronic program guide can be used in multiple ways. The search engine commander can make use of this information in formulating its requests for information that are sent to the search engines . In addition, when the information is returned by the search engines, the search engine commander  can pass the relevant electronic program guide data down to the search results processor  along with the search results. This allows the search results processor to use relevant electronic program guide information in filtering the results obtained.","Because the electronic program guide changes over time, it is necessary to update the contents of the electronic program guide data store  on a periodic basis. The search engine commander does this automatically by accessing the internet. Alternatively, if desired, the electronic program guide information can be obtained through the television system's cable or satellite link.","While the system described above has the ability to access any information available on the internet, a particularly robust embodiment can be implemented by designating certain pre-defined sites that contain information the user has selected as being of interest, or sites designated by the system manufacturer as containing information of interest to most viewers. Information retrieved from such pre-designated sites can be retrieved and communicated to the user more quickly, because there is no need to invoke search engines to scour the entire body of information available on the Internet.","By way of illustration, the system may be pre-configured to access an on-line encyclopedia Internet site which is used to supply commonly requested information about programs the user is viewing. For example, if the user is watching a movie about India, the system might automatically retrieve relevant statistics about that country and provide them on screen in response to a user's request.","An interesting enhancement of this capability involves the presentation of multimedia data or streaming data from the pre-selected internet web site. By providing screening data, the user is given the experience of actually viewing the supplemental material as a film clip or animation. Such film clips or animations could be viewed, for example, during commercial breaks. Alternatively, if the user is enjoying a television system that provides video on demand, the user could temporarily suspend transmission of the original program to allow viewing of the supplemental information provided from the pre-defined internet site.","The search engine commander, itself, maintains a user profile data store  that may be used to further enhance the usefulness of the system. User preferences stored in the user profile data store can be combined with information in the electronic program guide to generate search requests automatically. Thus, if the system has ascertained from previous usage that the viewer is interested in certain international events, the search engine commander will automatically send requests for relevant information and can cause the relevant information to be displayed on the screen, depending on whether such information is suitable in the current viewing context. For example, if important news about a viewers home country is found, it could be displayed on screen while the international news is being viewed. The same message might be suppressed if the viewer is watching a movie that may be simultaneously being recorded.","The presently preferred embodiment uses a natural language parser that is goal-oriented.  depicts components of the natural language parser  in more detail. In particular, speech understanding module  includes a local parser  to identify predetermined relevant task-related fragments. Speech understanding module  also includes a global parser  to extract the overall semantics of the speaker's request.","The local parser  utilizes in the preferred embodiment small and multiple grammars along with several passes and a unique scoring mechanism to provide parse hypotheses. For example, the novel local parser  recognizes according to this approach phrases such as dates, names of people, and movie categories. If a speaker utters \u201ctell me about a comedy in which Mel Brooks stars and is shown before January 23rd\u201d, the local parser recognizes: \u201ccomedy\u201d as being a movie category; \u201cJanuary 23rd\u201d as a date; and \u201cMel Brooks\u201d as an actor. The global parser assembles those items (movie category, date, etc.) together and recognizes that the speaker wishes to retrieve information about a movie with certain constraints.","Speech understanding module  includes knowledge database  which encodes the semantics of a domain (i.e., goal to be achieved). In this sense, knowledge database  is preferably a domain-specific database as depicted by reference numeral  and is used by dialog manager  to determine whether a particular action related to achieving a predetermined goal is possible.","The preferred embodiment encodes the semantics via a frame data structure . The frame data structure  contains empty slots  which are filled when the semantic interpretation of global parser  matches the frame. For example, a frame data structure (whose domain is tuner commands) includes an empty slot for specifying the viewer-requested channel for a time period. If viewer  has provided the channel, then that empty slot is filled with that information. However, if that particular frame needs to be filled after the viewer has initially provided its request, then dialog manager  instructs the computer response module to ask the viewer to provide a desired channel.","The frame data structure  preferably includes multiple frames which each in turn have multiple slots. One frame may have slots directed to attributes of a movie, director, and type of movie. Another frame may have slots directed to attributes associated with the time in which the movie is playing, the channel, and so forth.","The following reference discusses global parsers and frames: R. Kuhn and R. D. Mori, (14), Academic Press, Boston (1998).","Dialog manager  uses dialog history data file  to assist in filling in empty slots before asking the speaker for the information. Dialog history data file  contains a log of the conversation which has occurred through the device of the present invention. For example, if a speaker utters \u201cI'd like to watch another Marilyn Monroe movie,\u201d the dialog manager  examines the dialog history data file  to check what movies the user has already viewed or rejected in a previous dialog exchange. If the speaker had previously rejected \u201cSome Like It Hot\u201d, then the dialog manager  fills the empty slot of the movie title with movies of a different title. If a sufficient number of slots have been filled, then the present invention will ask the speaker to verify and confirm the program selection. Thus, if any assumptions made by the dialog manager  through the use of dialog history data file  prove to be incorrect, then the speaker can correct the assumption.","The natural language parser  analyzes and extracts semantically important and meaningful topics from a loosely structured, natural language text which may have been generated as the output of an automatic speech recognition system (ASR) used by a dialogue or speech understanding system. The natural language parser  translates the natural language text input to a new representation by generating well-structured tags containing topic information and data, and associating each tag with the segments of the input text containing the tagged information. In addition, tags may be generated in other forms such as a separate list, or as a semantic frame.","Robustness is a feature of the natural language parser  as the input can contain grammatically incorrect English sentences, due to the following reasons: the input to the recognizer is casual, dialog style, natural speech can contain broken sentences, partial phrases, and the insertion, omission, or mis-recognition of errors by the speech recognizer even when the speech input is considered correct. The natural language parser  deals robustly with all types of input and extracts as much information as possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["160","24","12"],"i":["Principles of Compiler Design","Generalized LR Parsing"]},"At each pass of the computation, a generalized parsing algorithm is used to generate preferably all possible (both complete and partial) parse trees independently for each targeted topic. Each pass potentially generates several alternative parse-trees, each parse-tree representing a possibly different interpretation of a particular topic. The multiple passes through preferably parallel and independent paths result in a substantial elimination of ambiguities and overlap among different topics. The generalized parsing algorithm is a systematic way of scoring all possible parse-trees so that the (N) best candidates are selected utilizing the contextual information present in the system.","Local parsing system  is carried out in three stages: lexical analysis ; parallel parse-forest generation for each topic (for example, generators  and ); and analysis and synthesis of parsed components as shown generally by reference numeral .","Lexical Analysis:","A speaker utters a phrase that is recognized by an automatic speech recognizer  which generates input sentence . Lexical analysis stage  identifies and generates tags for the topics (which do not require extensive grammars) in input sentence  using lexical filters  and . These include, for example, movie names; category of movie; producers; names of actors and actresses; and so forth. A regular-expression scan of the input sentence  using the keywords involved in the mentioned exemplary tags is typically sufficient at this level. Also, performed at this stage is the tagging of words in the input sentence that are not part of the lexicon of particular grammar. These words are indicated using an X-tag so that such noise words are replaced with the letter \u201cX\u201d.","Parallel Parse-Forest Generation:","The parser  uses a high-level general parsing strategy to describe and parse each topic separately, and generates tags and maps them to the input stream. Due to the nature of unstructured input text , each individual topic parser preferably accepts as large a language as possible, ignoring all but important words, dealing with insertion and deletion errors. The parsing of each topic involves designing context-sensitive grammar rules using a meta-level specification language, much like the ones used in LR parsing. Examples of grammars include grammar A  and grammar B . Using the present invention's approach, topic grammars  and  are described as if they were an LR-type grammar, containing redundancies and without eliminating shift and reduce conflicts. The result of parsing an input sentence is all possible parses based on the grammar specifications.","Generators  and  generate parse forests  and  for their topics. Tag-generation is done by synthesizing actual information found in the parse tree obtained during parsing. Tag generation is accomplished via tag and score generators  and  which respectively generate tags  and . Each identified tag also carries information about what set of input words in the input sentence are covered by the tag. Subsequently the tag replaces its cover-set. In the preferred embodiment, context information  is utilized for tag and score generations, such as by generators  and . Context information  is utilized in the scoring heuristics for adjusting weights associated with a heuristic scoring factor technique that is discussed below. Context information  preferably includes word confidence vector  and dialogue context weights . However, it should be understood that the parser  is not limited to using both word confidence vector  and dialogue context weights , but also includes using one to the exclusion of the other, as well as not utilizing context information .","Automatic speech recognition process block  generates word confidence vector  which indicates how well the words in input sentence  were recognized. Dialog manager  generates dialogue context weights  by determining the state of the dialogue. For example, dialog manager  asks a user about a particular topic, such as, what viewing time is preferable. Due to this request, dialog manager  determines that the state of the dialogue is time-oriented. Dialog manager  provides dialogue context weights  in order to inform the proper processes to more heavily weight the detected time-oriented words.","Synthesis of Tag-Components:","The topic spotting parser of the previous stage generates a significant amount of information that needs to be analyzed and combined together to form the final output of the local parser. The parser  is preferably as \u201caggressive\u201d as possible in spotting each topic resulting in the generation of multiple tag candidates. Additionally in the presence of numbers or certain key-words, such as \u201cbetween\u201d, \u201cbefore\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d, \u201caround\u201d, etc., and especially if these words have been introduced or dropped due to recognition errors it is possible to construct many alternative tag candidates. For example, an input sentence could have insertion or deletion errors. The combining phase determines which tags form a more meaningful interpretation of the input. The parser  defines heuristics and makes a selection based on them using a N-Best candidate selection process. Each generated tag corresponds to a set of words in the input word string, called the tag's cover-set.","A heuristic is used that takes into account the cover-sets of the tags used to generate a score. The score roughly depends on the size of the cover-set, the sizes in the number of the words of the gaps within the covered items, and the weights assigned to the presence of certain keywords. In the preferred embodiment, ASR-derived confidence vector and dialog context information are utilized to assign priorities to the tags. For example applying channel-tags parsing first potentially removes channel-related numbers that are easier to identify uniquely from the input stream, and leaves fewer numbers to create ambiguities with other tags. Preferably, dialog context information is used to adjust the priorities.","N-Best Candidates Selection","At the end of each pass, an N-best processor  selects the N-best candidates based upon the scores associated with the tags and generates the topic-tags, each representing the information found in the corresponding parse-tree. Once topics have been discovered this way, the corresponding words in the input can be substituted with the tag information. This substitution transformation eliminates the corresponding words from the current input text. The output  of each pass is fed-back to the next pass as the new input, since the substitutions may help in the elimination of certain ambiguities among competing grammars or help generate better parse-trees by filtering out overlapping symbols.","Computation ceases when no additional tags are generated in the last pass. The output of the final pass becomes the output of the local parser to global parser . Since each phase can only reduce the number of words in its input and the length of the input text is finite, the number of passes in the fixed-point computation is linearly bounded by the size of its input.","The following scoring factors are used to rank the alternative parse trees based on the following attributes of a parse-tree:\n\n","Each path preferably corresponds to a separate topic that can be developed independently, operating on a small amount of data, in a computationally inexpensive way. The architecture of the natural language parser  is flexible and modular so incorporating additional paths and grammars, for new topics, or changing heuristics for particular topics is straight forward, this also allows developing reusable components that can be shared among different systems easily.","From the foregoing it will be appreciated that the present invention is well adapted to providing useful information obtained from the internet to the TV viewer. The speech-enabled, natural language interface creates a user friendly, easy to use system that can greatly enhance the enjoyment and usefulness of both television and the internet. The result of using the system is a natural blend of passive television viewing and interactive internet information retrieval.","While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment, it will be understood that the invention is capable of modification without departing from the spirit of the invention as set forth in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
