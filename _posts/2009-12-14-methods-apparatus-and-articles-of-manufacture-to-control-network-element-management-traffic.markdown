{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This disclosure relates generally to network element management traffic and, more particularly, to methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to control network element management traffic.","A centralized element management system (EMS) is commonly used to control and\/or manage large numbers of network elements, which may be located at any number and\/or type(s) of customer premises. The EMS is also commonly used to monitor the status of the managed network elements. In some examples, the managed network elements periodically and\/or aperiodically send EMS query messages to the EMS to update their status and\/or confirm connectivity with the EMS, and\/or send EMS query messages to the EMS to receive configuration information and\/or parameters.","Example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to control network element management traffic are disclosed. A disclosed example apparatus to process an element management system (EMS) query message includes a receiver to receive the EMS query message from a managed network element, the EMS query message being redirected from an EMS server, a responder to select a pre-determined response to the EMS query message and discard EMS information contained in the EMS query message, wherein the pre-determined response is to delay the managed network element from resending the EMS query message to the EMS server for a time period, and a transmitter to send the pre-determined response to the managed network element.","A disclosed example method includes receiving an EMS query message from a network element, the EMS query message redirected from an EMS server based on at least one of a load, a status or an availability of the EMS server, selecting a pre-determined response to the EMS query message, wherein the pre-determined response is to prevent the network element from resending the EMS query message to the EMS server, discarding all EMS information contained in the EMS query message, and sending the pre-determined response to the network element.","A disclosed example system includes an EMS server, a managed network element to send an EMS query message to the EMS server, a load balancer to redirect the EMS query message when the EMS server is at least one of unable or unavailable to process the EMS query message, and an auto-responder to receive the redirected EMS query message, send a pre-determined response to the managed network element, and discard EMS information contained in the EMS query message.","Another disclosed example apparatus includes a load monitor to determine a load of an EMS server, a load analyzer to determine whether to redirect an EMS query message based on the load of the EMS server, and a redirector to modify routing information for the EMS query message to redirect the EMS query to an EMS shunt server.","Another disclosed example method includes determining an availability of an EMS server, determining whether to redirect an EMS query message based on the availability of the EMS server, and modifying routing information for the EMS query message to redirect the EMS query to an EMS shunt server.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","105","115","110","105","100"]},"Example managed network elements  of  include, but are not limited to, residential gateways, cable modems, digital subscriber line (DSL) modems, wireless modems, wireless access points, cellular telephones, voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) analog terminal adapters, satellite receivers, network adapters, appliances, gaming devices, telemetry devices, media servers, optical network units, and\/or set-top boxes. The example managed network elements  may be mobile and\/or substantially stationary devices, and may be located at and\/or in any number and\/or type(s) of customer premises, such as residences, government offices, churches, retail establishments, restaurants, sporting venues, transportation centers, libraries, schools, places of business and\/or any other private and\/or public locations. The example managed network elements  of  may be customer owned, may be leased or rented by a customer from a service provider, and\/or may be owned by the service provider. The managed network elements  may be installed, configured, managed and\/or operated by customers and\/or service providers.","The example access networks  of  may be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of communication path(s), communication media, communication technology(-ies), communication protocol(s) and\/or communication device(s). For example, the example access networks  may be implemented using DSL-based systems, public switched telephone network (PSTN) systems, public land mobile network (PLMN) systems (e.g., cellular systems), wireless distribution systems, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16 based distribution systems (a.k.a. WiMAX), wired distribution systems, coaxial cable distribution systems, Ultra High Frequency (UHF)\/Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequency systems, satellite or other extra-terrestrial systems, cellular distribution systems, power-line broadcast systems, fiber optic networks, passive optical network (PON) systems, and\/or any combination and\/or hybrid of these devices, systems and\/or networks.","The example managed network elements  of  are configured, monitored and\/or otherwise managed by one or more EMSs, one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example EMS  of  is implemented at an operations data center . The example EMS  and\/or, more generally, the example operations data center  of  manage the network elements  located within a particular geographic area and\/or region. As such, the example operations data center  of  implements centralized network element management for the geographic area and\/or region.","The example EMS  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of EMS servers, one of which is designated at reference numeral , and an EMS database . Network element status information and\/or network element configuration information may be stored in the example EMS database  using any number and\/or type(s) of data structures. The example EMS database  may be implemented by any number and\/or type(s) of memory(-ies), memory device(s) and\/or storage device(s).","The example managed network elements  of  are communicatively coupled to the example EMS  via the example access network(s) , one or more switches, routers and\/or hubs (one of which is designated at reference numeral ), and\/or one or more load balancers (one of which is designated at reference numeral ). The example routers  and\/or the example load balancers  of  route EMS query messages and\/or EMS response messages between the example managed network elements  and the EMS  using any number and\/or type(s) of routing protocol(s) and\/or routing technology(-ies). In some examples, the routers  and\/or the load balancers  include a routing table and\/or a routing policy database, one of which is designated at reference numeral , that the routers  and\/or the load balancers  use to determine how to route and\/or distribute EMS query messages and\/or EMS response messages. Additionally or alternatively, the example routers  and\/or the example load balancers  of  query a domain name service (DNS) server  to determine how to route EMS query messages and\/or EMS response messages. The example DNS server  includes a DNS database  containing routing information for a plurality of destinations and\/or destination identifiers (e.g., Internet protocol addresses). The example load balancers  of  distribute EMS query messages among the example EMS servers  to balance the processing loads of the EMS servers .","As each EMS query message is received at the example EMS  of , at least one of the example EMS servers  processes the EMS query message. Some example EMS query messages are status update messages that allow the EMS server  to update the status of the managed network element  in the example EMS database  and\/or to confirm connectivity with the managed network element . Additional and\/or alternative example EMS query messages are configuration request messages that request network element configuration information and\/or parameters. The example EMS servers  of  respond to each received EMS query message with an EMS response message that, for example, acknowledges the status update, acknowledges connectivity and\/or provides the requested configuration information and\/or parameters.","When any of the managed network elements  sends an EMS query message, the managed network element  expects to receive an EMS response message from the EMS . When the EMS response message is not received at the managed network element  within a pre-determined time period, the managed network element  resends the EMS query message to the EMS . When a given EMS server  is unavailable due to, for example, upgrade, repair, software update, configuration change or other maintenance activity, a loss of power and\/or a disruption of a communication path, the subject EMS server  is unable to respond to EMS query messages sent by the managed network elements . Accordingly, a large number of the managed network elements  may continually attempt to resend their EMS query messages. Such a backlog of unprocessed EMS query messages may grow substantially such that when the EMS  is again available it may have inadequate processing resources to process the backlog of unprocessed EMS query messages and\/or to process newly received EMS query messages. Such a backlog of EMS query messages may also occur when the EMS  has insufficient processing resources to process all received EMS query messages (e.g., after a period of downtime for repair) and\/or when a regional power outage results in a large number of the managed network elements  attempting to re-establish communication with the EMS  (e.g., when power is restored).","To reduce a backlog of unprocessed EMS query messages, the example communication system  of  includes a monitor  and one or more shunt servers and\/or auto responders, one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example monitor  of  monitors the availability, status and\/or processing load of the example EMS servers  and\/or, more generally, the example EMS . The example monitor  can monitor the availability, status and\/or processing load of the EMS servers  and\/or, more generally, the EMS  by sending one or more EMS query messages to the EMS servers  and\/or, more generally, the EMS  via the routers  and\/or the load balancers . By determining whether and\/or how long it takes to receive EMS response messages from the EMS , the example monitor  can estimate the availability, status and\/or processing load of the EMS servers  and\/or, more generally, the EMS . Additionally or alternatively, the example monitor  of  can access and\/or utilize an application programming interface (API)  implemented by the example EMS  to obtain the availability, status and\/or process loading information.","When the example EMS servers  and\/or, more generally, the example EMS  are unavailable due to upgrade, repair, software update, configuration change, maintenance activity, a power loss and\/or a disruption of a communication path, and\/or have processing loads that may result in a backlog of unprocessed EMS query messages, the example monitor  redirects or shunts some or all subsequent EMS query messages to the example shunt server(s) and\/or auto responder(s) . The redirection or shunting of EMS query messages may, additionally or alternatively, be initiated by a person , such as a technician or network operator, via a graphical user interface (GUI)  () of the example monitor . The example GUI  may be accessed by the person  to initiate redirection of EMS query messages prior to an upgrade, a repair, a software update, a configuration change or other maintenance activity being initiated for the example EMS . The example monitor  may redirect EMS query messages by modifying the example DNS database  and\/or the example routing tables and\/or routing policies . If EMS query messages are to be redirected based on processing load rather than unavailability, the example monitor  may redirect only some types of EMS query messages to the example shunt server(s) and\/or auto responder(s)  while other types of EMS query messages are routed to the EMS . For example, EMS query messages representing only connectivity checks with the EMS  may be shunted to the shunt server(s)  while more important EMS query messages are processed by the example EMS .","As EMS query messages are received at a particular shunt server and\/or auto responder  from one of the managed network elements , the shunt server and\/or auto responder  selects and\/or sends a pre-determined EMS response message. The pre-determined EMS response message is sent to the managed network element  to prevent the managed network element  from timing out and, thus, subsequently resending the EMS query message. The shunt server and\/or auto responder  discards the received EMS query message after sending the pre-determined EMS response message. Thus, a received status update EMS query message does not result in any update of the EMS database . Likewise, an EMS query message requesting configuration information and\/or parameters does not result in a return of the requested information and\/or parameters to the requesting managed network element . The example shunt servers and\/or auto responders  of  do not implement the full functionality of the example EMS . The shunt servers and\/or auto responders  are purposefully designed with limited functionality such that they require limited processing and\/or data storage capabilities. Thus, a single workstation may the handle the same number of EMS query messages normally requiring a number or workstations or EMS servers  to process. The example shunt servers and\/or auto responders  of  implement only enough EMS messaging functionality to provide pre-determined EMS response messages to prevent the creation of a backlog of EMS query messages. The limited EMS messaging functionality of the example shunt servers and auto responders  may result in the loss of network element status information and\/or may delay the configuration and\/or provisioning of network elements. However, such loss of information may be preferable to the creation of a backlog of EMS query messages, which may not be resolvable. An unresolved backlog of EMS query messages may result in a perpetually inoperable EMS , and\/or may require the implementation of an overly complex EMS  in order to ensure recovery from such conditions. In some examples, the shunt servers and\/or auto responders  count the number of sent pre-determined EMS messages, and\/or record identifiers representing managed network elements to which pre-determined EMS response messages are sent and\/or the content(s) of received EMS query messages in a database  () for subsequent retrieval and\/or processing by, for example, the EMS . Moreover, only the content(s) of particular types of received EMS query messages containing data that may affect network and\/or business operations and\/or practices may be stored in the database  while the content(s) of other types of received EMS query messages are discarded.","In some examples, the pre-determined EMS response message is selected without any reference to any contents (e.g., EMS information, data and\/or parameters) of the received EMS query message. For example, an appropriately formatted (e.g., formatted according to the simple object access protocol (SOAP) and\/or the extensible markup language (XML)) and acceptable EMS acknowledge (ACK) response message could automatically be sent in response to every received EMS query message. Additionally or alternatively, the EMS response message may be selected from a plurality of pre-determined EMS response messages based on the type of the EMS query message that was received. For example, a status update or connectivity check EMS query message could be responded to with an EMS ACK response message while a configuration request EMS query message could be ignored (i.e., no EMS response message sent) such that the managed network element  will resend the configuration request EMS query message at a later time.","As shown in , the example shunt servers and\/or auto responders  may be implemented at the operations data center  and\/or may be implemented at different locations of a geographic area and\/or region.","While an example communication system  has been illustrated in , the elements illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way. Further, the example communication system  may include additional devices, databases, servers, systems, networks and\/or processors in addition to, or instead of, those illustrated in , and\/or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated devices, databases, servers, networks, systems and\/or processors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["160","160","205","160","210","205","210"]},"To select pre-determined EMS response messages, the example shunt server  of  includes a responder . In some examples, the example responder  of  selects a pre-determined EMS response message, such as a generic EMS ACK response message, without any reference to any EMS information, data and\/or parameters contained in a received EMS query message. In other examples, the responder  selects EMS response messages from a plurality of pre-determined EMS response messages based on the type of EMS query message that was received. In some such examples, a status update or connectivity check EMS query message is responded to with an EMS ACK response message while a configuration request EMS query message is ignored such that the managed network element  will resend the configuration request EMS query message at a later time. The example responder  may maintain a count of pre-determined EMS response messages that have been sent, and\/or counts of different types of pre-determined EMS response messages that have been sent.","In some examples, the shunt server  includes a database  to record identifiers representative of managed network elements  to which pre-determined EMS response messages were sent. The example database  of  may also be used to record some or all contents of received EMS query messages for subsequent retrieval and\/or processing by, for example, the example EMS . The example database  may be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of data structures, and may be stored on any number and\/or type(s) of memory(-ies), memory device(s) and\/or storage device(s).","To specify and\/or identify which pre-determined EMS response messages are to be sent in response to which EMS query messages, the example shunt server  of  may include a response rules database . The example response rules database  of  identifies for each of a plurality of EMS query message types which pre-determined EMS response message, if any, is to be sent. The example response rules database  may be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of data structures, and may be stored on any number and\/or type(s) of memory(-ies), memory device(s) and\/or storage device(s).","While an example manner of implementing the example shunt servers and\/or auto responders  of  has been illustrated in , the interfaces, modules, elements and\/or devices illustrated in  may be combined, divided, re-arranged, eliminated and\/or implemented in any way. Further, the example receiver(s) , the example transmitter(s) , the example responder , the example databases  and  and\/or, more generally, the example shunt server  of  may be implemented by hardware, software, firmware and\/or any combination of hardware, software and\/or firmware. Thus, for example, any of the example receiver(s) , the example transmitter(s) , the example responder , the example databases  and  and\/or, more generally, the example shunt server  may be implemented by one or more circuit(s), programmable processor(s), application specific integrated circuit(s) (ASIC(s)), programmable logic device(s) (PLD(s)) and\/or field programmable logic device(s) (FPLD(s)), etc. When any of the appended apparatus claims are read to cover a purely software and\/or firmware implementation, at least one of the example receiver(s) , the example transmitter(s) , the example responder , the example databases  and  and\/or, more generally, the example shunt server  are hereby expressly defined to include a tangible medium such as a memory, a digital versatile disc (DVD), a compact disc (CD), etc. storing the software and\/or firmware. Further still, the example shunt server  may include additional interfaces, modules, elements and\/or devices in addition to, or instead of, those illustrated in , and\/or may include more than one of any or all of the illustrated interfaces, modules, elements and\/or devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3"],"b":["155","123","120","155","305","305","123","120","310"]},"To send and receive EMS query messages, the example monitor  of  includes a network element interface . The example network element interface  enables the example load monitor  to send EMS query messages and monitor for EMS response messages and\/or measure the time required to receive EMS response messages to estimate and\/or ascertain the availability, status and\/or processing load of the EMS .","To determine the availability, status and\/or processing load of the example EMS , the example monitor  includes the example load monitor . By accessing the example API  via the example EMS interface  and\/or by sending and receiving EMS messages via the example network element interface , the example monitor  can estimate, compute, determine and\/or otherwise ascertain the availability, status and\/or processing load of the EMS .","To determine whether EMS query messages are to be redirected, the example monitor  of  includes a load analyzer . The example load analyzer  of  applies one or more rules to the availability, status and\/or processing load information obtained and\/or determined by the example load monitor . Example rules that may be applied to determine which, if any, EMS query messages are to be redirected include, but are not limited to: when the EMS  is identified as unavailable, all EMS query messages are redirected; when the processing load exceeds a first threshold, particular types of EMS query messages are redirected; and when the processing load exceeds a second threshold, all EMS query messages are redirected. In some examples, one or more rule parameters and\/or thresholds may be adapted, calculated, selected and\/or changed based on the behavior of the example communication system  of . For example, the load analyzer  may collect information relating to current and past shunting events and decide how\/whether to shunt. For example, based on the current EMS overload, the number of EMS query messages that the EMS  can nominally process per period of time, and the expected or predicted number of EMS query messages per period of time, the load analyzer  could select to delay shunting when EMS overload is detected because the EMS  should be able to recover from the anticipated EMS query message backlog. However, if the overload continues more than a particular length of time or the EMS overload increases, then the load analyzer  could shunt some\/all subsequent EMS query messages.","To configure the redirection of EMS query messages, the example monitor  of  includes a redirector  and a router interface  and\/or a DNS interface . Based on the types of EMS query messages to be redirected, the example redirector  of  modifies the example routing tables and\/or routing policies  via the example router interface  and\/or modifies the example DNS database  via the example DNS interface .","To allow a person  () to configure and\/or initiate the redirection of EMS query messages, the example monitor  of  includes the example GUI .
