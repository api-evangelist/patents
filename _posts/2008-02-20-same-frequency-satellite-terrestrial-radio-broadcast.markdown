title: Same frequency satellite terrestrial radio broadcast
abstract: A satellite broadcasts radio programs to mobile and fixed receivers at various locations. Ground stations supplement the satellite broadcasts in areas where the satellite signal may be shadowed. Likewise, the satellite signal supplements the terrestrial transmissions in areas with marginal terrestrial signal strength. Ground stations and a satellite transmit the same digital symbol stream over a same frequency spectrum. The symbol streams arrive in each service area of the ground stations with a relative delay that is within a window for which a receiver is adapted to decode efficiently. Spectral efficiency is achieved by allowing the ground stations to share the same frequencies as the satellites.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the priority and benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 60\/924,672 entitled \u201cSAME-FREQUENCY SATELLITE TERRESTRIAL RADIO BROADCAST\u201d filed May 25, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The technology is related to providing satellite\/terrestrial spatial diversity transmissions on a same frequency by using timing and synchronization arrangements.","Two satellite\/terrestrial radio systems currently serve the USA\u2014Sirius Radio (\u201cSirius\u201d) and XM Radio (\u201cXM\u201d). Each is allocated a 12.5 MHz frequency spectrum by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) as illustrated in . Sirius divides its spectrum into three equal portions each of which is slightly less than 4.2 MHz. Two portions are allocated to two satellites and one portion is allocated to terrestrial (ground based) repeaters. XM divides its spectrum into three portions as well, but allocates a greater portion to the terrestrial repeaters as compared to the satellites.","In both Sirius and XM, fixed or mobile receivers receive the desired program by three paths\u2014two satellite paths and one ground path\u2014by using receivers capable of tuning to multiple respective frequencies and connected in a diversity configuration. A reception of any one signal alone guarantees reception of the desired program. Division of the spectrum between the three paths reduces the amount of programming that can be transmitted since the same program must be carried by three frequency signals\u2014two satellite and one terrestrial\u2014to guarantee reception via a reception of a single signal. This also increases the complexity of the receivers since they must be able to tune to multiple frequency signals in search of a program. The increase in complexity also increases the price of the receivers.","To increase broadcast capacity using multiple transmitters, it is desirable to use the entirety of the available spectrum instead of dividing the spectrum into multiple portions and repeating the broadcast (program) information in each portion. In one or more non-limiting example embodiments that maximizes the transmission capacity, a digital wireless broadcast system includes a plurality of ground stations and a satellite.","Each ground station wirelessly transmits to a corresponding service area a digital symbol stream over a frequency spectrum. The satellite also wirelessly transmits the same digital symbol stream over the same frequency spectrum to the plurality of service areas. Within each service area, the digital symbol stream from the corresponding ground station and from the satellite arrive within a predetermined time period of each other. The predetermined time period is a relative delay between the digital symbol stream from the satellite and from the ground station that is within a range for which the receiver is capable of decoding the digital symbol stream. The relative delay may be measured in symbol periods. It is preferred that a timing of transmission from one ground station be independently controllable from a timing of transmission from another ground station.","It is preferred that the digital symbol stream from the ground station be timed nominally to arrive in advance of the digital symbol stream from the satellite within the service area. To accomplish this, programming information related to the symbol stream should be available to the plurality of ground stations prior to the satellite transmitting the symbol stream to the service areas. In a non-limiting example embodiment, the corresponding programming information is provided to the ground stations from the satellite over a different frequency spectrum or is available from a source other than the satellite.","A ground station can transmit the digital symbol stream omnidirectionally in azimuth. Another ground station can transmit the stream in a shaped pattern so as to have varied shapes for the service area. The service area is preferred to be shaped asymmetrically elongated in a direction away from the satellite. Non-limiting example shapes include an elongated hexagon, a compressed hexagon and a rectangle. The service area can be divided into a plurality of sectors. It is preferred that the ground station be such that a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to one sector is independently controllable relative to a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to another sector. The sizes and\/or shapes of the sectors closer to the satellite can be different from the sectors further from the satellite within the service area. At borders between services areas, the digital symbols from the respective ground stations are timed to arrive within a small, specified number of modulation periods of each other.","In a non-limiting example embodiment, another (second) satellite transmits the digital symbol stream to the service areas using another (second) frequency spectrum. It is preferred that the ground station also be able to transmit the digital symbol stream using the same second frequency spectrum in addition to the using the first frequency spectrum. The ground station can be the same ground station mentioned in connection with the first satellite or can be a different ground station, thus providing both ground station and satellite diversity. The digital symbol stream over the second frequency spectrum from the ground station and the second satellite arrive to the receiver in the service area within the predetermined time period of each other.","Another non-limiting example embodiment of a digital wireless broadcast system includes first and second satellites and both satellites transmit a digital symbol stream over a frequency spectrum to a service area. The digital symbol stream from the first and second satellites arrive to a receiver in the service area within a predetermined time period of each other. Where there are multiple service areas, the first and second satellites can transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using a frequency spectrum or time slot corresponding to the service area, in order to reduce the size of the service area and thus the maximum delay differential that the receiver must handle. Alternatively, the first and second satellites can be used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using different directed beams, different time slots, and\/or different polarizations corresponding to each service area.","A non-limiting example of a digital wireless broadcast method is disclosed. The method includes transmitting a digital symbol stream using both a plurality of ground stations and a satellite over a same frequency spectrum. The digital symbol stream from each ground station is synchronized to arrive within a predetermined time period of the satellite signal received in a corresponding service area. The predetermined time period is a relative delay between the digital symbol stream from the satellite and from the ground station that is within a, range for which the receiver is capable of decoding the digital symbol stream. The relative delay may be measured in symbol periods.","It is preferred that the digital symbol stream from the ground station be timed nominally to arrive in advance of the digital symbol stream from the satellite within the service area. The method can also includes providing programming information corresponding to the digital symbol stream to the ground station from the satellite over a different frequency spectrum or from a source other than the satellite.","The digital symbol stream from a ground station can be transmitted omnidirectionally in azimuth or in a shaped pattern so as to have varied shapes for the service area. A service area can be shaped to be asymmetrical elongated in a direction away from the satellite. Also the service area can be divided into a plurality of sectors. The digital symbol stream transmitted to at least one sector can be independently controlled relative to a timing of the digital symbol stream transmitted to another sector of the service area. The sizes and\/or shapes of the sectors closer to the satellite can be different from the sectors further from the satellite within the service area. At borders between services areas, the digital symbols from the respective ground stations are timed to arrive within one modulation period of each other.","In another non-limiting example method, the digital symbol stream can be transmitted using a second satellite over a second frequency spectrum. The same second frequency spectrum can also be used by a ground station to transmit the digital symbol stream. The ground station can be the same ground station as mentioned to be operating in the first frequency spectrum in connection with the first satellite or can be a different ground station The digital symbol stream over the second frequency spectrum from the ground station and the second satellite arrive to the receiver in the service within the predetermined time period of each other.","Another non-limiting example of a digital wireless broadcast method includes transmitting the digital symbol stream from first and second satellites over a same frequency spectrum to a service area. The digital symbol stream from the first and second satellites arrive to a receiver in the service area within the predetermined time period of each other. Where there are multiple service areas, the first and second satellites are used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using a frequency spectrum or time slot corresponding to the service area. Alternatively, the first and second satellites are used to transmit the digital symbol stream to each area using different directed beams, different time slots, and\/or different polarizations corresponding to each service area.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth such as particular architectures, interfaces, techniques and so on to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.

In an example non-limiting embodiment, the sectors - and - can be merged into a single 240-degree sector using an appropriate antenna pattern. This can reduce the complexity and cost of the ground station serving the cell - by reducing the number of transmitters and antenna sets from three to two. As mentioned above, the timing advance of the terrestrial signal transmitted to the sector - can be different from that of the sectors - and - as illustrated in . See curves H, D and B as compared to curves A, F, F and G.","Other modified cell shapes and patterns can be used. For example,  illustrates a non-limiting example of a pattern of cells  each served by ground stations  where the right-firing hexagonal sectors are elongated to the right while the left-firing hexagonal sectors are compressed.  illustrates yet another non-limiting alternative using rectangular sectors  each served by ground stations  that are of different lengths to the right and to the left of the ground stations  respectively.","In addition to the illustrated non-limiting examples, any geometry that is generally elongated in the direction away from the satellite and compressed in the direction toward the satellite relative to the ground station is contemplated. In addition, the shapes of the cells\u2014the service areas\u2014need not be identical. It is contemplated that the sizes and\/or the shapes of the cells can be different.","One of many advantages of maintaining separate right and left firing sectors is that the transmit timing can be chosen independently for each sector so as to achieve optimum terrestrial and satellite signal timing alignments for multiple diversity. For example,  shows that the timing advance of the right-firing sector can be reduced so that points H, D and B experience substantially zero timing differential between the terrestrial and the satellite signal.","Moreover, at vertex A in , the timing of the terrestrials signals received from the left-firing sectors - and - from the ground station - can be made approximately the same as timing of the terrestrial signals received from the right firing sectors of ground stations - and -, when an account is taken of the difference in timing advance of those ground stations to align them with the satellite timing at their locations in a like manner. As a result, vertex A can receive triple diversity terrestrial signals as well as the satellite signal. Similarly vertex B can also receive triple diversity terrestrial signals from ground stations -, - and -. In fact, any or all vertices A, F, D, B, D and F can receive multiple diversity terrestrial signals.","To make such diversity as effective as possible, the timing advance of ground stations such as - and -, which would normally be the same, can be offset slightly so that a border point such as F receives the two terrestrial signals with a small symbol timing difference. For example, if the offset is \u00b10.5 modulation symbol periods, then there would be one symbol timing difference at the border point.","Such a deliberate timing difference is desirable when an equalizer is used to demodulate a multi-path signal. One type of equalizer which provides this desirable characteristic is the Viterbi Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE). There are many other types of equalizers known and there are also many published refinements to the MLSE equalizer which may be advantageously employed.","It is also desirable to provide diversity satellite signals for receivers that are out of range of any ground station. In an example non-limiting embodiment as illustrated in , the service area  is out of range of any ground stations. In this case, first and second satellites - and - can provide the same digital symbol stream using respective parts of the frequency spectrum to avoid the need for accurate timing synchronization, as in the case of XM and Sirius satellite systems.","However, in an alternative non-limiting embodiment, the first and second satellites can transmit using the same frequency spectrum to any receiver within the service area . The service area  is preferred to be small enough such that the amount of relative delay measured in symbol periods between the digital symbol stream from the satellites - and - within the service area  is within a tolerance range of the receiver for an efficient decoding to take place.","It is difficult to synchronize the transmissions of two satellites so that their signals are received with a small relative timing difference over an entire continent. To overcome this difficulty, the satellite spectrum can be divided into multiple portions to provide two-satellite diversity. This is illustrated in  which includes two satellites - and - and two service areas - and -. The frequency spectrum is divided into portions  and \u2014i.e., into carriers  and \u2014and both carriers are transmitted by both satellites. The timings of digital symbol transmissions using carrier  of the spectrum can be independently controlled relative to the timing using carrier  for one or both satellites. It is also possible to divide a transmission period into timeslots instead of dividing a frequency spectrum, and to adjust the relative timing of the modulations from each satellite on a timeslot by timeslot basis, allocating each timeslot to the respective service area.","Yet another non-limiting alternative is to transmit from each satellite in the same frequency spectrum over the entire continent, but using different polarizations, for example Right Hand Circular and Left Hand Circular polarization. Despite a \u00b16 mS relative timing difference that can arise at extremely different locations over a continent such as Miami versus Seattle or San Diego versus New York, a dual-polarization diversity receiver used with a diversity equalizer can resolve the transmitted information. Any number of satellites and any number of service areas are also contemplated.","Multiple frequencies can also be used on the ground stations to provide frequency diversity transmissions as well as terrestrial\/satellite spatial diversity for each satellite signal as already described above. This is illustrated in  that illustrates a non-limiting example digital wireless broadcast system with multiple satellites serving a service area with a ground station. The system includes first and second satellites - and - providing respective satellite signals to the service area . The first satellite - provides a digital symbol stream over a first frequency spectrum (spectrum ) and the second satellite - provides the same digital symbol stream over a second frequency spectrum (spectrum ) where the first and second spectrums are different.","The ground station  can transmit two terrestrial signals as well. The first terrestrial signal is carried over the same frequency spectrum as the first satellite - (spectrum ) and the second terrestrial signal is carried over the same frequency spectrum as the second satellite - (spectrum ). Thus the spectral utilization of the above-disclosed scheme can be improved by a factor 1.5 compared to the existing satellite radio systems.","It is also possible to split ground station  into two stations - and -, which transmit using first and second spectrum respectively as illustrated in . The terrestrial signal transmitted in the first spectrum has its timing related to the satellite transmission received in the first spectrum in its service area. Similarly, the terrestrial signal transmitted in the second spectrum has a timing related to the satellite transmission received in the second spectrum its respective coverage area.","The differential delay between signals received from a west coast satellite and an east coast satellite can be as much as \u00b16 mS, which is over 1600 symbols at the GSM symbol rate. A scheme published by Alamouti can be used to provide diversity transmissions with large delay difference between them. When each transmission is also subject to multi-path propagation, an extension of the Alamouti scheme to multi-path channels can be used. This was published by Erik Lindskog and Arogyaswami Paulraj in \u201cA transmit Diversity Scheme for Channels with Intersymbol Interference\u201d, 0-7803-6286-1\/00, 2000 IEEE, pp 307-311, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.","To cope with \u00b16 mS timing difference, a block of known symbols 6 mS long is used with the Alamouti or Lindskog\/Pauljaj scheme. For the block of known symbols, which may be used for channel estimation, to represent an overhead of less than 10%, the block of data symbols lying between blocks of known sync symbols should be of the order of 60 mS long. It is preferred that the channel remains constant over such block periods.","For mobile receivers, the channel is unlikely to be constant over such long block periods. For frequencies in S-band and vehicle speeds of 60 mph, the block length is preferably less than 0.5 mS. In an example non.-limiting embodiment, the delay difference between two satellites is reduced by dividing the continent into smaller regions, using multiple satellite beams. This is exemplified in  which illustrates a non-limiting example digital wireless broadcast system with a satellite  providing satellite signals to two service areas - and -. A first satellite signal to the first service area - is provided via a first beam (beam ) and a second satellite signal to the second service area - is provided via a second beam (beam ). The first and second satellite beam signals may or may not use the same frequency spectrum. Further, the timings of the first and second beam signals may be independent of each other.","Although the description above contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention.
