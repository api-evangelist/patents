title: Controllers, observers, and applications thereof
abstract: Controller scaling and parameterization are described. Techniques that can be improved by employing the scaling and parameterization include, but are not limited to, controller design, tuning and optimization. The scaling and parameterization methods described here apply to transfer function based controllers, including PID controllers. The parameterization methods also apply to state feedback and state observer based controllers, as well as linear active disturbance rejection (ADRC) controllers. Parameterization simplifies the use of ADRC. A discrete extended state observer (DESO) and a generalized extended state observer (GESO) are described. They improve the performance of the ESO and therefore ADRC. A tracking control algorithm is also described that improves the performance of the ADRC controller. A general algorithm is described for applying ADRC to multi-input multi-output systems. Several specific applications of the control systems and processes are disclosed.

For example, it may be desirable to maintain the speed of a car on a highway as close as possible to 60 miles per hour in spite of possible hills or adverse wind; or it may be desirable to have an aircraft follow a desired altitude, heading and velocity profile independently of wind gusts; or it may be desirable to have the temperature and pressure in a reactor vessel in a chemical process plant maintained at desired levels. All these are being accomplished today by using feedback control, and the above are examples of what automatic control systems are designed to do, without human intervention.","The key component in a feedback control system is the controller , which determines the difference between the output of the plant , (e.g. the temperature) and its desired value and produces a corresponding control signal u (e.g., turning a heater on or off). The goal of controller design is usually to make this difference as small as possible as soon as possible. Today, controllers are employed in a large number of industrial control applications and in areas like robotics, aeronautics, astronautics, motors, motion control, thermal control, and so on.","Classic Controllers","Classic Control Theory provides a number of techniques an engineer can use in controller design. Existing controllers for linear, time invariant, and single-input single output plants can be categorized into three forms: the proportional\/integral\/derivative (PID) controllers, transfer function based (TFB) controllers, and state feedback (SF) controllers. The PID controller is defined by the equation\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere u is the control signal and e is the error between the set point and the process output being controlled. This type of controller has been employed in engineering and other applications since the early 1920s. It is an error based controller that does not require an explicit mathematical model of the plant.

Here r is the set point for the output to follow.\n\nController Tuning\n","Over the years, the advances in control theory provided a number of useful analysis and design tools. As a result, controller design moved from empirical methods (e.g., ad hoc tuning via Ziegler and Nichols tuning tables for PID) to analytical methods (e.g., pole placement). The frequency response method (Bode and Nyquist plots) also facilitated analytical control design.","Conventionally, controllers are individually designed according to design criteria and then individually tuned until they exhibit an acceptable performance. Practicing engineers may design controllers, (e.g., PID) using look-up tables and then tune the controllers using trial and error techniques. But each controller is typically individually designed, tuned, and tested.","Tuning controllers has perplexed engineers. Controllers that are developed based on a mathematical model of the plant usually need their parameters to be adjusted, or \u201ctuned\u201d as they are implemented in hardware and tested. This is because the mathematical model often does not accurately reflect the dynamics of the plant. Determining appropriate control parameters under such circumstances is often problematic, leading to control solutions that are functional but ill-tuned, yielding lost performance and wasted control energy.","Additionally, and\/or alternatively, engineers design using analytical (e.g., pole placement) techniques, but once again tune with trial and error techniques. Since many industrial machines and engineering applications are built to be inherently stable, acceptable controllers can be designed and tuned using these conventional techniques, however, acceptable performance may not approach optimal performance.","One example conventional technique for designing a PID controller included obtaining an open-loop response and determining what, if anything, needed to be improved. By way of illustration, the designer would build a candidate system with a feedback loop, guess the initial values of the three gains (e.g., kp, kd, ki) in PID and observe the performance in terms of rise time, steady state error and so on. Then, the designer might modify the proportional gain to improve rise time. Similarly, the designer might add or modify a derivative controller to improve overshoot and an integral controller to eliminate steady state error. Each component would have its own gain that would be individually tuned. Thus, conventional designers often faced choosing three components in a PID controller and individually tuning each component. Furthermore, there could be many more parameters that the design engineer must tune if a TFB or a state feedback state observer (SFSOB) controller is employed.","Another observation of control design is that it is not portable. That is, each control problem is solved individually and its solution cannot be easily modified for another control problem. This means that the tedious design and tuning process must be repeated for each control problem. The use of state observers is useful in not only system monitoring and regulation but also detecting as well as identifying failures in dynamical systems. Since almost all observer designs are based on the mathematical model of the plant, the presence of disturbances, dynamic uncertainties, and nonlinearities pose great challenges in practical applications. Toward this end, the high-performance robust observer design problem has been topic of considerable interest recently, and several advanced observer designs have been proposed. Although satisfactory in certain respects, a need remains for an improved strategy for an observer and incorporation and use of such in a control system.","State Observers","Observers extract real-time information of a plant's internal state from its input-output data. The observer usually presumes precise model information of the plant, since performance is largely based on its mathematical accuracy. Closed loop controllers require both types of information. This relationship is depicted in  of . Such presumptions, however, often make the method impractical in engineering applications, since the challenge for industry remains in constructing these models as part of the design process. Another level of complexity is added when gain scheduling and adaptive techniques are used to deal with nonlinearity and time variance, respectively.","Disturbance Estimation Observes and Disturbance Rejection","Recently, disturbance rejection techniques have been used to account for uncertainties in the real world and successfully control complex nonlinear systems. The premise is to solve the problem of model accuracy in reverse by modeling a system with an equivalent input disturbance d that represents any difference between the actual plant P and a derived\/selected model Pof the plant, including external disturbances w. An observer is then designed to estimate the disturbance in real time and provide feedback to cancel it. As a result, the augmented system acts like the model Pat low frequencies, making the system accurate to Pand allowing a controller to be designed for P. This concept is illustrated in  of .","The most common of these techniques is the disturbance observer (DOB) structure (Endo, S., H. Kobayashi, C. J. Kempf, S. Kobayashi, M. Tomizuka and Y. Hori (1996). \u201cRobust Digital Tracking Controller Design for High-Speed Positioning Systems.\u201d 4:4, 527-536; Kim, B. K., H.-T. Choi, W. K. Chung and I. H. Suh (2002). \u201cAnalysis and Design of Robust Motion Controllers in the Unified Framework.\u201d 124, 313-321; Lee, H. S. and M.

Tomizuka (2000). \u201cA Sensitivity Optimization Approach to Design of a Disturbance Observer in Digital Motion Control.\u201d 5:1, 32-38; Umeno, T. and Y. Hori (1991). \u201cRobust Speed Control of DC Servomotors Using Modern Two Degrees of Freedom Controller Design\u201d. 38:5, 363-368). It uses simple binomial Q-filters, allowing the observer to be parameterized, i.e. tuned by a single bandwidth parameter. A model deliberately different from P is also suggested in E. Schrijver and J. van Dijk, \u201cDisturbance Observers for Rigid Mechanical Systems: Equivalence, Stability, and Design,\u201d 124, no. 4, pp. 539-548, 2002 to facilitate design, but no guidelines are given other than it should be as simple as possible, cautioning stability and performance may be in danger. Another obstacle is that a separate observer must be designed to provide state feedback to the controller. In existing research, derivative approximates are used in this way but their effect on performance and stability has yet to be analyzed. Furthermore, the controller design is dependent on the DOB design, meaning that derivative approximates can not be arbitrarily selected.","Multiple DOBs were used to control a multivariable robot by treating it as a set of decoupled single-input single-output (SISO) systems, each with disturbances that included the coupled dynamics (Bickel, R. and M. Tomizuka (1999). \u201cPassivity-Based Versus Disturbance Observer Based Robot Control: Equivalence and Stability.\u201d 121, 41-47; Hori, Y., K. Shimura and M. Tomizuka (1992). \u201cPosition\/Force Control of Multi-Axis Robot Manipulator Based on the TDOF Robust Servo Controller For Each Joint.\u201d 753-757; Kwon, S. J. and W. K.

Van Dijk (2002) Disturbance Observers for Rigid Mechanical Systems: Equivalence, Stability, and Design.\u201d 124, 539-548.","Another technique, referred to as the unknown input observer (UIO), estimates the states of both the plant and the disturbance by augmenting a linear plant model with a linear disturbance model (Burl, J. B. (1999). 308-314. Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., Calif.; Franklin, G. F., J. D. Powell and M. Workman (1998). , Third Edition, Addison Wesley Longman, Calif.; Johnson, C. D. (1971). \u201cAccommodation of External Disturbances in Linear Regulator and Servomechanism Problems.\u201d , AC-16:6, 635-644; Liu, C.-S., and H.

Unlike the DOB structure, the controller and observer can be designed independently, like a Luenberger observer. However, it still relies on a good mathematical model and a design procedure to determine observer gains. An external disturbance w is generally modeled using cascaded integrators (1\/s). When they are assumed to be piece-wise constant, the observer is simply extended by one state and still demonstrates a high degree of performance.","Extended State Observer (ESO)","In this regard, the extended state observer (ESO) is quite different. Originally proposed by Han, J. (1999). \u201cNonlinear Design Methods for Control Systems.\u201d 14, in the form of a nonlinear UIO and later simplified to a linear version with one tuning parameter by Gao, Z. (2003). \u201cScaling and Parameterization Based Controller Tuning.\u201d 4989-4996, the ESO combines the state and disturbance estimation power of a UIO with the tuning simplicity of a DOB. One finds a decisive shift in the underlying design concept as well. The traditional observer is based on a linear time-invariant model that often describes a nonlinear time-varying process. Although the DOB and UIO reject input disturbances for such nominal plants, they leave the question of dynamic uncertainty mostly unanswered in direct form. The ESO, on the other hand, addresses both issues in one simple framework by formulating the simplest possible design model P=1\/sfor a large class of uncertain systems. Pis selected to simplify controller and observer design, forcing P to behave like it at low frequencies rather than P. As a result, the effects of most plant dynamics and external disturbances are concentrated into a single unknown quantity. The ESO estimates this quantity along with derivatives of the output, giving way to the straightforward design of a high performance controller.","Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC)","Originally proposed by Han, J. (1999). \u201cNonlinear Design Methods for Control Systems.\u201d 14, a nonlinear, non-parameterized active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is a method that uses an ESO. A linear version of the ADRC controller and ESO were parameterized for transparent tuning by Gao, Z. (2003). \u201cScaling and Parameterization Based Controller Tuning.\u201d 4989-4996. Its practical usefulness is seen in a number of benchmark applications already implemented throughout industry with promising results (Gao, Z., S. Hu and F. Jiang (2001). \u201cA Novel Motion Control Design Approach Based on Active Disturbance Rejection.\u201d 40; Goforth, F.

It was also applied to a fairly complex multivariable aircraft control problem (Huang, Y., K. Xu and J. Han (2001). \u201cFlight Control Design Using Extended State Observer and Nonsmooth Feedback.\u201d 40).","What is needed is a control framework for application to systems throughout industry that are complex and largely unknown to the personnel often responsible for controlling them. In the absence of required expertise, less tuning parameters are needed than current approaches, such as multi-loop PID, while maintaining or even improving performance and robustness.","Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Controller (LADRC)","In addition to the above controllers, a more practical controller is the recently developed from Active Disturbance Rejection Controller (ADRC). Its linear form (LADRC) for a second order plant is introduced below as an illustration. The unique distinction of ADRC is that it is largely independent of the mathematical model of the plant and is therefore better than most controllers in performance and robustness in practical applications.","Consider an example of controlling a second order plant\n\n\u2003\u2003(7)\n\nwhere y and u are output and input, respectively, and w is an input disturbance. Here both parameters, a and b, are unknown, although there is some knowledge of b, (e.g., b\u2248b, derived from the initial acceleration of y in step response). Rewrite (7) as\n\n+()\u2003\u2003(8)\n\nwhere \u0192=\u2212a{dot over (y)}\u2212by+w+(b\u2212b)u.

Oftentimes, it refers to how closely the output y compares to the reference input r at any given point in time. This measurement is known as the error e=r\u2212y.","Control problems can be categorized in two major groups; point-to-point control and tracking control. Point-to-point applications call for a smooth step response with minimal overshoot and zero steady state error, such as when controlling linear motion from one position to the next and then stopping. Since the importance is placed on destination accuracy and not on the trajectory between points, conventional design methods produce a controller with inherent phase lag in order to produce a smooth output. Tracking applications require precise tracking of a reference input by keeping the error as small as possible, such as when controlling a process that does not stop. Since the importance is placed on accurately following a changing reference trajectory between points, the problem here is that any phase lag produces unacceptably large errors in the transient response, which lasts for the duration of the process. Although it does not produce a response without overshoot, it does produce a much smaller error signal than the point-to-point controller. The significance is in its ability to reduce the error by orders of magnitude. A step input may be used in point-to-point applications, but a motion profile should be used in tracking applications.","Various methods have been used to remove phase lag from conventional control systems. All of them essentially modify the control law to create a desired closed loop transfer function equal to one. As a result, the output tracks the reference input without any phase lag and the effective bandwidth of the overall system is improved. The most common method is model inversion where the inverse of the desired closed loop transfer function is added as a prefilter. Another method proposed a zero Phase Error Tracking Controller (ZPETC) that cancels poles and stable zeros of the closed loop system and compensates for phase error introduced by un-cancelable zeros. Although it is referred to as a tracking controller, it is really a prefilter that reduces to the inverse of the desired closed loop transfer function when unstable zeros are not present. Other methods consist of a single tracking control law with feed forward terms in place of the conventional feedback controller and prefilter, but they are application specific. However, all of these and other previous methods apply to systems where the model is known.","Model inaccuracy can also create tracking problems. The performance of model-based controllers is largely dependent on the accuracy of the model. When linear time-invariant (LTI) models are used to characterize nonlinear time-varying (NTV) systems, the information becomes inaccurate over time. As a result, gain scheduling and adaptive techniques are developed to deal with nonlinearity and time variance, respectively. However, the complexity added to the design process leads to an impractical solution for industry because of the time and level of expertise involved in constructing accurate mathematical models and designing, tuning, and maintaining each control system.","There have been a number of high performance tracking algorithms that consist of three primary components: disturbance rejection, feedback control, and phase error compensation implemented as a prefilter. First, disturbance rejection techniques are applied to eliminate model inaccuracy with an inner feedback loop. Next, a stabilizing controller is constructed based on a nominal model and implemented in an outer feedback loop. Finally, the inverse of the desired closed loop transfer function is added as a prefilter to eliminate phase lag. Many studies have concentrated on unifying the disturbance rejection and control part, but not on combining the control and phase error compensation part, such as the RIC framework. Internal model control (IMC) cancels an equivalent output disturbance. B. Francis and W. Wonham, \u201cThe Internal Model Principal of Control Theory,\u201d , vol 12, 1976, pp. 457-465. E. Schrijver and J. van Dijk, \u201cDisturbance Observers for Rigid Mechanical Systems Equivalence, Stability, and Design,\u201d , vol. 124, December 2002, pp. 539-548 uses a basic tracking controller with a DOB to control a multivariable robot. The ZPETC has been widely used in combination with the DOB framework and model based controllers.","Thus, having reviewed controllers and observers, the application now describes example systems and methods related to controllers and observers.","Web Processing Applications","Web tension regulation is a challenging industrial control problem. Many types of material, such as paper, plastic film, cloth fabrics, and even strip steel are manufactured or processed in a web form. The quality of the end product is often greatly affected by the web tension, making it a crucial variable for feedback control design, together with the velocities at the various stages in the manufacturing process. The ever-increasing demands on the quality and efficiency in industry motivate researchers and engineers alike to explore better methods for tension and velocity control. However, the highly nonlinear nature of the web handling process and changes in operating conditions (temperature, humidity, machine wear, and variations in raw materials) make the control problem challenging.","Accumulators in web processing lines are important elements in web handling machines as they are primarily responsible for continuous operation of web processing lines. For this reason, the study and control of accumulator dynamics is an important concern that involves a particular class of problems. The characteristics of an accumulator and its operation as well as the dynamic behavior and control of the accumulator carriage, web spans, and tension are known in the art.","Both open-loop and closed-loop methods are commonly used in web processing industries for tension control purposes. In the open-loop control case, the tension in a web span is controlled indirectly by regulating the velocities of the rollers at either end of the web span. An inherent drawback of this method is its dependency on an accurate mathematical model between the velocities and tension, which is highly nonlinear and highly sensitive to velocity variations. Nevertheless, simplicity of the controller outweighs this drawback in many applications. Closing the tension loop with tension feedback is an obvious solution to improve accuracy and to reduce sensitivity to modeling errors. It requires tension measurement, for example, through a load cell, but is typically justified by the resulting improvements in tension regulation.","Most control systems will unavoidably encounter disturbances, both internal and external, and such disturbances have been the obstacles to the development of high performance controller. This is particularly true for tension control applications and, therefore, a good tension regulation scheme must be able to deal with unknown disturbances. In particular, tension dynamics are highly nonlinear and sensitive to velocity variations. Further, process control variables are highly dependent on the operating conditions and web material characteristics. Thus, what are needed are systems and methods for control that are not only overly dependent on the accuracy of the plant model, but also suitable for the rejection of significant internal and external disturbances.","Jet Engine Control Applications","A great deal of research has been conducted towards the application of modern multivariable control techniques on aircraft engines. The majority of this research has been to control the engine at a single operating point. Among these methods are a multivariable integrator windup protection scheme (Watts, S. R. and S. Garg (1996). \u201cAn Optimized Integrator Windup Protection Technique Applied to a Turbofan Engine Control,\u201d ), a tracking filter and a control mode selection for model based control (Adibhatla S. and Z. Gastineau (1994). \u201cTracking Filter Selection And Control Mode Selection For Model Based Control.\u201d 30), an Hmethod and linear quadratic Gaussian with loop transfer recovery method (Watts, S. R. and S. Garg (1995). \u201cA Comparison Of Multivariable Control Design Techniques For A Turbofan Engine Control.\u201d .), and a performance seeking control method (Adibhatla, S. and K. L. Johnson (1993). \u201cEvaluation of a Nonlinear Psc Algorithm on a Variable Cycle Engine.\u201d 29). Various schemes have been developed to reduce gain scheduling (Garg, S. (1997). \u201cA Simplified Scheme for Scheduling Multivariable Controllers.\u201d ) and have even been combined with integrator windup protection and H(Frederick, D. K., S. Garg and S. Adibhatla (2000). \u201cTurbofan Engine Control Design Using Robust Multivariable Control Technologies. ).","Conventionally, there have been a limited number of control techniques for full flight operation (Garg, S. (1997). \u201cA Simplified Scheme for Scheduling Multivariable Controllers.\u201d IEEE Control Systems; and Polley, J. A., S. Adibhatla and P. J. Hoffman (1988). \u201cMultivariable Turbofan Engine Control for Full Conference on Decision and Control Flight Operation.\u201d ). However, there has been no development of tuning a controller for satisfactory performance when applied to an engine. Generally, at any given operating point, models can become inaccurate from one engine to another. This accuracy increases with model complexity, and subsequently design and tuning complexity. As a result, very few of these or similar aircraft design studies have led to implementation on an operational vehicle.","The current method for controlling high performance jet engines remains multivariable proportional-integral (PI) control (Edmunds, J. M. (1979). \u201cControl System Design Using Closed-Loop Nyquist and Bode Arrays.\u201d 30:5, 773-802, and Polley, J. A., S. Adibhatla and P. J. Hoffman (1988). \u201cMultivariable Turbofan Engine Control for Full Conference on Decision and Control. Flight Operation.\u201d ). Although the controller is designed by implementing Bode and Nyquist techniques and is tunable, a problem remains due to the sheer number of tuning parameters compounded by scheduling.","Health Monitoring and Fault Detection","The terms \u201chealth\u201d, \u201cfault\u201d, \u201cdiagnosis\u201d, and \u201ctolerance\u201d are used in broad terms. Some literature defines a fault as an unpermitted deviation of at least one characteristic property or variable by L. H. Chiang, E. Russell, and R. D. Braatz, , Springer-Verlag, February 2001. Others define it more generally as the indication that something is going wrong with the system by J. J. Gertler, \u201cSurvey of model-based failure detection and isolation in complex plants,\u201d 1988.","Industry is increasingly interested in actively diagnosing faults in complex systems. The importance of fault diagnosis can be seen by the amount of literature associated with it. There are a number of good survey papers by (J. J.

Prentice-Hall, Inc, April 1993.) which collect many of the issues and solutions for faults.","There are four main categories of fault diagnosis. Fault detection is the indication that something is going wrong with the system. Fault isolation determines the location of the failure. Failure identification is the determination of the size of the failure. Fault accommodation and remediation is the act or process of correcting a fault. Most fault solutions deal with the first three categories and do not make adjustments to closed loop systems. The common solutions can be categorized into a six major areas:\n\n","Some of these methods attempt to remove the need for accurate mathematical models yet require other implicit models. Analytical redundancy by (E. Y. Chow and A. S. Willsky, \u201cAnalytical redundancy and the design of robust failure detection systems,\u201d , October 1982.), the most popular method, relies heavily on mathematical models.","Often detailed model information is not available although diagnostics of the dynamic control system are still important. A less developed but important problem is characterizing what can be determined from input output data with few assumptions about the plant.","Without adequate knowledge of the plant, disturbances, faults, and modeling errors, it is difficult to build an effective estimator. For the most part, each of these issues has been approached independently.","This section presents a simplified summary of methods, systems, and computer readable media and so on for scaling and parameterizing controllers to facilitate providing a basic understanding of these items. This summary is not an extensive overview and is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on or to delineate the scope of these items. This summary provides a conceptual introduction in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The application describes scaling and parameterizing controllers. With these two techniques, controller designing, tuning, and optimizing can be improved. In one example, systems, methods, and so on described herein facilitate reusing a controller design by scaling a controller from one application to another. This scaling may be available, for example, for applications whose plant differences can be detailed through frequency scale and\/or gain scale. While PID controllers are used as examples, it is to be appreciated that other controllers can benefit from scaling and parameterization as described herein.","Those familiar with filter design understand that filters may be designed and then scaled for use in analogous applications. Filter designers are versed in the concept of the unit filter which facilitates scaling filters. In example controller scaling techniques, a plant transfer function is first reduced to a unit gain and unit bandwidth (UGUB) form. Then, a known controller for an appropriate UGUB plant is scaled for an analogous plant. Since certain plants share certain characteristics, classes of UGUB plants can be designed for which corresponding classes of scaleable, parameterizable controllers can be designed.","Since certain classes of plants have similar properties, it is possible to frequency scale controllers within classes. For example, an anti-lock brake plant for a passenger car that weighs 2000 pounds may share a number of characteristics with an anti-lock brake plant for a passenger car that weighs 2500 pounds. Thus, if a UGUB plant can be designed for this class of cars, then a frequency scaleable controller can also be designed for the class of plants. Then, once a controller has been selected and engineered for a member of the class (e.g., the 2000 pound car), it becomes a known controller from which other analogous controllers can be designed for other similar cars (e.g., the 2500 pound car) using frequency scaling.","This scaling method makes a controller \u201cportable\u201d. That is a single controller can be used as the \u201cseed\u201d to generate controllers for a large number of different plants that are similar in nature. The remaining question concerns how to account for differences in design requirements. Controller parameterization addresses this issue. The example parameterization techniques described herein make controller coefficients functions of a single design parameter, namely the crossover frequency (also known as the bandwidth). In doing so, the controller can be tuned for different design requirements, which is primarily reflected in the bandwidth requirement.","The combination of scaling and parameterization methods means that an existing controller (including PID, TFB, and SFSOB) can be scaled for different plants and then, through the adjustment of one parameter, changed to meet different performance requirements that are unique in different applications.","Certain illustrative example methods, systems, computer readable media and so on are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These examples are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the methods, systems, computer readable media and so on may be employed and thus are intended to be inclusive of equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","As used in this application, the term \u201ccomputer component\u201d refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, software, a combination thereof, or software in execution. For example, a computer component can be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be computer components. One or more computer components can reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a computer component can be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","\u201cComputer communications\u201d, as used herein, refers to a communication between two or more computers and can be, for example, a network transfer, a file transfer, an applet transfer, an email, a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) message, a datagram, an object transfer, a binary large object (BLOB) transfer, and so on. A computer communication can occur across, for example, a wireless system (e.g., IEEE 802.11), an Ethernet system (e.g., IEEE 802.3), a token ring system (e.g., IEEE 802.5), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a point-to-point system, a circuit switching system, a packet switching system, and so on.","\u201cLogic\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, software and\/or combinations of each to perform a function(s) or an action(s). For example, based on a desired application or needs, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other programmed logic device. Logic may also be fully embodied as software.","An \u201coperable connection\u201d is one in which signals and\/or actual communication flow and\/or logical communication flow may be sent and\/or received. Usually, an operable connection includes a physical interface, an electrical interface, and\/or a data interface, but it is to be noted that an operable connection may consist of differing combinations of these or other types of connections sufficient to allow operable control.","\u201cSignal\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to one or more electrical or optical signals, analog or digital, one or more computer instructions, a bit or bit stream, or the like.","\u201cSoftware\u201d, as used herein, includes but is not limited to, one or more computer readable and\/or executable instructions that cause a computer or other electronic device to perform functions, actions and\/or behave in a desired manner. The instructions may be embodied in various forms like routines, algorithms, modules, methods, threads, and\/or programs. Software may also be implemented in a variety of executable and\/or loadable forms including, but not limited to, a stand-alone program, a function call (local and\/or remote), a servelet, an applet, instructions stored in a memory, part of an operating system or browser, and the like. It is to be appreciated that the computer readable and\/or executable instructions can be located in one computer component and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating, and\/or parallel processing computer components and thus can be loaded and\/or executed in serial, parallel, massively parallel and other manners. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the form of software may be dependent on, for example, requirements of a desired application, the environment in which it runs, and\/or the desires of a designer\/programmer or the like.","\u201cData store\u201d, as used herein, refers to a physical and\/or logical entity that can store data. A data store may be, for example, a database, a table, a file, a list, a queue, a heap, and so on. A data store may reside in one logical and\/or physical entity and\/or may be distributed between two or more logical and\/or physical entities.","To the extent that the term \u201cincludes\u201d is employed in the detailed description or the claims, it is intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term \u201ccomprising\u201d as that term is interpreted when employed as a transitional word in a claim.","To the extent that the term \u201cor\u201d is employed in the claims (e.g., A or B) it is intended to mean \u201cA or B or both\u201d. When the author intends to indicate \u201conly A or B but not both\u201d, then the author will employ the term \u201cA or B but not both\u201d. Thus, use of the term \u201cor\u201d in the claims is the inclusive, and not the exclusive, use. See Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 624 (2d Ed. 1995).","Example methods, systems, computer media, and so on are now described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to facilitate thoroughly understanding the methods, systems, computer readable media, and so on. It may be evident, however, that the methods, systems and so on can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to simplify description.","Scaling","Controllers typically are not scalable and thus are not portable between applications. However, controllers can be made portable via scaling as described in the example systems and methods provided herein. In general, a plant mathematically represented by a transfer function G(s), (where s is the Laplace Transform variable) can be scaled according to:\n\n()=()\u2003\u2003(16)\n\nwhere \u03c9is the plant frequency scale and k is the gain scale, to represent a large number of plants that differ from the original plant by a frequency scale, \u03c9, and a gain scale, k.\n","Then, a corresponding controller G(s) for the plant G(s) can be scaled according to:\n\n()=(1)().\u2003\u2003(17)\n","Consider a unit feedback control system  with the plant G(s)  and controller G(s) , as shown in . Assume that G(s)  was designed with desired command following, disturbance rejection, noise rejection, and stability robustness. Now, consider a similar class of plants kG(s\/\u03c9). For given \u03c9, using example systems and methods described herein, a suitable controller can be produced through frequency scaling. Thus define \u03c9as the frequency scale and k as the gain scale of the plant G(s\/\u03c9) with respect to G(s). Then\n\n()=(1)().\u2003\u2003(18)\n","Referring to , an example system  that employs frequency scaling is illustrated. The system  includes a controller identifier  that can identify a known controller associated with controlling a known plant. The controller may have one or more scaleable parameters (e.g., frequency, gains) that facilitate scaling the controller. The controller identifier  may access a controller information data store  and\/or a plant information data store  to facilitate characterizing one or more properties of the known controller. By way of illustration, the controller identifier  may identify the frequency scale of the controller (\u03c9) and\/or the frequency scale (\u03c9) and transfer function (s) of a plant controlled by the known controller.","The controller information data store  may store, for example, controller class information and\/or information concerning scaleable controller parameters. Similarly, the plant data store  may store, for example, plant information like transfer function shape, frequency scale, and so on.","The system  may also include a controller scaler  that produces a scaled controller from the identified scaleable parameter. The scaler  may make scaling decisions based, for example, on information in the controller information data store  (e.g., controller class, scaleable parameters, frequency scale), information in the plant information data store  (e.g. plant class, plant transfer function, frequency scale), and so on.","While illustrated as two separate entities, it is to be appreciated that the identifier  and scaler  could be implemented in a single computer component and\/or as two or more distributed, communicating, co-operating computer components. Thus, the entities illustrated in  may communicate through computer communications using signals, carrier waves, data packets, and so on. Similarly, while illustrated as two separate data stores, the controller information data store  and the plant information data store  may be implemented as a single data store and\/or distributed between two or more communicating, co-operating data stores.","Aspects of controller scaling can be related to filter design. In filter design, with the bandwidth, the pass band, and stop band requirements given, filter design is straight forward. An example filter design method includes finding a unit bandwidth filter, such as an nth order Chebeshev filter H(s), that meets the pass band and stop band specifications and then frequency scaling the filter as H(s\/\u03c9) to achieve a bandwidth of \u03c9.","Revisiting the system  in , to facilitate understanding frequency scaling and time scaling as related to controllers, denote \u03c9as the frequency scale of the plant Gp(s\/\u03c9) with respect to G(s) , and \u03c4=1\/\u03c9, the corresponding time scale. Then denote k as the gain scale of the plant kGp(s) with respect to Gp(s) . With these definitions in hand, differences in example industrial control problems can be described in terms of the frequency and gain scales. For example, temperature processes with different time constants (in first order transfer functions), motion control problems with different inertias, motor sizes, frictions, and the like can be described in terms of the defined frequency and gain scales.","These scales facilitate paying less attention to differences between controllers and applications and more attention to a generic solution for a class of problems because using the scales facilitates reducing linear time invariant plants, proper and without a finite zero, to one of the following example forms:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0136"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mn":"1","mi":"s"},{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"2"},"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mi":["\u03be","s"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}},"mn":"1"}},{"mn":"1","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}},{"mn":"1","msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"2"}},{"mn":"1","mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"3"},"mo":["+","+","+"],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"\u03be","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"s","mn":"2"}},{"msub":{"mi":"\u03be","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"s"}],"mn":"1"}}],"mo":[",",",",",",",",",",","],"mi":"\u2026"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"19"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"p"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0132","num":"0137"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mfrac":[{"mn":"23.2","mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"s","mo":"+","mn":"1.41"}}}},{"mn":"11.67","mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"s","mn":"1.41"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"s","mn":"1.41"},"mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"20"}}]}}}}},"Equation (19) describes many example industrial control problems that can be approximated by a first order or a second order transfer function response.

The method  includes, at , identifying a known controller in a controller class where the known controller controls a first plant. The method  also includes, at , identifying a scaleable parameter for the known controller. At , the method  includes identifying a desired controller in the controller class, where the desired controller controls a second, frequency related plant and at , establishing the frequency relation between the known controller and the desired controller. At , the method  scales the known controller to the desired controller by scaling the scaleable parameter based, at least in part, on the relation between the known controller and the desired controller.","Practical Optimization Based on a Hybrid Scaling and Parameterization Method","Practical controller optimization concerns obtaining optimal performance out of existing hardware and software given physical constraints. Practical controller optimization is measured by performance measurements including, but not limited to, command following quickness (a.k.a. settling time), accuracy (transient and steady state errors), and disturbance rejection ability (e.g., attenuation magnitude and frequency range). Example physical constraints include, but are not limited to, sampling and loop update rate, sensor noise, plant dynamic uncertainties, saturation limit, and actuation signal smoothness requirements.","Conventional tuning relies, for example, on minimizing a cost function like Hand H. However, conventional cost functions may not comprehensively reflect the realities of control engineering, and may, therefore, lead to suboptimal tuning. For example, one common cost function is mathematically attractive but can lead to suboptimal controller tuning. Thus, optimizing other criteria, like \u03c9are considered.","A typical industrial control application involves a stable single-input single-output (SISO) plant, where the output represents a measurable process variable to be regulated and the input represents the control actuation that has a certain dynamic relationship to the output. This relationship is usually nonlinear and unknown, although a linear approximation can be obtained at an operating point via the plant response to a particular input excitation, like a step change.","Evaluating performance measurements in light of physical limitations yields the fact that they benefit from maximum controller bandwidth \u03c9. If poles are placed in the same location, then \u03c9can become the single item to tune. Thus, practical PID optimization can be achieved with single parameter tuning. For example, in manufacturing, a design objective for an assembly line may be to make it run as fast as possible while minimizing the down time for maintenance and trouble shooting. Similarly, in servo design for a computer hard disk drive, a design objective may be to make the read\/write head position follow the setpoint as fast as possible while maintaining extremely high accuracy. In automobile anti-lock brake control design, a design objective may be to have the wheel speed follow a desired speed as closely as possible to achieve minimum braking distance.","In the three examples, the design goal can be translated to maximizing controller bandwidth \u03c9. There are other industrial control examples that lead to the same conclusion. Thus, \u03c9maximization appears to be a useful criterion for practical optimality. Furthermore, unlike purely mathematical optimization techniques, \u03c9optimization has real world applicability because it is limited by physical constraints. For example, sending \u03c9to infinity may be impractical because it may cause a resulting signal to vary unacceptably.","As an example of how physical limitations may affect \u03c9optimization, consider digital control apparatus that have a maximum sampling rate and a maximum loop update rate. The maximum sampling rate is a hardware limit associated with the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and the maximum loop update rate is software limit related to central processing unit (CPU) speed and the control algorithm complexity. Typically, computation speeds outpace sampling rates and therefore only the sampling rate limitation is considered.","As another example, measurement noise may also be considered when examining the physical limitations of \u03c9optimization. For example, the \u03c9is limited to the frequency range where the accurate measurement of the process variable can be obtained. Outside of this range, the noise can be filtered using either analog or digital filters.","Plant dynamic uncertainty may also be considered when examining the physical limitations of \u03c9optimization. Conventional control design is based on a mathematical description of the plant, which may only be reliable in a low frequency range. Some physical plants exhibit erratic phase distortions and nonlinear behaviors at a relative high frequency range. The controller bandwidth is therefore limited to the low frequency range where the plant is well behaved and predictable. To safeguard the system from instability, the loop gain is reduced where the plant is uncertain. Thus, maximizing the bandwidth safely amounts to expanding the effective (high gain) control to the edge of frequency range where the behavior of the plant is well known.","Similarly, actuator saturation and smoothness may also affect design. Although using transient profile helps to decouple bandwidth design and the transient requirement, limitations in the actuator like saturation, nonlinearities like backlash and hysteresis, limits on rate of change, smoothness requirements based on wear and tear considerations, and so on may affect the design. For example, in a motion control application with a significant backlash problem in the gearbox, excessively high bandwidth will result in a chattering gearbox and, very likely, premature breakdown. Thus, \u03c9optimization, because it considers physical limitations like sampling rate, loop update rate, plant uncertainty, actuator saturation, and so on, may produce improved performance.","In one controller optimization example, assume that the plant is minimum phase, (e.g., its poles and zeros are in the left half plane), that the plant transfer function is given, that the \u03c9parameterized controllers are known and available in form of Table I, that a transient profile is defined according to the transient response specifications, and that a simulator  of closed-loop control system as shown in  is available. It is to be appreciated that the closed loop control system simulator  can be, for example, hardware, software or a combination of both. In one example, the simulator incorporates limiting factors including, but not limited to, sensor and quantization noises, sampling disturbances, actuator limits, and the like.","With these assumptions, one example design method then includes, determining frequency and gain scales, \u03c9and k from the given plant transfer function.

Conventionally, second order systems with controllers and observers may have a large number (e.g., 15) of tunable features in each of the controller and observer. Thus, while a design method like the Han method is conceptually viable, its practical implementation is difficult because of tuning issues. As a consequence of the scaling and parameterization described herein, observer based systems can be constructed and tuned using two parameters, observer bandwidth (\u03c9) and controller bandwidth (\u03c9).","State observers provide information on the internal states of plants. State observers also function as noise filters. A state observer design principle concerns how fast the observer should track the states, (e.g., what should its bandwidth be). The closed-loop observer, or the correction term L(y\u2212) in particular, accommodates unknown initial states, uncertainties in parameters, and disturbances. Whether an observer can meet the control requirements is largely dependent on how fast the observer can track the states and, in case of ESO, the disturbance f(t,x1,x2,w). Generally speaking, faster observers are preferred. Common limiting factors in observer design include, but are not limited to dependency on the state space model of the plant, sensor noise, and fixed sampling rate.","Dependency on the state space model can limit an application to situations where a model is available. It also makes the observer sensitive to the inaccuracies of the model and the plant dynamic changes. The sensor noise level is hardware dependent, but it is reasonable to assume it is a white noise with the peak value 0.1% to 1% of the output. The observer bandwidth can be selected so that there is no significant oscillation in its states due to noises. A state observer is a closed-loop system by itself and the sampling rate has similar effects on the state observer performance as it does on feedback control. Thus, an example model independent state observer system is described.","Observers are typically based on mathematical models. Example systems and methods described herein can employ a \u201cmodel independent\u201d observer as illustrated in . For example a plant  may have a controller  and an observer . The controller  may be implemented as a computer component and thus may be programmatically tunable. Similarly, the observer  may be implemented as a computer component and thus may have scaleable parameters that can be scaled programmatically. Furthermore, using analogous scaling and parameterizing as described herein, the parameters of the observer  can be reduced to \u03c9. Therefore, overall optimizing of the system  reduces to tuning \u03c9, and \u03c9.","Consider a simple example for controlling a second order plant\n\n\u2003\u2003(39)\n\nwhere y and u are output and input, respectively, and w is an input disturbance.

One example procedure for coo optimization based design is now described.","Given tolerable noise thresholds in the observer states, increase \u03c9until at least one of the thresholds is about to be reached or the observer states become oscillatory due to sampling delay.

In this example there are two bandwidths to consider, the actual control loop bandwidth \u03c9and the equivalent bandwidth of the transient profile, . Part of the design procedure concerns selecting which of the two to use in (55). Since the observer is evaluated on how closely it tracks the states and more indicative than \u03c9, on how fast the plant states move, is the better choice although it is to be appreciated that either can be employed. Furthermore, taking other design issues like the sampling delay into consideration, a more appropriate minimum \u03c9is found through simulation and experimentation as\n\n\u03c9\u22485\u242310 \u2003\u2003(56)\n","An example for optimizing LADRC is now presented.

The method also includes designing a transient profile with the equivalent bandwidth of and selecting an \u03c9from (56). The method then includes setting \u03c9=\u03c9and simulating and\/or testing the LADRC in a simulator. The method also includes incrementally increasing \u03c9and \u03c9by the same amount until the noise levels and\/or oscillations in the control signal and output exceed the tolerance. The method also includes incrementally increasing or decreasing \u03c9and \u03c9individually, if necessary, to make trade-offs between different design considerations like the maximum error during the transient period, the disturbance attenuation, and the magnitude and smoothness of the controller.","In one example, the simulation and\/or testing may not yield satisfactory results if the transient design specification described by is untenable due to noise and\/or sampling limitations. In this case, control goals can be lowered by reducing and therefore \u03c9and \u03c9.

Given a \u201cblack box\u201d plant with input u and output y, the order, n, and bcan be estimated by allowing the plant to discharge energy stored internally so that it has a zero initial condition, (e.g., y(0)={dot over (y)}(0)= . . . y(0)=0) and then assuming \u0192(0)=0. The method includes applying a set of input signals and determining the initial slope of the response: {dot over (y)}(0), \u00ff(0), . . . . The method also includes determining the slope y(0) that is proportional to u(0) under various tests, (e.g., y(0)=ku(0)). Then the method includes setting n=i+1 and b=k.","Auto-Tuning Based on the New Scaling, Parameterization and Optimization Techniques","Auto-tuning concerns a \u201cpress button function\u201d in digital control equipment that automatically selects control parameters. Auto-tuning is conventionally realized using an algorithm to calculate the PID parameters based on the step response characteristics like overshoot and settling time. Auto-tuning has application in, for example, the start up procedure of closed-loop control (e.g., commissioning an assembly line in a factory). Auto-tuning can benefit from scaling and parameterization.","In some applications, dynamic changes in the plant during operations are so severe that controller parameters are varied from one operating point to another. Conventionally, gain-scheduling is employed to handle these situations. In gain-scheduling, the controller gains are predetermined for different operating points and switched during operations. Additionally, and\/or alternatively, self-tuning that actively adjusts control parameters based on real time data identifying dynamic plant changes is employed.","Common goals of these techniques are to make the controller parameter determination automatic, given the plant response to a certain input excitation, say a step function and to maintain a consistent controller performance over a wide range of operations, (e.g. making the controller robust).","Example systems, methods and so on described herein concerning scaling and parameterization facilitate auto-scaling model based controllers. When a transfer function model of a plant is available, the controller can be designed using either pole placement or loop shaping techniques. Thus, example scaling techniques described herein facilitate automating controller design and tuning for problems including, but not limited to, motion control, where plants are similar, differing only in dc gain and the bandwidth, and adjusting controller parameters to maintain high control performance as the bandwidth and the gain of the plant change during the operation.","In the examples, the plant transfer functions can be represented as (s)=kG(s\/\u03c9), where G(s) is given and known as the \u201cmother\u201d plant and k and \u03c9are obtained from the plant response or transfer function. Assuming the design criteria are similar in nature, differing only in terms of the loop gain bandwidth, \u03c9, the controller for similar plants can be automatically obtained by scaling the given controller, G(s, \u03c9), for G(s). This is achieved by combining the controller scaling, defined in equation (26), and \u03c9-parameterization to obtain the controller for (s)=kG(s\/\u03c9) as\n\n()=(,\u03c9)\/\u2003\u2003(67)\n","There are three parameters in (67) that are subject to tuning. The first two parameters, k and \u03c9, represent plant changes or variations that are determined. The third parameter, \u03c9, is tuned to maximize performance of the control system subject to practical constraints.","An example method for auto-tuning is now described. The auto-tuning method includes examining a plant G(s) and the nominal controller G(s, \u03c9). Given the plant G(s) and the nominal controller G(s, \u03c9), the method includes performing off-line tests to determine k and \u03c9for the plant. The method also includes using equation (67) to determine a new controller for the plant, (s)=kG(s\/\u03c9), obtained in the previous act. The method also includes optimizing \u03c9for the new plant.","An example method for adaptive self-tuning is now described. The adaptive self-tuning procedure includes examining a plant (s)=kG(s\/\u03c9), where k and \u03c9are subject to change during plant operation. Given the plant (s)=kG(s\/\u03c9), the method includes performing real time parameter estimation to determine k and \u03c9as they change. The method also includes determining when the performance of the control system is degraded beyond a pre-determined, configurable threshold and updating the controller using (67). The method also includes selectively decreasing \u03c9if the plant dynamics deviate significantly from the model kG(s\/\u03c9), which causes performance and stability problems. The method also includes selectively increasing \u03c9subject to \u03c9-optimization constraints if the plant model can be updated to reflect the changes of the plant beyond k and \u03c9.","The LADRC technique does not require the mathematical model of the plant. Instead, it employs a rough estimate of the single parameter b in the differential equation of the plant (57). This estimation is denoted as band is the sole plant parameter in LADRC. As the dynamics of the plant changes, so does b. Thus, bcan be estimated by rewriting (57) as\n\n=\u0192()+\u2003\u2003(69)\n\nand assuming the zero initial condition, (e.g., y(0)=0, i=1, 2, . . . n\u22121 and f(0)=0). Then b\u2248b can be estimated by using\n\n(0)\/(0)\u2003\u2003(70)\n\nwhere u(0) is the initial value of the input. It is to be appreciated that this method can be applied to both open loop and closed-loop configurations. For the auto-tuning purposes, the test can be performed off-line and a step input, u(t)=constant can be applied. The LADRC does not require bto be highly accurate because the difference, b\u2212b, is treated as one of the sources of the disturbance estimated by LESO and cancelled by control law.\n","The bobtained from the off-line estimation of b described above can be adapted for auto-tuning LADRC. An auto-tuning method includes, performing off-line tests to determine the order of the plant and b, selecting the order and the bparameter of the LADRC using the results of the off-line tests, and performing a computerized auto-optimization.","Using the controller scaling, parameterization and optimization techniques presented herein, an example computer implemented method  as shown in  can be employed to facilitate automatically designing and optimizing the automatic controls (ADOAC) for various applications. The applications include, but are not limited to, motion control, thermal control, pH control, aeronautics, avionics, astronautics, servo control, and so on.","The method , at , accepts inputs including, but not limited to, information concerning hardware and software limitations like the actuator saturation limit, noise tolerance, sampling rate limit, noise levels from sensors, quantization, finite word length, and the like. The method also accepts input design requirements like settling time, overshoot, accuracy, disturbance attenuation, and so on. Furthermore, the method also accepts as input the preferred control law form like, PID form, model based controller in a transfer function form, and model independent LADRC form. In one example, the method can indicate if the control law should be provided in a difference equation form. At , a determination is made concerning whether a model is available. If a model is available, then at  the model is accepted either in transfer function, differential equations, or state space form. If a model is not available, then the method may accept step response data at . Information on significant dynamics that is not modeled, such as the resonant modes, can also be accepted.","Once the method has received information input, the method can check design feasibility by evaluating the specification against the limitations. For example, in order to see whether transient specifications are achievable given the limitations on the actuator, various transient profiles can be used to determine maximum values of the derivatives of the output base on which the maximum control signal can be estimated. Thus, at , a determination is made concerning whether the design is feasible. In one example, if the design is not feasible, processing can conclude. Otherwise, processing can proceed to .","If the input information passes the feasibility test, then at , the method  can determine an \u03c9parameterized solution in one or more formats. In one example, the \u03c9solution can then be simulated at  to facilitate optimizing the solution.","In one example, to assist an engineer or other user, the ADOAC method provides parameterized solutions of different kind, order, and\/or forms, as references.

the velocities are generally controlled in open-loop by a conventional PI feed forward and control method, the industrial controller needs to retune the controller when the operating conditions are changed and external disturbance appears. In addition, the industrial controller has a poor performance in the presence of disturbance.","The Lyapunov based controller (LBC) improves the industrial controller by adding auxiliary error feedback terms to get better performance and disturbance rejection. However, the LBC has its own shortcomings since it is designed specifically to deal with disturbances, which are introduced in the model. Thus, when uncertainties appear in a real-world application, the LBC may require re-design of the controller.","In view of the conventional systems and methods, the exemplary embodiment was developed in the framework of an alternative control design paradigm, where the internal dynamics and external disturbances are estimated and compensated in real time. Therefore, it is inherently robust against plant variations and effective in disturbances and uncertainties in real application. In tension regulation, both open-loop and closed-loop options will be explored. In the open-loop case, the tension is not measured but indirectly controlled according to Equation (71) by manipulating the velocity variables. In the closed-loop case, a tension observer is employed in the tension feedback control.","A New Solution to Velocity and Tension Regulation","In developing new solutions for this difficult industry problem, performance and simplicity are stressed. That is, the new controller must have a much better performance than the existing ones, and it should also be simple to design, implement, and tune. In order to provide a comprehensive control structure, velocity and tension are both addressed. The three velocity loops are very similar in nature and finding a better solution would be a good first step. The tension problem is crucial because of its importance and its nonlinear dynamics. Based on the cost and performance considerations, two solutions are discussed herein: 1) if the tension model in (1) is reliable, it can be well controlled with fast and accurate velocity loops; 2) industry users are quite willing to install tension sensors for direct tension feedback control in return for better tension performance.  illustrates an exemplary velocity control system and  illustrates a tension control system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0273","num":"0278"},"figref":"FIG. 20","b":["2000","2002"]},"The ESO system can be employed in various forms of dynamic systems. These include but are not limited to electrical, mechanical, and chemical dynamic systems often concerned with control problems. The most advantage would be achieved if this solution closes the loop of the system to accommodate the estimated faults. However, without dynamically controlling the system this method would still provide a benefit for health status and fault detection without automatically attempting to fix the fault or optimize the health. In one example, ESO is employed in web processing systems, as discussed in detail below. Other applications can include power management and distribution.","The ESO offers a unique position between common methods. There are generally two ways that the health and fault diagnosis problem is approached. On one side of the spectrum the approach is model dependent analytical redundancy. The other side of the spectrum is the model-less approaches from fuzzy logic, neural networks and statistical component analysis. The ADRC framework offers a unique position between these two extremes without entering into hybrid designs. The ESO requires minimal plant information while estimating the rest of the unknown dynamics and unknown faults. Furthermore, built into the solution is a novel scheme for automatic closed loop fault accommodation.","Although a single velocity loop is illustrated, it is to be appreciated that the control system  can be applied separately for all three velocity loops v(t), v(t) and v(t). Velocity regulation in a process line is one of the most common control problems in the manufacturing industry. Since most processes are well-behaved, a PID controller is generally sufficient.

It is applied to both velocity and tension regulation problems. Although only one section of the process, including the carriage, the exit, and the process stages, is included in this study, the proposed method applies to both the upstream and downstream sections to include the entire web line. Simulation results, based on a full nonlinear model of the plant, have demonstrated that the proposed control algorithm results in not only better velocity control but also significantly less web tension variation. The proposed method can provide several benefits over conventional systems and methods. For example, 1) no detailed mathematical model is required; 2) zero steady state error is achieved without using the integrator term in the controller; 3) improved command following is achieved during the transient stage; 4) the controller is able to cope with a large range of the plant's dynamic change; and 5) excellent disturbance rejection is achieved.","Additional Forms of the Extended State Observer","Although various observers are known, such as high gain observers, sliding mode observers, and extended state observers (ESO), it is generally regarded that the extended state observer is superior in dealing with dynamic uncertainties, disturbances, and sensor noise. Controllers that use it depend on quick and accurate estimation in real time of the output and equivalent disturbance as well as their derivatives.","Observers are used to estimate variables that are internal to the system under control, i.e. the variables are not readily available outputs. Observers use a model of the system with correction terms and are run in continuous time. In order for continuous functions of time to run in hardware, however, they are often discretized and run at fixed sample rates. Discrete observers are often referred to as estimators.","The fundamental limiting factor of the controller and estimator is the sampling rate. Improving the ESO will improve the overall performance of the system. Up to this point, Euler approximations have been used to implement the ESO in hardware, which adversely affects its performance at slower sampling rates. As described in greater detail herein, several discrete variants of extended state observers are further identified and analyzed.","There are three main contributions, discrete implementation of the ESO or (DESO), the Generalization of the ESO and DESO or (GESO), and discrete parameterization of the DESO and GESO.","Performance enhancements are made to the ESO, both in formulation and in implementation. Although this is referred to as the DESO, a number of methods are disclosed. Here, the system model is first discretized using any number of methods; Euler, zero order hold (ZOH), and first order hold (FOH). Then, a predictive discrete estimator (PDE) from G. F. Franklin, J. D. Powell, and M. Workman, 3rd ed., Menlo Park, Calif.: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., 1998, pp. 328-337 is constructed from the discrete model and correction terms are determined in discrete time symbolically as a function of one tuning parameter. It is also formulated as a Current Discrete Estimator (CDE) from G. F. Franklin, J. D. Powell, and M. Workman, 3rd ed., Menlo Park, Calif.: Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., 1998, pp. 328-337 to maintain stable operation at lower sampling rates, a major limiting factor in controls. Typical discretization methods, such as a PDE, generate at least one sample of delay, whereas a CDE removes this delay by adding a current time step update to the estimated state. Next, Euler, zero order hold (ZOH), and first order hold (FOH) versions of all discrete matrices are determined symbolically to retain the simplicity of single parameter tuning. In the past, only an approximation using Euler integration was used. The problem is that the correction terms were determined in continuous time and become inaccurate when they are increased and at low sample rates. A second order example is used. Simple tests show that the CDE with ZOH performs the best.","The DESO is then generalized to estimate systems of arbitrary order, as well as to estimate multiple extended states. This is referred to as the generalized ESO or (GESO). This reformulation incorporates a disturbance model of arbitrary order, thus allowing the amount of disturbance rejection to be specified for different types of systems. Multiple extended states allow the estimation of higher order derivatives of the disturbance, which improves the estimation of the disturbance, allowing it to be more accurately cancelled. In the past, disturbances were restricted to first order and estimated using one extended state. The standard ESO does not make use of this information. A number of advantages exist for the current discrete version of the GESO. First, it offers better estimation and accordingly higher stability. Another implementation benefit is the minimal code space and processing power changes in addition to the standard ESO. The GESO also improves the performance and increases the range of operation while maintaining a similar level of complexity.","The immediate application of the DESO and GESO can be applied to ADRC controllers. Due to the current and eventual wide-spread application of both ADRC, the powerful GESO also has great immediate and future potential. Many plants or other control applications have physical upper limits for sample time and they will benefit from a stable and accurate estimation at lower sampling rates. They may also have a need to estimate higher order disturbances and they will benefit from higher performance control.","The preferred embodiments described herein allow these advanced control methods to be a practical solution for industry to transparently implement a high performance controller into their systems. The problem it solves is that the usability of the controller will no longer suffer dramatically as a result adding complexity to achieve higher performance. This means a significant reduction in time to design, implement, tune, and maintain each drive in every plant and\/or every application.","The preferred embodiment observers have been tested in simulation and hardware. Results on simple test applications and popular motion control problems have shown stable control at lower sampling rates than what are possible with the standard ESO. It was applied to ADRC with a tracking controller. The controller was tested in a realistic simulation and in hardware in a motion control servo-drive","Discrete Implementation of the Extended State Observer (DESO)","For the sake of simplicity, consider the continuous-time differential equation of a second order plant where u and y are the input and output, respectively, and b is a constant.\n\n()+\u2003\u2003(107)\n\nCombining the internal dynamics g(y,{dot over (y)},t) with an external disturbance w to form a generalized disturbance \u0192(y,{dot over (y)},t), the system is rewritten as\n\n()+\u2003\u2003(108)\n","An augmented state space model is constructed",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0349","num":"0354"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00071","num":"00071"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"."},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["Ax","Bu"],"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2062","mover":{"mi":"f","mo":"."}}}},{"mi":"y","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["Cx","Du"],"mo":"+"}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"A","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]}]}}},{"mi":"B","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mi":"b"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}}]}}},{"mi":"E","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"0"}},{"mtd":{"mn":"1"}}]}}}],"mo":[",",","]},{"mrow":[{"mi":"C","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":["1","0","0"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.7em","height":"1.7ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.7em","height":"1.7ex"}}}]}}},{"mi":"D","mo":"=","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"0"}}],"mo":","}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"109"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sup":"T "},"Next, an observer is created from the state space model.\n\n()\n\n\u2003\u2003(110)\n\nNote that {dot over (\u0192)} is ignored in (110) since it is unknown and is estimated by the correction term.

option for low sampling time requirements is ZOH, followed by the current discrete method. In this regard, the current discrete ESO with ZOH appears to be six to ten times better than the Euler approximation used in previous literature. The servo system in (145) was also simulated, resulting in an improvement of 5.3 times. In summary, the current discrete ESO with ZOH should be used for improved tracking accuracy as well as closed loop stability.","Generalization of the Extended State Observer (GESO)","Although a second order example was used in the previous section, (110) through (120) and (122) are applicable to a plant of arbitrary order with any number of extended states. For example, a class of general norder plants similar to (107) is represented as\n\n()+\u2003\u2003(126)\n\nwhere ydenotes the nderivative of the output and g(y, . . . , y, w, t) represents the internal dynamics. Two critical parameters are relative order n and high frequency gain b. Combining the unknowns into one generalized disturbance \u0192(y, . . . , y, w, t) results in\n\n=\u0192()+\u2003\u2003(127)\n\nNote that when represented with an equivalent input disturbance d=\u0192\/b, the design model becomes\n\n()=.\u2003\u2003(128)\n","As a signal, the type of disturbance can be characterized similar that of system type in a classical control. This specification is outlined in G. F. Franklin, J. D. Powell, and A. Emami-Naeni, 4th ed., Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 2002, pp. 239-242, 601-604 as the degree of a polynomial that approximates a signal, which directly relates to the number of times it is differentiated before reaching zero. Sometimes disturbances are represented by a set of cascaded integrators 1\/swith unknown input. Under this assumption, the plant is represented in  of  by two sets of cascaded integrators; one for the design model and another for the disturbance model. It will also be shown that this assumption leads to an estimated disturbance equivalent to that of a DOB.","In (109), previous ESO design, and in disturbances are considered to be piece-wise constant with h=1 or a series of steps. Now an ESO with h=1, 2, 3 can respectively track a square, triangular, or parabolic disturbance. A sinusoid is a different matter because it is infinitely differentiable. However, increasing h increases the degree of the polynomial and improves tracking of a sinusoid or any time varying disturbance. An ESO with h extended states for a relative norder plant is denoted as an ESO.","The new form is represented in continuous state space\n\n\n\n\u2003\u2003(129)\n\nwhere the state includes the disturbance \u0192 and its derivatives to be estimated.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0368","num":"0373"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00075","num":"00075"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":["x",{}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},{"mi":["x","n"]},{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mi":"x","mrow":{"mi":["n","h"],"mo":"+"}}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",",",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":["\u2026","\u2026"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}]}},"mi":"T"}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msup":[{"mi":"y","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}},{"mi":"y","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"0"}},{"mi":"f","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"h","mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",",",",",","\u2062",","],"mi":["\u2026","\u2026"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.6em","height":"0.6ex"}}}]}},"mi":"T"}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"130"}}]}}}}},"Since the new form consists of cascaded integrators, the A matrix simplifies to an n+h square matrix with ones on the super diagonal.

It is shown that the current discrete formulation is superior to the predictive one in reducing the delay associated with the sampling process. It is also demonstrated that the ZOH implementation improves estimation accuracy and stability without additional complexity to the user. To facilitate the ESO implementation for practitioners, the algorithm is derived symbolically with a single tuning parameter, i.e. the bandwidth of the observer. Another significant development is the generalization of the ESO for various types of systems and disturbances. Finally, a filter version shows that the estimated disturbance is equivalent to the DOB structure. Unlike the DOB, however, the ESO estimates suitable derivatives of the output, allowing for a straightforward controller design. The motion control problem is complex with many uncertainties, yet preliminary results show that this observer can achieve high performance over a wide range of system dynamics while remaining easy to use.","Tracking Control Applied to ADRC","The various preferred embodiment controllers and observers described herein can be used in conjunction with tracking components to further improve their function and performance.","The immediate application of the tracking enhancement can be applied to ADRC controllers. Due to the current and eventual wide-spread application of ADRC, the powerful tracking enhancement also has great immediate and future potential. Future uses also include the specific application of the tracking control method to new controllers.","The already proven ADRC control structure which works well for steady state set point control can now be extended to handle transient tracking control by use of the preferred embodiment tracking strategy. This enhancement allows these advanced control methods to be a practical solution for industry to transparently implement a high performance tracking controller into their systems. The problem it solves is that the usability of the controller will no longer suffer dramatically as a result adding complexity to achieve higher tracking performance. This means a significant reduction in time to design, implement, tune, and maintain each drive in every plant of every company.","The preferred embodiment tracking strategies have been applied to ADRC in the form of prefilters and\/or feed forward tends to make the desired closed loop transfer function of ADRC approximately equal to one or, more generally, have a relative order equal to zero.

With tracking control, the maximum error is reduced by a factor of 80 times during the initial transient shown in the first 1.5 seconds with only a slight increase in maximum control effort. There is also no adverse affect on the disturbance rejection property of the controller, shown when a square wave disturbance is added after 1.5 seconds.","This discrete tracking ADRC algorithm does not require an explicit mathematical model to achieve high performance. It has one or two tuning parameters that can be adjusted quickly, meaning that the level of expertise, time, and resources typically needed to construct a model, design a controller, and maintain performance is no longer required. This reduces manufacturing costs.","Multivariable ADRC","A general control method is given that can be applied to any MIMO system with the number of inputs greater than or equal to the number of outputs, not just jet engines. For proof of concept, it is then applied to dynamically decouple and control turbofan engines, i.e. jet engines. Since the jet engine is one of the most complex systems in existence, it is to be appreciated that this will provide a good example. If one is able to control it without knowing its mathematical model, which may be several thousand lines of code, then there is good chance this method will work on almost any plant. For example, this control system can be utilized with chemical processes, flight control of airplanes and missiles, CNC machine control, robotics, magnetic bearing, satellite attitude control, and process control.","Consider a system formed by a set of coupled norder input-output equations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0430","num":"0435"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00102","num":"00102"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msubsup":{"mi":"y","mn":"1","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"f","mn":"1"},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"b","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"U"}}},{"msubsup":{"mi":["y","q"],"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"n"}},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["f","q"]},"mo":"+","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["b","q"]},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"U"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mtext":{}}],"mi":"\u22ee"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"189"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sub":["i","i","1","p","1","q","i","i,1","i,p","i","i","i","0","1","q","1","q","0","1","q","0 ","0"],"sup":["(n) ","th ","T","T","(n\u22121)","(n\u22121)","(u)","(n)","(n)","(n)","T","T","T","T","T","(n)"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["Y","=F+B","U"]},"The idea is to estimate H and cancel it in real time, reducing the plant to a set of cascaded integrators.

These schedules along with actuator limits are then placed to constrain the outgoing control signal.","Multivariable ADRC Design Procedure with a Jet Engine Example","A generic design procedure is given for multivariable ADRC, using the application to the MAPPS jet engine  in  as an example. Test conditions are then discussed for the jet engine, followed by simulation results that compare the new algorithm to the current one, showing that similar performance can be achieved with much less design effort.","The design procedure for applying any of the new disturbance rejection techniques is uniquely characterized by the plant representation.\n\n\u2003\u2003(215)\n\nIn (215), the size of the input vector U and output vector Y should be known. The design procedure involves the determination of n and B as well as a method of tuning the controller.\n","A generic procedure is given, followed by a detailed explanation of each step with examples specific to the jet engine application.\n\n","Step One: The first step is to determine the number of control inputs p and controlled outputs q of the plant. If q>p, then multi-mode control should be used to make q\u2266pfor each of the j sub-controllers. It is preferable to make q=pwhich produces a square B matrix that allows the diagonal elements to become tuning parameters. Note that when B is a square matrix, B=B. A diagonal B matrix also permits the new technique to be reduced to multiple SISO techniques.","The jet engine in MAPPS, for example, has three actuator inputs that control seven performance parameter outputs. As a result, the jet engine controller consists of four separate regulators, each controlling only three outputs at a time. In this research, a simple form of multivariable ADRC using Euler integration is applied to the three-input three-output low speed regulator section and tested in simulation. This approach will isolate the affects that blending of multiple modes may have on the results.","Step Two: The second step is to determine the high frequency gain B of the system. This matrix will drastically change for different values of relative order n. The trick is that n must be known in order to determine B, and B must be known to determine n, a circular argument. As a result, steps two and three are interchangeable and an iterative process may be used in finding n and B. Nevertheless, there is only a problem if both are unknown. If this is the case, use the identity matrix for B to first determine n and then iterate. The B matrix can also be tuned in step seven. In practice, B needs to be initially within fifty percent of its true value and such a broad range is frequently known. However, if it is unknown or the system is too complex, then various system identification techniques can be used.","In MAPSS, the control signals are scaled to produce the proper units for each actuator input allowing each control signal to be within the same relative range. Thus, a logical starting point for B in the low speed regulator is the identity matrix.","Step Three: The third step is to determine the relative order n of the plant. The overall structure of the observer and controller depends on n which may or may not be the actual order of the system, depending on which dynamics are dominant. The idea is to find n=1, 2, or 3 that produces the smallest H, the smallest control signal, or the best closed loop results. Sometimes n is known or can be derived from a model of physical relationships. If none of the above techniques work, the last resort is trial and error. In this situation, start by assuming the system is first order and complete the remaining steps. Then assume the system is second order and repeat the process to see if the results are better. Then try third order, etc. Lower order is usually better.","Another consideration is that n can be determined for each plant input-output pair. For a particular output, the input yielding the lowest order with the highest gain is the most direct form of control and therefore should be used.","Since not all of the engine's states are measurable in MAPPS, the model for low speed regulation is represented as a nonlinear input-output vector function. Without explicit knowledge of system order, the simplest and lowest order case is first attempted.\n\n()\u2003\u2003(216)\n\nWhen a 3\u00d73 matrix B is used to approximate the actual high frequency gain B, the signal H is defined as\n\nH\u2261F(Y,U,t)\u2212BU\u2003\u2003(217)\n\nThe system then reduces to a form that has distinct terms to represent any internal or external dynamics and an instantaneous input.\n\n{dot over (Y)}\u2248H+BU\u2003\u2003(218)\n\nAfter running simulation tests at higher orders, first order was found to be sufficient for MAPPS. This also makes sense since the CLM is represented as a first order state space equation and the actuator dynamics are fast enough to be neglected.\n","Step Four: The fourth step is to determine the number of extended states h. This affects the overall structure of the ESO. For ADRC, select h=1, 2, or 3 based on the system type of the disturbance H or an external disturbance. The assumption h=1 will suffice in most cases and therefore is used in the remaining examples for the sake of clarity. Similar is true for determining the number of extended states m in the control law when using generalized PID.","Step Five: The fifth step is to apply the new algorithm to the system. The overall configuration is shown in . The structure of the observer and controller depends on the integer values selected for n and h. The most frequently used cases are now explicitly given for multivariable ADRC with Euler integration. In general, U is a p\u00d71 vector, Y is a q\u00d71 vector, B is a q\u00d7p matrix, and Land Kare q\u00d7q matrices.","When n=1 and h=1, the ESO equations become\n\n()+\n\n()\u2003\u2003(219)\n\nand the controller is represented by\n\n(()\u2212)\u2003\u2003(220)\n\nBy applying (219) and (220), the control configuration is then shown in . Notice that since the input to B is essentially BU, it is used as an input to the ESO instead of multiplying U by B. In doing so, there is only one matrix to adjust containing elements of B and it acts to scale the plant and allow the rest of the algorithm to be designed for a unity gain plant.\n","When n=2 and h=1, the ESO equations become\n\n()\n\n()+\n\n()\u2003\u2003(221)\n\nand the controller is represented by\n\n(()\u2212)\u2003\u2003(222)\n\nBy applying (221) and (222), the control configuration is then shown in .\n","The first order plant in (218) used for low speed regulation is represented by state equations where the extended state Xis assigned to track the general disturbance H\n\n\n\n{dot over (X)}={dot over (H)}\u2003\u2003(223)\n\nand the 3\u00d71 state vectors are defined as X=[X,X]=[Y,H].

As a result, additional anti-windup mechanisms are no longer required.","Step Six: The sixth step is to run the closed loop system in order to tune the controller and observer bandwidths.

The relative signs of each diagonal element were next determined, followed by magnitude adjustment.","Jet Engine Control Simulation Results","Turbofan engine performance varies from engine to engine due to manufacturing tolerances and deterioration from extended use. Even though degradation may eventually require an engine to be overhauled as limits are reached, the engine control system should be robust enough to keep the engine operating within safe limits for several thousand flight cycles. With repeated use, the engine components wear and performance is degraded. For example, turbine blades erode and clearances open up. In order to achieve the same level of thrust as a new engine, a deteriorated engine must run hotter and\/or faster. This shift from nominal operation increases with use, and eventually reaches the point where performance can not be maintained without compromising the safety of the engine or the life of its components. The degradation in performance is simulated in MAPSS by adjusting ten health parameters.","In most turbofan engines, thrust is calculated as a function of regulated and non-regulated variables, since it cannot be directly measured. Although regulated variables are maintained at their set points regardless of engine degradation, non-regulated parameters shift from their nominal values with deterioration. As a result, the closed-loop performance of the current model-based controller suffers as the engine wears. One of the objectives here is to control the transient thrust response of a deteriorated engine, making it behave as close to a new engine as possible.","Gas path analysis is a diagnostic technique that is used to estimate and trend health parameters by examining shifts in component health based upon gas path sensor measurements, i.e. pressures, temperatures, rotor speeds, and the known aero-thermodynamic relationships that exist between them. The health parameters follow an average degradation profile over the life span of the engine\n\n(1\u2212exp(\u2212))+\u2003\u2003(242)\n\nwhere a, b, and care constants for each health parameter and trepresents the physical age of the engine in effective flight cycles rather than it chronological age. The initial exponential rise is intended to simulate rub-in and new engine deterioration mechanisms. As the engine ages, the health parameter degradation tends to become more linear.\n","The component degradation values in percent resulting from health parameter changes are shown in Table IX.

The design procedure of the nominal controller basically involves running the CLM at several operating points to calculate a set of gains from Bode and Nyquist arrays at each operating point. The eighteen gains are each scheduled by six parameters, amounting to a total of 108 possible adjustments that can be made when configuring a single regulator on an actual engine. During the simulations, these gains change by as much as 200 percent.","In contrast, the five ADRC gains remained constant throughout all simulations.\n\n\u03c9=8, \u03c9=16=diag(0.2, \u22120.5, \u22120.5)\u2003\u2003(243)\n\nThere was no scheduling. Each gain was quickly tuned on the CLM just as if it would be on an actual engine. The engine was then simulated at multiple operating points to verify the performance of the new controller.\n","Preliminary results of these simulation tests on a rather complex turbofan model show the power of the dynamic decoupling method proposed here. Mathematical models are often inaccurate when representing nonlinear multivariable systems. Gain scheduling helps in this area, but makes tuning even worse than it was before. Where modern multivariable control schemes are limited, this approach appears well suited for complex nonlinear systems with incomplete model information. The ultimate goal is to offer a degree of tunability to account for variations between engines without sacrificing performance, while being robust enough to withstand slow degradations from aging or damage.","Health Monitoring and Fault Detection using the Extended State Observer","This research combines the unique concept of design model disturbance estimation with health monitoring and fault diagnosis. The tools developed in the previous description can be directly applied to health monitoring with minimal model information. The unique application uses the ESO as a disturbance estimator with minimal plant information to estimate system dynamics and disturbances. The estimated disturbance is then used for health and fault diagnosis. Most dynamic health and fault monitoring estimators require significant model information to work effectively. Since the ESO use a simple design model that works on a wide variety of plants, estimator design can be reduced to single parameter tuning. In  of , the general concept of fault monitoring is illustrated.","Decomposing Disturbances for Fault Diagnosis","The following gives a more detailed explanation of the concept of using the ESO for health and fault monitoring.

In each case, assumptions are made that the other effects are negligible. Likewise, an overarching framework to integrate the problem of control, fault diagnosis and health monitoring and accommodation is an open problem for research.","Disturbance Estimation for Control Health Diagnosis","Recently large saving has been provided by six sigma techniques to actively monitor the health of a control loop performance by (C.
