Technical Field","The present invention relates to a sputtering target for an oxide semi-conductor, comprising InGaO(ZnO) crystal phase and a process for producing thereof, as well as a forming of an oxide semi-conductor thin film or a thin film transistor using the sputtering target.","2. Background of the Art","A field effect type transistor is widely used for a unit electron device for a semi-conductor memory integrated circuit, a high-frequency signal amplifier device, a device for driving a liquid crystal, and is the most practically used electric device.","Among the above, because of recent dramatic progress in a display device, a thin film transistor (TFT) is heavily used as a switching device for driving a display device by adding drive voltage to a display device among various kind of a display device such as a liquid crystal display device (LCD), an electroluminescence display device (EL), or a field emission display (FED).","As for the material thereof, silicon semi-conductor compounds are most commonly used. In general, single-crystal silicon is used for a high-frequency signal amplifier device or an element for integrated circuit which requires high-speed operation. Amorphous silicon is used for a device for driving a liquid crystal to meet a request for a larger-area.","However, a crystalline silicon thin film requires, for example, high temperature of 800\u00b0 C. or more during crystallization, and thus it is difficult to compose it on a glass substrate or an organic material substrate. Therefore, there are several problems, for example, the film can be formed only on an expensive substrate having high heat resistance such as a silicon wafer or quartz, and the production thereof requires a lot of energy and many steps.","In addition, it was difficult for a crystalline silicon semi-conductor to uniformity make a large area semi-conductor to be applied to a big screen TV, and to reduce costs by cutting a number of masks down.","An amorphous silicon semi-conductor capable of forming under relatively low temperature (amorphous silicon) has lower mobility and slower switching speed than those of crystalline semi-conductor. Therefore, when the semi-conductor is used for a switching device for driving a display device, displaying high-speed motion picture cannot be achieved sometimes.","Currently, a switching device for driving a display device mainly uses a device using a silicon semi-conductor film. This is because, a silicon thin film has various good properties such as stability, good workability, and high switching speed. This silicon thin film is generally prepared by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.","For example, a conventional thin film transistor (TFT) has an opposite stagger structure which laminates a gate electrode, a gate insulation layer, a semi-conductor layer such as a hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), a source electrode and drain electrode on a substrate such as a glass. This TFT is used for an image sensor, as well as a driving device for a flat panel display represented by an active matrix type liquid crystal display, within a field of a large-area device. Among these usages, high mobility is required for higher definition and higher speed in driving frequency, even though conventional amorphous silicon is used.","Under these situations, recently, an oxide semi-conductor thin film using oxides is coming up, because it is to make a large area and to reduce costs by cutting a number of masks down rather than using crystalline silicon semi-conductor, and the film has excellent stability and high mobility rather than those of an amorphous silicon semi-conductor (amorphous silicon).","However, among those types of oxide semi-conductors, an oxide semi-conductor using zinc oxide and a multi-crystalline film has low field effect mobility (hereinafter, simply said as \u201cmobility\u201d): about 1 cm\/V\u00b7sec, and low ON-OFF ratio. In addition, leak current is easy to occur, and thus it was difficult to put it into industrial, practical use. Furthermore, many attempts were taken place for an oxide semi-conductor using zinc oxide, but the following problems were present when a film was formed by a sputtering method which is commercially and commonly used.","That is, an oxide semi-conductor film containing ZnO as a major component easily causes oxygen defect, many occurrences of carrier electrons, and difficulties in lessen electric conductivity. During film forming by using a sputtering method, abnormal discharges were occurred, stability for forming films is lost, and thus uniformity and reproducibility of the obtained film were declined. Therefore, for, example, when it is used as an active layer (channel layer) of a TFT (thin film transistor), even if no gate voltage is added, a lot of current is passed between a source terminal and a drain terminal, thus normally off of a TFT cannot be achieved. It is difficult to enlarge ON-OFF ratio of a transistor. Further, there were possibility that mobility is low, ON-OFF ratio is low, leak current is high, pinch-off is unclear, normally-ON is easy to occur, and thus properties in TFT are lowered. The obtained film has less chemical resistance, and thus process or usage environment is limited, for example, wet-etching is difficult. Further, a film must be formed under high pressure in order to improve its properties, but film-forming speed is slow as well as 700\u00b0 C. or more of high temperature is required, and thus there are problems in industrialization. In addition, TFT properties such as mobility in a bottom-gate structure is low, and thus a TFT device structure is also limited, for example, top-gate structure and 200 nm or more of thickness are required for raising its properties.","In order to solve these problems, a method for producing an amorphous oxide semi-conductor film composed of indium oxide, gallium oxide and zinc oxide so as to drive a thin film transistor has been discussed. Further, there was discussion for industrially preparing an amorphous oxide semi-conductor comprising indium oxide, gallium oxide and zinc oxide by a sputtering method which is suitable for commercial production. Sputtering targets for the method were also discussed. For example, a sputtering target comprising a homologous structure of InGaZnO(InGaO(ZnO)) in which the content of Ga in atom ratio is the same as that of In is disclosed (Patent Document 1).","In addition, a sputtering target only having a homologous structure of InGaMgOand a sputtering target only having a homologous structure of YbFeOis also disclosed (Patent Document 2). However, if a sputtering target composed of oxides comprising In, Ga, Zn is film-formed by using methods disclosed in these documents, problems were raised, e.g. the content ratio of In and Ga in atom ratio is shifted between a semi-conductor film and the sputtering target, properties of a thin film transistor was changed during long term film forming (decline in reproducibility), film-forming speed was changed during continuous film forming. In addition, it was reported that crystal of InGaO(ZnO) was obtained by sintering very small amount of a mix powder fin a platinum tube at each temperature (1150, 1250, 1350, 1550\u00b0 C.) for a long time (3 to 14 days) (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). However, it is difficult to form a film using thus obtained crystalline powder, and thus no production method for a sputtering target which is capable of film-forming by a sputtering method was discussed.","Meanwhile, there was a discussion about an effect cased by inhibiting the formation of a GaOcrystalline phase having high insulation (Patent Document 3). However, there was no discussion about effects by a crystalline phase where a peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree based on X-ray diffraction such as a ZnGaOcrystalline phase, a InOcrystalline phase, a ZnO crystalline phase, a InO(ZnO)crystalline phase, and a InGaOcrystalline phase.","At the same time, as an embodiment of a composition having Ga content which is smaller than In content in atom ratio, an example for forming an amorphous oxide semi-conductor and a thin film transistor using an In\u2014Ga\u2014Zn\u2014O sintered body having metal ratio of In:Ga:Zn=30:15:55 are disclosed (Patent Document 4). If this sintered body disclosed in this document is used as a sputtering target, several problems are occurred, for example, shifting composition ratio of In and Ga in atom ratio between a film-formed semi-conductor film and the sputtering target, low reproducibility of a thin film transistor, occurring variation during forming a thin film transistor to its large area form, and a lot of particles being appeared. Thus there was obstacle in practical use.","As for another embodiment of a composition having Ga content which is smaller than In content in atom ratio, a sputtering target comprising ZnO as a main component. However, because of ZnO being a main component, a crystalline phase other than InGaO(ZnO) was formed, density of a target becomes low, resistance becomes high, and acid-tolerance at the making of a semi-conductor film becomes low. Therefore, the target was not suitable for a field effect transistor (Patent Documents 5 and 6).","As stated above, a conventional target comprising In, Ga and Zn includes a crystalline phase other than InGaO(ZnO). Therefore, composition ratio readily shifts between a target and a film-formed semiconductor film, bulk resistance was high, uniformity was low, variation of film-forming speed during the film-forming was high, and many particles were appeared. When such a target was used for film-forming of a semi-conductor, there were problems about appearance of variation when it was prepared to its large area form.\n\n","The first object of the present invention is to provide a sputtering target having less variation (high reproducibility) in properties of a thin film transistor even if long time film forming is conducted.","The second object of the present invention is to provide a sputtering target having excellent transistor properties such as mobility, S value, ON-OFF ratio, etc. when a thin film transistor is formed.","The third object of the present invention is to provide a sputtering target comprising an oxide sintered body indicating only a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO), and having uniform bulk resistance and less variation in film-forming speed during film-forming.","The present inventors intently made their studies and then the inventors conceived the present invention, since they found that a sputtering target comprising an oxide sintered body indicating only a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO) has several features, for example, composition ratio of In and Ga of the target is reflected to a semi-conductor, properties of a thin film transistor does not change much during film-forming for a long time (high reproducibility), and variation in film-forming speed during film-forming is small.","Namely, using a conventional target caused several problems, for example, the content ratio of In and Ga in atom ratio was shifted between a semi-conductor film and the sputtering target, properties of a thin film transistor was changed during film-forming for a long time (decline in reproducibility), and film-forming speed was changed during continuous film forming. However, if preparation were done by using a sputtering target having small or no peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree based on X-ray diffraction for a preparation, it was found that the above problems could be solved. In addition, by using this target, a good transistor having high mobility, small S value and high ON-OFF ratio could be obtained.","It was also found that such a sputtering target comprising an oxide sintered body indicating only a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO) can be obtained by setting a content ratio of In and Ga within a certain range during sintering a formed body, and sintering at a certain temperature, time and atmosphere or sintering a formed body comprising a composite oxide.","The present invention may relate to the followings.","[1] A sputtering target

when a thin film transistor is formed.","In addition, a sputtering target comprising an oxide sintered body indicating only a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO), and having uniform bulk resistance and small variation in film-forming speed during film-forming can be produced.","A sputtering target of the present invention is composed of an oxide sintered body comprising a compound having a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO), in which a peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree based on X-ray diffraction is 3% or less of the maximum peak of InGaO(ZnO).","(1-1) Homologous Crystal Structure","\u201cHomologous crystal structure\u201d is a crystal structure composed of \u201cnatural superlattice\u201d structure having long-cycle where crystalline layers having different materials are laminated. When a crystal cycle or the thickness of each thin film layer is nanometer order, unique properties different from those of a single material or a mixed crystal where each layer is uniformly mixed can be obtained by the combination of a chemical composition of said each layer or thickness of a layer. A crystal structure of a homologous phase can be confirmed by, for example, X-ray diffraction pattern of a target ground powder, or by the correspondence with X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase assumed by composition ratio. Specifically, it can be confirmed when the pattern corresponds to X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal structure of homologous phase obtained from JCPDS (Joint Committee of Powder Diffraction Standards) cards. The presence of InGaO(ZnO) can be confirmed by showing if a pattern is identical to a pattern of JCPDS card No. 38-1104 based on X-ray diffraction.","If the pattern is identical (structure is identical), a peak may shift by changes of lattice constant.","The phrase \u201ca peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree based on X-ray diffraction is 3% or less of the maximum peak of InGaO(ZnO)\u201d means that peak strength between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree based on X-ray diffraction, which does not belong to a pattern indicating an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure, is 3% or less of peak strength of the maximum peak of InGaO(ZnO) (usually in around 2\u03b8=30.8 degree). This peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree is preferably 2% or less, more preferably 1% or less, and especially preferably not observed. If the peak strength is 3% or less, it is preferable since uniformity of bulk resistance, variation of film-forming speed, and appearance of particle are improved. If no peak between 2\u03b8=62 degree and 63 degree is observed, it is preferable since some effects can be obtained, e.g. composition ratio of In and Ga of a target is reflected to a semi-conductor, and properties of a thin film transistor are less changed (high reproducibility) when film-forming is conducted for a long time.","Peaks indicating crystals of compounds of GaO, ZnGaO, ZnO, InO, InGaO, and InO(ZnO)which do not belong to a pattern indicating an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure are 5% or less of the maximum peak of InGaO(ZnO) (usually in around 2\u03b8=30.8 degree), preferably 3% or less, and more preferably 1% or less. It is especially preferable that peaks which do not belong to a pattern indicating an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure are not confirmed. In the present invention, the phrase \u201cindicates only a homologous crystal structure represented by InGaO(ZnO)\u201d means that, if the oxide sintered body of the present invention is analyzed by X-ray diffraction, no peak belonging to pattern indicating the above crystal structures other than InGaO(ZnO) is detected. If peaks which do not belong to pattern indicating an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure are small, it is preferable since uniformity of bulk resistance and variation of film-forming speed are improved. If peaks which do not belong to pattern indicating an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure are not confirmed, it is preferable that composition ratio of In and Ga of a target is reflected to a semi-conductor, and properties of a thin film transistor are less changed (high reproducibility) when film-forming is conducted for a long time.","The oxide crystal indicating an InGaO(ZnO)crystal phase basically has a crystal structure having octahedral edge-sharing of InO. If there is octahedral edge-sharing of InO, it is preferable since electrically-conducting path will be formed and then mobility will become high.","The sputtering target of the present invention may contain an oxygen defect. That is, it is not necessary to meet stoichiometry. Oxygen defect ratio between the surface and the inside of a sputtering target is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 10 fold.","Area of a Ga-rich phase by the EPMA measurement of cross section of an oxide sintered body is preferably 5% or less, preferably 3% or less, and more preferably 1% or less. If the Ga-rich phase is 5% or less, some effects are expected, e.g. uniformity of bulk resistance or relative density of a target is improved.","In addition, as long as an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure is indicated by X-ray diffraction, oxygen defect may be present.","(1-2) Containing Elements","A part of In in InGaO(ZnO) contained in an oxide sintered body of the sputtering target of the present invention is preferably subjected to solid solution substitution by a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences. In a case of solid solution substitution by a metal element (X) having positive four valences, it is preferable that bulk resistance preferably becomes more lowered. The metal element (X) having positive four or more valences contains one or more elements selected from the group consisting of tin, zirconium, germanium, cerium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, and titanium. The substitution of a part of elements of In by a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences can be confirmed by a shift of interstitial distance calculated from X-ray diffraction, or structural analysis using high brightness emitted light. Specifically, lattice constant may be decided by Rietveld analysis.","If the sputtering target of the present invention contains a metal element (X) having positive four valences, an atom ratio of (the metal element (X) having positive four or more valences)\/(all the metal elements in the oxide sintered body) is preferably 100 ppm to 10000 ppm, more preferably 200 ppm to 5000 ppm, especially preferably 500 ppm to 3000 ppm. An atom ratio of (the metal element (X) having positive four or more valences)\/(all the metal elements in the oxide sintered body) is preferably 100 ppm or more, since effect from the addition becomes increase, bulk resistance becomes lowered, and in-plane uniformity of resistance is improved. 10000 ppm or less of an atom ratio of (the metal element (X) having positive four or more valences)\/(all the metal elements in the oxide sintered body) is also preferable, because a compound represented by InGaO(ZnO) can be formed, and the oxide semi-conductor film formed by using the sputtering target of the present invention is stable.","The substitution by a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences can be confirmed by a shift of interstitial distance calculated from X-ray diffraction, or structural analysis using high brightness emitted light.","The sputtering target of the present invention contains Indium element (In), Gallium element (Ga), and Zinc element (Zn). More preferably, the target contains a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences. The metal element (X) having positive four or more valences contains one or more elements selected from the group consisting of tin, zirconium, germanium, cerium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, and titanium. By adding these metal elements (X) to the oxide of the present invention, bulk resistance of the oxide itself can be lowered, and abnormal discharge appeared on a sputtering target during sputtering the oxide can be inhibited.","An oxide thin film obtained from a sputtering target using the oxide of the present invention is amorphous, the added metal having positive four valences had no doping effect, and thus a film where electron density is sufficiently lowered can be obtained. Therefore, when a thin film transistor is formed by using the oxide membrane as an oxide semi-conductor film, stability becomes high, Vth shift caused by bias stress is inhibited, and thus operation as a thin film transistor becomes stable.","Vth means voltage during rising drain current when gate voltage (drain voltage) is applied. Vth shift means variation of Vth when gate voltage (drain voltage) is applied. If Vth shift is small, it can be said that the operation as a thin film transistor is stable.","Atom ratio of each element; Indium element (In), Gallium element (Ga), and Zinc element (Zn) is preferably in a range meeting the following formulae (1) to (3) so that an InGaO(ZnO) crystal structure can be readily formed, and balance among mobility, On-OFF ratio and S value becomes good during the forming of a thin film transistor.\n\n0.20\u2266In\/(In+Zn+Ga)\u22660.60\n\n0.10\u2266Ga\/(In+Zn+Ga)\n\n0.10\u2266Zn\/(In+Zn+Ga)\n","wherein, \u201cIn,\u201d \u201cGa,\u201d and \u201cZn\u201d are numbers of atoms for Indium element (In), Gallium element (Ga), and Zinc element (Zn), respectively.","If In\/(In+Zn+Ga) is 0.2 or more, it is preferable since relative density is not lowered, and that mobility of a thin film transistor (TFT) obtained from the sputtering target is improved. If In\/(In+Zn+Ga) is 0.6 or less, it is preferable since nodule is not appeared, and OFF current does not become higher.","If Ga\/(In+Zn+Ga) is 0.10 or more, it is preferable since White spot is not appeared, and that OFF current during the preparation of a thin film transistor (TFT) obtained from the sputtering target does not become higher.","If Zn\/(In+Zn+Ga) is 0.10 or more, it is preferable since White spot is not appeared, and that there is no influence when a thin film transistor (TFT) obtained from the sputtering target is prepared or when wet-etching is conducted.","More preferable atom ratio is\n\n0.25\u2266In\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.55\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n0.17\u2266Ga\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.26\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n0.21\u2266Zn\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.60\u2003\u2003(3), and\n\nespecially preferable atom ratio is\n\n0.34\u2266In\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.50\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n0.17\u2266Ga\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.26\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n0.24\u2266Zn\/(In+Ga+Zn)\u22660.49\u2003\u2003(3).\n\n(1-3) Relative Density\n","Relative density can be controlled by primary particle diameter or specific surface area of a crude powder; a method of preparing or drying a mixed powder; a forming method or a forming pressure during the preparation of a formed body; and sintering temperature, sintering time, rate of temperature increase, sintering atmosphere, pressure during sintering. Relative density of the sputtering target of the present invention is 95% or more, preferably 97% or more, and more preferably 99% or more. If relative density of a sputtering target is 95% or more, it is preferable since no abnormal electric discharge is occurred, and film forming rate is increased when sputtering is conducted.","The relative density is calculated from theoretical density calculated from density of a crude powder and density of a sintered body determined by Archimedes method.","(1-4) Average Particle Diameter of Crystals","The average particle diameter for each oxide crystal can be controlled by primary particle diameter or specific surface area of a crude powder; a method of preparing or drying a mixed powder; a forming method or a forming pressure during the preparation of a formed body; and sintering temperature, sintering time, rate of temperature increase, sintering atmosphere, pressure during sintering. The average particle diameter is preferably 20 \u03bcm or less, more specifically 10 \u03bcm or less, and especially preferably 5 \u03bcm or less.

If a half band width of the maximum peak (2\u03b8=around 30.8 degree) of X-ray diffraction is 2.0 degree or less, it is preferable since relative density becomes high and bulk resistance becomes low.","(1-5) Bulk Resistance","The bulk resistance can be controlled by primary particle diameter or specific surface area of a crude powder; a method of preparing or drying a mixed powder; a forming method or a forming pressure during the preparation of a formed body; and sintering temperature, sintering time, rate of temperature increase, sintering atmosphere, pressure during sintering.

The bulk resistance is determined by four-point probe method using LORESTA (Mitsubishi chemical Co.), etc. If the bulk resistance is 20 m\u03a9cm or less, it is preferable since abnormal electric discharge can be inhibited during sputtering.","The sputtering target of the present invention is desirably prepared by the following steps.","(a) mixing a crude oxide powder (mixing step);","(b) forming the obtained mixture (forming step); and","(c) sintering the obtained formed body (sintering step).","In addition, the sputtering target of the present invention may be prepared by a method including the following essential steps and the following optional steps.","(a) an essential step for mixing a crude oxide powder composed of at least indium oxide, gallium oxide, and zinc oxide (mixing step);","(a)\u2032 an optional step for heating the obtained mixture at 500 to 1200\u00b0 C. for 1 to 100 hours (calcining step);","(b) an essential step for forming the obtained mixture (forming step);","(c) an essential step for sintering the obtained formed body (sintering step);","(d) an optional step for reducing the sintered body obtained by the sintering step (reducing step); and","(e) an optional step for processing the sintered body to a configuration suitable for loading the body to a sputtering device (processing step).","(a) Mixing Step","Mixing step is an essential step for mixing metal oxides used as crude materials for a sputtering target.","Crude materials may comprise metal oxides such as oxides of Indium element (In), Gallium element (Ga), Zinc element (Zn) and a metal element (X) having positive four or more valences.","An average diameter of a zinc compound powder used as the crude material is preferably smaller than that of an indium compound powder. The average diameter of a metal oxide powder for the crude materials can be measured by a method described in JIS R 1619. Indium compounds include, for example, indium oxide and indium hydroxide. Zinc compounds include, for example, zinc oxide and zinc hydroxide. Oxide is preferable for each compound because of its ease of sintering or its rareness of remaining by-products.","Each of the above crude materials is mixed and ground by known mixing or grinding processes.

If the purity of each crude material is 99.9% (3N) or more, properties of a semi-conductor is not declined by impurities and thus credibility is sufficiently kept. Specifically, if Na content is less than 100 ppm, credibility at the time of making a thin-film transistor is preferably going up.","The above-mentioned crude oxide powder is mixed. The mixing is preferably conducted by using a normal mixing and grinding machine, for example, a wet-type ball mill, a beads mill or an ultrasonic device so as to mix and grind it uniformly.

The difference in the specific surface areas for each crude oxide powder is 5 m\/g or less, preferably 3 m\/g. If the difference in the specific surface area is smaller, the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently, and especially, it is preferable that no gallium oxide particle is remained in an obtained oxide. In addition, it is preferable that the specific surface area for an indium oxide powder is substantially the same as that for a gallium oxide powder, so that the crude oxide powder can be ground and mixed more efficiently. In this connection, the specific surface area can be determined by, for example, BET method. It is preferable that the crude material is a mixed powder comprising an oxide indium powder, an oxide gallium powder, a zinc powder or a complex oxide powder having the specific surface area of 3 to 16 m\/g in which the specific area of the whole powders is 3 to 16 m\/g.

In this connection, the mixed powder is preferably ground so that the specific surface area after the grinding is 1.0 to 3.0 m\/g higher than that of the crude mixed powder, or so that an average median diameter (d50) after the grinding is around 0.8 to 2 \u03bcm. An oxide indium powder, an oxide gallium powder, a zinc powder or a complex oxide powder thereof can be used for a crude material. By using such a crude powder controlled by the above, an oxide sintered body having a high density can be obtained without any calcining step. A reducing step becomes also unnecessary.","It is preferable that increase in the specific surface area of the above-mentioned crude mixed powder is 1.0 m\/g or more, or that the average median diameter (d50) after grinding the crude mixed powder is 1 \u03bcm or less, since sintered density is sufficiently high. It is also preferable that increase in the specific surface area of the crude mixed powder is 3.0 m\/g or less, or that the average median diameter (d50) after grinding the crude mixed powder is 0.6 \u03bcm or more, since contamination (the amount of impurity contaminated) from grind devices during grinding is not increase.","The value of the specific surface area for each powder is determined by BET method. The value of the median diameter (d50) of grain size distribution for each powder is determined by a grain size distribution meter. These values can be controlled by grinding the powder using a dry-type grinding method or a wet-type grinding method.","The variation range of distribution of the mixed powder of Ga and In after grinding is preferably within 0.5%.

By the calcining, density of a sputtering target obtained at the end can be readily increased. The calcining step may or may not be conducted, but if the calcining step is not conducted, it is preferable since steps are reduced drastically, and difference in composition between charged amount and a target is reduced.","If the calcining step is not conducted, the specific surface area of an indium oxide is preferably 6 to 10 m\/g, the specific surface area of a gallium oxide is preferably 5 to 10 m\/g, and the specific surface area of a zinc oxide is preferably 2 to 4 m\/g.

Such a heating condition at 500\u00b0 C. or more for 1 hour or more is desirable, since thermal decomposition of an indium compound, a zinc compound and a tin compound is sufficiently conducted. A heating condition at 1200\u00b0 C. or less for 100 hours or less is also desirable, since sublimation of zinc is inhibited and particles rarely create a bulk.","The obtained post-calcined mixture is preferably ground before the following forming step and the sintering step. This grinding of the post-calcined mixture is preferably conducted by a ball mill, a roll mill, a palm mill, or a jet mill. Average particle diameter of the post-calcined mixture after the grinding is, for example, 0.01 to 3.0 \u03bcm, and preferably 0.1 to 2.0 \u03bcm. It is preferable that the average particle diameter of the post-calcined mixture is 0.01 \u03bcm or higher, since sufficient bulk specific gravity is retained, and it is easy to handling it. It is also preferable that the average particle diameter of the post-calcined mixture is 1.0 \u03bcm or less, since density of a sputtering target obtained at the end can be readily increased.","The average particle diameter of the post-calcined mixture can be determined by a method described in JIS R 1619.","(b) Forming Step","The forming step is a step of press forming the mixture of metal oxides (or the post-calcined mixture if the above calcining step is present) so as to make a formed body. By this step, the mixture (or post-calcined mixture) is formed in a configuration appropriate for a sputtering target. If there is a calcining step, micro powders of the obtained post-calcined mixture may be granulated and then formed in a desirable configuration by a press forming.","Forming processing which can be used in the present invention includes, for example, uniaxial compression, metal molding, casting forming, injection molding, and so on. In order to obtain a sintered body (a sputtering target) having high sintered density, forming by cold isostatic press (CIP) is preferable.","During the forming processing, a forming auxiliary agent such as polyvinyl alcohol, methyl cellulose, polywax, or oleic acid may be used.","The press forming may be conducted by well-known forming methods such as Cold Press method and Hot Press method.

If the rate of temperature increase is 30\u00b0 C.\/hour or more, decomposition of oxides does not progress, and no pinhole is appeared. If the rate of temperature decrease for cooling is 30\u00b0 C.\/hour or more, the composition ratio of In or Ga does not change.","The Cold Press method and Hot Press method are explained in detail below. By the Cold Press method, a mixed powder is filled in a forming die to prepare a formed body and then the body is sintered. By Hot Press method, a mixed powder is directly sintered within a forming die.","As for the Cold Press method of the dry-processes, a crude material obtained after a grinding step is dried by a spray dryer and so on, and then formed. The forming may be conducted by methods known in the art, for example, press forming, cold isostatic press, metal molding, casting forming, or injection molding. In order to obtain a sintered body (a sputtering target) having high sintered density, the forming is preferably conducted by a method accompany with cold isostatic press (CIP).

The body comprises a lower forming die having one or more drain holes, a filter having water flowable property in which filter is placed on the lower forming die, and a forming die flame which clips the filter from the upper side through a seal material for sealing it. Each of the lower forming die, the forming die flame, the sealing material and the filter is disassemblably structured. By using the filtering forming die which vacuum-pumps water in the slurry out only from the filter side, slurry containing mixed powder, ion-exchange water and an organic additive is prepared. This slurry is injected in the filtering forming die, and then a formed body is prepared by vacuum-pumping water in the slurry out only from the filter side.

When a large target is prepared, normal pressure sintering is especially preferable so that even large target is easily prepared uniformly. Sintering is preferably conducted under oxygen atmosphere by flowing oxygen or under compressed pressure. Under these conditions, zinc transpiration is inhibited, and a sintered body having no void (cavity) can be obtained. White-spot (decolorization), which is caused by the presence of in-plane or perpendicular composition distribution in a target, can be inhibited.","Oxygen atmosphere can be made by atmosphere, by a mix gases comprising oxygen, or by compressed oxygen.

Especially, when the thin film transistor is used for an organic light emitting display, because of direct current drive, S value is preferably 0.3V\/dec or less so as to enormously reduce electric power consumption.","(3-3) Specific Making Method of a Thin Film Transistor","A substrate such as a grass substrate is prepared, and then Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm (a contact layer), Au having thickness of 10 to 300 nm (a connecting layer), and Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm (a contact layer) are laminated in this order. The laminated layers are formed a gate electrode by a photo-lithography method and a lift-off method.","SiOfilm having thickness of 50 to 500 nm is formed on the laminated layers by a TEOS-CVD method, and then a gate insulation film is formed. A film forming method for a gate insulation film may be a sputter method, but a CVD method such as a TEOS-CVD method or a PECVD method is preferable.","A sputtering target composed of the oxide of the present invention is used as a target, and then an amorphous oxide thin film (semi-conductor) composed of In\u2014Ga\u2014Zn\u2014O oxide having thickness of 5 to 300 nm is deposited as a channel layer by a RF sputter method. An element on which the obtained thin film is deposited is cut into an appropriate size, and then heat treatment is conducted under ambient pressure at 100 to 450\u00b0 C. for 6 to 600 minutes. The obtained element is further laminated by Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm (a contact layer), Au having thickness of 10 to 300 nm (a connecting layer), and Ti having thickness of 1 to 100 nm (a contact layer) in this order to form a source electrode and a drain electrode by a photo-lithography method and a lift-off method. SiOfilm having thickness of 50 to 500 nm is further formed on the laminated layers by a sputter method as a protective film. A method for film-forming a protective film may be a CVD method. In this connection, by changing order of steps, making of a protective film (etching stopper) may be conducted prior to the preparation of the above source electrode and drain electrode.","Heat treatment of 150 to 350\u00b0 C. for 5 minutes to 5 hours is preferably added after the preparation of the protective film (etching stopper). By adding the heat treatment, the surface of a semi-conductor which is reduced at the time of film forming of the protective film is oxidized, and thus OFF current can be reduced.","The amorphous oxide thin film obtained above may be used as-is, or by heating treatment, used as a thin film transistor, a channel layer for a thin film transistor, or a semi-conductor film of a solar cell or a gas sensor. In addition, this film can be used for an electrode as a conductive film by reducing resistance via reduction treatment.","(4-1) The thin film transistor prepared by the present invention is explained below. The thin film transistor includes a substrate, a semi-conductor layer, a protective layer for a semi-conductor layer, a gate insulation film or an electrode.","Substrate","As for a substrate, any substrate known in the present technical field may be used without limitation. For example, a glass substrate such as alkaline silicate type glass, alkali-free glass, or quartz glass; a silicon substrate; a resin substrate such as acryl, polycarbonate, or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN); or a polymer film base material such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyamide can be used. Thickness of substrate or base material is usually 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably 0.3 to 5 mm. If a grass substrate is used, a chemically or thermally enhanced grass substrate is preferable. If transparency or smoothness is required, a glass substrate and a resin substrate are preferable, and a glass substrate is especially preferable. If weight saving is required, a resin substrate or a polymer base material is preferable.","Semi-Conductor Layer","A semi-conductor layer includes a composite oxide of In (indium), Zn (zinc), and Ga (gallium). Such a semi-conductor layer can be prepared, for example, by forming a thin film using a sputtering target of the present invention (a target for a semi-conductor).","In the present invention, the semi-conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film. By using such an amorphous film, its contact property to an insulation film or a protective layer has improved, and then uniform transistor property can be easily obtained even if it is large area. Whether or not the semi-conductor layer is an amorphous film can be confirmed by X-ray crystal structure analysis. If no clear peak is monitored, the semi-conductor layer is amorphous.","Carrier density of the semi-conductor layer is preferably 10to 10\/cm, and especially preferably 10to 10\/cm. If carrier density is in the above range, the semi-conductor layer becomes readily a non-degeneration semi-conductor, and then balance between mobility and ON-OFF ratio is preferably improved when it is used as a transistor. Band gap is preferably 2.0 to 6.0 eV, and more preferably 2.8 to 5.0 eV. If the band gap is 2.0 eV or more, a field effect type transistor causes less improper operation by absorbing visible light. If the band gap is 6.0 eV or less, a field effect type transistor rarely lose its function by less supplement of carrier.","A semi-conductor layer is preferably a non-degeneration semi-conductor having thermal active property. If a non-degeneration semi-conductor is used, some disadvantages such as off-current and gate-leak current increase caused by excess of carrier, or normally-ON caused by negative threshold can be avoided. Whether or not the semi-conductor layer is a non-degeneration semi-conductor can be confirmed by measuring mobility and carrier density as a result of temperature changes using Hall effect. In order to make a semi-conductor layer being a non-degeneration semi-conductor, partial pressure for oxygen during preparing a film is adjusted, and carrier density is optimized by post treatment for controlling the number of oxygen defects.","Surface roughness of the semi-conductor layer (RMS) is preferably 1 nm or less, more preferably 0.6 nm or less, and especially preferably 0.3 nm or less. If RMS is 1 nm or less, mobility would not be reduced.","The semi-conductor layer is preferably an amorphous film maintaining at least a part of an edge-sharing structure in a bixbite structure of indium oxide. Whether the amorphous film containing indium oxide maintains at least a part of an edge-sharing structure in a bixbite structure of indium oxide may be confirmed by radial distribution function (RDF) obtained by Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering (GIXS) in which a peak showing In\u2014X (X is In or Zn) is in 0.3 to 0.36 nm (specifically, see F. Utsuno, et al., Thin Solid Films, Volume 496, 2006, pp. 95-98).","Assuming that the maximum value of RDF where atomic distance is between 0.30 and 0.36 nm is A, and that the maximum value of RDF where atomic distance is between 0.36 and 0.42 is B, A\/B>0.7 is preferable, A\/B>0.85 is more preferable, A\/B>1 is further preferable, and A\/B>1.2 is especially preferable.","If A\/B is 0.7 or more, mobility is rarely reduced, and threshold or S value is rarely increased too high. Small A\/B seems to reflect poor short distance orderliness in an amorphous film.","Average bond distance of In\u2014In is preferably 0.3 to 0.322 nm, and especially preferably 0.31 to 0.32 nm. Average bond distance of In\u2014In can be measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The measurement by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) expanded from rising to a high energy portion such as several hundred eV higher. EXAFS is caused by backscattering of electrons by atoms surrounding excited atoms. Interference effect between releasing electron wave and backscattered wave is occurred. The interference depends on wavelength of electron state, and light path length traversing between surrounding excited atoms. Radial distribution function (RDF) is obtained by conducting Fourier transform of EXAFS. Average bond distance can be estimated from RDF peak.","Film thickness of the semi-conductor layer is normally 0.5 to 500 nm, preferably 1 to 150 nm, more preferably 3 to 80 nm, and especially preferably 10 to 60 nm. If the thickness is 0.5 nm or more, industrial, uniform film forming is possible. If the thickness is 500 nm or less, film forming time is not too long. If the thickness is between 3 and 80 nm, TFT properties such as mobility or ON-OFF ratio are especially improved.","Preferred embodiment of the present invention is that the semi-conductor layer is an amorphous film, and that energy width (E) of delocalized level is 14 meV or less. The energy width (E) of delocalized level of the semi-conductor layer is preferably 10 meV or less, more preferably 8 meV, and especially preferably 6 meV. If the energy width (E) of delocalized level is 14 meV or less, and if the semi-conductor layer is used as an active layer for a transistor, mobility is rarely reduced, and threshold or S value is rarely increased too high. High energy width (E) of delocalized level of the semi-conductor layer seems to reflect poor short distance orderliness in an amorphous film.","Semi-Conductor Layer","The thin film transistor preferably has a protective layer of a semi-conductor. If there is a protective layer of a semi-conductor, oxygen in a surface layer of a semi-conductor is not left even under vacuum or low pressure, off-current is not increased, and threshold voltage does not become negative. There is no environmental effect such as humidity even under atmospheric pressure, and there is no risk of increasing variation in transistor properties such as threshold voltage.","There is no limitation for selecting material to form the protective layer of a semi-conductor. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the present invention is lost. For example, SiO, SiNx, AlO, TaO, TiO, MgO, ZrO, CeO, KO, LiO, NaO, RbO, ScO, YO, HfO, CaHfO, PbTi, BaTaO, SrTiO, AlN, etc. Among these oxides, SiO, SiNx, AlO, YO, HfO, and CaHfOare preferably used; SiO, SiNx, YO, HfO, and CaHfOare more preferable; SiO, YO, HfO, and CaHfOare especially preferable. Number of oxygen in these oxides does not always have to correspond to stoichiometric ratio (e.g. SiOas well as SiOx are allowed). When a protective layer is film-formed from an oxide, partial pressure for oxygen is preferably 1\u00d710Pa or more so as to reduce OFF current. Heat history between 150 and 350\u00b0 C. is preferably applied for reducing oxygen defects on a semi-conductor layer and the surface of a protective film, and for reducing OFF current. SiOx may contain hydrogen element.","Such a protective film may have a laminated structure containing two or more different kinds of insulation film. The protective film may be a crystalline material, a multi-crystalline material or an amorphous material. A multi-crystalline material or an amorphous material each of which is readily, industrially produced is preferable. It is especially preferable that the protective layer is an amorphous material. If a protective layer is an amorphous material, interfacial smoothness is improved, mobility is not lowered, and neither threshold voltage nor S value becomes too high.","The protective layer of a semi-conductor layer is preferably an amorphous oxide or an amorphous nitride, and an amorphous oxide is especially preferable. If the protective layer is an amorphous oxide, oxygen in a semi-conductor does not transfer to a protective layer side, OFF current does not become high, and there is no risk to show normally-OFF caused by negative threshold voltage. The protective layer of the semi-conductor layer may use an organic insulation film such as poly-(4-vinylphenol) (PVP), or parylene. The protective layer of the semi-conductor layer may have two or more layer-laminated structure including an inorganic insulation film and an organic insulation film.","Gate Insulation Film","There is no limitation for selecting material to form the gate insulation film. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the invention related to the present embodiment is lost. For example, SiO, SiNx, AlO, TaO, TiO, MgO, ZrO, CeO, KO, LiO, NaO, RbO, ScO, YO, HfO, CaHfO, PbTi, BaTaO, SrTiO, AlN, etc. Among these oxides, SiO, SiNx, AlO, YO, HfO, and CaHfOare preferably used; SiO, SiNx, YO, HfO, and CaHfOare more preferable. Number of oxygen in these oxides does not always have to correspond to stoichiometric ratio (e.g. SiOas well as SiOx are allowed). SiOx may contain hydrogen element.","Such a gate insulation film may have a laminated structure containing two or more different kinds of insulation film. The gate insulation film may be a crystalline material, a multi-crystalline material or an amorphous material. A multi-crystalline material or an amorphous material each of which is readily, industrially produced is preferable. The gate insulation film may use an organic insulation film such as poly-(4-vinylphenol) (PVP), or parylene. The gate insulation film may have two or more layer-laminated structure including an inorganic insulation film and an organic insulation film.","Electrode","There is no limitation for selecting material to form each electrode such as a gate electrode, a source electrode, and a drain electrode. Any material commonly used may be chosen unless feature of the present invention is lost.","For example, the material includes a transparent electrode such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide, ZnO, or SnO; a metal electrode such as Al, Ag, Cr, Ni, Mo, Au, Ti, Ta, or Cu; or an alloyed metal electrode contained thereof. These materials are preferably laminated two or more layers to reduce contact resistance, and to enhance interface strength. In order to reduce contact resistance of a source electrode and a drain electrode, the interface between them and an electrode of a semi-conductor may be subject to plasma treatment and ozone treatment so as to control their resistance.","(4-2) Method for Making a Thin Film Transistor (A Field Effect Type Transistor)","The making method of the present invention is characterized by using the sputtering target of the above-mentioned present invention, and by comprising a step for forming an amorphous oxide thin film (semi-conductor layer) and a step for heat-treating it at 70 to 350\u00b0 C. after forming the amorphous oxide thin film.","In this connection, each contractual element (layer) of the above-mentioned thin film transistor may be formed by any method known in the present technical field.","Specifically, a film forming method includes a chemical film forming method such as a spray method, a dip method, or a CVD method; and a physical film forming method such as a sputter method, a vacuum deposition method, an ion plating method, or a pulse laser deposition method. A physical film forming method is preferable, since carrier density is readily controlled and film quality is easily improved. A sputter method is more preferable because of its high productivity.","Sputtering includes a method using a sintered target of a composite oxide, a method using a cosputter by multiple sintered targets, and a method using a reactive sputter by an alloy target. A sintered target of a composite oxide is preferably used. RF, DC or AC sputtering known in the art is also useful. DC or AC sputtering is preferable in view of uniformity and mass productivity (facility costs).","The formed film may be subject to patterning by several etching methods.","In the present invention, a semi-conductive film is preferably formed using the target of the present invention by DC or AC sputtering. By using DC or AC sputtering, damage at the film forming can be reduced in comparison with an RF sputtering. Therefore, in a case with a field effect type transistor, reduction of threshold voltage shift, enhancement of mobility, reduction of threshold voltage, reduction of S value and so on can be expected.","In the present invention, heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350\u00b0 C. after film forming of a semi-conductor layer. Especially, the heat treatment is preferably conducted at 70 to 350\u00b0 C. after forming a semi-conductor layer and a protective layer of the semi-conductor layer. If the temperature is 70\u00b0 C. or more, the obtained transistor may keep its sufficient heat stability, heat resistance, and sufficient mobility, and there is no rick to become S value or threshold voltage too high. If the temperature is 350\u00b0 C. or less, a substrate having no heat resistance can be used, and facility cost for heat treatment is not necessary.","Heat treating temperature is more preferably 80 to 260\u00b0 C., further preferably 90 to 180\u00b0 C., and especially preferably 100 to 150\u00b0 C. Specifically, if the heat treating temperature is 180\u00b0 C. or less, it is preferable because a resin substrate having low heat resistance such as PEN can be used as a substrate.","Heat treating time is usually preferably 1 second to 24 hours, but it is also preferable that the heat treating time is controlled based on treating temperature. For example, when the temperature is from 70 to 180\u00b0 C., 10 minutes to 24 hours is more preferable, 20 minutes to 6 hours is further preferable, and 30 minutes to 3 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 180 to 260\u00b0 C., 6 minutes to 4 hours is more preferable, and 15 minutes to 2 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 260 to 300\u00b0 C., 30 seconds to 4 hours is more preferable, and 1 minute to 2 hours is especially preferable. When the temperature is from 300 to 350\u00b0 C., 1 second to 1 hour is more preferable, and 2 seconds to 30 minutes is especially preferable.","Heat treatment is preferably conducted in an inert gas under 10Pa or less of oxygen partial pressure, or after a semi-conductor layer is covered with a protective layer. If either of conditions is selected, reproducibility is improved.","(4-3) Thin Film Transistor Properties","In the thin film transistor of the present invention, mobility is preferably 1 cm\/Vs or more, more preferably 3 cm\/Vs or more, and especially preferably 8 cm\/Vs or more.

If the threshold voltage is 0V or more, normally-ON is avoided, no voltage is needed during OFF, and then electric power consumption can be kept lower. If the threshold voltage is 10V or more, driving voltage can be kept lower, electric power consumption can be kept lower, and mobility can also be kept lower.","S value is preferably 0.8V\/dec or less, more preferably 0.3V\/dec or less, further preferably 0.25V\/dec or less, and especially preferably 0.2V\/dec or less. If S value is 0.8V\/dec or less, driving voltage does not become higher and then electric power consumption becomes lower. Especially, when the transistor is used for an organic light emitting display, because of direct current drive, if S value is 0.3V\/dec or less, electric power consumption is preferably and enormously reduced.","Threshold voltage shift between before and after applying 10 \u03bcA of direct current voltage at 50\u00b0 C. for 100 hours is preferably 1.0V or less, and more preferably 0.5V or less. If the shift is 1.0V or less, image quality does not change if the transistor is used for a transistor of an organic light emitting display.","Smaller hysteresis during gate voltage being up and down in transfer curve is preferable.","Ratio of channel width (W) and channel length (L) (W\/L) is normally 0.1 to 100, preferably 0.5 to 20, and especially preferably 1 to 8.

The channel length (L) is normally 0.1 to 1000 \u03bcm, preferably 1 to 100 \u03bcm, and more preferably 2 to 10 \u03bcm. If the channel length (L) is 0.1 \u03bcm or more, there is no possibility to become industrial manufacture difficult and to become leak current higher. If the channel length (L) is 1000 \u03bcm or less, an element does not become too big.","The thin film transistor of the present invention preferably has a structure for shading a semi-conductor layer. If there is a structure for shading a semi-conductor layer (e.g. a shading layer), there is no possibility to excite a carrier electron when light comes in the semi-conductor layer and then to become OFF current higher. The shading layer preferably includes a thin film having absorption between 300 nm and 800 nm. The shading layer may be located on either upper or lower portion of the semi-conductor layer, but the shading layer is preferably located on both upper and lower portions. The shading layer may also be used as a gate insulation film and a black matrix. If the shading layer is present only on one side, it is necessary to improve its structure not to radiate light to a semi-conductor layer from another side where no shading layer is present.","The thin film transistor of the present invention may have a contact layer between a semi-conductor layer and a source electrode or a drain electrode. The contact layer preferably has lower resistance than that of a semi-conductor layer. Forming materials of the contact layer may include a composite oxide having similar composition to that of the above-mentioned semi-conductor layer. That is, the contact layer preferably contains each element such as In, Zn or Zr.
