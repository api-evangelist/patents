{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention generally relate to information technology, and, more particularly, to virtual machine management.","Resource oversubscription in computing cloud systems is becoming common in information technology (IT) services. Virtual machines (VMs) are often provisioned to host separate services in the cloud systems. Traditionally, these VMs are provisioned with all of their allocated resources (for example, memory and central processing unit (CPU)) guaranteed in the physical resources. Resource allocation of more than the amount that can be guaranteed by the physical resources, that is, resource oversubscription, allows for more VMs to be hosted on a hypervisor. As VMs often do not consume all of the allocated resources, over-subscription can increase resource utilization, and as a result, reduce cost of service provision.","However, oversubscription brings the risk of resource overload in the hypervisor before hosted VMs use up the allocated resources, and the resource overload, especially memory overload, largely degrades service performance.","Existing approaches attempting to remedy the undesirable consequences of oversubscription include migration-only solutions. However, migration-only solutions are not sufficient to remediate overload in over-committed systems (in these systems, there exists the possibility for a large number of hypervisors to be close-to-overload at the same time), and migration overhead may be large in a dense over-committed hypervisor cluster.","Accordingly, a need exists for remediating an overload in over-committed computing environments.","In one aspect of the present invention, techniques for remediating resource overload are provided. An exemplary computer-implemented method for remediating overload in an over-committed computing environment can include steps of measuring resource usage of each of multiple virtual machines on each of at least one hypervisor in a computing environment, upon detection of a resource overload on one of the at least one hypervisor, determining at least one operation that is to be taken for at least one of the multiple virtual machines on the hypervisor to remediate resource overload while increasing values of running virtual machines, and sending a command to the hypervisor to issue the at least one operation.","In another aspect of the invention, techniques for an automated overload remediation method for a virtualized environment are provided. An exemplary computer-implemented method includes the steps of recovering from a system resource overloaded situation by selecting, from a plurality of virtual machines in the system, a subset of the virtual machines to migrate and a subset of the virtual machines to quiesce, and periodically selecting a subset of the virtual machines to migrate and a subset of the virtual machines to resume to increase the number of running virtual machines and increase work value achieved by the running virtual machines.","Another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an article of manufacture tangibly embodying computer readable instructions which, when implemented, cause a computer to carry out a plurality of method steps, as described herein. Furthermore, another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of an apparatus including a memory and at least one processor that is coupled to the memory and operative to perform noted method steps. Yet further, another aspect of the invention or elements thereof can be implemented in the form of means for carrying out the method steps described herein, or elements thereof; the means can include (i) hardware module(s), (ii) software module(s), or (iii) a combination of hardware and software modules; any of (i)-(iii) implement the specific techniques set forth herein, and the software modules are stored in a tangible computer-readable storage medium (or multiple such media).","These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","As described herein, an aspect of the present invention includes remediating overload in over-committed computing environments. At least one embodiment of the invention includes providing a mechanism to remediate overload without assuming that there is always resource available for migration. As detailed herein, a work value notion is used to compare the importance of VMs, and the overload remediation problem is formulated as a variant of the Removable Online Multi-Knapsack Problem (ROMKP). An aspect of the invention includes an algorithm to solve this optimization problem.","An embodiment of the invention can be implemented, for example, in a large commercial cloud environment. When no resource-available hypervisors exist, at least one embodiment of the invention includes discarding certain computations temporarily, that is, quiescing one or more VMs determined to be less important, to remediate the ongoing overload so that the rest of the VMs run normally. After a set of VMs complete their jobs and terminate normally or release resources, resources become available and quiesced VMs are resumed to finish their jobs. Accordingly, as detailed herein, an aspect of the invention includes determining which operations (migration, quiesce or resume) should be taken for which VMs, in order to remediate resource overload in over-subscribed computing systems which may not have sufficient resources, while increasing (for example, maximizing) the values of running services.","Further, at least one embodiment of the invention includes combining considerations of quiesce, resume and migration operations of VMs to provide an algorithm that addresses this problem variant. Accordingly, the algorithm incorporates considerations of the cost of the quiesce\/migration\/resume operations, and a global optimization is approximated by a heuristic algorithm.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["106","110","102","104","108","112","114"]},"When an overload on a hypervisor is detected by the monitor in the hypervisor, the remediation center has the knowledge on resource usages of all of the hypervisors in the cloud, and makes decisions of which VMs are to be migrated or quiesced or resumed. Additionally, the remediation center sends commands to corresponding hypervisors to issue operations. The message transmissions between the monitors and the remediation center are illustrated via the dashed lines in .","As resource usage of a VM changes with time, and VM provision and de-provision occur from time to time, resource usage in the cloud changes as well. Accordingly, the remediation center periodically checks whether sufficient resources become available for any quiesced VMs to resume.","As detailed herein, an aspect of the invention includes the use of a notion of \u201cwork value\u201d to define the importance of a VM. Work value, as used herein, aims at measuring the potential loss of the services\/tasks on a VM caused by the VM's being quiesced, and\/or the impacts of a VM's being quiesced on the execution of other VMs. These values are not measured as utility in traditional VM placement techniques because such approaches do not quiesce VMs. For example, work value includes the expected work to be done by a quiesced VM if it was not quiesced, and the utilities in these techniques do not consider this aspect.","An objective of at least one embodiment of the invention is to quiesce VMs performing the least amount of work value, and resume VMs that were performing more work value. As described herein, an analytic model is used to assess work value of each VM, leveraging existing analysis (for example, time series with seasonality) of VM metrics to compute\/estimate work value. Such a computation can incorporate knowledge of patterns of predicted workload, life-time predictions from past or workload type, customer style, etc.","Also, at least one embodiment of the invention includes using a dependency model to assess work value of each VM. This can include, for example, static dependency via configuration analysis, dynamic dependency, and\/or use of other heuristics such as VM price, current central processing unit (CPU) work, etc.","One example embodiment of work value is revenue, or price. If price is not used as the work value, the work value may be indicated by service types. When a VM providing critical services such as email and network file system (NFS) is quiesced, it can cause great loss. The potential loss can be estimated directly from knowledge about a VM's services, or by leveraging analytical models if such direct knowledge is not available. For example, if a VM provides backup service for a number of machines and performs the backup service regularly once a week, the analysis of time series with seasonality can be applied to detect the regularity of this VM's service and predict the criticality of this VM at a specific time. Workload patterns can also be predicted and used to determine the importance of a VM's work at a specific time.","In addition to using knowledge about services, analytical models, and workload patterns to estimate the work value, administrators can specify a computation of the work value of VMs at any time t. An example of computing the work value is given below (the parameters V, V, V, and the function V_pattern( ) are to be properly set):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"\u2003estimate_work_value(a_vm, t) {"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"if a_vm is known that it provides critical services all the time"]},{"entry":[{},"work_value(a_vm, t) = Vfor any time;"]},{"entry":[{},"else if a_vm is estimated to be running regularly-scheduled critical"]},{"entry":[{},"services"]},{"entry":[{},"work_value(a_vm, t)=Vfor scheduled time;"]},{"entry":[{},"work_value(a_vm, t)=Vfor other time;"]},{"entry":[{},"else if the workload pattern on a_vm is predicted"]},{"entry":[{},"work_value(a_vm, t)=V_pattern (workload_pattern, t) \/\/ with the"]},{"entry":[{},"workload pattern"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"known, we can get its work value at time t"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"else"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"work_value(a_vm, t)=average amount of load in a_vm in its"]},{"entry":[{},"past history"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Besides the loss of the quiesced VM's service, the quiesced VM may also impact other VMs which depend on the quiesced VM. By way of example, a stock trading service in a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) depends on a DB2 server, and the WAS and DB2 servers exist in two separate VMs. When the DB2 VM is quiesced, the WAS VM does not achieve any work value.","Additionally, at least one embodiment of the invention can include optimizing the total work values of running VMs in dependency-free scenarios when certain VMs are selected to be quiesced, migrated, or resumed. In dependency-free scenarios, a VM's work value is independent of the work values of other VMs. In such a scenario, the problem is a variant of multiple-knapsack problem (MKP), or more specifically, a variant of Removable Online MKP, because VMs are to be provisioned, removed from hypervisors, and relocated from one hypervisor to another, and VMs have changing resource usages and work values. Besides work values, costs of VM quiescing and migration are also considered in handling this problem.","By way of example, consider a cloud computing environment that has m hypervisors: H, H, . . . , H.

Then, a test is carried out to determine if all of the VMs in C (that is, the VMs consuming the most resources on the overloaded hypervisor such that the rest of the VMs consume less than a threshold thrd2) can be migrated to other hypervisors by applying a heuristic algorithm for MKP. The test will fail when there are insufficient resources. Accordingly, the VM with the least work value-to-resource usage ratio in the entire cloud is planned to be quiesced, and the test is carried out again. This procedure is continued until the test passes.","Subsequently, the planned-to-be-quiesced VMs in Q are checked to select those VMs that have been unnecessarily planned to be quiesced. After these steps, the final plan of migration and quiesce is obtained. The steps of periodic-resume part are similar to the description of the overload-remediation part above, except that a test is carried out to determine whether all quiesced VMs in C can be resumed.","This algorithm has the time complexity of O(n log n+nkm), where n is the number of VMs in the Cloud, k is the number of VMs to be migrated\/resumed, and m is the number of hypervisors. It is polynomial time overhead, and can be implemented for, by way of example, clouds of hundreds of hypervisors and thousands of VMs.","By way of example, at least one embodiment of the invention can be implemented as a MAPE (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execution) loop on a large cloud platform.  is a diagram illustrating architecture of implementation of the overload remediation system in a target cloud, according to an embodiment of the present invention. The shaded components in  are those components added to the target cloud for supporting overload remediation. The unshaded components in  are components of the cloud itself.","The cloud manager  is a software package in charge of VM provision, de-provision, migration, and other management operations for VMs . The data warehouse  stores measurement data which are periodically reported by the monitors  in hypervisors . A customer can issue commands to the cloud manager for conducting desired operations via a portal . A REST (REpresentation State Transfer) application programming interface (API) is leveraged between the portal and the cloud manager for requesting specific operations in the cloud manager. Additionally, a message queue component  can be implemented in between the cloud manager and the portal.","Compared with the basic overload remediation illustrated in , the system depicted in  includes a remediation database (DB)  to support persistency. The database stores events generated by the hypervisor monitor (for example, a \u201cresource overload\u201d event, an \u201coverload remediated\u201d event, etc.), status of the actions performed by the cloud manager (for example, \u201csuccess of migration,\u201d \u201cfailure of resuming a VM,\u201d etc.), and the current states of all managed VMs (for example, \u201cnormally running,\u201d \u201coverloaded,\u201d \u201cquiesced,\u201d etc.). The remediation center  is a process running on a separate computer that periodically queries the remediation DB to process any new events received by the DB. When processing these events, the remediation center retrieves performance data from the data warehouse  as these data are needed in the remediation algorithms. When the decision of which VMs to be migrated, quiesced and\/or resumed is made, commands are sent to the cloud manager to execute the decision.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","304","306","308","310","316","312"]},"In step , Q=Q+{the VM with the next smallest U\/R value and with acceptable quiesce cost}.

Step  includes determining at least one operation that is to be taken for at least one of the multiple virtual machines on the hypervisor to remediate resource overload while increasing or maximizing values of running virtual machines. As detailed herein, the operation can include at least one of migration, quiesce or resume.","Determining at least one operation that is to be taken can include computing a work value of each virtual machine on the hypervisor, wherein work value can include at least one of a measure of potential loss of services on the virtual machine caused by the virtual machine being quiesced, and a measure of an impact of the virtual machine being quiesced on execution of at least one other virtual machine.

Further, determining at least one operation that is to be taken can include continuously measuring and leveraging the work value and resource consumption of each virtual machine. At least one embodiment of the invention can also include using a ratio of work value and resource consumption to determine whether any of a migrate, quiesce, or resume operation is to be taken on a virtual machine.","Step  includes sending a command to the hypervisor to issue the at least one operation.

Also, such an embodiment of the invention can include periodically selecting a subset of the virtual machines to migrate and a subset of the virtual machines to resume to increase the number of running virtual machines and increase work value achieved by the running virtual machines. As detailed herein, each migrate, quiesce and resume selection takes into account a work value metric contributed by each virtual machine. The work value metric combines one or more factors including virtual lifetime, price, revenue, service level agreement, central processing unit utilization, virtual machine dependency, and workload prediction.","Additionally, in at least one embodiment of the invention, a problem is formulated as a variant of a Removable Online Multiple Knapsack Problem (ROMKP).

Such a problem also includes considering costs of the knapsack operations in decision making.","A solution to the variant of ROMKP problem can include continuously measuring and leveraging the work value and resource usage of each virtual machine, using a ratio of work value and resource usage as criterion to make a decision for selecting a migrate, quiesce, or resume operation for one or more virtual machines, and computing a cost of each migrate, quiesce, and\/or resume operations and using the cost as a constraint in problem formulation. Additionally, in at least one embodiment of the invention, the work value for a virtual machine is defined as 1\/(resource usage) if the virtual machine was not quiesced during a given recent time period P, and infinity if the virtual machine was quiesced during the period P.","The techniques depicted in  can also, as described herein, include providing a system, wherein the system includes distinct software modules, each of the distinct software modules being embodied on a tangible computer-readable recordable storage medium.
