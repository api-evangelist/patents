The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Technical Field","This invention generally relates to radiolabeled compounds and their use in methods for imaging the prostate gland. For example, in certain embodiments the compounds are useful for imaging benign prostate diseases such as benign prostate hyperplasia. In other embodiments, the compounds are useful for imaging cancerous prostate diseases, such as prostate cancer tumors. In certain embodiments the invention relates to radioactive I compounds and their use as an imaging tool in prostate cancer and benign prostate diseases. The disclosed compounds find utility in any number of imaging applications, including imaging of androgen receptor (AR) splice variants in prostate cancers, including all stages and androgen dependent, androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancers (also referred to as hormone refractory, androgen-independent, androgen deprivation resistant, androgen ablation resistant, androgen depletion-independent, castration-recurrent, anti-androgen-recurrent).","2. Description of the Related Art","Androgens mediate their effects through the androgen receptor (AR). Androgens play a role in a wide range of developmental and physiological responses and are involved in male sexual differentiation, maintenance of spermatogenesis, and male gonadotropin regulation (R. K. Ross, G. A. Coetzee, C. L. Pearce, J. K. Reichardt, P. Bretsky, L. N. Kolonel, B. E. Henderson, E. Lander, D. Altshuler & G. Daley, 35, 355-361 (1999); A. A. Thomson, 121, 187-195 (2001); N. Tanji, K. Aoki & M. Yokoyama, 47, 1-7 (2001)). Several lines of evidence show that androgens are associated with the development of prostate carcinogenesis. Firstly, androgens induce prostatic carcinogenesis in rodent models (R. L. Noble, 37, 1929-1933 (1977); R. L. Noble, 34, 138-141 (1977)) and men receiving androgens in the form of anabolic steroids have a higher incidence of prostate cancer (J. T. Roberts & D. M. Essenhigh, 2, 742 (1986); J. A. Jackson, J. Waxman & A. M. Spiekerman, 149, 2365-2366 (1989); P. D. Guinan, W. Sadoughi, H. Alsheik, R. J. Ablin, D. Alrenga & I. M. Bush, 131, 599-600 (1976)). Secondly, prostate cancer does not develop if humans or dogs are castrated before puberty (J. D. Wilson & C. Roehrborn, 84, 4324-4331 (1999); G. Wilding, 14, 113-130 (1992)). Castration of adult males causes involution of the prostate and apoptosis of prostatic epithelium while eliciting no effect on other male external genitalia (E. M. Bruckheimer & N. Kyprianou, 301, 153-162 (2000); J. T. Isaacs, 5, 545-557 (1984)). This dependency on androgens provides the underlying rationale for treating prostate cancer with chemical or surgical castration (androgen ablation).","Androgens also play a role in female diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome as well as cancers. One example is ovarian cancer where elevated levels of androgens are associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer (K. J. Helzlsouer, A. J. Alberg, G. B. Gordon, C. Longcope, T. L. Bush, S. C. Hoffman & G. W. Comstock, 274, 1926-1930 (1995); R. J. Edmondson, J. M. Monaghan & B. R. Davies, 86, 879-885 (2002)). The AR has been detected in a majority of ovarian cancers (H. A. Risch, 90, 1774-1786 (1998); B. R. Rao & B. J. Slotman, 12, 14-26 (1991); G. M. Clinton & W. Hua, 25, 1-9 (1997)), whereas estrogen receptor-alpha (ERa) and the progesterone receptor are detected in less than 50% of ovarian tumors.","The only effective treatment available for advanced prostate cancer is the withdrawal of androgens which are essential for the survival of prostate epithelial cells. Androgen ablation therapy causes a temporary reduction in tumor burden concomitant with a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Unfortunately prostate cancer can eventually grow again in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant disease) (Huber et al 1987 104, 33-39). Castration-resistant prostate cancer is biochemically characterized before the onset of symptoms by a rising titre of serum PSA (Miller et al 1992 147, 956-961). Once the disease becomes castration-resistant most patients succumb to their disease within two years.","The AR has distinct functional domains that include the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD) comprising two zinc finger motifs, and an N-terminus domain (NTD) that contains one or more transcriptional activation domains. Binding of androgen (ligand) to the LBD of the AR results in its activation such that the receptor can effectively bind to its specific DNA consensus site, termed the androgen response element (ARE), on the promoter and enhancer regions of \u201cnormally\u201d androgen regulated genes, such as PSA, to initiate transcription. The AR can be activated in the absence of androgen by stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and by various growth factors (Culig et al 1994 54, 5474-5478; Nazareth et al 1996 271, 19900-19907; Sadar 1999 274, 7777-7783; Ueda et al 2002 A 277, 7076-7085; and Ueda et al 2002 B 277, 38087-38094). The mechanism of ligand-independent transformation of the AR has been shown to involve: 1) increased nuclear AR protein suggesting nuclear translocation; 2) increased AR\/ARE complex formation; and 3) the AR-NTD (Sadar 1999 274, 7777-7783; Ueda et al 2002 A 277, 7076-7085; and Ueda et al 2002 B 277, 38087-38094). The AR may be activated in the absence of testicular androgens by alternative signal transduction pathways in castration-resistant disease, which is consistent with the finding that nuclear AR protein is present in secondary prostate cancer tumors (Kim et al 2002 160, 219-226; and van der Kwast et al 1991 48, 189-193).","Available inhibitors of the AR include nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as bicalutamide (Casodex\u2122), nilutamide, flutamide, enzulutamide and investigational drug ARN-509 and steroidal antiandrogens, such as cyproterone acetate. These antiandrogens target the LBD of the AR and predominantly fail presumably due to poor affinity and mutations that lead to activation of the AR by these same antiandrogens (Taplin, M. E., Bubley, G. J., Kom Y. J., Small E. J., Uptonm M., Rajeshkumarm B., Balkm S. P., 59, 2511-2515 (1999)). These antiandrogens would also have no effect on the recently discovered AR splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD) to result in a constitutively active receptor which promotes progression of castration recurrent prostate cancer (Dehm S M, Schmidt L J, Heemers H V, Vessella R L, Tindall D J., 68, 5469-77, 2008; Guo Z, Yang X, Sun F, Jiang R, Linn D E, Chen H, Chen H, Kong X, Melamed J, Tepper C G, Kung H J, Brodie A M, Edwards J, Qiu Y., 69, 2305-13, 2009; Hu et al 2009 Cancer Res. 69, 16-22; Sun et al 2010 J Clin Invest. 2010 120, 2715-30).","Conventional therapy has concentrated on androgen-dependent activation of the AR through its C-terminal domain. Studies developing antagonists to the AR have concentrated on the C-terminus and specifically: 1) the allosteric pocket and AF-2 activity (Est\u00e9banez-Perpi\u00f1\u00e1 et al 2007, 104, 16074-16079); 2) in silico \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists (Bisson et al 2007, 104, 11927-11932); and coactivator or corepressor interactions (Chang et al 2005, 19, 2478-2490; Hur et al 2004, 2, E274; Est\u00e9banez-Perpi\u00f1\u00e1 et al 2005, 280, 8060-8068; He et al 2004, 16, 425-438).","The AR-NTD is also a target for drug development (e.g. WO 2000\/001813), since the NTD contains Activation-Function-1 (AF-1) which is the essential region required for AR transcriptional activity (Jenster et al 1991. Mol Endocrinol. 5, 1396-404). The AR-NTD importantly plays a role in activation of the AR in the absence of androgens (Sadar, M. D. 1999 274, 7777-7783; Sadar M D et al 1999 6, 487-502; Ueda et al 2002 277, 7076-7085; Ueda 2002 277, 38087-38094; Blaszczyk et al 2004 10, 1860-9; Dehm et al 2006 28, 27882-93; Gregory et al 2004 279, 7119-30). The AR-NTD is important in hormonal progression of prostate cancer as shown by application of decoy molecules (Quayle et al 2007, 104, 1331-1336).","While the crystal structure has been resolved for the AR C-terminus LBD, this has not been the case for the NTD due to its high flexibility and intrinsic disorder in solution (Reid et al 2002 277, 20079-20086) thereby hampering virtual docking drug discovery approaches. Compounds that modulate AR include the bis-phenol compounds disclosed in published PCT Nos: WO 2010\/000066, WO 2011\/082487; WO 2011\/082488; WO 2012\/145330; WO 2012\/139039; WO 2012\/145328; WO 2013\/028572 and WO 2013\/028791, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, to the British Columbia Cancer Agency Branch and The University of British Columbia.","In addition to compounds which modulate AR, compounds and methods for imaging the prostate are useful research, diagnostic and prognostic tools. Such compounds are useful in many applications, including imaging of benign and\/or malignant prostate cells and tissue. In this regard, positron emission tomography (PET) is an often used imaging technique for non-invasive identification of pathological state and tumors. In PET imaging, the distribution of a radioisotope (e.g., F) in the body can be determined. Thus incorporating F into compounds which concentrate in tumor sites (see e.g., WO 2013\/028791) offers potential for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers. However, improved methods for imaging are needed, for example methods which employ I and single photon emission coupled tomography (SPECT) techniques have potential to improve methods for imaging AR-rich tissues such as the benign prostate, and in particular prostate cancers and AR splice variants in castrate recurrent prostate cancers.","While significant advances have been made in this field, there remains a need for improved imaging agents In particular, methods and compounds suitable for imaging benign and malignant prostate tissues and cells are needed. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.","Some embodiments of the compounds described herein may be used for diagnostic purposes to investigate diseases of the prostate, including cancer. In particular embodiments, the compounds are useful for imaging diagnostics in cancer. In some embodiments, such imaging allows for the detection and\/or location of cancer sites (e.g., tumor sites). Furthermore, these compounds may be used individually or as part of a kit for such purposes.","The present disclosure is based in part on the surprising discovery that the compounds described herein, may be used to modulate AR activity either in vivo or in vitro for both research and therapeutic uses. Accordingly, embodiments of the compounds are useful for imaging the prostate. The imaging may be for any number of diagnostic purposes. For example, in certain embodiments the compounds are useful for imaging benign prostate cancer diseases. In other embodiments, the compounds find utility for imaging of certain cancers, including prostate cancer since certain embodiments of the compounds localize in prostate tumor sites. Other imaging agents are androgen mimics; however, in one embodiment, the compounds are useful for imaging AR splice variants or any AR species (ie., those mutated in other domains or regions). The AR may be mammalian. For example, the AR may be human. The prostate cancer may be castration-resistant prostate cancer. The prostate cancer may be androgen-dependent prostate cancer.","In accordance with one embodiment, there is provided a compound having a structure of Formula I:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"38.35mm","wi":"71.37mm","file":"US09375496-20160628-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3","4","5","1","2","3 ","4 ","123"]},"In other embodiments pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of structure (I) are provided.

Many currently available imaging agents tend to accumulate in the bladder, which decreases their effectiveness as imaging tools specifically for the prostate. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the present applicants believe the disclosed compounds are unexpectedly effective for imaging of the prostate due to their ability to accumulate in the prostate, rather than the bladder, allowing the prostate gland to be seen. Accordingly, the compounds may be used in methods for imaging the prostate, for example to image benign prostate diseases. In other embodiments, the compounds may be used in methods to image cancerous prostate diseases, such as tumors of the prostate.","Androgen ablation therapy causes a temporary reduction in prostate cancer tumor burden, but the malignancy will begin to grow again in the absence of testicular androgens to form castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A rising titer of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after androgen ablation therapy indicates biochemical failure, the emergence of CRPC, and re-initiation of an androgen receptor (AR) transcription program. Most patients succumb to CRPC within two years of biochemical failure.","AR is a transcription factor and a validated target for prostate cancer therapy. Current therapies include androgen ablation and administration of antiandrogens. Most CRPC is suspected to be AR-dependent. AR has distinct functional domains that include the C-terminus ligand-binding domain (LBD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), and an amino-terminal domain (NTD). AR NTD contains the activation function-1 (AF-1) that contributes most of the activity to the AR. Recently, splice variants of the AR that lack the LBD have been reported in prostate cancer cell lines (VCaP and 22Rv1), and in CRPC tissues. To date more than 20 splice variants of AR have been detected. Splice variants V7 and V567es are clinically relevant with levels of expression correlated to poor survival and CRPC. AR V567es is solely expressed in 20% of metastases. Abiraterone resistance is associated with expression of AR splice variants. Enzalutamide also increases levels of expression of these constitutively active AR splice variants. These splice variants lack LBD and thereby would not be inhibited by current therapies that target the AR LBD such as antiandrogens or androgen ablation therapy. A single patient with advanced prostate cancer can have many lesions throughout the body and skeleton and each tumor can have differing levels of expression of AR.","Biopsy of metastatic tumors in a patient to determine AR species is not widely accessible nor feasible to sample tumours in a patient that may have multiple metastases. Thus it is essential to develop approaches to detect the expression of all AR species for the molecular classification of tumors based on the level and extent of expression of AR splice variants, or other AR species that cannot be detected using an imaging agent that interacts with the LBD, to identify patients with potentially aggressive disease and poor prognosis, or to identify patients that will not respond to hormone therapies that target the AR LBD. Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present invention provide a AR NTD-targeted molecular imaging probe (e.g., compound of formula I) which can be used to monitor response to therapy and provide insight into the role of AR in resistance mechanisms.","One current approach to image AR in prostate cancer uses positron emission tomography (PET) with 16\u03b2-[F]-fluoro-5\u03b1 dihydrotestosterone (F-FDHT) that binds to AR LBD. Unfortunately this imaging agent cannot detect splice variants lacking LBD. In some embodiments, the invention employs sequential imaging with F-FDHT to detect full-length AR and gamma radiation emitting probes to specifically detect the AR NTD which would be the sum of both full-length AR and variant AR. In other embodiments, the invention employs sequential imaging with two different PET imaging agents to detects only full-length AR and another to specifically detect the AR NTD which would be the sum of both full-length AR and variant AR. Together these data reveal patients with tumors that express variant AR (NTD of variant plus full-length AR detected with NTD isotope minus full-length AR detected with F-FDHT). By using sequential imaging, a discordant distribution or discordant level of uptake between F-FDHT and a radiolabeled compound of this invention (i.e., compound of structure (I)) indicates the presence of overexpression of splice variants lacking the LBD.","Accordingly, certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to compounds that bind to the AR NTD and are useful for imaging of tumors with splice variants using SPECT and\/or methods of modulating AR NTD activity. Other embodiments are directed to compound and methods useful for imaging and\/or treating benign prostate conditions or diseases.

Salts as described herein may be prepared by conventional processes known to a person skilled in the art, for example, and without limitation, by reacting the free form with an organic acid or inorganic acid or base, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that preparation of salts may occur in situ during isolation and purification of the compounds or preparation of salts may occur by separately reacting an isolated and purified compound.","In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, polymorphs, isomeric forms) as described herein may be in the solvent addition form, for example, solvates. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent in physical association the compound or salt thereof. The solvent may be, for example, and without limitation, a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. For example, hydrates are formed when the solvent is water or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is an alcohol.","In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, isomeric forms) as described herein may include crystalline and amorphous forms, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, conformational polymorphs, amorphous forms, or a combination thereof. Polymorphs include different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and\/or solubility. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various factors including recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.","In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, polymorphs) as described herein include isomers such as geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on asymmetric carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers, individual enantiomers, individual diastereomers, racemates, diastereomeric mixtures and combinations thereof, and are not limited by the description of the formula illustrated for the sake of convenience.","In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this invention may comprise a salt of such a compound, preferably a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutical preparations will typically comprise one or more carriers, excipients or diluents acceptable for the mode of administration of the preparation, be it by injection, inhalation, topical administration, lavage, or other modes suitable for the selected treatment. Suitable carriers, excipients or diluents are those known in the art for use in such modes of administration.","Suitable pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated by means known in the art and their mode of administration and dose determined by the skilled practitioner. For parenteral administration, a compound may be dissolved in sterile water or saline or a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle used for administration of non-water soluble compounds such as those used for vitamin K. For enteral administration, the compound may be administered in a tablet, capsule or dissolved in liquid form. The tablet or capsule may be enteric coated, or in a formulation for sustained release. Many suitable formulations are known, including, polymeric or protein microparticles encapsulating a compound to be released, ointments, pastes, gels, hydrogels, or solutions which can be used topically or locally to administer a compound. A sustained release patch or implant may be employed to provide release over a prolonged period of time. Many techniques known to one of skill in the art are described in & by Alfonso Gennaro, 20ed., Lippencott Williams & Wilkins, (2000). Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated naphthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide\/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for modulatory compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel.","Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this invention or for use in this invention may be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, stent, etc. Also, implants may be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time.","An \u201ceffective amount\u201d of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as reduced tumor size, increased life span or increased life expectancy. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as smaller tumors, increased life span, increased life expectancy or prevention of the progression of prostate cancer to lethal CRPC. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount.","It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the exact imaging protocol. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgement of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected by medical practitioners. The amount of active compound(s) in the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum imaging result. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the imaging results. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.","In general, compounds of the invention should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds of the invention can be determined using standard techniques, for example, by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index, i.e., the ratio between the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the LD100 (the dose lethal to 100% of the population). In some circumstances, such as in severe disease conditions, substantial excesses of the compositions may be administered for therapeutic effects. Some compounds of this invention may be toxic at some concentrations. Titration studies may be used to determine toxic and non-toxic concentrations. Toxicity may be evaluated by examining a particular compound's or composition's specificity across cell lines using PC3 or DU145 cells as possible negative controls since these cells do not express functional AR. Animal studies may be used to provide an indication if the compound has any effects on other tissues. Systemic therapy that targets the AR will not likely cause major problems to other tissues since antiandrogens and androgen insensitivity syndrome are not fatal.","Compounds as described herein may be administered to a subject. As used herein, a \u201csubject\u201d may be a human, non-human primate, mammal, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat and the like. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, or suspected of having or at risk for having acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration. Diagnostic methods for various cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, and diagnostic methods for acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration and the clinical delineation of cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, diagnoses and the clinical delineation of acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Compounds for use in the present invention may be obtained from medical sources or modified using known methodologies from naturally occurring compounds. In addition, methods of preparing or synthesizing compounds of the present invention will be understood by a person of skill in the art having reference to known chemical synthesis principles. For example, Auzou et al 1974 9(5), 548-554 describes suitable synthetic procedures that may be considered and suitably adapted for preparing compounds of any one of the compounds of structure (I) as set out above.

Compounds of structure A can be reacted with compounds of structure B under basic conditions (e.g., NaH) to yield compounds of structure C. In this regard, particularily useful leaving groups (L) include p-toulenesulfonates (\u201ctosyl\u201d), which can be prepared by reaction of the corresponding alcohol with tosyl chloride. Further, various stereoisomers of compound B can be used depending on the desired stereochemistry of the final product. Various stereoisomer of B can be purchased or prepared according to methods known in the art. The radioactive iodine moiety (I) can be installed by reaction of C with an appropriate iodinating reagent, for example NaI and a suitable oxidant (e.g., NaClO) to yield D. It should be noted that, although General Reaction Scheme I depicts iodination at only one position, other compounds of structure (I) with I at different positions and\/or multiple I substitutions can be prepared according to analogous methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Reaction of D with epoxide E under basic conditions (e.g., NaH) yields compounds of structure F. Again, tosyl leaving groups have been fond to be particularly useful as the Lmoiety, and various stereoisomers of compound F can be used depending on the desired stereochemistry of the final product. Finally, reaction of F with an appropriate reagent, such as CeCl3.7HO yields G. Other compounds of structure (I) wherein R, Rand\/or Rare moieties other than H can be prepared by further modification of compound G. For example alkylation with common alkylating reagents (e.g., methyl idodide) and\/or acylation with common acylating reagents (e.g., acetyl chloride) yields compounds of structure (I) wherein R, Rand\/or Rare C-Calkyl or C-Calkylcarbonyl, respectively.","One skilled in the art will recognize that variations to the order of the steps and reagents discussed in reference to the above General Synthetic Scheme I are possible. For example, epoxidation may precede dioxalone formation. Further, I atoms may be introduced via any number of reagents, and iodination is not limited to those methods depicted or described above. Methods for such iodination are well known in the art. Methodologies for preparation of specific exemplary compounds of structure I are described in more detail in the following examples.","In addition, protecting group strategies may be employed for preparation of the compounds disclosed herein. Such strategies are well known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary protecting groups and related strategies are disclosed in Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley-Interscience; 4 edition (Oct. 30, 2006), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments, a protecting group is used to mask an alcohol moiety while performing other chemical transformations. After removal of the protecting group, the free hydroxyl is obtained. Such protecting groups and strategies are well known in the art.","The present compounds find particular utility in methods for imaging the prostate.
