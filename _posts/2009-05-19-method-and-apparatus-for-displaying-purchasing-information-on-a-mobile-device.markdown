{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Wireless (e.g., cellular) service providers and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of development has been the use of mobile devices for online commerce. To interact with online commerce services, a user generally has to browse a catalog and provide at least some information (e.g., user login information such as a user identification and password, payment information for online commerce services, personal information for registering with certain services, etc.). On a mobile device, the task of browsing and\/or providing information for purchasing items can be cumbersome and potentially inconvenient to the user, particularly if the device has a small display and limited processing capability.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for quickly and conveniently displaying purchasing information.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises initiating transmission of purchasing information to be presented on a mobile device. The method also comprises determining whether a purchasing application is resident on the mobile device. The method further comprises redirecting the purchasing information to a browser application or a messaging application on the mobile device based on the determination of whether the purchasing application is resident on the mobile device.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to initiate transmission of purchasing information to be presented on a mobile device. The apparatus is also caused to determine whether a purchasing application is resident on the mobile device. The apparatus is further caused to redirect the purchasing information to a browser application or a messaging application on the mobile device based on the determination of whether the purchasing application is resident on the mobile device.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause an apparatus to initiate transmission of purchasing information to be presented on a mobile device. The apparatus is also caused to determine whether a purchasing application is resident on the mobile device. The apparatus is further caused to redirect the purchasing information to a browser application or a messaging application on the mobile device based on the determination of whether the purchasing application is resident on the mobile device.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for initiating transmission of purchasing information to be presented on a mobile device. The apparatus also comprises means for determining whether a purchasing application is resident on the mobile device. The apparatus further comprises means for redirecting the purchasing information to a browser application or a messaging application on the mobile device based on the determination of whether the purchasing application is resident on the mobile device.","According to another embodiment, a method comprises receiving purchasing information. The method also comprises directing a browser application to a script associated with the purchasing information that is used to determine whether a purchasing application is resident and to redirect the purchasing information to the browser application or a messaging application based on the determination.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprising at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to receive purchasing information. The apparatus is also caused to direct a browser application to a script associated with the purchasing information that is used to determine whether a purchasing application is resident and to redirect the purchasing information to the browser application or a messaging application based on the determination.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause an apparatus to receive purchasing information. The apparatus is also caused to direct a browser application to a script associated with the purchasing information that is used to determine whether a purchasing application is resident and to redirect the purchasing information to the browser application or a messaging application based on the determination.","According to yet another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for receiving purchasing information. The method also comprises means for directing a browser application to a script associated with the purchasing information that is used to determine whether a purchasing application is resident and to redirect the purchasing information to the browser application or a messaging application based on the determination.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","A method and apparatus for displaying purchasing information are disclosed. In the following description, for the purpose of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.","Although various embodiments are described herein with respect to displaying purchasing information on a mobile device, it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used with other devices capable of displaying purchasing information including, for example, a fixed device such as a desktop computer, communication terminal, and the like. As used herein, the term \u201cpurchasing information\u201d comprises information (e.g., description, pictures, pricing, availability, etc.) related to items available for purchase. For example, these items include applications, services, content, items, and other goods. It is contemplated that purchasing information may also include information related to paying for the items including method of payment (e.g., credit card, telephone account billing, operator billing), account information, and authentication credentials.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"To address this problem, a system  of  enables the transmission of purchasing information to a user's mobile device using, for instance, a link in a short message service (SMS) text message, a multimedia messaging service (MMS) message, electronic mail (E-mail) message, and other similar messaging services. In certain embodiments, the link may also be provided by another application (e.g., when the application suggests an item to purchase). The link includes, for instance, a script that is processed by a browser application on the mobile device to determine whether a purchasing application is installed and resident on the mobile device. In one embodiment, the purchasing application is a standalone application capable of displaying the purchasing information. As a standalone application in the mobile device, the purchasing application can provide, for example, a user interface that is more integrated with the operating system of the mobile device, and therefore easier for the user to use. However, in some cases, the purchasing application may not be available or installed on a particular mobile device. In such a case, the system  redirects the purchasing information to be displayed in the browser application or a messaging application (e.g., SMS application, MMS application, E-mail application, instant messaging application) of the mobile device instead of in the purchasing application. In this way, the system  can provide a similar user experience for purchasing an item using the browser application or a messaging application that is provided by the purchasing application. More generally, the approach of system  enables transmission of specific purchasing information for display on a purchasing application (e.g., to direct users to specific purchasing information that the user may not otherwise discover, or to promote products and services as part of an advertising or marketing campaign) and to redirect that information for display on a browser application or a messaging application if the purchasing application is not present. The system  can determine whether to redirect the purchasing application to the browser application or the messaging application based on, for instance, user preference or data network availability.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  having connectivity to a purchasing redirection platform  via a communication network . The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.). As described above, the purchasing redirection platform  transmits purchasing information over the communication network  for display on the UE  using the purchasing application  if installed on the device. If the purchasing application  is not installed, the purchasing redirection platform  redirects the purchasing information to either the browser application  or the messaging application . For example, if the purchasing information is redirected to the browser application , the user can view the purchasing information and complete a purchase of the items described in the purchasing information using the browser application . Similarly, if the purchasing information is directed to the messaging application , the purchasing information may be presented as an SMS message, MMS message, or E-mail. In one embodiment, the user can then respond to the message containing the purchasing information to initiate purchase of one or more items described by the purchasing information.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network (not shown), a wireless network (not shown), a telephony network (not shown), or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like.","The purchasing redirection platform  and the UE  also have connectivity to one or more online merchants  through the communication network . Typically, the online merchants  provide a range of items available for purchase. The online merchants  may also include content providers or other service providers (not shown) with access to the communication network . In one embodiment, the purchasing redirection platform  obtains the purchasing information from one or more of the online merchants  for transmission to the UE . In addition, the purchasing redirection platform  has connectivity to one or more external applications  (e.g., a navigation application, a music player) that can provide purchasing information to the purchasing redirection platform . For example, a navigation application may provide purchasing information for new maps or maps for other regions. Similarly, a music player may provide purchasing information for songs or other media. It is contemplated that the purchasing redirection platform  also has connectivity to other applications  running on the UE . These applications may perform, for instance, the same functions performed by the external applications  (e.g., navigation, music), but are run on the UE  (e.g., mobile device) itself The purchasing information from these applications (e.g., external applications  and other applications ) can then be transmitted to the UE  by the purchasing redirection platform . After transmitting the information, the purchasing redirection platform  can direct the information to the purchasing application , the browser application , or the messaging application  depending on the presence of the purchasing application . As shown, the purchasing redirection platform  is a standalone component on the communication network . In addition or alternatively, the purchasing redirection platform  may be included in one or more of the online merchants , the external applications , or the other applications .","By way of example, the UE , the purchasing redirection platform , the online merchants , and the external applications  communicate with each other and with other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  (e.g., UE , purchasing redirection platform ) interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application headers (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","101","103","201","101","201","105","201","101"]},"To obtain purchasing information, the scripting module  interacts with a database of purchasing information within the purchasing redirection platform . The purchasing information database contains information related one or more items available for sale. For example, the database may provide the item name, description, vendor, availability, price, etc. for each item in the database. It is contemplated that the item may include services, applications, goods, content, or a combination thereof available for sale over the communication network . In addition or alternatively, the scripting module  may obtain purchasing information from a purchasing database associated with one or more online merchants  or from a purchasing database associated with one or more external applications  or other applications .","By way of example, the scripting module  interacts with a merchant interface module  to access the purchasing information database . The merchant interface module  provides access to public or private application programming interfaces (APIs) corresponding to the online merchants . In this example, public APIs are those released publicly by the online merchant  for access publicly available functions or data provided by the merchant . Private APIs are those provided, for instance, for granting private access to certain functions and data of the online merchant . For example, private APIs are typically exchanged through mutual agreement between the online merchant  and the provider of the purchasing redirection platform .","Similarly, the scripting module  interacts with the purchasing information database of the external applications  using an API  of the purchasing information platform . In this embodiment, the API  provides the external applications  and other applications  access to the functions of the purchasing redirection platform . In this way, the external applications  and other applications  may direct the scripting module  to transmit purchasing information related to the external applications  and other applications . As described previously, a navigation application may, for instance, direct the scripting module  to transmit purchasing information related to new maps for use in the navigation application.","After generating the script including or pointing to the purchasing information obtained from the purchasing redirection platform , the online merchants , the external applications , the other applications , or a combination thereof, the scripting module  directs the messaging module  to transmit the script to the UE . By way of example, the messaging module  can transmit the script using any messaging service available to the UE  including SMS, MMS, E-mail, or a combination thereof In one embodiment, the script is transmitted as a link within the transmitted message (e.g., SMS message, MMS message, E-mail message, instant messaging message such as Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) message). If the purchasing information is provided by an application (e.g., external applications  or other applications ), the application may provide the link directly to the UE  via application processes or via the purchasing redirection platform  using the API .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["103","300","301","103","101","103","115","117","103","207"]},"The purchasing redirection platform  then determines whether a purchasing application  is resident on the mobile device (step ). In one embodiment, the determination is made by directing the browser application  within the mobile device to access a script associated with the purchasing information. For example, the script is provided with the link transmitted by the platform  or an external application (e.g., external application  or other application ). On accessing the script using the browser application , the script detects whether the purchasing application  is installed on the mobile device (step ).","If the purchasing application  is installed or resident on the mobile device, the purchasing redirection platform  initiates display of the purchasing information in the purchasing application  (step ). In one embodiment, the process of displaying the purchasing information includes launching the purchasing application . The launch of the purchasing application  can be initiated, for instance, using a command in the script associated with the purchasing information. After launching the purchasing application , the purchasing information may direct the purchasing application  to display a specific view such as a purchasing category (e.g., a category of \u201cbooks,\u201d or a category of recommended content based on user preferences or purchasing history), a purchasing channel (e.g., a collection of items designated by, for instance, an online merchant ), a purchase item (e.g., a song, other media content, an application, goods, a service, etc.), or a combination thereof If the purchasing application  is not present, the purchasing redirection platform  redirects the purchasing information to the browser application  or the messaging application  for display. For example, the purchasing redirection platform  directs the browser to an Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) version of the purchasing information. As discussed previously, the purchasing redirection platform  can also transmit the purchasing information to the messaging application  in an SMS message, MMS message, E-mail message, and\/or instant message. By way of example, the purchasing redirection platform  determines whether to redirect the purchasing information to the browser application  or the messaging application based on user preference or other criteria such as networking availability or traffic. For example, the user may configure the purchasing redirection platform  to redirect the purchasing information to either the browser application  or the messaging application . In other embodiments, the purchasing redirection platform  can determine whether the UE  has connectivity to the data network within the communication network  to support a browser session for display of the purchasing information. If not, the purchasing redirection platform  redirects the purchasing information to the messaging application . In this way, the purchasing redirection platform  can direct a user to specific purchasing information even when the user's mobile device does not have the purchasing application  installed. This approach advantageously enables the user to discover new purchasing information while reducing the burden of viewing a large catalog of purchase items on the limited display of a mobile device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 7"],"b":["400","101","401","101","103","103","101","115","117","107","403","405"]},"The script operates as described with respect to . Specifically, if the purchasing application  is present, the UE  receives a signal from the purchasing redirection platform  to initiate display of the purchasing information in the purchasing application  (step ). The signal, for instance, may be triggered by the script or may be initiated by the purchasing redirection platform  as additional purchasing information transmitted to the purchasing application . In other embodiments, the signal comprises the act of forwarding the purchasing information to the purchasing application  by the script or the browser application . If the purchasing application  is not present, the purchasing information is redirected to the browser application  or the messaging application  as described above to provide the same or similar user interface and user experience as provided by the purchasing application  (step ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 5A"],"b":["500","109","107","101","109","109","101","500","501","500","503","505","507"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 5B","b":["520","107","103","107","101","103","107","520","500","520","107","500","109","500","520","103","107","101","521","520","501","500","523","503","500","525","505","500","520","527","507","107","109","500","520","109","107"]},"The processes described herein for displaying purchasing information may be advantageously implemented via software, hardware (e.g., general processor, Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.), firmware or a combination thereof Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","610","600"]},"A bus  includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus . One or more processors  for processing information are coupled with the bus .","A processor  performs a set of operations on information as specified by computer program code related to display purchasing information. The computer program code is a set of instructions or statements providing instructions for the operation of the processor and\/or the computer system to perform specified functions. The code, for example, may be written in a computer programming language that is compiled into a native instruction set of the processor. The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set (e.g., machine language). The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus  and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information, shifting positions of units of information, and combining two or more units of information, such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR, exclusive OR (XOR), and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions, such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor , such as a sequence of operation codes, constitute processor instructions, also called computer system instructions or, simply, computer instructions. Processors may be implemented as mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, chemical or quantum components, among others, alone or in combination.","Computer system  also includes a memory  coupled to bus . The memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, stores information including processor instructions for displaying purchasing information. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory  is also used by the processor  to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. The computer system  also includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to the bus  for storing static information, including instructions, that is not changed by the computer system . Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus  is a non-volatile (persistent) storage device , such as a magnetic disk, optical disk or flash card, for storing information, including instructions, that persists even when the computer system  is turned off or otherwise loses power.","Information, including instructions for displaying purchasing information, is provided to the bus  for use by the processor from an external input device , such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user, or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus , used primarily for interacting with humans, include a display device , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT) or a liquid crystal display (LCD), or plasma screen or printer for presenting text or images, and a pointing device , such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys, or motion sensor, for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display  and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display . In some embodiments, for example, in embodiments in which the computer system  performs all functions automatically without human input, one or more of external input device , display device  and pointing device  is omitted.","In the illustrated embodiment, special purpose hardware, such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) , is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor  quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display , cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network, speech recognition, and interfaces to special external devices, such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.","Computer system  also includes one or more instances of a communications interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a one-way or two-way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors, such as printers, scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link  that is connected to a local network  to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example, communication interface  may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus (USB) port on a personal computer. In some embodiments, communications interface  is an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments, a communication interface  is a cable modem that converts signals on bus  into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example, communications interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN, such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links, the communications interface  sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical, acoustic or electromagnetic signals, including infrared and optical signals, that carry information streams, such as digital data. For example, in wireless handheld devices, such as mobile telephones like cell phones, the communications interface  includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments, the communications interface  enables connection to the communication network  for transmitting purchasing and redirecting the display of that information on the UE .","The term computer-readable medium is used herein to refer to any medium that participates in providing information to processor , including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including, but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media include, for example, dynamic memory . Transmission media include, for example, coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic cables, and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables, such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves, including radio, optical and infrared waves. Signals include man-made transient variations in amplitude, frequency, phase, polarization or other physical properties transmitted through the transmission media. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","700","6"]},"In one embodiment, the chip set  includes a communication mechanism such as a bus  for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor  has connectivity to the bus  to execute instructions and process information stored in, for example, a memory . The processor  may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi-core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi-core processor include two, four, eight, or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition, the processor  may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus  to enable independent execution of instructions, pipelining, and multithreading. The processor  may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors (DSP) , or one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) . A DSP  typically is configured to process real-world signals (e.g., sound) in real time independently of the processor . Similarly, an ASIC  can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor.

The power amplifier (PA)  and the transmitter\/modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU , with an output from the PA  coupled to the duplexer  or circulator or antenna switch, as known in the art. The PA  also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .","In use, a user of mobile station  speaks into the microphone  and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) . The control unit  routes the digital signal into the DSP  for processing therein, such as speech encoding, channel encoding, encrypting, and interleaving. In one embodiment, the processed voice signals are encoded, by units not separately shown, using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.","The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer  for compensation of any frequency-dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream, the modulator  combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator  generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission, an up-converter  combines the sine wave output from the modulator  with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer  to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA  to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems, the PA  acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP  from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer  and optionally sent to an antenna coupler  to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally, the signal is transmitted via antenna  to a local base station. An automatic gain control (AGC) can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone, other mobile phone or a land-line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), or other telephony networks.","Voice signals transmitted to the mobile station  are received via antenna  and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier (LNA) . A down-converter  lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator  strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer  and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)  converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker , all under control of a Main Control Unit (MCU) \u2014which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit (CPU) (not shown).","The MCU  receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard  and\/or the MCU  in combination with other user input components (e.g., the microphone ) comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU  runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile station  to display purchasing information. The MCU  also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display  and to the speech output switching controller, respectively. Further, the MCU  exchanges information with the DSP  and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card  and a memory . In addition, the MCU  executes various control functions required of the station. The DSP  may, depending upon the implementation, perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally, DSP  determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone  and sets the gain of microphone  to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile station .","The CODEC  includes the ADC  and DAC . The memory  stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via, e.g., the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory, flash memory, registers, or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device  may be, but not limited to, a single memory, CD, DVD, ROM, RAM, EEPROM, optical storage, or any other non-volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.","An optionally incorporated SIM card  carries, for instance, important information, such as the cellular phone number, the carrier supplying service, subscription details, and security information. The SIM card  serves primarily to identify the mobile station  on a radio network. The card  also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry, text messages, and user specific mobile station settings.","While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations, the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements, which fall within the purview of the appended claims.
