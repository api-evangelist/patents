Technical Field","The present invention relates to an access control device and an electronic device, and more particularly, to an access control device which controls an access right with respect to a plurality of electronic devices present in a network for each combination of electronic devices, and an electronic device which achieves a desired service in association with an application stored in another electronic device via a network, in accordance with a control of the access right by the access control device.","2. Background Art","Conventional electronic devices, such as a digital TV, a mobile telephone, and the like, are increasingly having a function of downloading a program described in Java\u00ae language or the like and executing the downloaded program. For example, in the field of mobile telephones, NTT DoCoMo provides a service called \u201ci-appli\u201d. In the service, a mobile telephone terminal downloads a Java\u00ae program from an application distribution server on the Internet, and executes the program on the terminal. In Europe, a specification called \u201cDVB-MHP (Digital Video Broadcasting-Multimedia Home Platform)\u201d has been established, and a service was already started in conformity with the specification. In digital broadcasting based on the DVB-MHP standards, a digital TV receives and executes a Java\u00ae program multiplexed with a broadcast wave.","In such a program distribution service, a number of security functions are incorporated so as to prevent unauthorized access of an application to an electronic device. By using the security functions, conventional electronic devices prevent unauthorized access from an application created by, for example, a malicious creator. Specifically, conventional electronic devices are provided with, for example, a function of confirming authentication information given to an application to confirm the identity of a creator of the application, a function of controlling API (Application Programming Interface) for accessing a computer resource available on an electronic device, depending on the presence or absence of authentication information, or the like.","Patent Document 1 discloses a conventional electronic device having a function of preventing unauthorized access.  is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of the conventional electronic device. In , the conventional electronic device  comprises computer resources to , an application executing section , and an access permission control section . The computer resources to are resources which are used by the electronic device  so as to achieve a predetermined function. Specifically, the computer resources to are a memory resource, a resource for achieving connection with respect to an external device, and the like. The application executing section  downloads an application program via a network from an application server . When the application program is proved not to be an unauthorized program by a third party or the like, authentication information is attached to the application program ","When the authentication information is attached to the application program , the access permission control section  permits access of the application program to all the computer resources to . On the other hand, when the authentication information is not attached to the application program , the access permission control section  prohibits access of the application program to all the computer resources to . Thus, the conventional electronic device  prevents access of unauthorized programs to the computer resources to ","In recent applications, there are not only an application which achieves a predetermined service using a single electronic device, but also an application which achieves a predetermined service in association with a plurality of electronic devices via a network. Examples of an electronic device which executes such an application include a mobile telephone which performs timer recording with respect to a video recorder device, a personal computer which shares image data, and the like.

On the other hand, when the access request is present in the access list, the control section  extracts an access request function and an argument list from the access request message (see ), and executes access to the application executing section  (step S).","An example in which the access control device , the electronic device  and the electronic device  of the present invention are applied to an application distribution type service, will be described. In this applied example, the electronic device  is assumed to be a device which downloads and executes an application from an application distribution server. The electronic device  is assumed to be the application distribution server. In such a case, the electronic device  can selectively download only an application corresponding to a function permitted by permission information, from the electronic device , based on authority information generated by the access control device . Thereby, the electronic device  can avoid downloading an application which includes execution which is not permitted.","Note that the electronic device  may further comprise the permission information storing section  and the permission information receiving section . Thereby, the electronic device  can achieve an operation similar to that of the electronic device . The electronic device  may further comprise the authority information storing section , the authority information requesting section , and the authority information receiving section . Thereby, the electronic device  can achieve an operation similar to that of the electronic device .","Note that the procedures of the access control device , the electronic device  and the electronic device  of the embodiment of the present invention may be implemented by a CPU interpreting and executing predetermined program data which can execute the above-described procedures which are stored in a storage device (a ROM, a RAM, a hard disk, etc.). In this case, the program data may be introduced via a storage medium to the storage device, or may be executed directly from the storage medium. Note that the storage medium refers to a semiconductor memory (a ROM, a RAM, a flash memory, etc.), a magnetic disk memory (e.g., a flexible disk, a hard disk, etc.), an optical disc memory (e.g., a CD-ROM, a DVD, a BD, etc.), a memory card, or the like. The storage medium has a concept including communication media (a telephone line, a transmission channel, etc.).","As described above, the access control device  of the present invention generates authority information and permission information in relation with each other, and transmits the generated authority information to the electronic device  which is to do access, and the permission information to the electronic device  which is to be accessed. Thereby, the access control device  can control an access right to a plurality of electronic devices present in a network for each combination of electronic devices.","Since the electronic device  of the present invention requests access to the electronic device  only when given authority according to authority information, it is possible to prevent request for access to an electronic device which is not given authority. Also, since the electronic device  permits access from the electronic device  only when permitted according to permission information, it is possible to prevent access from an electronic device which is not given permission. Thereby, the electronic device  and the electronic device  can provide a predetermined service in association with each other via a network while preventing unauthorized access.","The access control device of the present invention is effective for a control of an access right with respect to a plurality of electronic devices present in a network for each combination of electronic devices, for example."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"102"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"107"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["100","200"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":"100"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"205"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":"200"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":"300"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
