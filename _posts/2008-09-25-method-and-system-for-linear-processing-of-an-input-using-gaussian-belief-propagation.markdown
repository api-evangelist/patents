{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government assistance under National Science Foundation (NSF) Grant No. CCR-0514859. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates generally to the field of signal processing. Embodiments of the invention relate more particularly to signal processing for communications.","In many areas of science and engineering, such as but not limited to communications, it is desirable to solve a system of linear equations, e.g., to solve Ax=b. Solving such equations, using methods such as inverting matrix A (that is, to provide matrix A\u2032) can be performed either directly or iteratively. However, many conventional processes either require undesirable computational resources, or may not arrive at a useful solution. Often, such solutions are impractical in real-world implementations.","As a nonlimiting example, a signal may be received by a communications device, where the signal corresponds to a data vector. This data vector, in turn, is based on at least a message vector, a data matrix (e.g., due to known communication techniques), and an amount of noise. To determine the message vector from the received data vector, a matrix inversion or similar method can be performed on the received signal. However, for large, sparse, and\/or amorphous data matrices, direct methods are impractical due to the need for excessive row reordering operations. Further, the iterative approaches may converge asymptotically to the solution, and thus may converge slowly or not at all.","Embodiments of the present invention provide, among other things, a method for processing an input. An input vector y is received that represents a noisy observation of Ax, where A is a data matrix and x is a data vector of unknown variables. Data vector x is recovered from the received input vector y via an iterative method. The recovering comprises determining an inference of a vector of marginal means over a graph G, where the graph G is of a joint Gaussian probability density function p(x) associated with noise in the received input vector y.","For a system of linear equations Ax=b, given the observation vector b\u03b5 n\u03b5 and the data matrix A\u03b5 a unique solution, x=x*\u03b5 exists if and only if the data matrix A is full rank. For example, consider the case where the data matrices, A, are also symmetric (e.g., as in correlation matrices). Assuming a nonsingular symmetric matrix A, the system of equations can be solved either directly or in an iterative manner. Direct matrix inversion methods, such as but not limited to Gaussian elimination or band Cholesky factorization, find the solution with a finite number of operations, typically, for a dense n\u00d7n matrix, on the order of n. The former is particularly effective for systems with unstructured dense data matrices, while the latter is typically used for structured dense systems.","Iterative methods are inherently simpler, requiring only additions and multiplications, and have the further advantage that they can exploit the sparsity of the matrix A to reduce the computational complexity as well as the algorithmic storage requirements. By comparison, for large, sparse, and amorphous data matrices, the direct methods are impractical due to the need for excessive row reordering operations.","The main drawback of the iterative approach is that, under certain conditions, they converge only asymptotically to the exact solution x*. Thus, there is the risk that they may converge slowly, or not at all. In practice, however, it has been found that they often converge to the exact solution or a good approximation after a relatively small number of iterations. A powerful and efficient iterative algorithm, belief propagation (BP), also known as the sum-product algorithm, has been used very successfully to solve, either exactly or approximately, inference problems in probabilistic graphical models.","According to embodiments of the present invention, an input represented by a linear system of algebraic equations can be solved as a probabilistic inference problem on a suitably-defined graph. A more particular example method of the present invention, Gaussian BP (GaBP), provides an efficient, distributed approach to solving a linear system that circumvents the potentially complex operation of direct matrix inversion.","Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures that are not to scale, which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments, artisans will recognize additional features and broader aspects of the invention.","Generally, embodiments of the present invention provide systems, methods, and\/or devices for processing inputs from any system that can be modeled by y=Ax, where y is an n\u00d71 vector of observations, A is a data matrix, for example square (i.e., n\u00d7n) or rectangular (i.e., m\u00d7n), and x is a n\u00d71 vector of unknowns. Put another way, embodiments of the present invention can process channels where y is a noisy observation of Ax.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","10"]},"The device  includes an input  for receiving a signal representing a data input vector. Example inputs include a suitable input signal path, which may be configured to receive a processed signal (via any suitable methods), an unprocessed signal, a partially processed signal, a filtered signal, a partially filtered signal, an unfiltered signal, or any combination thereof. Processing logic  for performing methods of the present invention is provided, and such logic may be, as a nonlimiting example, encoded into the signal processing device . The processing logic  includes logic for recovering a message vector from the data input vector. An output  provides a signal representative of a recovered message vector (or, as a nonlimiting embodiment, a signal that can be further processed to provide a recovered message vector without performing matrix inversion). This output signal, as nonlimiting examples, can be displayed on any suitable display, printed on any suitable medium, stored to any suitable medium, stored in memory (e.g., physical or virtual memory), delivered over a network, used as an input for additional processing via any of the above methods, etc.","Generally, the processing logic  receives an input vector (e.g., receives a signal corresponding to an input vector) that represents a noisy observation of Ax. A is a data matrix, such as a two-dimensional matrix, either rectangular (e.g., m\u00d7n) or square (e.g., n\u00d7n). This data matrix A is based on any of various origins, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. Nonlimiting examples are provided herein. Data vector x represents data to be recovered by an example method according to the present invention. This vector x may represent, as a nonlimiting example, a message to be recovered, a solution to a linear algebra problem, or any of various other data vectors.","The input data vector y also includes noise, which for example embodiments of the present invention is assumed to be Gaussian noise, though the invention is not to be limited to this assumption. This noise may be incorporated into data matrix A, and may be separately represented in nonlimiting examples by a noise vector n. Noise can originate from any of a variety of sources, including but not limited to signal noise in communications, or simply unknowns when generating a solution to a linear algebra problem. Thus, it is to be understood that \u201cnoise\u201d may be any type of data that may be represented as noise by the equations described herein.","The general goal of embodiments of the present invention is to recover the data vector x from input data vector y. In example embodiments of the present invention, this is done by an iterative method that determines an inference of a vector of marginal means over a graph G, where the graph G is of a joint Gaussian probability density function p(x) associated with noise in the received input vector y. Generally, the graph G includes a set of continuous variable nodes that are in one-to-one correspondence with the vector of unknowns, x, and the set of undirected edges, between variable nodes, is determined by the non-zero entries of the data matrix A. Example methods for recovering data vector x are referred to herein as Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) methods.","A general description of example Gaussian belief propagation methods follows. In the description, the following notation will be used: the operator {\u2022}denotes a vector or matrix transpose, the matrix Iis an n\u00d7n identity matrix, while the symbols {\u2022}and {\u2022}denote entries of a vector and matrix, respectively.","First, define an undirected graphical model (i.e., a Markov random field) G, corresponding to the linear system of equations. Specifically, let G=(x, \u03b5), where x is a set of nodes that are in one-to-one correspondence with the linear system's variables x={x, . . . , x}, and where \u03b5 is a set of undirected edges determined by the non-zero entries of the (symmetric) matrix A. Using this graph, one can translate the problem of solving the linear system from the algebraic domain to the domain of probabilistic inference, as stated in the following theorem:","The computation of the solution vector x* is identical to the inference of the vector of marginal means \u03bc={\u03bc, . . . , \u03bc} over the graph G with the associated joint Gaussian probability density function",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"p","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"x"}},{"mrow":{"mi":"N","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bc","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mover":{"mo":"=","mi":"\u0394"},"mrow":{"msup":{"mi":"A","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mi":"b"}},"mo":",","msup":{"mi":"A","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}}}},"mo":"."}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mtext":"~"}}}}},"Proof:

algorithm. In this variant of BP, a maximization operation is performed rather than marginalization, i.e., variables are eliminated by taking maxima instead of sums. For trellis trees (as nonlimiting examples, graphical representation of convolutional codes or ISI channels), the conventional sum-product BP algorithm boils down to performing the BCJR algorithm, resulting in the most probable symbol, while its max-product counterpart is equivalent to the Viterbi algorithm, thus inferring the most probable sequence of symbols.","In order to derive the max-product version of an example GaBP solver, the integral (sum)-product rule is replaced by a new rule\n\n()\u221dargmax\u03c8()\u03c6()\u03a0().\n","Computing m(x) according to this max-product rule, one gets\n\n()\u221d(\u03bc\u03bc),\n\nwhich is identical to the messages derived for the sum-product case. Thus, it can be shown that the max-product and sum-product version of the example GaBP solver are identical.\n","In ordinary BP, convergence does not guarantee exactness of the inferred probabilities, unless the graph has no cycles. Advantageously, this is not the case with example GaBP solvers of the present invention. Its underlying Gaussian nature yields a direct connection between convergence and exact inference. Moreover, in contrast to conventional BP, the convergence of GaBP in example methods is not limited to acyclic or sparse graphs and can occur even for dense (fully-connected) graphs, adhering to certain rules.","For example, one can use known probabilistic inferences in graphical models to help determine the convergence and exactness properties of the example GaBP solver. The following two theorems establish sufficient conditions under which GaBP will always converge to the exact marginal means.\n\n","However, there are many examples of linear systems that violate these conditions for which the example GaBP solver nevertheless converges to the exact solution. As one nonlimiting example, if the graph corresponding to the system is acyclic (i.e., a tree), the example GaBP yields the exact marginal means (and even marginal variances), regardless of the value of the spectral radius.","Further speed-up of the GaBP solver can be achieved by adopting known acceleration techniques from linear algebra. Table 2 demonstrates the speed-up of an example GaBP solver obtained by using such an acceleration method, termed Steffensen's iterations (P. Henrici, Elements of Numerical Analysis, New York: John Wiley and Songs, 1964), in comparison with the accelerated Jacobi algorithm (e.g., as disclosed in O. Axelsson, Iterative Solution Methods, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1994) (diverged for the 4 users setup). This provides a unique setup using an acceleration method within the framework of message-passing algorithms.

However, these examples are not intended to limit the methods and systems of the present invention to the particular methods or devices disclosed herein.","One such example application is communications. As explained above, the underlying essence of estimation theory is to detect a hidden input to a channel from its observed noisy output. The channel can be represented as a certain graphical model, while the detection of the channel input is equivalent to performing inference in the corresponding graph. However, although particular examples described herein are directed to estimation-theoretic problems and applications from the field of communications, methods of the present invention are broadly applicable to problems of efficient distributed matrix inversion, solution of systems of linear equations, and determinant calculation, and methods, devices, and systems for solving such problems are examples of embodiments of the present invention.","BP has been proven beneficial in various applications in communications. Applications of processing devices, methods, and\/or systems of the present invention include, but are not limited to, processing communication signals.  shows an example communication device , which may be any device, portable or non-portable, which can perform methods according to the present invention. Nonlimiting examples include mobile telephones, portable computing devices, receivers, servers, clients, network devices, and\/or personal computers. The communication device  includes at least one antenna  for receiving wireless signals. One or more signal conditioners  and analog\/digital converters  may be used to process the received signal, as is well known in the art. A processor  controls functions of the communication device , and suitable memory  and input devices  (e.g., a keypad or touchscreen) and output devices  (e.g., a display or transmitter) may be provided for device use.","An input data signal is supplied to the processor , which in a nonlimiting example is suitably configured to perform methods of the present invention. The processor  may be one processor, or may be several processors configured to perform particular methods of the present invention. In addition to logic  for performing the data recovery as discussed above, one or more filters (e.g., matched filters)  may be provided, depending on the type of wireless communication performed. A suitable power supply  is provided, and suitable coupled to the various components of the communication device .","One nonlimiting example of communication signal uses code division multiple access (CDMA), the details of which will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. For randomly-spread code-divisional multiple-access (CDMA) in the large-system limit, a tractable BP-based multiuser detection (MUD) scheme has been employed, which exhibits near-optimal error performance for binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channels. This message-passing scheme has been extended to the case where the ambient noise level is unknown. As for sub-optimal detection, the nonlinear soft parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detector has been reformulated as an approximate BP solution to the MUD problem.","CDMA may include, e.g., K users and spreading codes of length N. In an example signal processing algorithm according to embodiments of the present invention, the received signal can be represented by r=Sx+n, where r is the N-length vector of received samples at an antenna, S is the N\u00d7K spreading codes matrix, in which each user has its own dedicated spreading code=column in the matrix, and n is the n-length additive vector, such as but not limited to a white Gaussian noise vector.","A matched filter S\u2032 (e.g., at a front end of a receiver, as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art) can be used to filter the samples to get y=S\u2032r=S\u2032Sx+S\u2032n=Rx+z. (In this example, S\u2032 indicates a conjugate-transpose operator of S.) In this equation, y is the K-length vector of observations, R is the spreading code's cross-correlation matrix (K\u00d7K matrix), and z is the K-length colored noise vector. This corresponds to the general GaBP model above, where A=R and n=K.","An example embodiment of the present invention can be used for efficient and distributed implementation of a detector Ay (a decorrelator). Other example detectors provided under embodiments of the present invention include detectors that are implemented via matrix inversion, such as but not limited to linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detectors.","Another example system according to embodiments of the present invention is a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. For example, consider a system with l transmitting antennas and m receiving antennas (for example, the communications device  may have multiple receiving antennas). Here, r=Hx+n, where r is the m-length vector of symbols received in m antennas, H is the m\u00d71 matrix of channel paths, where each entry denotes the gain of the effective channel between a certain Ttransmitting antenna out of the l antennas and a certain Rreceiving antenna out of the m receiving antennas, and n is a noise vector, such as but not limited to an m-length additive white Gaussian noise vector.","As with the CDMA example above, an example embodiment of the present invention uses a matched filter H\u2032, which is a front end of MIMO receivers, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. The matched filter provides y=H\u2032r=H\u2032Hx+H\u2032n=Rx+z, where y is the m-length vector of observations, R is the cross-correlation matrix (e.g., an m\u00d7m matrix), and z is an m-length colored noise vector. Again, the general Gaussian model above is applicable, with A=R and n=m.","Yet another example system, device, and method according to embodiments of the present invention processes signals using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Processing this signal provides y=Gx, where x is a K-length vector of information bits, G is a K\u00d7K system matrix, and y is a K-length observed vector. K, as a non-limiting example, is between 512-8192, sufficiently large to allow an efficient matrix inversion algorithm.","Still another example system, device, and method according to embodiments of the present invention processes signals using intersymbol interference (ISI) equalization. Similar to CDMA, ISI uses a correlation matrix (R), but these are interferences of time as opposed to interference among users. This signal processing method compensates for interference cause delayed replicas of the same transmitted symbol (e.g., due to reflections from large objects, such as but not limited to mountains, buildings, etc.).","In contrast to the dense, fully-connected nature of the graphical model of the non-orthogonal CDMA channel, a one-dimensional (1-D) ISI channel can be interpreted as a cycle-free tree graph. Thus, detection in 1-D ISI channels (termed equalization) can be performed in an optimal maximum a-posteriori (MAP) manner via BP, also known in this context as the forward\/backward, or BCJR, algorithm. Further, an iterative BP-like detection algorithm for 1-D ISI channels has been proposed that uses a parallel message-passing schedule and achieves near-optimal performance.","For the intermediate regime of non-dense graphs but with many relatively short loops, extensions of BP to two-dimensional ISI channels have been considered, and more recently, the near-optimality of a generalized version of BP for such channels has been demonstrated. Further, BP has been proven to asymptotically achieve optimal MAP detection for sparse linear systems with Gaussian noise, for example, in CDMA with sparse spreading codes.","An important class of practical sub-optimal detectors is based on linear detection. This class includes, for instance, the conventional single-user matched filter (MF), decorrelator (aka zero-forcing equalizer), linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector, and many other detectors with widespread applicability. In general, linear detection can be viewed as the solution to a (deterministic) set of linear equations describing the original (probabilistic) estimation problem. The mathematical operation behind linear detection extends to other tasks in communication, such as but not limited to channel precoding at the transmitter.","However, in spite of its significant role in estimation theory, linear detection has never been explicitly linked to BP, in contrast to optimal MAP detection and several sub-optimal nonlinear detection techniques.","Embodiments of the present invention use a general linear detection reformulated as a GaBP algorithm. This message-passing framework is not limited to the large-system limit and is suitable for channels with arbitrary prior input distribution. Revealing this missing link allows for a distributed implementation of the linear detector, circumventing the necessity of (potentially cumbersome) matrix inversion (via, e.g., Gaussian elimination).","GaBP is shown to yield faster convergence than conventional methods of solving systems of linear equations. BP-based MUD, recently derived and analyzed for Gaussian input symbols, is an instance of a larger overall framework. GaBP convergence can be further accelerated.","Consider a discrete-time channel with a real input vector x={x, . . . , x}governed by an arbitrary prior distribution, P, and a corresponding real output vector y={y, . . . , y}=f{x}\u03b5 (an extension to the complex domain is straightforward.) Here, the function \u0192{\u2022} denotes the channel transformation. By definition, linear detection compels the decision rule to be\n\n\n\nwhere b=y is the K\u00d71 observation vector, and the K\u00d7K matrix A is a positive-definite symmetric matrix approximating the channel transformation. The vector x* is the solution (over  to Ax=b. Estimation is completed by adjusting the (inverse) matrix-vector product to the input alphabet, dictated by P, accomplished by using a proper clipping function \u0394{\u2022} (e.g., for binary signaling \u0394{\u2022} is the sign function).\n","For example, linear channels, which appear extensively in many applications in communication and data storage systems, are characterized by the linear relation\n\n\n\nwhere n is a K\u00d71 additive noise vector and R=SS is a positive-definite symmetric matrix, often known as the correlation matrix. The N\u00d7K matrix S describes the physical channel medium, while the vector y corresponds to the output of a bank of filters matched to the physical channel S.\n","Note that, due to the vast applicability of linear channels, example experiments described herein are directed to such channels, though the invention is not to be limited to this case.

As expected, the Jacobi algorithm converges in zigzags towards the fixed point. The fastest algorithm is serial GaBP. GaBP convergence is in a spiral shape, suggesting that despite the overall convergence improvement, performance improvement is not guaranteed in successive iteration rounds. The spiral nature of GaBP convergence is better viewed in . In this case, the system was simulated with a certain R matrix for which Jacobi algorithm and other standard methods did not converge. Using Aitken's method, a further speed-up in GaBP convergence is obtained.","Despite the fact that examples of small systems are described herein, these illustrate typical behavior of various algorithms. GaBP has been exponentially shown to converge in a logarithmic number of iterations in the cases of very large matrices both dense (e.g., with up to hundreds of thousands of dimensions) and sparse (e.g., with up to millions of dimensions).","Example embodiments of the present invention using GaBP for linear detection allow for a distributed implementation of the linear detector, circumventing the need of (potentially cumbersome) direct matrix inversion, such as via Gaussian elimination. Example GaBP methods can yield faster convergence than many conventional methods.","For particular example GaBP methods, the input matrix R=SS(the chip correlation matrix) is computed prior to running the algorithm. This computation requires nk operations. In the case where the matrix S is sparse, the matrix R might no longer be sparse. Further, an example GaBP method uses 2nmemory to store the messages. For a large n, this could be prohibitive.","An alternative method according to embodiments of the present invention is provided to address these issues. In this alternative method, given a non-rectangular CDMA matrix S, an MMSE detector x=(SS+\u03a8)Sy is computed where \u03a8 is the AWGN diagonal covariance matrix. An example GaBP algorithm, which is an efficient distribution algorithm, is utilized. Construction according to this example embodiment uses only 2nk memory for storing the messages. When k<<n this represents significant saving relative to the 2nin the example GaBP algorithm described above. Furthermore, SS need not be explicitly computed, saving an additional nk overhead.","Again, consider a discrete-time channel with a real input vector x={x, . . . , x}governed by an arbitrary prior distribution, P, and a corresponding real output vector y={y, . . . , y}=f{x}\u03b5. Here, the function \u0192{\u2022} denotes the channel transformation. By definition, linear detection compels the decision rule to be\n\n\n\nwhere b=y is the K\u00d71 observation vector and the K\u00d7K matrix A is a positive-definite symmetric matrix approximating the channel transformation. The vector x* is the solution (over  to) Ax=b. Estimation is completed by adjusting the (inverse) matrix-vector product to the input alphabet, dictated by P, accomplished by using a proper clipping function \u0394{\u2022} (e.g., for binary signaling \u0394{\u2022} is the sign function).\n","For example, linear channels are characterized by the linear relation\n\n\n\nwhere n is a K\u00d71 additive noise vector and R=SS is a positive-definite symmetric matrix, often known as the correlation matrix.

It is known that if the matrix {tilde over (R)} is strictly diagonally dominant, then GaBP converges and the marginal means converge to the true means. Noting that the matrix {tilde over (R)} is symmetric, one can determine the applicability of this condition by examining its columns. Referring to \u201cEfficient Bayesian inference for learning in the Ising linear perceptron and signal detection in CDMA\u201d, Physica A., vol. 365, pp. 203-210, February 2006, it is seen that in the first k columns, the k CDMA sequences are present. Random-spreading binary CDMA sequences are assumed, which are normalized to one. In other words, the absolute sum of each column is \u221a{square root over (n)}. In that case, the matrix {tilde over (R)} is not diagonally dominant (DD). One can add a regularization term of \u221a{square root over (n)}+\u03b5 to force the matrix {tilde over (R)} to be DD, but there is a cost in changing the problem. In the next n columns of the matrix {tilde over (R)}, the diagonal covariance matrix \u03a8 is present with different noise levels per bit in the main diagonal, and zero elsewhere. The absolute sum of each column of S is k\/\u221a{square root over (n)}, thus when the noise level of each bit satisfies \u03c8=k\/\u221a{square root over (n)}, one has a convergence guarantee. Note that the convergence condition is a sufficient condition. It can also be determined (e.g., see A. Montanari, B. Prabhakar, and D. Tse, \u201cBelief propagation based multi-user detection\u201d, in Proc. 43th Allerton Conf. on Communications, Control and Computing, Monticello, Ill., USA, September 2005) that in the large system limit, the example algorithm converges for binary signaling, even in the absence of noise.","Again, though this alternative algorithm is referred to herein using the example of CDMA multiuser detection, it has wider applicability. As a nonlimiting example, an algorithm according to embodiments of the present invention can provide an efficient iterative method for computing the Monroe-Penrose pseudoinverse, and it can also be applied to the factor analysis learning problem.","While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions, and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.
