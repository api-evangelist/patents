This invention addresses these and other needs in the art. For example, provided herein is a means to channel the activity of a platinum anticancer agent to a cancerous tissue, thereby decreasing the potential of adverse effects.","Cancer is the second leading cause of death behind heart disease. In fact, cancer incidence and death figures account for about 10% of the U.S. population in certain areas of the United States (National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database and Bureau of the Census statistics; see, , Kasper et al., 16ed., 2005, Chapter 66). The five leading causes of cancer deaths among men are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, pancreatic cancer, and leukemia. The five leading causes of cancer deaths among women are lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer. When detected at locally advanced or metastatic stages, no consistently curative treatment regimen exists. Treatment for metastatic cancer includes immunotherapy, hormonal ablation, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and combination therapies. Unfortunately, for prostate cancer and hormone dependent tumors, there is frequent relapse of an aggressive androgen independent disease that is insensitive to further hormonal manipulation or to treatment with conventional chemotherapy (Ghosh et al., 95:13182-13187 (1998)).","The organic cation transporters (OCTs), OCT1 (Grundemann et al., 372:549-552 (1994)), OCT2 (Okuda et al., 224:500-507 (1996)), and OCT3 (Kekuda et al., 273:15971-15979 (1998); Wu et al., 273:32776-32786 (1998)), are in the class of plasma membrane transporters belonging to the solute carrier (SLC) 22A family. The OCTs mediate intracellular uptake of a broad range of structurally diverse organic cations (Jonker et al., 308:2-9 (2004); Wright, 204:309-319 (2005)). Substrates of OCTs include endogenous compounds such as choline, creatinine, and monoamine neurotransmitters, and a variety of xenobiotics such as tetraethylammonium (TEA, a prototypic organic cation), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+, a neurotoxin) and clinically used drugs such as metformin, cimetidine, and amantadine (Jonker et al., supra). In humans, OCT1 is primarily expressed in the liver (Gorboulev et al., 16:871-881 (1997); Zhang et al., 51:913-921 (1997); Wright, supra) and less so in the intestine (Muller et al., 70:1851-1860 (2005)), whereas OCT2 is predominantly expressed in the kidney (Gorboulev et al., supra; Wright, supra). OCT3 is expressed in many tissues including placenta, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle (Grundemann et al., 1:349-351 (1998); Verhaagh et al., 55:209-218 (1999)). The expression of the OCTs has also been detected in a number of human cancer cell lines (Hayer-Zillgen et al., 136:829-836 (2002)). The interaction of cisplatin with human OCTs has been investigated and the results are discordant (Briz et al., 61:853-860 (2002); Ciarimboli et al., 167:1477-1484 (2005)). Previous studies indicate that cisplatin is not a substrate of human OCT1 or OCT2 (Briz et al., supra), whereas more recent work indicates that the drug interacts with human and rat OCT2 but not OCT1 (Ciarimboli et al., supra; Yonezawa et al., 70:1823-1831 (2005)).","Platinum-based compounds and drugs are among the most active anticancer agents and cisplatin represents one of the three most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics (Wong et al., 99:2451-2466 (1999)). Although cisplatin is effective against a number of solid tumors, especially testicular and ovarian cancer, its clinical use is limited because of its toxic effects as well as the intrinsic and acquired resistance of some tumors to this drug (Weiss et al., 46:360-377 (1993)). Carboplatin is less nephrotoxic, but its cross-resistance with cisplatin limits its application in otherwise cisplatin-treatable diseases (Weiss et al., supra). Oxaliplatin, however, exhibits a different anticancer spectrum from that of cisplatin (Raymond et al., 9:1053-1071 (1998); Rixe et al., 52:1855-1865 (1996)). It has been approved as the first or second line therapy in combination with 5-fluoruracil\/leucovorin for advanced colorectal cancer, for which cisplatin and carboplatin are essentially inactive (Misset et al., 35:75-93 (2000)). In spite of their distinct antitumor specificities, cisplatin and oxaliplatin exhibit cytotoxicity (Pinto et al., 780:167-180 (1985); Zamble et al., 20:435-439 (1995)). These compounds may initiate a series of biochemical cascades, eventually leading to cell death (Pinto et al., supra; Wang et al., 4:307-320 (2005)).","Cisplatin and oxaliplatin target similar DNA sites for binding and form similar types of DNA adducts (Jennerwein et al., 70:39-49 (1989); Page et al., 29:1016-1024 (1990); Woynarowski et al., 54:770-777 (1998)), mainly 1,2- and 1,3-intrastrand cross-links involving purine nucleotides. Studies aiming to identify such mechanisms have focused on the cellular processing of cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-DNA adducts (Chaney et al., 53:3-11 (2005); Vaisman et al., 38:11026-11039 (1999)). Reduced intracellular accumulation is a common observation in cisplatin-resistant cells (Andrews et al., 2:35-43 (1990); Gately et al., 67:1171-1176 (1993)).","In a first aspect, a compound having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"68.75mm","wi":"56.90mm","file":"US09217007-20151222-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"X is a counterion.

The chemical structures and formulae set forth herein are constructed according to the standard rules of chemical valency known in the chemical arts.","Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., \u2014CHO\u2014 is equivalent to \u2014OCH\u2014.","The term \u201calkyl,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched carbon chain (or carbon), or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C-Cmeans one to ten carbons). Examples of saturated hydrocarbon radicals include, but are not limited to, groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, homologs and isomers of, for example, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. An alkoxy is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen linker (\u2014O\u2014).","The term \u201calkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CHCHCHCH\u2014. Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the present invention. A \u201clower alkyl\u201d or \u201clower alkylene\u201d is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms. The term \u201calkenylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from an alkene.","The term \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, including at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of Pt, O, N, P, Si, and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) Pt, O, N, P, S, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to: \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S(O)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014Si(CH), \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2550N\u2014OCH, \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014N(CH)\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH, \u2014O\u2014CH\u2014CH, and \u2014CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, \u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014OCHand \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014Si(CH).","Similarly, the term \u201cheteroalkylene,\u201d by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014 and \u2014CH\u2014S\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014NH\u2014CH\u2014. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 represents both \u2014C(O)R\u2032\u2014 and \u2014R\u2032C(O)\u2014. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)NR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014SR\u2032, and\/or \u2014SOR\u2032. Where \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like.","The terms \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d and \u201cheterocycloalkyl,\u201d by themselves or in combination with other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \u201calkyl\u201d and \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. A \u201ccycloalkylene\u201d and a \u201cheterocycloalkylene,\u201d alone or as part of another substituent, means a divalent radical derived from a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.","The terms \u201chalo\u201d or \u201chalogen,\u201d by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as \u201chaloalkyl\u201d are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term \u201chalo(C-C)alkyl\u201d includes, but is not limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.","The term \u201cacyl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, \u2014C(O)R where R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl.","The term \u201caryl\u201d means, unless otherwise stated, a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon substituent, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (preferably from 1 to 3 rings) that are fused together (i.e., a fused ring aryl) or linked covalently. A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain at least one heteroatom such as Pt, N, O, or S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. Thus, the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e., multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A 5,6-fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. Likewise, a 6,6-fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. And a 6,5-fused ring heteroaryl refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 6 members and the other ring has 5 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a carbon or heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl and heteroaryl groups include phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, 4-biphenyl, 1-pyrrolyl, 2-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrrolyl, 3-pyrazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl, pyrazinyl, 2-oxazolyl, 4-oxazolyl, 2-phenyl-4-oxazolyl, 5-oxazolyl, 3-isoxazolyl, 4-isoxazolyl, 5-isoxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl, 4-thiazolyl, 5-thiazolyl, 2-furyl, 3-furyl, 2-thienyl, 3-thienyl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-pyrimidyl, 4-pyrimidyl, 5-benzothiazolyl, purinyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 5-indolyl, 1-isoquinolyl, 5-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 5-quinoxalinyl, 3-quinolyl, and 6-quinolyl. Substituents for each of the above noted aryl and heteroaryl ring systems are selected from the group of acceptable substituents described below. An \u201carylene\u201d and a \u201cheteroarylene,\u201d alone or as part of another substituent, mean a divalent radical derived from an aryl and heteroaryl, respectively.","A fused ring heterocyloalkyl-aryl is an aryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heteroaryl is a heteroaryl fused to a heterocycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl-cycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to a cycloalkyl. A fused ring heterocycloalkyl-heterocycloalkyl is a heterocycloalkyl fused to another heterocycloalkyl.

Cancerous cells, e.g., cancerous colon or liver cells or kidney cells or neuroendocrine cells in the case of NET, can express (e.g., overexpress) one or more OCTs (e.g., OCT1, OCT2, and\/or OCT3) or NET at a level of at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% in comparison to normal, non-cancerous cells such as colon or liver cells or neuroendocrine cells in the case of NET. Cancerous cells can also have at least about a 1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, or 7-fold higher level of OCT (or NET) transcription or translation in comparison to normal, non-cancerous cells. In certain instances, the cancer cell sample is autologous.","\u201cTherapy resistant\u201d cancers, tumor cells, and tumors refer to cancers that have become resistant to both apoptosis-mediated (e.g., through death receptor cell signaling, for example, Fas ligand receptor, TRAIL receptors, TNF-R1, chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation, etc.) and non-apoptosis mediated (e.g., toxic drugs, chemicals, etc.) cancer therapies including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and combinations thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cmarker\u201d refers to any biochemical marker, serological marker, genetic marker, or other clinical or echographic characteristic that can be used to diagnose or provide a prognosis for a cancer that expresses at least one OCT or NET according to the methods of the present invention. Preferably, the marker is an OCT or NET protein or nucleic acid marker such as a NET marker or an OCT1, OCT2, and\/or OCT3 marker.","The term \u201csample\u201d includes sections of tissues such as biopsy and autopsy samples, and frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Such samples include blood and blood fractions or products (e.g., serum, plasma, platelets, red blood cells, and the like), sputum, tissue, cultured cells (e.g., primary cultures, explants, and transformed cells), stool, urine, other biological fluids (e.g., prostatic fluid, gastric fluid, intestinal fluid, renal fluid, lung fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and the like), etc. A sample is typically obtained from a \u201csubject\u201d such as a eukaryotic organism, most preferably a mammal such as a primate, e.g., chimpanzee or human; cow; dog; cat; a rodent, e.g., guinea pig, rat, mouse; rabbit; or a bird; reptile; or fish. In some embodiments, the sample is obtained from a human.","A \u201cbiopsy\u201d refers to the process of removing a tissue sample for diagnostic or prognostic evaluation, and to the tissue specimen itself. Any biopsy technique known in the art can be applied to the diagnostic and prognostic methods of the present invention. The biopsy technique applied will depend on the tissue type to be evaluated (e.g., colon, prostate, kidney, bladder, lymph node, liver, bone marrow, blood cell, etc.), the size and type of the tumor (e.g., solid or suspended, blood or ascites), among other factors. Representative biopsy techniques include, but are not limited to, excisional biopsy, incisional biopsy, needle biopsy, surgical biopsy, and bone marrow biopsy. An \u201cexcisional biopsy\u201d refers to the removal of an entire tumor mass with a small margin of normal tissue surrounding it. An \u201cincisional biopsy\u201d refers to the removal of a wedge of tissue that includes a cross-sectional diameter of the tumor. A diagnosis or prognosis made by endoscopy or fluoroscopy can require a \u201ccore-needle biopsy\u201d of the tumor mass, or a \u201cfine-needle aspiration biopsy\u201d which generally obtains a suspension of cells from within the tumor mass. Biopsy techniques are discussed, for example, in Kasper, et al., eds., 16th ed., 2005, Chapter 70, and throughout Part V.","The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or percent \u201cidentity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides that are the same (e.g., about 60% identity, preferably about 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or higher identity over a specified region, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region) as measured using a BLAST or BLAST 2.0 sequence comparison algorithm with default parameters described below, or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., NCBI web site http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/BLAST\/ or the like). Such sequences are then said to be \u201csubstantially identical.\u201d This definition also refers to, or may be applied to, the complement of a test sequence. The definition also includes sequences that have deletions and\/or additions, as well as those that have substitutions. As described below, the preferred algorithms can account for gaps and the like. Preferably, identity exists over a region that is at least about 25 amino acids or nucleotides in length, or over a region that is about 50-100 amino acids or nucleotides in length.","A \u201ccomparison window,\u201d as used herein, includes reference to a segment of any one of the number of contiguous positions selected from the group consisting of from about 20 to about 600, usually from about 50 to about 200, more usually from about 100 to about 150, in which a sequence may be compared to a reference sequence of the same number of contiguous positions after the two sequences are optimally aligned. Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by manual alignment and visual inspection (see, e.g., (Ausubel et al., eds. 1987-2005, Wiley Interscience)).","For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Preferably, default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.","A preferred example of algorithms suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., 25:3389-3402 (1977) and Altschul et al., 215:403-410 (1990), respectively. BLAST and BLAST 2.0 are used, with the parameters described herein, to determine percent sequence identity for the nucleic acids and proteins of the present invention. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al., supra). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see, Henikoff et al., 89:10915 (1989)) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=\u22124, and a comparison of both strands.","\u201cNucleic acid\u201d refers to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form and complements thereof. The term encompasses nucleic acids containing known nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally-occurring, or non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid, or which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-O-methyl ribonucleotides, and peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs).","Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and\/or deoxyinosine residues (Batzer et al., 19:5081 (1991); Ohtsuka et al., 260:2605-2608 (1985); Rossolini et al., 8:91-98 (1994)). In some embodiments, a nucleic acid is a gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, or polynucleotide.","A particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses \u201csplice variants\u201d and nucleic acid sequences encoding truncated forms of OCT or NET. Similarly, a particular protein encoded by a nucleic acid implicitly encompasses any protein encoded by a splice variant or truncated form of that nucleic acid. \u201cSplice variants,\u201d as the name suggests, are products of alternative splicing of a gene. After transcription, an initial nucleic acid transcript may be spliced such that different (alternate) nucleic acid splice products encode different polypeptides. Mechanisms for the production of splice variants vary, but include alternate splicing of exons. Alternate polypeptides derived from the same nucleic acid by read-through transcription are also encompassed by this definition. Any products of a splicing reaction, including recombinant forms of the splice products, are included in this definition. Nucleic acids can be truncated at the 5\u2032-end or at the 3\u2032-end. Polypeptides can be truncated at the N-terminal end or the C-terminal end. Truncated versions of nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences can be naturally-occurring or recombinantly created.","\u201cPolymorphism\u201d refers to the occurrence of two or more genetically determined alternative sequences or alleles in a population (e.g., NET, OCT1, OCT2, or OCT3 alleles). A \u201cpolymorphic site\u201d refers to the locus at which divergence occurs. Preferred polymorphic sites have at least two alleles, each occurring at frequency of greater than 1%, and more preferably greater than 10% or 20% of a selected population. A polymorphic locus can be as small as one base pair (single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP). Polymorphic markers include restriction fragment length polymorphisms, variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide repeats, tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements such as Alu. The first identified allele is arbitrarily designated as the reference allele and other alleles are designated as alternative or \u201cvariant alleles.\u201d The allele occurring most frequently in a selected population is sometimes referred to as the \u201cwild-type\u201d allele. Diploid organisms may be homozygous or heterozygous for the variant alleles. The variant allele may or may not produce an observable physical or biochemical characteristic (\u201cphenotype\u201d) in an individual carrying the variant allele. For example, a variant allele may alter the enzymatic activity of a protein encoded by a gene of interest.","The term \u201cgenotype\u201d as used herein broadly refers to the genetic composition of an organism, including, for example, whether a diploid organism is heterozygous or homozygous for one or more variant alleles of interest.","The term \u201cgene amplification\u201d refers to a cellular process characterized by the production of multiple copies of any particular piece of DNA. For example, a tumor cell amplifies, or copies, chromosomal segments naturally as a result of cell signals and sometimes environmental events. The process of gene amplification leads to the production of many copies of the genes that are located on that region of the chromosome. In certain instances, so many copies of the amplified region are produced that they can form their own small pseudo-chromosomes called double-minute chromosomes. The genes on each of the copies can be transcribed and translated, leading to an overproduction of the mRNA and protein corresponding to the amplified genes.","The terms \u201cpolypeptide,\u201d \u201cpeptide,\u201d and \u201cprotein\u201d are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally-occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally-occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymers.","The term \u201camino acid\u201d refers to naturally occurring and synthetic amino acids, as well as amino acid analogs and amino acid mimetics that function in a manner similar to the naturally-occurring amino acids. Naturally-occurring amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as those amino acids that are later modified, e.g., hydroxyproline, \u03b3-carboxyglutamate, and O-phosphoserine. Amino acid analogs refers to compounds that have the same basic chemical structure as a naturally occurring amino acid, i.e., an a carbon that is bound to a hydrogen, a carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R group, e.g., homoserine, norleucine, methionine sulfoxide, and methionine methyl sulfonium. Such analogs have modified R groups (e.g., norleucine) or modified peptide backbones, but retain the same basic chemical structure as a naturally-occurring amino acid. Amino acid mimetics refers to chemical compounds that have a structure that is different from the general chemical structure of an amino acid, but that functions in a manner similar to a naturally-occurring amino acid.","Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three-letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. Nucleotides, likewise, may be referred to by their commonly accepted single-letter codes.","\u201cConservatively modified variants\u201d applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids that encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are \u201csilent variations,\u201d which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill in the art will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence with respect to the expression product, but not with respect to actual probe sequences.","As to amino acid sequences, one of skill in the art will recognize that individual substitutions, deletions, or additions to a nucleic acid, peptide, polypeptide, or protein sequence which alters, adds, or deletes a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in the encoded sequence is a \u201cconservatively modified variant\u201d where the alteration results in the substitution of an amino acid with a chemically similar amino acid. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. Such conservatively modified variants are in addition to and do not exclude polymorphic variants, interspecies homologs, and alleles of the present invention.","The following eight groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Glycine (G); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); 7) Serine (S), Threonine (T); and 8) Cysteine (C), Methionine (M) (see, e.g., Creighton, Proteins (1984)).","The term \u201crecombinant,\u201d when used with reference, e.g., to a cell, nucleic acid, protein, or vector, indicates that the cell, nucleic acid, protein, or vector has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or protein or the alteration of a native nucleic acid or protein, or that the cell is derived from a cell so modified. Thus, for example, recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native (non-recombinant) form of the cell or express native genes that are otherwise abnormally expressed, overexpressed, underexpressed, or not expressed at all.","The term \u201cheterologous,\u201d when used with reference to portions of a nucleic acid, indicates that the nucleic acid comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature. For instance, the nucleic acid is typically recombinantly produced, having two or more sequences from unrelated genes arranged to make a new functional nucleic acid, e.g., a promoter from one source and a coding region from another source. Similarly, a heterologous protein indicates that the protein comprises two or more subsequences that are not found in the same relationship to each other in nature (e.g., a fusion protein).","The phrase \u201cstringent hybridization conditions\u201d refers to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target subsequence, typically in a complex mixture of nucleic acids, but to no other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and may be different in different circumstances. Longer sequences hybridize specifically at higher temperatures. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen, , \u201cOverview of principles of hybridization and the strategy of nucleic acid assays\u201d (1993). Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5-10\u00b0 C. lower than the thermal melting point (T) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength pH. The Tis the temperature (under defined ionic strength, pH, and nucleic concentration) at which 50% of the probes complementary to the target hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium (as the target sequences are present in excess, at T, 50% of the probes are occupied at equilibrium). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. For selective or specific hybridization, a positive signal is at least two times background, preferably at least ten times background hybridization. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions can be as follows: 50% formamide, 5\u00d7SSC, and 1% SDS, incubating at 42\u00b0 C., or, 5\u00d7SSC, 1% SDS, incubating at 65\u00b0 C., with wash in 0.2\u00d7SSC, and 0.1% SDS at 65\u00b0 C.","Nucleic acids that do not hybridize to each other under stringent conditions are still substantially identical if the polypeptides that they encode are substantially identical. This occurs, for example, when a copy of a nucleic acid is created using the maximum codon degeneracy permitted by the genetic code. In such cases, the nucleic acids typically hybridize under moderately stringent hybridization conditions. Exemplary \u201cmoderately stringent hybridization conditions\u201d include a hybridization in a buffer of 40% formamide, 1 M NaCl, 1% SDS at 37\u00b0 C., and a wash in 1\u00d7SSC at 45\u00b0 C. A positive hybridization is at least twice background. Those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that alternative hybridization and wash conditions can be utilized to provide conditions of similar stringency. Additional guidelines for determining hybridization parameters are provided in numerous reference, e.g., and , ed. Ausubel, et al., supra.","For PCR, a temperature of about 36\u00b0 C. is typical for low stringency amplification, although annealing temperatures may vary between about 32\u00b0 C. and about 48\u00b0 C. depending on primer length. For high stringency PCR amplification, a temperature of about 62\u00b0 C. is typical, although high stringency annealing temperatures can range from about 50\u00b0 C. to about 65\u00b0 C., depending on the primer length and specificity. Typical cycle conditions for both high and low stringency amplifications include a denaturation phase of about 90-95\u00b0 C. for about 30 sec-2 min., an annealing phase lasting about 30 sec.-2 min., and an extension phase of about 72\u00b0 C. for about 1-2 min. Protocols and guidelines for low and high stringency amplification reactions are provided, e.g., in Innis et al. (1990) , Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.","\u201cAntibody\u201d refers to a polypeptide comprising a framework region from an immunoglobulin gene or fragments thereof that specifically binds and recognizes an antigen. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu constant region genes, as well as the myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE, respectively. Typically, the antigen-binding region of an antibody will be most critical in specificity and affinity of binding.","An exemplary immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one \u201clight\u201d (about 25 kD) and one \u201cheavy\u201d chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to about 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (V) and variable heavy chain (V) refer to these light and heavy chains, respectively.","Antibodies exist, e.g., as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)\u2032, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V\u2014C1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)\u2032may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region, thereby converting the F(ab)\u2032dimer into an Fab\u2032 monomer. The Fab\u2032 monomer is essentially Fab with part of the hinge region (see, , Paul ed., 3d ed. 1993). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill in the art will appreciate that such fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by using recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies, or those synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies (e.g., single chain Fv) or those identified using phage display libraries (see, e.g., McCafferty et al., 348:552-554 (1990))","For preparation of antibodies, e.g., recombinant, monoclonal, or polyclonal antibodies, any technique known in the art can be used (see, e.g., Kohler and Milstein, 256:495-497 (1975); Kozbor et al., 4: 72 (1983); Cole et al., pp. 77-96 in , Alan R. Liss, Inc. (1985); Coligan, (1991); Harlow and Lane, (1988); and Goding, (2d ed. 1986)). The genes encoding the heavy and light chains of an antibody of interest can be cloned from a cell, e.g., the genes encoding a monoclonal antibody can be cloned from a hybridoma and used to produce a recombinant monoclonal antibody. Gene libraries encoding heavy and light chains of monoclonal antibodies can also be made from hybridoma or plasma cells. Random combinations of the heavy and light chain gene products generate a large pool of antibodies with different antigenic specificity (see, e.g., Kuby, (3ed. 1997)). Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies or recombinant antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 4,816,567) can be adapted to produce antibodies to the polypeptides of the present invention. Also, transgenic mice or other organisms such as other mammals may be used to express humanized or human antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016, Marks et al., 10:779-783 (1992); Lonberg et al., 368:856-859 (1994); Morrison, 368:812-13 (1994); Fishwild et al., 14:845-51 (1996); Neuberger, 14:826 (1996); and Lonberg et al., 13:65-93 (1995)). Alternatively, phage display technology can be used to identify antibodies and heteromeric Fab fragments that specifically bind to selected antigens (see, e.g., McCafferty et al., 348:552-554 (1990); Marks et al., supra). Antibodies can also be made bispecific, i.e., able to recognize two different antigens (see, e.g., PCT Patent Publication No. WO 93\/08829; Traunecker et al., 10:3655-3659 (1991); and Suresh et al., 121:210 (1986)). Antibodies can also be heteroconjugates, e.g., two covalently joined antibodies, or immunotoxins (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, PCT Patent Publication Nos. WO 91\/00360 and WO 92\/200373; and EP Patent No. 03089).","Methods for humanizing or primatizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non-human. These non-human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues, which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co-workers (see, e.g., Jones et al., 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., 239:1534-1536 (1988) and Presta, 2:593-596 (1992)), by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly, such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.","A \u201cchimeric antibody\u201d is an antibody molecule in which (a) the constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced, or exchanged so that the antigen binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class, effector function, and\/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug, etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced, or exchanged with a variable region having a different or altered antigen specificity.","In one embodiment, the antibody is conjugated to an \u201ceffector\u201d moiety. The effector moiety can be any number of molecules, including labeling moieties such as radioactive labels or fluorescent labels, or can be a therapeutic moiety. In one embodiment, the antibody modulates the activity of the protein.","The phrase \u201cspecifically (or selectively) binds\u201d to an antibody or \u201cspecifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,\u201d when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein, often in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated immunoassay conditions, the specified antibodies bind to a particular protein at least about two, three, four, or more times the background, and more typically more than at least about 10 to about 100 times the background. Specific binding to an antibody under such conditions requires an antibody that is selected for its specificity for a particular protein. For example, polyclonal antibodies can be selected to obtain only those polyclonal antibodies that are specifically immunoreactive with the selected antigen and not with other proteins. This selection may be achieved by subtracting out antibodies that cross-react with other molecules. A variety of immunoassay formats may be used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a particular protein. For example, solid-phase ELISA immunoassays are routinely used to select antibodies specifically immunoreactive with a protein (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, (1988) for a description of immunoassay formats and conditions that can be used to determine specific immunoreactivity).","As used herein, the term \u201cadministering\u201d means oral administration, administration as a suppository, topical contact, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intralesional, intrathecal, intranasal or subcutaneous administration, or the implantation of a slow-release device, e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to a subject. Administration is by any route, including parenteral and transmucosal (e.g., buccal, sublingual, palatal, gingival, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or transdermal).

Pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can also be used orally using, for example, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating such as glycerol or sorbitol.","For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.","Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water\/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.","When parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures for the compounds of the invention are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In particular, carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline, pure water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, and the like. Ampules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds of the invention can also be incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or patches. Pharmaceutical admixtures suitable for use in the present invention are well-known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa.) and WO 96\/05309, the teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethylene oxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol mono-oleate), or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, aspartame or saccharin. Formulations can be adjusted for osmolarity.","Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.","Oil suspensions can contain a thickening agent, such as beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents can be added to provide a palatable oral preparation, such as glycerol, sorbitol or sucrose. These formulations can be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. As an example of an injectable oil vehicle, see Minto, 281:93-102, 1997. The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase can be a vegetable oil or a mineral oil, described above, or a mixture of these. Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occurring gums, such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides, such as soybean lecithin, esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as sorbitan mono-oleate, and condensation products of these partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate. The emulsion can also contain sweetening agents and flavoring agents, as in the formulation of syrups and elixirs. Such formulations can also contain a demulcent, a preservative, or a coloring agent.","The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.","The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 10000 mg, more typically 1.0 mg to 1000 mg, most typically 10 mg to 500 mg, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents.","Some compounds may have limited solubility in water and therefore may require a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such co-solvents include: Polysorbate 20, 60 and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84 and P-103; cyclodextrin; polyoxyl 35 castor oil; or other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01% and about 2% by weight.","Viscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions may be desirable to decrease variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of components of a suspension or emulsion of formulation and\/or otherwise to improve the formulation. Such viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof, hyaluronic acid and salts thereof, combinations of the foregoing, and other agents known to those skilled in the art. Such agents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01% and about 2% by weight. Determination of acceptable amounts of any of the above adjuvants is readily ascertained by one skilled in the art.","The compositions of the present invention may additionally include components to provide sustained release and\/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight, anionic mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides and finely-divided drug carrier substrates. These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920; 5,403,841; 5,212,162; and 4,861,760. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.","Pharmaceutical compositions provided by the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e., in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The actual amount effective for a particular application will depend, inter alia, on the condition being treated. When administered in methods to treat a disease, such compositions will contain an amount of active ingredient effective to achieve the desired result, e.g., modulating the activity of a target molecule (e.g. OCT1, OCT2, and\/or OCT3 or NET), and\/or reducing, eliminating, or slowing the progression of disease symptoms. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure herein.","The dosage and frequency (single or multiple doses) administered to a mammal can vary depending upon a variety of factors, for example, whether the mammal suffers from another disease, and its route of administration; size, age, sex, health, body weight, body mass index, and diet of the recipient; nature and extent of symptoms of the disease being treated (e.g., cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Small Cell, and Large Cell lymphomas, multiple myeloma, or other cancers that express one or more of the OCTs, neuroendocrine cancers, glioblastoma multiforme, glioma, neuroblastoma, brain cancer, or other cancers that express NET), kind of concurrent treatment, complications from the disease being treated or other health-related problems. Other therapeutic regimens or agents can be used in conjunction with the methods and compounds described herein. Adjustment and manipulation of established dosages (e.g., frequency and duration) are well within the ability of those skilled in the art.","For any compound described herein, the therapeutically effective amount can be initially determined from cell culture assays. Target concentrations will be those concentrations of active compound(s) that are capable of achieving the methods described herein, as measured using the methods described herein or known in the art.","As is well known in the art, therapeutically effective amounts for use in humans can also be determined from animal models. For example, a dose for humans can be formulated to achieve a concentration that has been found to be effective in animals. The dosage in humans can be adjusted by monitoring compounds effectiveness and adjusting the dosage upwards or downwards, as described above. Adjusting the dose to achieve maximal efficacy in humans based on the methods described above and other methods is well within the capabilities of the ordinarily skilled artisan.","Dosages may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the compound being employed. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. In one embodiment, the dosage range is 0.001% to 10% w\/v. In another embodiment, the dosage range is 0.1% to 5% w\/v.","Dosage amounts and intervals can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the administered compound effective for the particular clinical indication being treated. This will provide a therapeutic regimen that is commensurate with the severity of the individual's disease state.","Utilizing the teachings provided herein, an effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatment regimen can be planned that does not cause substantial toxicity and yet is effective to treat the clinical symptoms demonstrated by the particular patient. This planning should involve the careful choice of active compound by considering factors such as compound potency, relative bioavailability, patient body weight, presence and severity of adverse side effects, preferred mode of administration and the toxicity profile of the selected agent.","The ratio between toxicity and therapeutic effect for a particular compound is its therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio between LD(the amount of compound lethal in 50% of the population) and ED(the amount of compound effective in 50% of the population). Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. Therapeutic index data obtained from cell culture assays and\/or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds preferably lies within a range of plasma concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. See, e.g. Fingl et al., In: TPBT, Ch. 1, p. 1, 1975.

As such, the level of OCT (or NET) expression can be used as a prognostic indicator, with positive or high expression as an indication of a good prognosis, e.g., a longer disease-specific survival.","In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention can also be useful for diagnosing the severity of a cancer, e.g., a cancer that expresses at least one OCT (or NET) marker. As a non-limiting example, the level of OCT (or NET) expression can be used to determine the stage or grade of a cancer such as colorectal cancer, e.g., according to the Tumor\/Nodes\/Metastases (TNM) system of classification (International Union Against Cancer, 6th edition, 2002), the Dukes staging system (Dukes, 35:323 (1932)), or the Astler-Coller staging system (Astler et al., 139:846 (1954)). Typically, cancers are staged using a combination of physical examination, blood tests, and medical imaging. If tumor tissue is obtained via biopsy or surgery, examination of the tissue under a microscope can also provide pathologic staging. In some embodiments, cancer patients with positive or high OCT (or NET) expression may have a more severe stage or grade of that type of cancer. As such, the level of OCT (or NET) expression can be used as a diagnostic indicator of the severity of a cancer or of the risk of developing a more severe stage or grade of the cancer. In certain other instances, the stage or grade of a cancer assists a practitioner in determining the prognosis for the cancer and in selecting the appropriate cancer therapy.","Diagnosis or prognosis can involve determining the level of OCT (or NET) expression (i.e., transcription or translation) in a patient and then comparing the level or localization to a baseline or range. In some embodiments, the baseline value is representative of OCT (or NET) expression levels in a healthy person not suffering from the disease (e.g. cancer). Variation of levels of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention from the baseline range (i.e., either up or down) may indicate that the patient has a cancer or is at risk of developing a cancer. Variation of levels of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention from the baseline range (i.e., either up or down) may indicate that the patient has a cancer that would respond to platinum-based compound therapy or would not respond to platinum-based compound therapy. In some embodiments, the level of OCT (or NET) expression is measured by taking a blood, urine, or tissue sample from a patient and measuring the amount of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention in the sample using any number of detection methods, such as those discussed herein. In some embodiments, the presence of OCT (or NET) expression in a sample is indicative that the patient should receive platinum-based compound treatment, as described herein. In some embodiments, an increased level of OCT (or NET) expression in a sample, compared to a control, is indicative that the patient should receive platinum-based compound treatment, as described herein.","Any antibody-based technique for determining a level of expression of a protein of interest can be used to measure the level of OCT or NET expression in tumor tissue or cancerous cells (e.g. ELISA assays, immunoprecipitation assays, and immunohistochemical assays). One skilled in the art will know of additional antibody-based techniques that can be used for determining a level of OCT (or NET) expression. PCR assays can be used to detect expression levels of nucleic acids, as well as to discriminate between variants in genomic structure, such as insertion\/deletion mutations, truncations, or splice variants.","In some embodiments, the expression of at least one OCT (or NET) marker in a cancerous or potentially cancerous tissue may be evaluated by visualizing the presence and\/or localization of the OCT (or NET) marker in the subject. The visualization of cancerous or potentially cancerous tissue in live subjects can be performed using anti-OCT (OCT1, OCT2, and\/or OCT3) or anti-NET antibodies or other molecules that specifically interacts or binds to an OCT (or NET) transcript or to a polypeptide encoded by the transcript.","A detectable moiety can be coupled either directly or indirectly to anti-OCT antibodies (or anti-NET antibodies) using methods well known in the art (e.g. radionuclides, fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Oregon Green\u2122, rhodamine, Texas red, tetrarhodimine isothiocynate (TRITC), Cy3, Cy5, etc.), fluorescent markers (e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP), phycoerythrin, etc.), autoquenched fluorescent compounds that are activated by tumor-associated proteases, enzymes (e.g., luciferase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.), nanoparticles, biotin, digoxigenin).","In some embodiments, a composition or method of detection may be used to visualize live subjects using any device or method known in the art (e.g. Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT), radionuclide scintigraphy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a laparoscopic probe (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,133), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), radiography (i.e., X-rays), computed tomography (CT), fluoroscopy, or other methods known in the art).","In some embodiments in vivo optical imaging techniques may be suitable for the visualization of fluorescent and\/or enzymatic labels or markers (e.g. fluorescence microendoscopy (see, e.g., Flusberg et al., 30:2272-2274 (2005)), fiber-optic fluorescence imaging (see, e.g., Flusberg et al., 2:941-950 (2005)), fluorescence imaging using a flying-spot scanner (see, e.g., Ramanujam et al., 48:1034-1041 (2001)), catheter-based imaging systems (see, e.g., Funovics et al., 231:659-666 (2004)), near-infrared imaging systems (see, e.g., Mahmood et al., 213:866-870 (1999)), fluorescence molecular tomography (see, e.g., Gurfinkel et al., 19:107-121 (2004)), and bioluminescent imaging (see, e.g., Dikmen et al., 35:65-70 (2005))).","Anti-OCT antibodies (or anti-NET antibodies), when conjugated to any of the above-described detectable moieties, can be administered in doses effective to achieve the desired image of tumor tissue or cancerous cells in a subject. Such detection is aimed at determining where one or more OCT (or NET) markers are concentrated in a subject, with such concentration being an indicator of the location of a tumor or tumor cells. Alternatively, such detection is aimed at determining the extent of tumor regression in a subject, with the size of the tumor being an indicator of the efficacy of cancer therapy.","Diagnosis or prognosis can further involve determining the genotype of at least one OCT marker (or NET marker) in a subject. For example, genotyping an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid marker at a polymorphic site for alleles that result in decreased or increased organic cation transporter activity can be useful in diagnosing or providing a prognosis for cancers that express the OCT (or NET) marker. In certain instances, an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid marker that comprises a variant allele resulting in no or substantially reduced substrate transporter activity is indicative of a cancer that does not express the OCT (or NET) marker. A subject having this genotype would have a cancer that may be resistant to platinum-based compound or drug therapy and may have a poor prognosis for cancer using such therapy. Variant alleles in OCT1 and OCT2 which comprise polymorphisms suitable for detecting in the methods of the present invention are described in, e.g., Shu et al., 100:5902-5907 (2003); and Leabman et al., 12:395-405 (2002).","In some embodiments the methods of the present invention include determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein or nucleic acid (e.g., mRNA) is expressed in a sample. As used herein, the term \u201cdetermining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein (or nucleic acid) is expressed\u201d refers to determining the presence or level of at least one OCT (or NET) marker of interest (e.g., OCT1, OCT2, and\/or OCT3 or NET) by using any quantitative or qualitative assay known to one of skill in the art. In some embodiments of the methods described herein, prognostic or diagnostic methods as described above are combined with the methods of using the compounds described herein (e.g. formula I, Ia, II, IIa, III, IIIa, IV, or V, including embodiments).","In some embodiments, an OCT (or NET) protein marker is analyzed using an immunoassay, although other methods are well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., the measurement of marker RNA levels). Immunoassay techniques and protocols are generally described in Price and Newman, \u201cPrinciples and Practice of Immunoassay,\u201d 2nd Edition, Grove's Dictionaries, 1997; and Gosling, \u201cImmunoassays: A Practical Approach,\u201d Oxford University Press, 2000. The presence or amount of an OCT (or NET) protein marker is generally determined using antibodies specific for the marker and detecting specific binding. For example, polyclonal antibodies directed to OCT1, OCT2, or OCT3 can be obtained from Alpha Diagnostics Intl. Inc. (San Antonio, Tex.).","Any suitable immunoassay can be utilized for determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample (e.g. enzyme immunoassays (EIA) such as enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM antibody capture ELISA (MAC ELISA), and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA); capillary electrophoresis immunoassays (CEIA); radioimmunoassays (RIA); immunoradiometric assays (IRMA); fluorescence polarization immunoassays (FPIA); and chemiluminescence assays (CL)). If desired, such immunoassays can be automated. Immunoassays can also be used in conjunction with laser induced fluorescence (see, e.g., Schmalzing et al., 18:2184-93 (1997); Bao, 699:463-80 (1997)). Liposome immunoassays, such as flow-injection liposome immunoassays and liposome immunosensors, (see, e.g., Rongen et al., 204:105-133 (1997)) or nephelometry assays may be used in the methods of detecting the presence of a marker as described herein.","Specific immunological binding of the antibody to OCT (or NET) protein can be detected directly or indirectly (e.g. direct detection may include fluorescent or luminescent tags, metals, dyes, radionuclides). An antibody labeled with iodine-125 (I) can be used for determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample. A chemiluminescence assay using a chemiluminescent antibody specific for an OCT (or NET) protein marker is suitable for sensitive, non-radioactive detection of OCT (or NET) protein levels. An antibody labeled with fluorochrome is also suitable for determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample (e.g. DAPI, fluorescein, Hoechst 33258, R-phycocyanin, B-phycoerythrin, R-phycoerythrin, rhodamine, Texas red, and lissamine). Indirect labels include various enzymes well known in the art, such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP), alkaline phosphatase (AP), \u03b2-galactosidase, urease, and the like. A horseradish-peroxidase detection system can be used, for example, with the chromogenic substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), which yields a soluble product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide that is detectable at 450 nm. An alkaline phosphatase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate, for example, which yields a soluble product readily detectable at 405 nm. Similarly, a \u03b2-galactosidase detection system can be used with the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG), which yields a soluble product detectable at 410 nm. An urease detection system can be used with a substrate such as urea-bromocresol purple (Sigma Immunochemicals; St. Louis, Mo.). A signal from the label can be analyzed, for example, using a spectrophotometer to detect color from a chromogenic substrate; a radiation counter to detect radiation such as a gamma counter for detection of I; or a fluorometer to detect fluorescence in the presence of light of a certain wavelength.","Antigen capture assays can be useful in the methods of the present invention. For example, in an antigen capture assay, an antibody directed to an OCT (or NET) protein marker is bound to a solid phase and sample is added such that OCT (or NET) protein is bound by the antibody. After unbound proteins are removed by washing, the amount of bound marker can be quantitated using, for example, a radioimmunoassay (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1988)). Sandwich enzyme immunoassays can also be useful in the methods of the present invention. For example, in a two-antibody sandwich assay, a first antibody is bound to a solid support, and OCT (or NET) protein is allowed to bind to the first antibody. The amount of OCT (or NET) protein is quantitated by measuring the amount of a second antibody that binds the marker. The antibodies can be immobilized onto a variety of solid supports, such as magnetic or chromatographic matrix particles, the surface of an assay plate (e.g., microtiter wells), pieces of a solid substrate material or membrane (e.g., plastic, nylon, paper), and the like. An assay strip can be prepared by coating the antibody or a plurality of antibodies in an array on a solid support. This strip can then be dipped into the test sample and processed quickly through washes and detection steps to generate a measurable signal, such as a colored spot.","Quantitative western blotting can also be used to detect or determine whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample. Western blots can be quantitated by well known methods such as scanning densitometry or phosphorimaging.","Alternatively, a variety of immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques can be used to determine whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample. As used herein, the term \u201cimmunohistochemistry\u201d or \u201cIHC\u201d encompasses techniques that utilize the visual detection of fluorescent dyes or enzymes coupled (i.e., conjugated) to antibodies that react with the OCT (or NET) protein marker using fluorescent microscopy or light microscopy (e.g. direct fluorescent antibody, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), anticomplement immunofluorescence, avidin-biotin immunofluorescence, and immunoperoxidase assays).","The presence or level of an OCT (or NET) protein marker can also be determined by detecting or quantifying the amount of the purified marker. Purification of OCT (or NET) protein can be achieved, for example, by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), alone or in combination with mass spectrometry (e.g., MALDI\/MS, MALDI-TOF\/MS, tandem MS, etc.). Qualitative or quantitative detection of OCT (or NET) protein can also be determined by well-known methods including, without limitation, Bradford assays, Coomassie blue staining, silver staining, assays for radiolabeled protein, and mass spectrometry.","The analysis of a plurality of OCT (or NET) protein markers may be carried out separately or simultaneously with one test sample. For separate or sequential assay of OCT (or NET) protein markers, suitable apparatuses include clinical laboratory analyzers such as the ElecSys (Roche), the AxSym (Abbott), the Access (Beckman), the ADVIA\u00ae, the CENTAUR\u00ae (Bayer), and the NICHOLS ADVANTAGE\u00ae (Nichols Institute) immunoassay systems. Preferred apparatuses or protein chips perform simultaneous assays of a plurality of OCT (or NET) protein markers on a single surface. Particularly useful physical formats comprise surfaces having a plurality of discrete, addressable locations for the detection of a plurality of different biomarkers. Such formats include protein microarrays, or \u201cprotein chips\u201d (see, e.g., Ng et al., 6:329-340 (2002)) and certain capillary devices (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,019,944). In these embodiments, each discrete surface location may comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more OCT (or NET) protein markers for detection at each location. Surfaces may alternatively comprise one or more discrete particles (e.g., microparticles or nanoparticles) immobilized at discrete locations of a surface, where the microparticles comprise antibodies to immobilize one or more OCT (or NET) protein markers for detection.","In addition to the above-described assays for determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in a sample, analysis of OCT (or NET) marker mRNA levels using routine techniques such as Northern analysis, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or any other methods based on hybridization to a nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a portion of the marker coding sequence (e.g., slot blot hybridization) are also within the scope of the present invention. The mRNA expression of a gene of interest is typically evaluated in vitro on a sample collected from the subject in comparison to a normal or reference sample. Applicable PCR amplification techniques are described in, e.g., Ausubel et al., Theophilus et al., and Innis et al., supra. General nucleic acid hybridization methods are described in Anderson, \u201cNucleic Acid Hybridization,\u201d BIOS Scientific Publishers, 1999. Amplification or hybridization of a plurality of transcribed nucleic acid sequences (e.g., mRNA or cDNA) can also be performed from mRNA or cDNA sequences arranged in a microarray. Microarray methods are generally described in Hardiman, \u201cMicroarrays Methods and Applications: Nuts & Bolts,\u201d DNA Press, 2003; and Baldi et al., \u201cDNA Microarrays and Gene Expression: From Experiments to Data Analysis and Modeling,\u201d Cambridge University Press, 2002.","Analysis of the genotype of an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid marker can be performed using techniques known in the art including, without limitation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis, sequence analysis, and electrophoretic analysis. A non-limiting example of a PCR-based analysis includes a Taqman\u00ae allelic discrimination assay available from Applied Biosystems. Non-limiting examples of sequence analysis include Maxam-Gilbert sequencing, Sanger sequencing, capillary array DNA sequencing, thermal cycle sequencing (Sears et al., 13:626-633 (1992)), solid-phase sequencing (Zimmerman et al., 3:39-42 (1992)), sequencing with mass spectrometry such as matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF\/MS; Fu et al., 16:381-384 (1998)), and sequencing by hybridization (Chee et al., 274:610-614 (1996); Drmanac et al., 260:1649-1652 (1993); Drmanac et al., 16:54-58 (1998)). Non-limiting examples of electrophoretic analysis include slab gel electrophoresis such as agarose or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Other methods for genotyping a subject at a polymorphic site in an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid marker include, e.g., the INVADER\u00ae assay from Third Wave Technologies, Inc., restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, a heteroduplex mobility assay, and single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis.","Analysis of whether or not an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid has been gene amplified or deleted in a sample can also be used in the pharmacogenetic, diagnostic and prognostic methods described herein. In some embodiments, the presence or level of gene amplification or deletion of one or more OCT (or NET) nucleic acid markers can be determined by DNA-based techniques such as PCR or Southern blot analysis or by molecular cytogenetic techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), and immunohistochemistry. Other techniques include genome-wide scanning of amplified chromosomal regions with comparative genomic hybridization for the detection of amplified regions in tumor DNA (see, e.g., Kallioniemi et al., 258:818-821 (1992)) and the detection of gene amplification by genomic hybridization to cDNA microarrays (see, e.g., Heiskanen et al., 60:799-802 (2000)). One skilled in the art will know of additional gene amplification or deletion techniques that can be used to detect or determine a level of an amplified gene that corresponds to one or more OCT (or NET) nucleic acid markers of the present invention.","In another embodiment, the present invention provides kits for carrying out the therapeutic, diagnostic, and prognostic assays described herein. The kits typically include one or more probes that comprise an antibody or nucleic acid sequence that specifically binds to the polypeptides or polynucleotides of the present invention, and a label for detecting the presence of the probe. The kits can find use, for example, for measuring the levels of OCT (or NET) protein or OCT (or NET) transcripts, or for measuring OCT (or NET) activity to a target substrate. The kits may also include several polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides of the present invention. In some embodiments of the methods described herein, prognostic or diagnostic methods as described above may be combined with the methods of using the compounds described herein (e.g. formula I, Ia, II, IIa, III, IIIa, IV, or V, including embodiments).","In some embodiments is a method of providing a prognosis for platinum-based compound cancer therapy in a subject, the method including the steps of (a) contacting a sample from the subject with an antibody that specifically binds to OCT (or NET) protein; and (b) determining whether or not OCT (or NET) protein is expressed in the sample, thereby providing a prognosis for platinum-based compound cancer therapy. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of colorectal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, glioma, neuroblastoma, and neuroendocrine cancer. In some embodiments, the OCT is selected from the group consisting of OCT1, OCT2, OCT3, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the method includes genotyping the subject to determine an OCT (or NET) genotype. In some embodiments of the methods described herein, prognostic or diagnostic methods as described above may be combined with the methods of using the compounds described herein (e.g. formula I, Ia, II, IIa, III, IIIa, IV, or V, including embodiments).","In some embodiments is a method of providing a prognosis for platinum-based compound cancer therapy in a subject, the method including the steps of (a) contacting a sample from the subject with a primer set of a first oligonucleotide and a second oligonucleotide that each specifically hybridize to an OCT (or NET) nucleic acid; (b) amplifying the OCT (or NET) nucleic acid in the sample; and (c) determining whether or not the OCT (or NET) nucleic acid in the sample is expressed in the sample, thereby providing a prognosis for platinum-based compound cancer therapy. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of colorectal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, glioma, neuroblastoma, and neuroendocrine cancer. In some embodiments is a method of localizing a cancer that expresses an organic cation transporter (OCT) or NET in vivo, the method comprising the step of imaging in a subject a cell expressing OCT or NET, thereby localizing the cancer in vivo. In some embodiments of the methods described herein, prognostic or diagnostic methods as described above are combined with the methods of using the compounds described herein (e.g. formula I, Ia, II, IIa, III, IIIa, IV, or V, including embodiments).","In some embodiments, a method is presented for detecting an OCT (or a NET) protein or mRNA in a cell from a patient. In some embodiments, the method further includes administering to the patient a platinum-based compound described herein. In some embodiments, the cell from the patient expresses an OCT (or NET) protein. In some embodiments, the cell from the patient has an increased amount of an OCT or NET mRNA or protein compared to the amount of an OCT or NET mRNA or protein in a control sample.","In some embodiments, a method is presented for administering a platinum-based compound as described herein to a patient with cancer cells that have an increased amount of an OCT or NET mRNA or protein compared to a control sample.","Members of the solute carrier (SLC) 22A family, OCT1(SLC22A1) and OCT2 (SLC22A2) mediate the intracellular uptake of structurally diverse organic cations that includes endogenous cations such as choline, creatinine and a variety of xenobiotics such as tetraethylammonium (TEA, a prototypic organic cation), the neurotoxin MPP+ (1-methyl-4-pyridinium). It is quite likely that these transporters are expressed by neoplastic liver cells. Any increase in the affinity of oxaliplatin-like or other platinum complex towards OCTs holds the promise of delivering a therapeutic agent that possesses a far greater efficacy and specificity for any cancer that retains a high level of OCT expression than the agents currently used.","Several mechanistic investigations have established the monoaquated complex of compounds such as oxaliplatin to be the form that is transporter by the OCTs. This complex has a net one positive charge (). Such complexes are highly unstable in nature due to their tremendous susceptibility toward the displacement of the water molecule by a chloride ion, forming a neutral dichloro compound.

Further, the efficacy of these complexes is being tested in cancer cell lines expressing OCTs. Based on the pharmacokinetic properties of these lead complexes, further structural optimization is being carried out to develop platinum compounds with enhanced specificity for OCTs. We are developing platinum anticancer compounds that are excellent substrates of OCTs for the purpose of targeted therapy of cancers with high level expression of human OCTs. This approach can enhance the therapeutic efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity of the platinum-based anticancer drugs due to the enrichment of platinum compounds in cells with high level of OCT expression. Oxaliplatin and its synthetic platinum analogs can be used for the treatment of the cancers expressing relatively high levels of OCTs, since they are expected to be enriched in the liver tumor cells due to the high level of OCT expression.","This study provides a pharmacogenomic basis for the selection of patients based on the expression level of a particular transporter for treatment with these novel anticancer agents and moving towards individualized therapy. A net increase in the therapeutic efficacy and decrease of systemic toxicity is a desired characteristic of these anticancer compounds.","Targeting OCTs enhances the delivery of platinum compounds to OCT expressing tumors and hence decreases the toxicity to cells which do not express OCTs. Currently synthezied platinum analogs of oxaliplatin will, for the first time, bring into practice the currently hypothetical individualized treatment for cancer, since the expression level and\/or polymorphism of these transporters will dictate the response and\/or adverse reactions of their treatment.","Utilization of either the siRNA approach and\/or the use of an inhibitor of hOCTs for diminishing the efficacy of the lead compounds is being used to confirm the utilization of OCTs to get inside cells by these compounds. We are performing in-vivo studies in transgenic and xenograft mouse models for cancers to produce a proof-of-concept. Further effect of individual OCT on pharmacokinetics and efficacy of new platinum complexes is being evaluated in specific OCT-knockout mice. Based on the efficacy, toxicity and PK\/PD data for our lead compounds from our preliminary in vivo screen, we are rationally modifying\/optimizing the structural features of these currently promising compounds.","Platinum-complexes are some of the most widely-used drugs for the treatment of cancers, especially solid tumors. Unfortunately, their tissue distribution is either nonspecific or of a specificity that is insufficient to cause adequate selective accumulation so as to deliver an adequate cytotoxic effect. We have found that the distribution of platinum complexes into various body tissues including tumors or neoplasms can be influenced through design of ligands that confer upon the platinum complex increased affinity for a particular influx transport mechanism. This enhanced affinity translates into higher sequestration of the platinum into tissues that express the particular influx transport mechanism. Higher tissue accumulation translates into 1) higher anticancer potency and 2) lower potential of adverse effects because the platinum is channeled away from the tissue where adverse effects occur.","In some embodiments, the platinum-based compound comprises one platinum ion in either the +2 or the +4 oxidation state. The nature of ligand attachment to the Pt ion may be an ionic bond or a dative\/covalent-coordinate bond. In some embodiments, ionic bonds may be present bridging ligands or the Pt containing compound and a counterion without the involvement of the platinum ion in the said bridging unit.","We have synthesized a large (>100) library of platinum-based compounds. Described herein is the application these platinum-based compounds to the targeting of Norepinephrine Transporter (NET). A set platinum compounds are selected to exemplify this concept: SM-73 and SM-85 ().","Table 4 shows the toxicity of these compounds toward HEK cells that are either transfected stably with the Norepinephrine Transporter or are empty vector cells. The platinums in  bear ligands that confer upon them varying degrees of affinity for NET, which is translated into varying cytotoxicities that are dependent on the presence of absence of NET.","The term \u201cresistance factor\u201d is a measure of selectivity conferred upon the platinum-based compound by the inclusion of ligands that promote recognition by NET. From Table 4, it is clear that SM-73 is 5.5-fold more effective against HEK cells that express NET.","The success of our targeting strategy can be gauged in-vitro also through comparing the uptake of the platinum complex into cells. The actual effects of this increased uptake can in turn be ascertained and quantified through comparison of DNA-binding of the platinum complexes.","Overall, it is clear that the targeted platinum agents are more selective for accumulation into NET-expressing HEK cells when compared to the non-targeted platinum agent, cisplatin.

Tissue accumulation of platinum is being determined after 48 h of a single bolus intravenous tail-vein injection of each platinum drug.","Tumor Induction: The choice of HEK293 cells for this study is influenced by their modest tumor growth-rates and their well-documented ability to express readily the transfected mammalian proteins. In this study, nude mice are being divided into different treatment groups: 1-4. tumors consisting of HEK293 cells stably expressing OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET respectively; 6. tumors consisting of HEK293 cells expressing the vector alone.

These compounds were prepared through a modified form of a reported preparative procedure (Giandomenico 1995).","To dimethylacetamide (100 mL, distilled freshly from CaH) was added EtNCl.HO (780 mg, 4.41 mmol) and the mixture was distilled under a pressure of 1 mmHg to remove ca. 20 mL of the solvent. To the remaining pale yellow solution was added cisplatin (1.09 g, 3.66 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 90\u00b0 C. under Ar overnight. The resulting solution was then evaporated to \u2153its volume and poured into ether-hexanes (1:1, 200 mL) and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. overnight, during which an oily residue separated from the mixture. The supernatant was decanted and the oily residue taken up in ca. 15 of water, filtered, and treated with well-swelled Dowex 50W-X8 cationic resin for 2 h. The mixture was filtered, resin washed with 10 mL of water and the combined filtrates where evaporated under 0.5 mmHg to a volume of 1-2 mL.

After stirring vigorously at ambient temperature overnight, the yellow precipitate was isolated by filtration and triturated with water (10 mL, 3\u00d7) and acetone (10 mL, 3\u00d7). The solid was then dried under 1 mm Hg to afford Na[PtClIAmineNH].HO (84 mg, 67%).","To Na[PtClIAmineNH].HO (80 mg) was added AgNO(1 equiv) under exclusion of light followed by HO (5 mL). This mixture was stirred until a test of silver ion was negative. About 1.00 g of activated charcoal was then added and the mixture was filtered after stirring for an hour. HCl (2 mL) was then added, causing precipitation of a solid over 24 h. The solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOH, EtOAc and then ether, and dried under 0.5 mmHg to afford 68 mg (51%) of Na[PtCl-AmineNH]. Giandomenico C M, Abrams M J, Murrer, B A, et al.

After overnight incubation, the platinum compound with or without an OCT inhibitor (disopyramide) was then be added to the culture medium to various concentrations.

Accumulation was normalized to protein content.","Platinum-DNA Adduct Formation:","The cells were incubated in the culture medium containing 10 \u03bcM concentration of oxaliplatin or platinum-based compounds with or without an OCT inhibitor. After incubation, genomic DNA was isolated from the cell pellets using Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA was used for determination of platinum (ICP-MS) and DNA content (absorption spectrometry at 260 nm).

Absorption as a function of time (0\u2266t\u22661440 min) for platinum concentration of zero was subtracted from the absorption at each platinum concentration. Initial rates were calculated from the early time points as change in absorption over change in time.","Statistics:","In the studies using OCT transfected cells, comparisons of IC, uptake and platinum DNA adduct formation was performed between OCTs expressing cells and control (empty vector transfected cells). In the colon cancer cell lines, the same comparisons were made in the presence and absence of disopyramide. Standard t-tests will be used with a p value set at 0.05 (two-tailed).","Evaluation of all three classes of compounds was carried out in an in-vitro cytotoxicity assay, involving a comparison between the effect of the platinum complex on human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) transfected with human OCT1 (HEK-hOCT1) and OCT2 (HEK-hOCT2) versus those that are not transfected. The results indicated that the positively charged complexes are superior substrates for OCT1 and OCT2 than oxaliplatin itself. The ICvalues of these newly synthesized complexes were 20-170 times lower in OCT transfected cell lines when compared with untransfected cells. Cytotoxicities of individual member of platinum complex classes A, B and C are listed in table 2, 3 and 4. From this preliminary cytotoxicity data, the identified lead platinum-based compounds as described herein were: SM73 and SM85 (10).","Concrete evidence for the higher accumulation of platinum-based compounds is obtained through a comparison of the cellular uptake of lead platinum compounds vs. oxaliplatin in OCT1 or OCT2 or OCT3 or NET transfected and untransfected cells. A 50-100 fold higher accumulation of new platinum compounds, when compared to the 4.5-fold higher accumulation of oxaliplatin in HEK-OCT1 cells than untransfected cells serves to confirm the abovesaid supposition (). These experiments clearly demonstrate that platinum-based compounds designed to target hOCT1 were far better substrates of hOCT1 when compared to oxaliplatin and could indeed be used as targeted anticancer therapy.","Similar results were obtained for the entire series of our synthetic platinum complexes (tables 6, 7, and 8). Also, most of these complexes were found to be substrates for OCT2 (tables 6 and 7). This greatly substantiates our original proposition of the stereoelectronic mimicry of the bioactive mono-aqua complex to achieve higher affinity for OCTs.","To further support our results from experiments in transfected cell lines, we will demonstrate anticancer efficacy of oxaliplatin and these platinum-based compounds as described herein in colon cancer cell lines or neuroendocrine cancer cell lines or other cancer cell lines that express and OCT or NET, or another transporter that translocates the compounds described herein.","Besides these in vitro experiments which demonstrate the importance of OCT1 in the pharmacological efficacy of these platinums, we carried out a mechanistic study whereby we compared the rates of inactivation of these lead synthetic platinums with that of cisplatin and oxaliplatin. One major pathway by which these platinum drugs get inactivated in vivo is by reaction with glutathione (GSH). We mimicked this reaction with GSH in vitro using physiological concentrations of GSH and salts.
