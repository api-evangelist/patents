{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 (e) of U.S. provisional application No. 60\/585,263, filed on Jul. 1, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to the field of data analysis, including the design of data analysis and visualization systems.","The modern world is seemingly flooded with data but is often at a loss for interpreting it. One exceptionally useful tool that has found wide acceptance is software that presents the data in some visual form, especially in a way that makes relationships noticeable. Using this software, often very complex databases can be queried. The results of the queries are then analyzed and displayed in some visual format, usually graphical, such as a bar or pie chart, scatter plot, or any of a large number of other well-known formats. Modern analysis tools then allow the user to dynamically adjust the ranges of the displayed results in order to change and see different aspects of the analysis.","One prominent data visualization product is owned by Spotfire AB of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden, and marketed under the name DecisionSite.\u00ae In this product, which incorporates the technology disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,661 (Ahlberg, et al., \u201cSystem and method for automatic analysis of data bases and for user-controlled dynamic querying,\u201d issued 11 Jan. 2000, and herein incorporated by reference), query devices tied to columns in the data set and different visualizations of the data allow users to dynamically filter their data sets based on any available property, and hence to interactively visualize the data. As the user adjusts graphical query devices such as rangesliders and alphasliders, the DecisionSite\u00ae product changes the visualization of the data accordingly.","The DecisionSite\u00ae product also includes several other automatic features, such as initial selection of suitable query devices and determination of ranges, which aid the user not only to visualize the data, but also to mine it. When properly used, this technique constitutes a powerful tool that forms the basis for sophisticated data exploration and decision-making applications.","Overall, analysis and visualization products have improved the efficiency and enhanced the capabilities of professionals in a wide range of areas of data analysis. But these individuals are typically highly trained and highly paid, and they can still spend long periods of time in their data analysis tasks. Improvements in the efficiency of data analysis tasks would therefore be of great benefit to individuals working in a variety of areas.","In one general aspect, the invention features a system for analyzing data from a database that includes a data analysis user interface responsive to user interaction to initiate actions on the data. An action logging interface is operative to create a logged sequence of actions as the user initiates them through the data analysis user interface. And a token-based authoring user interface responsive to user selection commands to select action-tokens corresponding to the actions logged by the action logging interface to create an authored set of actions that has an authored sequence that can be different from the logged sequence.","In preferred embodiments, the authoring user interface can include one or more sequencing controls that operate on the action-tokens. At least one of the sequencing controls can be a selection control operative to select a subset of the logged actions for inclusion in a guide series. The authoring interface can include a selection control operative to select a subset of the logged actions for inclusion in a guide series. The authoring interface can include a reordering control operative to reorder actions referenced in the guide series. The authoring interface can include a grouping control operative to identify groups of actions. The authoring interface can include a group naming control operative to name groups of actions identified by the authoring interface. A guide display can be operative to display at least a portion of the authored set of actions. The authoring interface can include a gating control operative to insert one or more gating constructs into the authored sequence. The authoring interface can include sequencing controls that are responsive to actuation by a pointing device. The sequencing controls can include drop-and-drag controls. The sequencing controls can include promote and demote controls. The authoring interface can include annotation controls responsive to user input to associate user-authored textual annotations to actions in the different sequence. The textual annotations can be visible in a user interface window. The logging can be operative at startup of the system. The logging can be independent of any user logging initiation command. The system can also include a macro interface that performs actions in response to a parsed series of user-editable statements. The system can include a library operative to provide access to a plurality of the authored sequences by more than one user. At least some of the authored sequences can be designated through the server as best practice sequences. The authoring interface can be operative to save authored sets to the library and retrieve them from the library for further authoring. The authoring interface can be operative to save authored sets and retrieve them for further authoring. The authoring interface can be operative to permit the user to create an authored sequence in which at least some of the actions are in a different order than they are in the logged sequence. The authoring interface can permit users to create authored sequences with references outside of the data analysis system. The authoring interface can permit users to create authored sequences with references outside of the data analysis system in which selected data are passed from the data analysis system. The authoring interface can permit users to create authored sequences with references to outside services that return information to the data analysis system. The authoring interface can permit users to create authored sequences with references outside of the data analysis system in which selected data are passed from the data analysis system to an outside service and a result is returned from that service for the selected data. The system can further include an application programming interface that defines a standard for supporting additional actions in the system and wherein the additional actions can be logged and referenced in authored sequences. The authoring interface can permit users to insert hyperlinks to items other than actions into the authored sequence. The authoring interface can permit users to insert references to data to be operated on by the system into the authored sequence. The authoring interface can permit users to insert into the authored sequence references to data in the database to be operated on by the system. The authoring interface can permit users to insert prompts for selection of variables into the authored sequence. The system can include a state engine that stores application states. The data analysis system can include spreadsheet functionality. The data analysis system can include interactive data visualization functionality. The data analysis system can be a statistical package that includes a plurality of advanced statistical functions. The statistical analysis package can include at least two of the following advanced statistical functions: regression, correlation, and analysis of variance. The system can be operative independent of any user-initiated compile command. The authoring interface and the user interface can both be independently accessible at the same time. The authoring interface can further be responsive to user comment command input to insert end-user-readable comments into the authored set of actions. The authoring interface can be responsive to user commands to insert page delimiters in the authored set of actions. The authoring interface can include automatic page navigation logic operative to insert navigation links between pages in response to the insertion of page delimiters. The authored set of actions can be stored as a structured document. The authored set of actions can be stored in a structured text format that can be modified by the end user. The action-tokens can be hierarchical and can include other action-tokens. The database can be stored as a delimited file.","In another general aspect, the invention features a system for analyzing data from a database that includes a data analysis user interface responsive to user interaction to initiate actions on the data, and an action logging interface operative to create a logged sequence of actions as the user initiates them through the data analysis user interface. Mapping logic is operative to map one or more of the actions to an action-token, and a token access user interface is operative to present a selection of token controls corresponding to tokens mapped by the mapping logic to the user and responsive to user-actuations of selected ones of the controls to allow for random access to the actions corresponding to the selected tokens after the step of logging.","In preferred embodiments, the token access user interface can be an authoring user interface responsive to token selection commands to select actions from the logged sequence to create an authored set of actions that has an authored sequence that can be different from the logged sequence.","In a further general aspect, the invention features a data analysis method that includes automatically logging a sequence of data analysis actions on data from the database as they are initiated by a user, associating action-tokens with each of the actions logged in the step of automatically logging, receiving token-based user authoring commands from a user, and storing an authored sequence of actions selected by the user and for which token-based authoring commands were received by the step of receiving.","In another general aspect, the invention features a system for analyzing data from a database that includes means for automatically logging a sequence of data analysis actions as they are initiated by a user, means for associating action-tokens with each of the actions logged in the step of logging, means for receiving token-based user authoring commands from a user, and means for storing an authored sequence of actions selected by the user and for which token-based authoring commands were received by the means for receiving.","Systems according to the invention recognize that the process of analyzing a complex data set usually involves many steps as a user explores the effects of different input parameters and data fields, different filters, different analysis algorithms, different display options, etc. The data visualization process is also intended to be as easy for a user to use as possible, and since the user presumably has more productive work to do, it is seldom that a user will keep track of which actions he took to create a given visualization. This then makes it hard not only for him or her to reproduce the analysis for him- or herself, but also to report it to others in a way that they can use to reproduce the analysis and perhaps modify, augment or omit some of the actions, to perform the same actions on a different data set, etc. Moreover, an inability to completely or at least sufficiently record the actions taken to analyze a data set also makes it difficult or impossible to meet requirements for publishing \u201cbest practices\u201d documentation, or for meeting some regulatory demands.","Some existing applications that perform at least simple data analysis include some facility for recording actions. Microsoft Excel\u00ae, for example, has a macro tool that records actions. This tool runs in the background, however, and is a \u201cblack box\u201d from the perspective of a user, such that it records past actions, but does not guide the user\u2014or a different user\u2014to produce future results. Furthermore, these existing applications are not related to interactive graphical presentation of analyzed data.","Referring to , an illustrative embodiment of the invention is included in the Analysis Builder guide building feature of the DecisionSite\u00ae data analysis and visualization software system developed by Spotfire, Inc. This feature provides action-logging and guiding functionality with a graphical user interface that can be integrated into or will augment existing data analysis software, especially of the type that visualizes data, such as the DecisionSite\u00ae system. The principles of the invention may also be applied to other data analysis and visualization packages, however, with modifications that are within the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art to the extent that they are needed.","When the user activates the guide building feature, it creates a log of all user actions that affect the analysis. Actions may be of any type, from selecting and opening one or more data sets to choosing analysis routines and visualization options. The user can also edit the log as desired before or even after saving it. The invention also allows the user to add comments, to group and label actions intuitively, and to add links to external network resources such as web sites.","Once the log is saved it can be used as is, for purpose of pure documentation, or it can be exported to others, for example by e-mail as an XML file, in which case it acts as a guide to recreating the analysis, with the option of additional modification by other users. The log can also be stored in a library, optionally with a list of those who are allowed access to it. This allows others to run it, or use it as a basis for building further guides.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 1-7","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"]},"One feature of the DecisionSite\u00ae system is that it will automatically generate a slide presentation of the various visualizations in Microsoft PowerPoint, as is illustrated in .","In proceeding from initialization to final presentation, the user will have performed several actions: Opening a data set; selecting scatter plots and a histogram; initiating K-means clustering according to chosen parameters; setting query device filters; and instructing the system to generate the PowerPoint presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 8 and 9","FIGS. 1-7","FIG. 8"]},"Clicking on a link in the guide initiates the actions associated with the link. Thus, clicking on the \u201cLoad data, create initial views\u201d link (shown in the \u201cGuide contents\u201d pane) will \u201creplay\u201d and recreate the results of the actions of opening the data set (whose address\/file name\/locator, etc., is preferably saved along with the guide); clicking on \u201cIncremental visualization\u201d would cause the 3-D scatter plot to be generated; clicking on \u201cRun clustering\u201d directs the analysis routine to perform the four listed actions associated with K-means clustering; and \u201cGenerate PowerPoint report\u201d generates a report in PowerPoint.","The various links, along with user-added comments, are shown in the \u201cGuide contents\u201d pane and can be edited using commands shown either next to the pane itself (such as the \u201cAdd link\u201d button) or in drop-down menus on the guide building feature tool bar. The guide can then be saved in the conventional manner, preferably in a file format suitable for sending to others. As  shows, the saved guide can then be edited or opened later by the same or by another user.","Ways in which the user can interact with various features of this embodiment will now be described in more detail in connection with .","The guide builder allows users to capture commonly performed analysis processes into guides, but creating guides does not require users to write a single line of code. Guides created with the guide builder can contain text and links. However, the guides can also be extended with any number of complex tasks if one has programming experience or access to a person with these types of skills.","An example of a guide created with the guide builder is presented in . A Contents and Title flight view is automatically added at the top of every guide page. It includes the Contents link followed by the guide title. The Contents link closes the guide and goes back to the main page of the Guides pane. The title of a guide can be configured via the Guide> Properties menu entry in the guide builder.","The main part of the guide includes text and links. Users can design this part of the guide by adding text and links to the guide.","Back and Next links are provided as well. These are navigation links which are automatically added at the end of every guide page. The first page of the guide gets a Next link, following pages get a Back and a Next, and the last page of the guide gets a Back and a Back to Contents link (same function as the Contents link in the flight view).","Table 1 presents a suggested workflow narrative to create a new guide using the guide builder:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["1.","Open a data set in the system and start to perform your analysis the "]},{"entry":[{},"way that you want it to be done in the Guide."]},{"entry":["2.","If the guide builder tool is not already open, click guide builder> "]},{"entry":[{},"Create Guide in the Tools pane of the system Navigator."]},{"entry":["3.","Create the guide in the guide builder by adding links and text to the "]},{"entry":[{},"Guide contents list.

The user accomplishes this by clicking to select an action in the list (Ctrl allows several actions to be selected), and then clicks the<Add Link button to create a link in the guide.","Actions are automatically logged in the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list as they are performed by users of the system. Users first load data and perform the analysis they would normally perform. Their data, the visualizations they create, and the tools they start will appear as actions in the list. To edit a previously created guide, the user starts by running the guide in the system. This will furnish the list of actions with the data, visualizations and tools used in the guide.","Users do not have to turn on the guide builder in order for their actions to be logged. It is done automatically even if users have not started the guide builder. However, if a user logs out from the server, no actions will be logged while disconnected.","The list of actions will be emptied if the user closes his or her data via File>Close in the system. Note that the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list will be cleared if the user opens a new data set. Since the user can only have one data set open at a time in the system, the previous data will be closed when he or she opens the new data set. If the user logs out from the server, the guide builder will be closed and the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list will be cleared.","If an information link is added via the Information Library or the Information Builder, the created guide will include a reference to the information link or the actual query, respectively. If the information link is prompted, the end user of the guide will see the prompts and be able to make her own selection. The default reference is to a link on the same server, although the system can accommodate links to other servers.","The author can allow an end user of a guide to be able to choose a different information link, by instead including a link that starts the tool Information Library. To make the action Start Information Library appear in the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list, the user can start the tool once more after opening the information link that he or she used when creating the guide and select Cancel in the Information Library dialog.","If a data set has been opened by some other means than by opening an information link, the user will have the option to save the data with the guide. This means that the data set that the user is currently using will be a part of the guide file. This can be useful for reference data that are never changed or to create a prototype guide where some IT personnel will later on modify a guide to open data from a data source that is currently not supported by the guide builder.","The data set that is saved with the guide is the currently available data. That means that if the user has added or removed columns from the original data set prior to adding a link to a guide, the embedded data will contain the modified data set.","To save the data from an information link with the guide, e.g., for testing purposes, one can first open the information link, save the data as an SFS file in the system, the user can open the SFS file with the data and add the new action Open data (saved with guide) to the guide.","Visualizations appear in the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list when they are created, but the actual settings for the visualization are retrieved when a link is added to the Guide contents list. All properties are saved with the specific visualization. For example, the user can specify that a scatter plot should be created with two defined columns on the axes and with the markers colored by a third column. Query device settings (filtering), transformed columns and background images are also included in the link. It is also possible to add steps to the guide where the end user of the guide is prompted to specify which settings to use, as presented below in more detail.","Adding the Set query device filters action in a link will set all query devices and also the selected properties of the Columns tab to the current state. This means that the user can apply log scale, show or hide empty values, specify query device types and filter on specific columns without having to add a new visualization. This way, the user can create several links in the guide that update his or her visualizations, thus creating a \u201cbookmark\u201d kind of function. Note that if the data set that the end user of a guide is using differs from the one that the user was using while creating the guide, there might be occasions when the query device settings will not be applicable.","In the current version of the guide builder, settings are only in some cases saved with the tools. The various tool links will, most of the time, open the tool to the end user of the guide, but he or she will have to make the calculation selections and click OK in the tool dialog for him- or herself. If the authoring user wants the end users to use some specific settings in the tool, he or she should state this information as text in the guide. Some tools, e.g., the New Column from Expression tool, can be run silently (without input from the end user). When a link is added to such a tool, the user can set the Tool Option to specify whether the user wants the link to run the tool using the settings specified in the current analysis, or if the user wants to display the dialog to the end user of the guide.","It is possible and also often recommended to include several actions in a single link. For example, if the user wants the guide to open an information link and also display one or more visualizations upon clicking the link, the user can combine these actions to one link. It is important to make sure to have performed all actions that are to be included. The user then clicks to select all of the actions that should be included and clicks<Add Link. The actions will be performed in the order that they appear in the Actions in DecisionSite\u00ae list, i.e., the order in which the user performed them in his or her analysis.","While a user develops a guide, or if he or she creates guides that are for his or her own use only, the user may want to run a guide locally on his or her own computer, without giving other users access to it on the server.

It will also be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the illustrative system provides an environment in which users can directly record actions, modify guides, and run them, without having to first compile them or switch between application interfaces. Instead, both the authoring interface and the user interface are independently accessible at the same time. This allows users to build guides in an intuitive set of try-and-modify iterations.","Unlike conventional programming languages that are based on parsed sequences, the system of the invention uses action-tokens. An action-token is an independently executable element that can only be divided into other independently executable elements, if it can be divided at all. The use of such tokens allows even inexperienced users to safely manipulate them without resulting in syntax errors. This is quite different from allowing an inexperienced user to manipulate conventional programming code, where a single miscapitalized letter or a misplaced semicolon can cause errors that effectively prevent its execution.","The system stores the guides as built by users in the form of XML and HTML hypertext files, but other representations could of course also be used. The use of standard hypertext scripting languages can allow more technically skilled users to directly modify the guides by deleting logged code, modifying logged code, or adding new code. Users can even add code that uses other programming languages, such as Windows\u00ae native scripting language, or javascript.","It will also be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that while the system is implemented in a software running on a Microsoft Windows\u00ae platform, that other implementations are possible using different software and hardware platforms.","The system can also support hierarchical action entries. These allow users to \u201cdrill down\u201d into operations and make more granular choices. The user can select a scatter plot creation command (<Create Scatterplot>) in a guide, for example, and then expand it into a list of sub-actions such as:\n\n","In another example, the user can expand a <Set query device settings> action as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0111","num":"0125"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00015","num":"00015"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<Set query device setings>\u2003\u2003\u2003[Expand]"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003[Set Year range]"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003[Set Age range]\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003[Expand]"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003[Move Year lower range to 10]"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003[Move Age upper ranger to 25]"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"The user can instruct the system to perform the expansion operations in a variety of conventional ways, such as double-clicking on the action, actuating an expand button with the action selected, or actuating a dedicated expand control for the action (e.g., a \u201c+\u201d). The system can display the expanded actions in a variety of different ways as well, such as a separate pop-up window, or in an outline view that allows multiple actions to be viewed in expanded form at the same time.","The hierarchical nature of the system also allows tokens to be combined into larger tokens. It follows that a guide is also a kind of token and can be used as an element in other guides.","The system can also include a more traditional macro interface to supplement its guide functionality. This macro interface would enable more advanced users to create more highly-tailored macros that could then be included in guides. This functionality can use a traditional programming language interface that is based on a series of user-editable parsed statements. Such an interface could resemble the well-known Microsoft Visual Basics interface, for example. The system can also include some more advanced programming controls, such as simple gating statements (e.g., branching, testing, or error detection).","The present invention has now been described in connection with a number of specific embodiments thereof. However, numerous modifications which are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention should now be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, while the embodiment presented above is applied to data analysis software that has advanced visualization capabilities, guides could also be employed in less visually-oriented data analysis systems such as accounting programs, statistical packages (e.g., SPSS\u00ae), or spreadsheets. And software without analysis features, such as word processors or contact management programs may also benefit from guide-based automation according to the invention. It is therefore intended that the scope of the present invention be limited only by the scope of the claims appended hereto. In addition, the order of presentation of the claims should not be construed to limit the scope of any particular term in the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1-7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
