Lower doses given less frequently can be used prophylactically to prevent or reduce the incidence of recurrence of the infection.","For topical administration, formulations (e.g., solutions, pastes, creams, salves, ointments, etc.) can be prepared comprising between about 0.05 and about 5% active compound by weight, which can be applied one or more times daily for a period of time (e.g., one, two or three weeks) or until the condition is essentially controlled.","In accordance with the present methods, pharmaceutically active compounds as described herein can be administered orally as a solid or as a liquid, or can be administered intramuscularly or intravenously as a solution, suspension, or emulsion. Alternatively, the compounds or salts also can be administered by inhalation, intravenously, or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension. When administered through inhalation the active compound or salt should be in the form of a plurality of solid particles or droplets having a particle size from about 0.5 to about 5 microns, and preferably from about 1 to about 2 microns.","Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for intravenous or intramuscular injection are further embodiments provided herein. The pharmaceutical formulations comprise a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), and\/or (Id) described herein, a prodrug as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. If a solution is desired, water is the carrier of choice with respect to water-soluble compounds or salts. With respect to the water-soluble compounds or salts, an organic vehicle, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or mixtures thereof, can be suitable. In the latter instance, the organic vehicle can contain a substantial amount of water. The solution in either instance can then be sterilized in a suitable manner known to those in the art, and typically by filtration through a 0.22-micron filter. Subsequent to sterilization, the solution can be dispensed into appropriate receptacles, such as depyrogenated glass vials. The dispensing is preferably done by an aseptic method. Sterilized closures can then be placed on the vials and, if desired, the vial contents can be lyophilized.","In addition to compounds of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), and\/or (Id) or their salts or prodrugs, the pharmaceutical formulations can contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the formulations can contain antimicrobial preservatives. Useful antimicrobial preservative include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The antimicrobial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multi-dose use. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.","In yet another embodiment of the subject matter described herein, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile formulation comprising a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), and\/or (Id), or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate, which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid formulation suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 10 mg to about 10 grams of the compound salt. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent, which is physiologically acceptable, can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline.","Other pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared from the water-insoluble compounds disclosed herein, or salts thereof, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the formulation will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound or salt thereof. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.","Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art.

See Woitun et al., (), 34(1), 22-27 (1981); and Maier et al., (), 34(1), 16-21 (1981). 1,3-Dibenzyloxycarbonyl-3\u2032(R)-amino spectinomycin was synthesized from spectinomycin dihydrochloride pentahydrate in two steps as shown in . First, the secondary methyl amines on the A ring were protected as benzyl carbamates with carboxybenzyl (CBz) groups using benzyl chloroformate and NaHCOin water. Then the 3\u2032-deoxy-3\u2032-amino derivative was obtained by the reductive amination of the protected intermediate with ammonium nitrate and sodium cyanoborohydride in methanol.","The amine was then used for the synthesis of the targeted 3\u2032-acylamino spectinomycin derivatives by coupling it to a variety of acids using HBTU in dichloromethane. See . The CBz groups were removed by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon (Pd\/C) for 2 hrs to afford the target amides. For aryl side chains sensitive to the hydrogenolysis conditions used to remove the CBz groups, exposure to aqueous HBr 48% for 2 hrs was used as an alternative method to afford the deprotected final product.","The 3\u2032-deoxy-3\u2032-alkylamino spectinomycin derivatives were obtained by two routes: either by reduction of corresponding di-CBz-protected amides using NaBHin the presence of TFA and dioxane for simple alkyl substitutents (see ); or by direct reductive alkylation of 1,3-dibenzyloxycarbonyl 3\u2032(R)-amino spectinomycin with aryl aldehydes with PtOcatalyzed hydrogenation to afford arylalkyl substituted amines. See . Both approaches were then followed by CBz deprotection using catalytic hydrogenation using Pd\/C for 2 hrs to afford the target 3\u2032-deoxy 3\u2032(R)-alkylamino spectinomycins.","General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3\u2032-deoxy 3\u2032-acylamino spectinomycins:","To a stirred solution of selected acid (3 mmol) in CHCl(10 mL) and DIPEA (6 mmol) was added HBTU (3 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. Then 6,8-dibenzyloxycarbonyl 4(R)-amino spectinomycin (1 mmol) was added and stirred at room temperature for overnight. The reaction solution was diluted with excess CHCland washed with water, dried (NaSO) and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford corresponding protected amide using petroleum\/ethylacetate gradient eluent system. Deprotection of the amino protecting groups was achieved by dissolution of the protected amide in 1.25 M HCl in MeOH and EtOH (1:1) with 10% Pd\u2014C (50% by mass). The mixture was hydrogenated under 30 Psi\/Hat room temperature for 2 hrs, filtered and concentrated. The resulting solid was titurated with cold diethyl ether, filtered and the resulting solid washed with excess ether and dried in vacuo to give the target 3\u2032-deoxy 3\u2032-acylamino spectinomycins.","General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3\u2032-deoxy 3\u2032-acylamino spectinomycins, Method 2:","To a stirred solution of selected acid (3 mmol) in CHCl(10 mL) and DIPEA (6 mmol) was added HBTU (3 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h.

Disappearance of the parent compound was monitored during the incubation period. The percentage of parent compound remaining intact was estimated by comparing analyte concentrations before and after incubation.","Protein Binding:","Protein binding of the compounds was determined using equilibrium dialysis. Biologically relevant concentrations of test compound were prepared (low and high) in rat plasma. 200 \u03bcL of the plasma sample was placed in the central chamber and 350 \u03bcL of blank isotonic phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 was added to the peripheral chamber of a dialysis device (MW cutoff 6000-8000 D, RED\u00ae device, Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, Ill., United States of America). The chambers were covered with a seal and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for four hours on a shaker set at 100 rpm. At the end of incubation, the volumes of plasma and recipient buffer were measured to identify and account for volume shift, if any. Aliquots of plasma and buffer were used to determine the drug concentration using an LC-MS\/MS assay. The free fraction of the drug was calculated as ratio of the concentrations in the buffer and in plasma.","Pharmacokinetic Studies:","Catheterized male Sprague-Dawley rats (jugular vein alone for oral study and jugular vein and femoral vein for intravenous study) weighing approximately 225 g were obtained from Harlan Bioscience (Indianapolis, Ind., United States of America). The animals were kept on a 12 hr light\/dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. Groups of rats (n=4) received either an intravenous (IV) or oral dose of a test compound at a dose level of 10 mg\/kg or 100 mg\/kg, respectively. For oral administration, the animals were fasted overnight and until 4 hr after administration of test compound. Serial blood samples (approx. 250 \u03bcL) were collected pre-dose and at predetermined time points post-dose until 48 hours. Plasma was separated immediately by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C.) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until analysis. Urine specimens were collected for a period of 48 hours following drug administration. The study protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (Memphis, Tenn., United States of America).","Sample Preparation and LC-MS\/MS Assay:","A calibration curve ranging from 7.81-1000 \u03bcg\/L was constructed for each test compound by spiking the test compound into 50 \u03bcL of blank rat plasma. A structurally similar analogue to the test compounds, compound 1369, was used as internal standard (IS) to all calibration standards and all plasma specimens. Plasma proteins were precipitated by the addition of four volumes of ice cold methanol containing IS. These samples were vortexed and kept on ice for 20 minutes. Following this, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C. and the supernatants were diluted if necessary and injected onto LC-MS\/MS for analysis. Chromatographic separations were carried out using a Shimadzu liquid chromatograph (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) consisting of two pumps, online degasser, system controller and a CTC Leap auto sampler (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, N.C., United States of America). A gradient of methanol and 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 3.5 was used at a flow rate of 0.4 mL\/min. A Phenomenex\u00ae Luna 3\u03bc HILIC, 100\u00d74.6 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif., United States of America) protected with a guard column was used for the separation. 10 \u03bcL of sample was injected onto the column and the eluate was led directly into an API 3000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems ABI\/MDS-Sciex, Foster City, Calif., United States of America) equipped with an electrospray ion source. The instrument was operated in the positive ion mode with nebulizer gas (NEB) at 7 psi, curtain gas (CUR) at 8 psi, collision gas (CAD) at 10 psi, ion spray voltage (IS) at +4000 V and temperature (TEM) at 500\u00b0 C. The resulting multiple reaction monitoring chromatograms were used for quantification using Analyst software version 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems ABI\/MDS-Sciex, Foster City, Calif., United States of America).","Pharmacokinetic Data Analysis:","Plasma concentration-time data for oral dose were analyzed by non-compartmental analysis. A two compartment open model with bolus input and first order output was used to analyze the IV plasma concentration-time data. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) was calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation to time infinity. Mean residence time (MRT), the average amount of time a particle remains in a compartment of system was calculated for IV dose using MRT=AUMCinf\/AUCinf where AUMCinf is the area under the moment curve when the concentration-time curve is extrapolated to infinity. The systemic clearance (CL) was calculated using the equation CL=Doseiv\/AUCinf iv, where Doseiv and AUCinf, iv are the IV dose and corresponding area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity, respectively. An estimate of volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was obtained from IV data using Vss=MRT*CL. Oral bioavailability (F) was calculated using F=(AUCinf, oral* Doseiv)\/(AUCinf, iv *Doseoral), where Doseoral, Doseiv, AUCinf, iv, and AUCinf, oral are the oral and IV doses and the corresponding areas under the plasma concentration-time curves from time 0 to infinity, respectively. Physiologic parameters for rats obtained from Davies et al. (10(7), 1093-1095 (1993)) were used to calculate the excretion ratio and hepatic extraction ratio.","The anti-tuberculosis activity of the spectinomycin analogs was determined against H37Rv in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with 10% ADC media by microbroth dilution of drug in 96 well plates. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 7 days and then read visually for growth inhibition according to previously described methods. See, e.g., Hurdle et al., 62(5), 1037-1045 (2008).

For example, the compounds 1443, 1444 and 1368 displayed MICs of 1.6, 6.25 and 6.25 \u03bcg\/mL respectively, against , which represents a 4-16 fold improvement over spectinomycin. Similarly, the compounds 1422, 1535 and 1543 showed 4-16 fold improvement over spectinomycin against . Several compounds showed significant activity against . For example, 1329, 1446, 1447, 1491, 1515, 1516, 1517, 1519, 1520, 1535, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540, 1541, 1542, 1543, and 1544 showed 8-62.5 fold improvement in activity against over spectinomycin.","As shown in Table 4, the K12 tolC knockout strain that possesses a defective multi-drug efflux pump was more susceptible than parental K12 to the spectinomycin analogs, whereas the MIC of spectinomycin was not substantially affected. Without being bound to any one theory, this appears suggestive that drug efflux systems and\/or cell permeability might account for the relative inactivity of spectinomycin against most bacterial organisms and that the presently disclosed spectinamides differ from spectinomycin in their uptake and efflux into bacterial cells. Further, it was recently reported that spectinomycin is effluxed by (see Ramon-Garcia et al., 59(3), 544-547 (2007)), which can in part explain its general lack of activity against TB cells. Therefore, it is believed that the enhanced anti-tubercular activities of compounds 1329, 1443, 1444 and 1445 and their related analogs against other organisms reflect the increased ability of these molecules to penetrate into specific organisms. Additionally, it is also likely that these inhibitors are less susceptible to extrusion by drug efflux mechanisms.","To determine whether the mode of action of spectinamides against is consistent with the known information for spectinomycin, spontaneous drug resistant mutants of compound 1329 were selected on agar containing drug at 4, 8 and 16 times their MICs. Mutants exhibiting resistance to 1329 emerged at a frequency of 1.9\u22123.7\u00d710, which is comparable to the mutation frequency for isoniazid resistance as was previously determined using the same method. See Hurdle et al., 62(5), 1037-1045 (2008). However, this was higher than the mutation frequency for streptomycin-resistant mutants that emerged at 0.7\u22121.6\u00d710. In the spirochete , spectinomycin resistance also arises at a frequency of 10in contrast to streptomycin that emerges at 10and results from mutations at different loci to those conferring spectinomycin resistance. See Criswell et al., 50(2), 445-452 (2006). Without being bound to any one theory, since spectinomycin and streptomycin both target the 16S rRNA, it is plausible that the elevated mutation frequencies observed for 1329 reflect the occurrence of mutations at sites other than within the target, such as in genes controlling the uptake of 1329. However, two stable mutants exhibiting high-level drug resistance to 1329 and spectinomycin (MICs=>200 \u03bcg\/mL) were examined for cross resistance to streptomycin, kanamycin, and other anti-tubercular antibiotics. See Table 5. None of the mutants were cross resistant to the aminoglycosides streptomycin and kanamycin, capreomycin and the 23S ribosomal inhibitor linezolid. Similarly, spontaneous mutants of streptomycin were highly susceptible to 1329, including the reference strain ATCC 35820 that is resistant to streptomycin due to mutations in ribosomal protein S12. See Nair et al., 10(3), 521-527 (1993). Importantly, there was no cross resistance between 1329 and the first-line TB drugs for isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol. See Table 5. Together, these results demonstrate that 1329 and spectinomycins appear to exhibit a novel mode of action against that is unlikely to be affected by mechanisms that confer resistance to other established TB antibiotics including streptomycin and related aminoglycosides.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0428","num":"0853"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Activity of 1329 Compared to Streptomycin."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Strain","1329","Streptomycin"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"H37RV","0.8-1.6","0.2"]},{"entry":[{},"ATCC35822- Inh-resistant","0.8","0.8"]},{"entry":[{},"ATCC -35820 Stp-Resistant","0.8","6.25"]},{"entry":[{},"ATCC35837-Emb-Resistant","0.8","0.2"]},{"entry":[{},"HL-mutant 15*",">200","0.8"]},{"entry":[{},"HL-mutant 14*",">200","0.4"]},{"entry":[{},"Streptomycin-resistant Mutant 1","0.8","1.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Streptomycin-resistant Mutant 2","1.6",">200"]},{"entry":[{},"Streptomycin-resistant Mutant 6","0.4",">200"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"*Strains are also susceptible to Streptomycin, Kanamycin, Capreomycin, Linezolid, Rifampicin, Ethambutol and Isoniazid."]}]}}]}}},"To explore the genetic basis of resistance to 1329 and reasons for the lack of cross resistance with aminoglycosides, molecular genetic analysis was performed on the two high-level mutants of 1329. In non-tuberculosis organisms mutations in helix 34, the binding domain for spectinomycin, is commonly associated with specific resistance to this antibiotic. See Galimand et al., 44(5), 1365-1366 (2000); and O'Connor and Dahlberg, 45(6), 429-433 (2002). Similarly, mutations within the ribosomal protein S5 (encoded by rpsE) that interacts with the spectinomycin binding domain also confers spectinomycin resistance as a result of conformational changes that alter the binding domain for spectinomycin in the 16S rRNA. To determine if 1329 also binds to helix 34 and whether mutations within the ribosomal protein S5 or the 16S rRNA engender spectinomycin resistance in , these genes were sequenced in their entirety in both 1329-resistant mutants i.e. HL-14 and 15. No nucleotide changes were detected in the rpsE genes of the two mutants when these were compared to the rpsE derived from their wild type progenitor H37Rv and the reference sequence for rpsE that is denoted by Rv0721 in the H37Rv genome. In contrast, the mutants HL-14 and 15 contained single point transversions in the genes for the 16S rRNA. Whereas a point mutation involving a C1057A nucleotide change conferred resistance in HL-14, the mutant HL-15 contained a mutation of C1184A in its 16S rRNA. The location of these mutations in relation to the spectinomycin binding domain was ascertained using a BLAST sequence analysis and homology modeling of the TB 16S rRNA (constructed from the crystal structure of the ribosome with bound spectinomycin). The tuberculosis and 16S rRNAs were found to be highly homologous, being 80% identical in sequence. Moreover, these sequences were found to be 100% identical within the 10 \u212b core area surrounding the spectinomycin binding site, further supporting the use of to map the location of our mutations in relation to spectinamide binding for 16S rRNA.","Mutations at position C1192 or its cross helix partner G1064, within the helix 34, are common sites for spectinomycin resistance in and other organisms. From the primary sequence alignment and structural analysis it was observed that position C1184 in the ribosome is homologous to position C1192 in . See Galimand et al., 44(5), 1365-1366 (2000); and O'Connor and Dahlberg, 45(6), 429-433 (2002). These positions both make equivalent direct H-bonding contact with spectinomycin. Thus the mutation in resulting in an adenine residue at position 1184 removes the H-bonding contact that is vital for stabilizing spectinomycin within the ribosome. Similarly, position C1057 is homologous to the residue C1066 that also stabilizes spectinomycin through H-bonding interaction. A mutation involving C1066U is reported to confer spectinomycin resistance in and , which supports our finding that the equivalent locus (C1057) in confers high-level resistance to 1329 and spectinomycin. See O'Connor and Dahlberg, 45(6), 429-433 (2002). Without being bound to any one theory, that mutational resistance to 1329 maps directly in helix 34 of the 16S rRNA of is believed to be consistent with the reported mode of action for spectinomycin and explains why there is a lack of target mediated cross resistance with streptomycin and other ribosomal inhibitors against . Indeed, mutations within helix 44 (i.e., the binding site for aminoglycosides) are required for resistance to streptomycin. Mutations in the ribosomal protein S12 and\/or within helix 44 do not affect spectinomycin binding to helix 34.","To further probe the macromolecular basis of mycobacterial inhibition by spectinamides, radiolabelling assays for macromolecular protein synthesis were performed on mid-log cells of BCG, using H-Leucine (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences, Piscataway, N.J., United States of America). Within 4 hours after the addition of 1329 or 1445 at 10 times their MICs, protein synthesis was inhibited by 50% or more. See . The control antibiotic streptomycin also inhibited protein synthesis. This appears to indicate that the spectinamides act on their ribosomal target in the bacterial cell to inhibit protein synthesis.","In addition to having enhanced cellular uptake or resistance to efflux mechanisms, it is also plausible that 1329 is more potent than spectinomycin at the ribosomal level. The commercially available cell free S30 coupled transcription\/translation system (Promega, Madison, Wis., United States of America) that measures the production of luciferase enzyme on ribosomes, and has been previously used in quantifying the antibacterial target level activity for ribosomal inhibitor antibiotics, was used to assay the protein synthesis inhibition by spectinomycins. See Murray et al., 42(4), 947-950 (1998). The concentrations of 1329 and spectinomycin that caused a 50% reduction in the synthesis of luciferase were found to be 0.66 \u03bcM and 0.90 \u03bcM respectively. See . These results indicate that 1329 is as potent as spectinomycin at the ribosomal level, but that 1329 is better able to penetrate mycobacteria to reach its ribosomal target.","Using the ICof 1329 as a standard, the relative inhibitory activity of several other compounds was investigated at 0.66 and 6.6 \u03bcM (i.e. 1 and 10 times the ICof 1329). See . The results indicate that the compounds inhibit luciferase protein production on the ribosomes, though at different levels of activity relative to 1329.","Most compounds in the assay were less active than 1329 at 0.66 \u03bcM. Compound 1351 was the next most active. However, 1351 has a MIC value of 25 \u03bcg\/mL, which suggests that this compound has relatively poor permeability and that selective transport into the tuberculosis bacilli plays a major role in the activity of this series. Likewise the 3\u2032-aminoalkyl series compounds 1420, 1422, 1423, 1424 and 1425 all inhibited well in the cell free assay, but have relatively poor anti-tubercular MIC activity compared to 1329, suggesting that they also suffer from poor permeability. Benzamides (1364, 1365, 1370), alkyl substituted compounds (1421, 1369) and the pyrimidine-substituted compound (1439) were less active than 1329 in the protein synthesis assay suggesting that their lower anti-tubercular activity is due to poorer target affinity.","To further compare the target level activities of spectinamides, concentrations that caused 50% reduction (IC) in luciferase synthesis in the transcription\/translation assay were determined for several compounds. As shown in Table 6, the ICs of the compounds varied from 0.12-2.63 \u03bcg\/mL. The compounds 1329, 1443, 1444 and 1445 all exhibited low ICs comparable to spectinomycin and streptomycin, indicating that the uptake of these molecules into bacterial cells is accompanied by potent inhibition of microbial protein synthesis. Compounds 1351 and 1447 also displayed comparably low ICs, but their higher MICs against TB bacilli probably reflect reduced uptake into these cells, as mentioned above. Altogether these results indicate that the presently disclosed spectinamides are highly potent inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0436","num":"0861"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 6"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Concentration of Spectinamides Causing 50% Inhibition"},{"entry":"of Luciferase Biosynthesis in S30 Assay."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Compound","IC(\u03bcg\/mL)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"1299","0.97"]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1329"},{"b":"0.29"}]},{"entry":[{},"1351","0.22"]},{"entry":[{},"1366","15.3"]},{"entry":[{},"1367","1.05"]},{"entry":[{},"1368","1.08"]},{"entry":[{},"1370","0.89"]},{"entry":[{},"1398","0.78"]},{"entry":[{},"1413","1.92"]},{"entry":[{},"1424","0.80"]},{"entry":[{},"1439","2.63"]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1443"},{"b":"0.29"}]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1444"},{"b":"0.12"}]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1445"},{"b":"0.25"}]},{"entry":[{},"1446","0.68"]},{"entry":[{},"1447","0.22"]},{"entry":[{},"1448","2.41"]},{"entry":[{},"1453","1.04"]},{"entry":[{},"1463","6.34"]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1465"},{"b":"0.50"}]},{"entry":[{},{"b":"1466"},{"b":"0.57"}]},{"entry":[{},"1471","0.17"]},{"entry":[{},"Spectinomycin","0.32"]},{"entry":[{},"Streptomycin","0.27"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"1","sub":"50"}]}]}}]}}},"From these results it appears that the structural activity relationship of spectinomycins against and possibly other organisms is mediated by (i) the extent of their cellular uptake to reach their ribosomal drug target and (ii) the ability for molecules to interact with key residues within the spectinomycin binding domain.

Thus, the cytotoxicity of 1329 was assessed against VERO epithelial cells using a well validated colorimetric MTT based cell proliferation. See Hurdle et al., 62(5), 1037-1045 (2008). The mean cytotoxic ICfor spectinomycin, 1329, streptomycin, and ethambutol were 1030, 2182.4, 1536.1, and 731.6, respectively. The therapeutic indices obtained as the ICdivided by the MIC were 41.5, 5456, 7680.5, and 913.8 respectively, which indicates that 1329, like streptomycin and ethambutol, is highly selective for the killing of . The poor index of unmodified spectinomycin reflects its poor activity against TB bacilli. To determine whether lack of cytotoxicity resulted from poor binding to the mammalian ribosomes, compounds were assayed fro ability to inhibit mammalian protein synthesis in Rabbit Reticulocytes (Promega, Madison, Wis., United States of America). The IC, of compounds 1329, 1443, and 1445 were greater than the highest concentration tested (i.e., >512 \u03bcg\/mL). This indicates the compounds are highly selective for bacterial ribosomes as shown in Table 6.","A preliminary pharmacokinetic profile was determined for 1329 (i.e., Lee 1329) using previously described methods. See Budha et al., 10(1), 157-165 (2008); and Budha et al., 15(8), 809-825 (2008).","Following intravenous administration of 10 mg\/kg in rats, 1329 follows a bi-exponential concentration\/time profile with distinct distribution and elimination phases. See . Plasma protein binding of the compound is approximately 30%. 1329 is widely distributed with a steady state volume of distribution of 4.3 L\/kg. It has a mean residence time in the body of approximately 5.3 hours. In vitro experiments using hepatic microsomes suggest that 1329 is metabolically stable with 95% of parent drug remaining intact after 90 min of incubation.","Following intravenous administration in rats, 1329 has a mean systemic clearance of 0.8 L\/hr\/kg. The fraction of dose excreted unchanged by the kidneys is 0.46, with approx. 40% of the dose being eliminated unchanged in the first 6 hours. The excretion ratio (ratio of renal clearance to glomerular filtration rate) of 1329 is 1.7 indicating filtration and active secretion as the net urinary elimination processes. The hepatic extraction ratio of the molecule is 0.13 indicating that 1329 can be classified as a low hepatic extraction drug.","It will be understood that various details of the presently disclosed subject matter may be changed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.
