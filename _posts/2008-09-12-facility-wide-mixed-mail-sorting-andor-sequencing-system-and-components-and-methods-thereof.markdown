Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to a facility wide sorting and sequencing system for improving product processing operations and, more particularly, to a facility wide system and related functionality for simultaneously sorting and sequencing mixed mail pieces such as, for example, flats and letter mail pieces.","2. Background Description","The sorting of mail is a very complex, time consuming task. In general, the sorting of mail is processed through many stages, including front end and back end processes, which sort and sequence the mail in delivery order sequence. These processes can either be manual or automated, depending on the mail sorting facility or the type of mail to be sorted such as packages, flats, letter and the like. A host of other factors may also contribute to the automation of the mail sorting, from budgetary concerns to modernization initiatives to access to appropriate technologies to a host of other factors.","Many form factors of mail pieces make sortation machines difficult to design and easy to jam. That is, mail pieces come in many sizes and shapes. These sizes and shapes create the opportunities for sortation jams. Frequent jamming is a major factor of not being able to operate a sortation operation automatically. However, in a facility wide sortation system, it is necessary to be able to sort millions of mail pieces a day. To accomplish this, mail pieces in a stream must be conveyed at very high rates from many inputs and selectively diverted to one of many outputs.","Currently, most mail processing of flats and letter mail use many passes with different machines to effectively sequence the mail. For example, flats are sorted and sequenced on one type of machine, whereas, letter mail pieces are sorted and sequenced on another type of machine. In fact, due to the different shapes, sizes and other considerations that must be taken into account with each type of mail piece, e.g., flat and letter mail pieces, there is no current machine or facility wide system that can sort, sequence, track and perform other processes simultaneously for each type of mail piece.","As an example, the current method of moving mail pieces is either end-to-end on a belt or in a tub or container. There are many disadvantages in such systems. For example, belts with non-uniform mail pieces of mail cause many opportunities for jamming. Also, belts are physically limited to about 40,000 letters\/hour. Also, the different sizes of mail pieces results in handling flats, letters, and parcels in three separate streams, requires three times as many mail processing machines to maintain and operate. Also, such processes result in many manual operations, e.g., moving mail in tubs from machine to machine, which is labor intensive.","In aspects of the invention, a system comprises a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. As used herein, in all embodiments, articles, objects and\/or products include mail pieces, e.g., flat and letter mail pieces (and small parcels). Similarly, mail pieces, e.g., flat and letter mail pieces (and small parcels), may be articles, products and\/or objects. Accordingly, as disclosed herein, limitations should not be placed on the terminology, either singularly or in the plural, for mail pieces, articles, products and\/or objects. However, distinction should be given to the use of mail pieces as either flats, letters and\/or small parcels. Also, it should be understood that the system and method of the present invention can be used in many different combinations and alternatives and that unless known by those of skill in the art to be exclusively mutual, each embodiment can be practiced alone or any combination thereof","By way of non-limiting examples, the following is a list of acronyms that may be used in the instant application. This list should not be considered exhaustive of all acronyms used herein, and is provided merely for reference and convenience.

The applied radix sequencing\/sorting methodology utilizes a differing number of frame transport tubes in subsequent stages of the applied radix sequencing\/sorting methodology.","In aspects of the invention, a system is provided for performing a sequencing\/sorting process of mail pieces. The system comprises: a tool operable to determine a proper sequence for a batch of the mail pieces using one of an N\u00d7N sequencing\/sorting methodology, an N\u00d7M sequencing\/sorting methodology and an applied radix sequencing\/sorting methodology; and a plurality of right-angle diverts, a plurality of right-angle mergers, and a plurality of frame transport tubes operable to rearrange the batch of the mail pieces into the proper sequence.","The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice.","The invention generally relates to improving product processing operations and, more particularly, to a method and system of sorting and\/or sequencing letter mail, flats and parcels and other objects. The system and method can be implemented in a warehouse, or mail sorting or any type of sorting facility. Implementing the present invention allows for the continuous sorting of mail pieces to any level of sortation using a single pass. To accomplish the advantages of the invention, the system and method uses multiple stages of diverts and merges, e.g., individual mail pieces are diverted into a sortation system composed of multiple stages each with many parallel paths. The mail pieces are merged and combined into sequenced order at the conclusion of sorting. Moreover, in accordance with aspects of the invention, the mail pieces are sorted and\/or sequenced in a stacked configuration, e.g., face-to-face (i.e., not end-to-end), in frames thus resulting in high throughput at low conveyor speeds. The present invention also relates to controls and methods for processing mail pieces throughout a facility and provides a seamless integration of computing functionality, e.g., sorting and sequencing methodologies, controls, etc., as further discussed below. The present invention represents a quantum leap over current mail sortation and sequencing operations.","More specifically, with the present invention, a facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system incorporates the sorting and\/or sequencing of flat mail, letter mail and, in embodiments, small parcels in a one pass stream. In embodiments, flat mail, letter mail and, in embodiments, small parcels, are placed into frames which are transported in a face-to-face orientation, which significantly increases throughput while potentially decreasing the footprint of the facility wide machine. The facility wide system includes input feeders, where mail pieces are singulated, the mail piece address and\/or bar codes are recognized, and the mail pieces are transported individually into the induction and sequencing portions of the system. The input feeders, in embodiments, can be conventional flat and letter feeders which are integrated into the system of the present invention. The system further includes a mail frame induction system, where the mail pieces are matched with a frame, inducted into the frames, and transported and merged into a sequence or certain sort depth using a diverting and merging methodology as discussed in further detail below. Throughout the system, the frames can be managed by controls, e.g., compressed and or expanded, merged, diverted, sorted and\/or sequenced, and shuttled throughout subcomponents in an efficient and cost effective manner. Once the combined mail pieces are in a sequence or a certain sort depth, the mail pieces are extracted from the frames using a mail piece extraction subsystem. Advantageously, the frames and mail pieces can be transported through various stages, e.g., between many different subsystems, using transports such as, for example, shuttles. The shuttles allow the frames and mail pieces to move quickly and efficiently throughout the facility.","Also, the system of the present invention is modular, which allows it to be expanded depending on the needs of a particular facility. The modularity of the system of the present invention also allows the system to be used with current machinery such that sorting and sequencing processes can continue without any significant interruption during the assembly of the facility wide system. Additionally, as discussed in more detail below, the system and method of the present invention includes unique sorting and\/or sequencing schemes, transport systems, e.g., lead screws, right angle diverts, etc., as well as computing functions, storage facilities, and preventive detection of maintenance issues. In addition, the present invention contemplates the use of certain architectures, facility and postal wide schemes, methodologies and systems that result in great savings to the postal system and increased efficiency of sorting and\/or sequencing and floor space.","More particularly, the present invention includes, in addition to other systems, components, etc, a facility wide mail sortation and\/or sequencing system having the following functionality, components, etc. as shown in . It should be noted that  is representative of a general overview of the system and, as such, additional features, capabilities, functions, etc. are contemplated by the present invention as described throughout the instant application.","Input Devices","The input devices are a series (1 to many) of mail piece feeders such as, for example, letter feeders, flat feeders and parcel feeders. These input devices comprise a barcode or address scanner, an algorithm that calculates the output bin associated with the input mail piece, a mechanical interface to convey mail from the output into the facility wide system, and a computing interface to communicate the associated address information to the remaining portions of the system. The bar code sorter may also communicate other information associated with a mail piece including mail image(s), indicia image(s) or characteristics, dimensions, barcodes, weights, sorter identification, and sortation information. More specifically, information that may be received, tracked and communicated throughout the system includes, for example, the following mail piece information from each induction subsystem:\n\n","The Facility Wide Sorting System includes many subsystems such as, for example, mail frame inductors to induct many different types of mail pieces, e.g., letters, flats, small parcels, into frames for transportation throughout the system; right angle diverts and merging points to sort and sequence mail pieces in the frames, shuttles for transporting the frames between subsystems and components, mail frame extractors and controls such as, for example, management systems for controlling the functions of the system, e.g., sorting and sequencing processes. The system further includes inter and intra facility components and networks and related functions and visibilities, as discussed herein. Some systems include, as an example, an identification subsystem that takes input data from the input devices and associates one or more electronic identifier uniquely to each mail piece. These electronic identifiers are used to track mail piece and to associate all related data to the mail piece.","Storage Subsystem","The storage subsystem is capable of storing mail between the receipt of mail to the dispatch of it. The storage system may be modular in nature, to be able to be sized to handle the volume of mail pieces from many different sizes of facilities. The association of a unique identification of the mail determines storage operations with its position in the system.","Input Subsystem","The Input Subsystem includes the Delivery Bar Code Sorters (DBCS) and the Flat Sorter Machines (FSM). In some embodiments, to take advantage of current USPS investments, the system of the invention uses the input sections (including induction stations, singulation, Optical Character recognition, barcode assignment, and facing canceling) of existing sortation systems. The portions of these systems used are the singulation, address\/barcode assigning\/reading\/interpretation of the units.","Frame Inserter","The Frame Inserter places individual mail pieces into frames. It is assumed that mail piece frames will come in many different sizes. The inserter or its computing subsystem will choose the proper size of mail frame and insert the mail inside by using, e.g., optical recognition technology, photodiodes, or other known technologies all of which are capable of being implemented by one of skill in the art. In embodiments, the inserter shall be capable of inserting flat and letter mail at the rate of about 35,000 mail pieces per hour. In embodiments, the inserter can be a rotary inserter. By way of example, the rotary inserters include two pinch belts. As the mail passes between the pinch belts, it will be inserted within the frames as they are automatically expanded about a radius of the frame. (The frames open as they revolve around a carousel.) The rotary inserter, in embodiments, has the capability of about 35,000 insertions per hour. In implementation, it is contemplated that there would be one inserter for every DBCS or every two FSM machines.","Frames","The frames are designed to hold mail pieces. Although many different sizes of frames are contemplated by the present invention, two specific sizes of frames can include one full-height (which can contain any size mail piece) and one half-height that shall convey mail pieces smaller than 6 inches tall. Frames are capable of being measured for minimal thickness necessary for diversion. A frame maximum thickness when stacked empty can be less than 0.1 inch. Also, frames containing mail pieces of less than or equal to 0.1 thickness can store the resulting mail pieces on \u215b inch centers. The frames are also configured and structured to be closed (sealed to prevent mail piece from escaping during sortation and transportation) at the end of insertion operations. In still further embodiments, the frames should be able to be stored in variably spaced storage units (only occupy the thickness of the mail piece). Also, the frames are designed such that they are able to be stored, diverted, retrieved and conveyed during normal truck transportation vibration at full conveyor speed. Also, the frames are conveyed and diverted with only the drive power from the conveyor, e.g., transportation system.","Buffer Subsystem","In certain embodiments, the Buffer Subsystem assures that surges in mail input do not result in overstressing the transport and assures that mail pieces get routed to the proper transport layer.","Transport Subsystem","The Transport Subsystem includes the numerous conveyors that transport the mail frames internally through the system. The transports carry the frames from the inserters throughout the system. In embodiments, the transport can handle about 80,000 mail pieces per hour (or 800,000 per hour for the main trunk). Transports include straight, curved, and ramped conveyors preferably of a lead screw type. The transport, in one embodiment, may be stacked layers.","Storage Subsystem","The Storage Subsystem automatically stores and retrieves mail pieces (in frames). This system can include buffers or storage areas for shuttles, which are designed to hold the frames during transport between different components.","Delivery Container Loader","The Delivery Container Loader packs the mail pieces into Delivery Containers. In embodiments, the loader resembles a conveyor other than the walls are a series of delivery containers. The containers are loaded at the speed of the conveyor. There is a small buffer to allow switching between full and empty containers. In embodiments, the following is noted.\n\n","The System Management Subsystem controls and coordinates all system operations and maintains the identity of all mail pieces and\/or frames. The system management subsystem is the series of computers that control and schedule all system movements, keep track of all mail piece identification by position, interface with human operators, and that interface all information between subsystems. The system management subsystem can include known algorithms to sort\/sequence the mail (in the frames), as well as controls to control the ejection of the mail from the frames, the stacking thereof, etc.","Delivery Container Movement Subsystem","The Delivery Container Movement Subsystem moves the Delivery Containers from the loader to the point of delivery (dock). This system can include specially designed carts that may be nestable as discussed in the instant application.","The system of the present invention should have as small a space footprint as possible. The footprint includes all major components and working areas for personnel associated with the equipment. As such, the components are designed to be located within existing USPS processing and delivery facilities. In addition, it is contemplated that the throughput of the sorting and\/or sequencing is significantly increased compared to conventional systems, e.g., upwards of 80,000 frames or more per hour. Additionally, and advantageously, the system is designed to handle all types of mail, simultaneously, while still using some existing sortation equipment such as, for example, letter, flat and parcel input feeders.","Additional Systems and Components","Although not specifically shown, the system can also include additional components and systems such as, for example, an unpackaging subsystem, Dispatch Packaging system, Receipt Packaging system, and Input Multiplexing subsystem. More specifically, the Unpackaging subsystem removes mail pieces from the standard mail packages and puts the resultant mail into tubs or containers, directly into transportation vehicles, or delivery point packaging. The Dispatch Packaging system packages standard mail packages into containers for shipping to the processing facilities without removing the individual mail piece container. The Dispatch Packaging system also packages standard mail packages into shipping containers, rolling stock or directly into transportation vehicles to other processing facilities without removing the individual mail piece container. The Receipt Packaging system unpacks standard mail packages from shipping containers, rolling stock, or directly for transportation vehicles from other processing facilities without removing the individual mail piece container. The Input Multiplexing subsystem takes mail from many different input devices and delivers them to the many modular storage and sortation subsystems, described herein. This subsystem associates a mail unique identification with its position in the system. Multiplexing operations are determined by this association.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0356","num":"0371"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["100","100","102","105","102"]},"The computing device  includes a processor , a memory , an input\/output (I\/O) interface , and a bus . The bus  provides a communications link between each of the components in the computing device . The communications link may be a wire or wireless link such as, for example, a LAN, WAN, intranet or the Internet. Additionally, the computer system environment  includes a storage system , e.g., database. While only a single storage system  is shown, it should be understood that the computer infrastructure  may include any number of storage systems . Moreover, it should be understood that, in embodiments, the storage system  may include one or more local storage systems implemented throughout the facility wide system and\/or one or more remote storage systems. For example, the one or more storage systems  can be utilized to store information such as, for example, sorting and\/or sequencing schemes, allocation plan, mail piece position within the facility, dock management information, control of different subcomponents, frame and mail piece size, identification and other attribute information, frame manifest, system wide functions, maintenance information, etc, as discussed in further detail below.","The processor  executes computer program code processes on computer storage media, which may be stored in the memory  and\/or storage system .

However, as can be observed, both the letter mail piece flow  and the flat mail piece flow  utilize the same facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system  in accordance with aspects of the invention.","As shown in , with the present invention, the processing of originating non-local collection letter mail  will follow one of two processing paths, depending on whether the automatic face canceling system (AFCS) is an upgraded system. For example, for a site that does not have an upgraded AFCS, e.g., AFCS-200, facing, canceling and image lift, described further herein below, occurs on the AFCS. Separation of mail into local and outgoing is also performed on the AFCS, but, in embodiments, only for online address recognition results. Both the local and outgoing streams run through a primary sort operation on a delivery bar code sorter input\/output subsystem (DIOSS) or combined input\/output subsystem (CIOSS), where remote bar code scanning (RBCS) address results are obtained and the Postnet bar code applied. The local mail output of the DIOSS\/CIOSS will be fed into the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system  in accordance with aspects of the present invention.","For a site that has an upgraded AFCS, e.g., an AFCS-200, (flow shown with the dashed line), the Postnet bar code is applied by the AFCS-200 for online address recognition results. As shown in , local mail whose destination address is resolved on an AFCS-200 can be sent directly to the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system . Moreover, RBCS address results are obtained on a DIOSS\/CIOSS with the local mail output being fed into the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system .","As further shown in , in accordance with aspects of the invention, flat mail pieces are processed following a different flow . After manual canceling and facing, all flats (local and outgoing) collection mail  is inducted directly into the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system . As discussed further herein below, the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system  performs address recognition, applies ID tags, and separates the mail stream into local (or destinating) and outgoing mail. Both mail streams are processed within the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system , with local flats being sequenced with letters to form a local (or destinating) mail output  and outgoing flats being sorted and made ready for the outgoing dispatches .","Thus, as shown in , originating and incoming mail  for letter and flat mail pieces and originating bulk mail for flats (except for the 5-digit cross dock bundles) is inducted into the sorting and\/or sequencing system . Moreover, as shown in  and described further herein below, the present invention will with one pass, sort the mail pieces (including letters and flats) and combine the destinating mail  into a single stream and pack it in delivery containers.

It should be understood that, in embodiments, the predetermined time period is user-configurable. If, at step \u2032, it is determined that the predetermined time period has not expired, the process continues at step \u2032. If, at step \u2032, it is determined that the predetermined time period has expired, the process continues at step \u2032. At step \u2032, the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system triggers an error signal. That is, as described above, some time may be required for the system to process the mail piece and determine and associate mail piece attribute data to a particular mail piece. However, if this information has not been received in the storage system after expiration of the predetermined time period, there may be some error with respect to that mail piece. Thus, in accordance with aspects of the invention, an alarm signal is issued to indicate that data still does not exist in the storage system for the particular mail piece. Moreover, in embodiments, the particular mail piece may be buffered to wait further processing (e.g., video coding and\/or other manual interventions). Subsequent to triggering an alarm signal at step \u2032, the process proceeds to step \u2032.","The present invention provides for the incorporation of automatic culling, facing, and canceling operations into a facility wide flats and letters sorting and\/or sequencing system. Although many individual machines currently exist to perform these functions (or a subset of these functions) as a stand alone or independent operation, there is none incorporated into a facility wide flats and letters sortation and\/or sequencing system.","The Letter Facer Canceller systems are a series (0 to many) of Letter Facer Canceller systems may be composed of a system that faces the mail, cancels the stamp, an address scanner, a barcode printer, a mechanical interface to convey mail from the output into the facility wide sortation system, and an electrical interface to communicate the associated address information to other components of the facility wide system in accordance with the invention. The Letter Facer Canceller may deliver some mail in a conventional manner (to a single output bin or bins) and some mail to the facility wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. The Letter Facer Canceller may also communicate other information associated with a mail piece including mail image(s), indicia image(s) or characteristics, dimensions, barcodes, weights, sorter identification, and sortation information in accordance with aspects of the invention to other subsystems of the facility wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","Exemplary machines for performing the automatic culling, facing and canceling functions are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication 2004\/0073532, entitled, \u201cMail Processing Apparatus\u201d, by Shimizu, and assigned to NEC Corporation, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,235,791, entitled \u201cImage Inputting Device\u201d, by Watanabe et al., and also assigned to NEC Corporation. These references are incorporated by reference in their entireties herein. While the current machines may be capable of performing their automatic culling, facing and canceling functions, the current machines perform these functions independently of the other activities occurring in the facility. Accordingly, if there is a malfunction in the current machines or if there is alternatively a malfunction in the other systems within the facility, there is a possibility that the automatic culling, facing and canceling functions could adversely affect the entire operation of the facility by processing too few flats and letters (malfunction in the automatic culling, facing and canceling machinery), or by processing too many flats and letters (malfunction in the other facility systems) resulting in an inconvenient accumulation of canceled products that require storage. For example, if there is a jam in the automatic culling, facing and canceling machinery, the jam could substantially disrupt the throughput of the entire facility.","Referring now to , a block diagram illustrates the relationship between an automatic culling, facing and canceling (\u201cACFC\u201d) system , an induction system , and a sequencing system . (The ACFC is also known as an automatic facer canceler system (AFCS).) The ACFC system  is at the front end of facility operations and is configured to include:\n\n","There is an interface between the ACFC system  and the sequencing system , and it is implemented as described above in the overview. In embodiments, two or more ACFC systems can be implemented by the present invention. The second or more of the ACFC systems can be redundant back up systems for performing the culling, facing and canceling functions when a monitoring unit indicates that the units are not functioning normally.","Once the incoming mail pieces or products have been culled, faced and canceled by the ACFC system , the mail pieces are sent to the induction system , for inserting into frames as described in another section of the instant application. The canceled mail pieces that are successfully inducted are input to the sequencing system . The sequencing system  monitors the throughput of the ACFC system  with a monitoring unit . It should be understood by those of skill in the art that the monitoring unit  may be a standalone system or incorporated into the sequencing system or any of its subsystems such as, for example, frame inserters, frame extractors, buffers, etc. If there are any malfunctions in the ACFC system , the monitoring unit generates a warning signal and the sequencing system  takes appropriate remedial measures. For example, the sequencing system  is capable of taking remedial measures such as activating backup ACFC systems  or slowing down other facility operations.","The present invention is directed to a system which provides transportable storage facilities that allow expansion of facilities into external areas, such as parking lots. The present invention also provides the ability to expand facilities without the need for building additional structures, as well as easing the transition to the sorting and\/or sequencing system into a working processing and distribution center.","A facility-wide letters and flats sorting and\/or sequencing machine requires mail to be sequenced and stored prior to dispatch. This requires storage space for the mail for an entire day. In a modern Processing and Distribution Center (P & DC), this could mean storage in excess of five million mail pieces. To generate the maximum return on investment, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing machine of the present invention is preferably space neutral. In other words, the facility-wide machine as contemplated by the present invention preferably does not take up more space than the current manual and semiautomatic processes current in use by the postal facility or other sorting operations. While it is feasible that a single machine could be designed space neutral, the challenge comes when the new facility-wide machine is delivered, and the existing facility must be converted to the new facility-wide machine.","During the time of the transition, existing facilities should continue to process the mail. This means that there is no tolerance for the facility to be completely emptied of its existing machines and then to have the new facility-wide machine installed on the premises. To accomplish this objective, the present invention provides a mechanism of delivering the mail and still allowing new capability to be added to the processing system. This can be accomplished by providing a storage facility or sorting capability external to the existing facility. Since the storage capability in the facility-wide sequencing is the most floor space consuming operation, it is the most cost effective subsystem to locate external to the building.","In embodiments, the additional capability required during converting or \u201ctransitioning\u201d to the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system of the present invention is added through the use of portable storage and main trunk transport units positioned outside the P&DC structure. These portable storage and main trunk transport units can be provided in the P&DC parking lot and connected together to the existing facility, as disused herein. This gives the capability to convert at lowest cost plus giving the capability to add future additional surge capability to any facility as necessary.","Further, in addition to the actual transition time period and period of surges, this capability to sort and store external to the facility such as, for example, within semi-trailers, or packaging this capability into a shipping container, could be used to reduce or eliminate sorting\/sequencing\/storage within a P&DC or could easily be located at a delivery unit, such as a post office, or even be used to deliver the mail to a facility. For example, the sorting and storage could occur while in the portable storage and main trunk transport units, e.g., shipping container. This can occur while the shipping container is stationary or while moving or traveling, i.e., \u201cen route\u201d. Shipping containers naturally may be used as a stand alone unit, typically called temporary trailers, or they can be transported by truck, as in a semi-trailer, or even on a train. This allows much functionality as to where mail sorting and storage of mail pieces occur. In embodiments, each portable storage and main trunk transport unit would be totally automatic and would be unmanned. In addition, they would be built to withstand vibration and temperature extremes, so they could perform sorting operations while moving.","In embodiments, the portable storage and main trunk transport units includes several aisles and levels to move mail pieces in frames or clamps. The frames can be transported to different levels and different storage units using lead screws and right angle diverts. In embodiments, each portable storage and main trunk transport unit includes the following features, as discussed throughout the present disclosure.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0408","num":"0441"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","320","300"]},"The shipping container storage units  are all designed to be able to withstand the elements of the outside environment. The elements which prevent vibration may include dampers shown at reference numeral  and\/or rugged construction that can withstand the vibration during moving, and to sort while transporting. The system may also include encapsulated circuitry to protect the controls from the moisture, vibration, and temperature extremes. This encapsulated circuitry may be embodied in the computing infrastructure of , and may include the encapsulation as discussed in more detail with reference to the S.M.A.R.T. card of the instant application. In embodiments, the computing infrastructure of  may be remote from the shipping container storage units  and communication may be provided over a wireless network such as, for example, WiFi, etc.","The shipping container storage units  may include semi-trailers that are configured to be connected to a tractor, a truck, or a train. Accordingly, storing and sorting may occur within the shipping container storage unit  while the shipping container storage unit  is stationary or while it is moving. Each shipping container storage unit  is configured to be completely automatic, e.g., to be operated remotely, is constructed to withstand vibration and withstand temperature extremes (e.g., provided with insulation).","Still referring to , the shipping container storage unit  includes a plurality of parallel storage aisles  for sorting and\/or sequencing operations as should understood in view of other sections of the instant invention. In embodiments, the mail pieces are conveyed to each of the storage aisles  by a conveyor aisle . The conveyor aisle  includes a conveyance system, such as lead screws SL and right angle diverts RAD to move the mail pieces between the conveyor aisle  and bin locations in each storage aisle . The conveyor aisle  can also include compression and\/or decompression zones as discussed in the instant application. The storage aisles can be configured to hold the frames in a certain order for sequencing thereof as discussed in the instant invention.","As shown in , the shipping container storage unit  includes one or more input\/output port . The input\/output port  provides access from the exterior to the interior of the shipping container storage unit . Accordingly, the input\/output port  provides the link or connection between the shipping container storage unit  and the P&DC, or the link or connection to another shipping container storage unit . The link or connection may include a conveying device, such as a conveyor belt, lead screws, conveyor belts with cogs, segmented screws, a shuttle docking station or conventional transports. Alternatively, the mail pieces may be moved between the P&DC and the shipping container storage unit  manually or via trucks. In such a case, the P&DC and the shipping container storage unit  are linked by the manual movement of the mail pieces or by the trucks.","The input\/output port  is connected to the inside induction system and more specifically to the conveying aisle  and\/or an elevator . This allows the mail pieces to enter and exit from the shipping container storage unit . In embodiments, the input\/output port  may be connected between two or more of the shipping container storage units. Accordingly, mail pieces can be manipulated inside the P&DC or another shipping container storage unit and then transported outside to another of the shipping container storage unit and manipulated therein. Also, the mail pieces can be transported back into the P&DC or another shipping container storage unit for remaining operations.","Additionally, as shown in , the shipping container storage unit  includes a plurality of vertically stacked storage aisles . In one contemplated embodiment, an eight foot tall shipping container storage unit  will accommodate four layers of storage aisles ; although other amounts of layers are contemplated by the present invention. Further, each layer includes a conveyor aisle  that extends in a direction transverse to the storage aisles  and along the length of the shipping container storage unit . Mail pieces can be conveyed along the conveyor aisles  and stored in the storage aisles  on any of the levels.  also shows the elevator  that raises and lowers the mail pieces between the layers of storage aisles  and conveyor aisles .","It should be recognized by those of skill in the art that the shipping container storage unit  should not be limiting to a system for storing and sequencing of mail pieces, but may be implemented for any subsystem of the present invention. For example, it is contemplated that the shipping container storage unit  can be used for the induction and\/or extraction of mail pieces into frames or any other subsystem as the P&DC facility is being dismantled and reassembled with the sorting and\/or sequencing machine of the present invention. Illustratively, in the case that the sequencing and storage system is already installed in the facility, it is possible to have the induction of the mail pieces into frames provided in the shipping container storage unit . Once the frames are filled, they may be sent to the facility for sorting and\/or sequencing operations. After the sequencing operations, the frames may be transported to the same or another of the shipping container storage unit  for extraction of the mail pieces. Any of the other processes described in the instant application are also contemplated for use in the shipping container storage unit .","Accordingly, the present invention provides a system in which the mail is processed while installing the new system. The system includes portable units including a trailer or a shell located in the parking lot during installation, so as not to be disruptive to the working system. Accordingly, the present invention provides both storage and a working subsystem of the new system, with no significant periods where the mail center is not processing mail. As such, in order to ensure that there is no significant interruption in the mail processing three options can be utilized for transitioning into the system of the present invention: gradual changeover, annex processing, and portable processing as recapped below.","Gradual Changeover","This strategy involves replacing input machines with the capabilities of the system of the present invention and phasing in delivery routes to the present invention until the entire P&DC has implemented the system of the present invention. Although the present system may rely on current sortation machines and storage areas to be replaced with buffers, transport conveyors, and storage units, the system of the present invention is designed to be space neutral. In this way, a partial system can occupy more space than the machine it replaces. Also to phase in output to specific delivery routes to be incorporated into a growing system, additional sortation may be required.","Annex Processing","Annex processing is used in addition to the gradual changeover. This strategy uses an Annex area that is temporarily built (or leased) to maintain a base of system capability to allow enough capability to gradually replace current P&DC processing machines. The Annex may either be a temporary of permanent facility for processing the mail pieces during a change over.","Portable Processing","This concept is again in addition to gradual changeover. In this case, additional capability is added through the use of portable storage and transport units positioned outside the P&DC structure (e.g., P&DC parking lot) and connected together. This gives the capability to transition at lowest cost plus giving the capability to add future additional surge capability to any plant as necessary.","Conventionally, the network architecture in a USPS processing and distribution center is segmented into two networks: (1) the Facility network (which is tied to the Postal wide area network (WAN)) to which everyone in the postal service accesses; and (2) the Mail Processing Equipment (MPE) local area network (MPE LAN), which maintenance employees may access, e.g., maintain a MPE. This segmentation is done to accomplish two goals: (1) to prevent normal users on the Postal WAN from attaching to and controlling a MPE and (2) to prevent someone maintaining MPE from accessing the Postal WAN. In this way, the USPS carefully controls who has access to the MPE LAN, for example, typically only providing modem access for remote access to a MPE for troubleshooting purposes.","With a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system in accordance with the present invention, there are many large subsystems that should communicate simultaneously on a network. For example, a single sequencer may need to process five million mail pieces per day, through twenty feeding stations, and many different sequencing, storage, insertion, extraction and transportation systems. Additionally, each feeder provides high resolution images of each mail piece to subsystem in order to perform address recognition tasks. Also, the transportation, storage, sequencing, insertion and extraction systems use frame identifiers, e.g., bar code, in order to correlate to the mail piece therein and the sequencing plan. Each of these subsystem add to the network congestion. Thus, all motion, data collection, etc. should be coordinated by a system management function; however, such coordination communication also creates much network traffic.","According to an aspect of the invention, to facilitate communication, a discrete communication network or local LAN may be established between some of the individual subsystems for exchanging, for example, high-use data between the individual subsystems. Moreover, a plurality of these discrete networks or local LANs may be established for different groups of the individual subsystems. That is, the system may provide a number of discrete networks between a plurality of subsystems that, for example, share a large amount of data, to prevent too much communication data for a single network, which connects all of the subsystems. This allows for islands of isolation to be created within the facility-wide system to minimize dependence upon, for example, other subsystems or components, and to reduce network congestion on the network that connects all of the subsystems. That is, as discussed further below, in addition to the discrete networks or local LANs, all of the subsystems are connected to one another and the system management subsystem via another network or system management LAN. However, by providing the discrete networks, network traffic on the system management LAN connecting all of the subsystems and the system management subsystem can be reduced.","In embodiments, the above-described discrete networks or local LANs, also allow a remote user access to the system (or many different subsystems), e.g., for troubleshooting or maintenance. That is, according to a further aspect of the invention, in addition to above-described discrete networks or local LANs, a system management network is provided to facilitate communication between all the subsystems and also to allow a remote user to access the system, including all the subsystems, for, e.g., troubleshooting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0424","num":"0457"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["405","405","415","420","405","420","405","410"]},"Moreover, according to an aspect of the invention, high-use data is routed on the local LANs  (indicated by the dashed lines) that are specifically set up between high-use subsystems (for example, those subsystems for address recognition). Thus, as shown in , for example, a local LAN  is provided between subsystem  and subsystem  and another local LAN  is provided between subsystem  and subsystem . The local LANs provide communication paths between the high-use subsystems, thereby alleviating network congestion on other communication paths, e.g., the system management LAN .","Thus, for example, using the above-described system management LAN and local LAN arrangement, one subsystem, e.g., an optical character recognition (OCR) scanner, may be on a separate local LAN  with a series of recognition subsystems. This allows the OCR scanner and other recognition subsystems to communicate between each other on the local LAN . Additionally, the subsystem, e.g., the OCR scanner, may provide status information on the mail, e.g., mail piece dimensions, to the central system, e.g., the system management subsystem , to determine, e.g., an appropriate frame size for the mail piece via the system management LAN .","Moreover, as shown in , the control and communication of the system and the subsystems of the present invention may be arranged in a hierarchical fashion, wherein a top tier level (e.g., the system management subsystem ) forwards commands to lower tiers (e.g., the subsystems ). Additionally, the routing and control is provided within the system itself.","The invention relates to a system and method for providing centralized address recognition in a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. The invention also provides a system and method for associating video coding returns with mail pieces and frame and\/or clamp identification in a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. In embodiments, the centralized address recognition system utilizes a centralized address recognition sub-system which communicates and\/or interfaces with each of a facing canceling sub-system, a mail piece feeding sub-system, a flats feeding sub-system, and a parcel feeding sub-system.","The ability to recognize addresses is important to all mail sorting and sequencing operations. In typical mail processing systems, video coding is performed such that addresses are read by photographing a face of the mail piece (i.e., the face of the envelop) at one or more machines and locations. For example, addresses can be read at an:\n\n","An onboard \u201crecognition\u201d engine will resolve a high percentage of addresses (e.g., around 90%); however, about 10% of addresses which are not resolved need to be forwarded to a bank of video terminals that allow operators to resolve the addresses. This is done by a laborious process of keying addresses after viewing the photographs. Since operators along with the required queuing of information and awaiting results takes a considerable amount of time (typically more than the buffer of any current sorting machine), the mail pieces that require address recognition are typically identified with a bar code. In subsequent sorting operations (e.g., performed after the video coding takes place), the bar code can be looked up in a table and the results then placed on the mail pieces.","In a facility wide sequencing system, mail pieces that are not recognized with \u201con-board\u201d recognition can also be forwarded to manual video coding stations. But in a facility wide system, sorting occurs typically with very little delay and therefore the mail pieces may need to be assigned to a buffer. There are costs associated with having mail pieces stacked up in a buffer, however. As a result, it can be cost effective to put in another layer of machine recognition at the full system level in an attempt to recognize the addresses. This can be accomplished by use of known algorithms for system level recognition.","Presently, some address recognition algorithms are not present on individual machines or sub systems due to their proprietary nature, especially for the recognition engines in the input feeder subsystems (which are very expensive to update). Furthermore, keeping all input feeders and other sub systems (each with different architectures and interfaces) up to date with the same recognition algorithms and ensuring the availability of the input processing power necessary to simultaneously perform multiple algorithms on an individual feeder and other sub systems can be costly. As a result, it is advantageous to have a centralized recognition capability as a subsystem to the facility wide sorting system, itself.","In implementations, using current sorting approaches, identification codes are placed on individual mail pieces. Subsequent sorting operations, which usually take place on different sorting machines and\/or subassemblies, read the barcode and look up the address assignment by the barcode on the mail piece, if necessary. However, with a facility wide sortation system, the mail piece is not always available to scan and, therefore, a barcode will identify the individual frames and\/or clamps that contain the mail piece. The mail piece can then be sorted and sequenced by associating the bar code with the mail piece address. When video encoding is required, the mail piece information can be updated by updating the information about the mail piece. Of course, the mail piece information is associated with the frames and\/or clamps identifier to be effective. Thus, the ability to associate mail piece information with the frames and\/or clamps identification (ID) and to use a mail piece recognized result is an advantage of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0434","num":"0471"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1A"],"b":["500","501","502","503","504","501","502","503","504","505","505","501","502","503","504","505"]},"In particular, the system  includes one or more facing canceling sub-systems .

In embodiments, a system management server is provided that receives data from a number of sources that are both internal and external to a mail processing and distribution center (P&DC). Based upon the data, the system management server generates assignments for handling all of the mail within the P&DC, in real time. The assignments may be related to, for example, dock receipt of the mail, scheduled movement of mail within the P&DC, storage of mail at locations in the P&DC, processing of the mail in a facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system, and dispatch of the mail from the P&DC. By continuously updating the various handling assignments as new data is received, the system management server provides a dynamic material management system for a P&DC.","In a typical processing and distribution center (P&DC), mail arrives all day long. However, because of the method in which the mail is sorted, most mail processing occurs in the late evening or early morning. This conventional mail processing profile is not caused by the truck arrival schedule, but by the underlying sorting algorithm. This is due to the fact that in conventional P&DC sort methodologies, a local mail piece is sorted approximately three times (e.g., goes through three passes) to sort to the delivery point sequence, DPS (e.g., delivery address). In such multi-pass systems, the entire first pass is completed before the second pass begins. Since the first pass is typically not completed until late evening, most of the processing occurs in the late evening and early morning. This creates the need for many more machines and operators than would be necessary if mail was more evenly processed all day long.","Moreover, in a conventional P&DC, there is a large amount of manual movement of objects throughout the sorting process. For example, as depicted in , mail objects arrive at a conventional P&DC  at a dock receipt  (e.g., loading dock). The mail objects may include letters, flats, parcels, etc., and typically arrive in bulk, such as, for example, on pallets, in bundles, etc. From the dock receipt , the mail objects are manually moved via material movement  to a staging area . The material movement  may be a forklift that moves a pallet of mail, and the staging area  typically comprises an assigned space where the pallet is temporarily stored before it is processed.","Still referring to the conventional P&DC  in , mail objects are moved from the staging area  to one of many different types of processing machines for sorting the mail. For example, parcels may be delivered to an Automated Package Processing System (APPS) , flats to a Flats Sorting Sequencer (FSS) , as are known such that further explanation is not believed necessary. Other mail may be delivered to a preparation area  where, for example, strapping and shrink wrap are removed. From the preparation area, bundles of mail are manually moved (e.g., via bundle movement ) to other mail handling equipment (MHE), mail processing equipment (MPE), or to the FSS . After sorting of the different types of mail on the different machines, different types of that could not be sorted are hand-cased and output from the P&DC  at dock dispatch . Included in the conventional sorting arrangement shown in  are numerous manual movements of mail (e.g., material movements  and bundle movements ).","In contrast to the conventional sorting arrangement shown in , the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system of the present invention uses a different sorting algorithm and a different sorting paradigm as described in the instant application. In embodiments, due to the different paradigm the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system comprises a comprehensive system that accepts different types of mail (e.g., letters, flats, etc.), sequences the different types of mail together, and outputs a single stream of sequenced mail. In this manner, much of the manual handling of mail (e.g., bundle movement and hand casing described above with respect to ) is eliminated.","More specifically, in accordance with aspects of the invention, mail arrives at a P&DC all day long and may be temporarily stored or input into a facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system as it arrives. In embodiments, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system sorts the mail and stores it until it is discharged at dispatch, which allows more judicious use of resources and eliminates the need for many feeders and operators. The facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system has different types of feeders to input the various types of mail (e.g., letters and flats). Additionally, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system includes plural ones of the different types of feeders for capacity and redundancy. In implementations, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system typically operates twenty hours a day and stores all the mail internally until the time of dispatch. In this manner, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system is an automated machine that automatically processes and sequences the mail internally to the machine, whereby the sequencing algorithm is independent of when the mail arrives. This allows mail to be input into the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system anytime within the service window, and eliminates the need to complete a first pass before beginning a second pass, as with the conventional multi-pass systems.","As the inventive facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system is highly automated, scheduling functions within the system allow a supervisor to schedule input of mail into feeders based on the availability of the feeders and personnel to operate the feeders, which allows mail to be more evenly processed all day long. Due to such automation, implementations of the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system typically utilize less operators and feeders, resulting in less peak mail processing power than a conventional P&DC. Thus, in the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system, there is an increased emphasis on forecasting the arrival of mail at the P&DC, efficiently and precisely handling the mail within the P&DC prior to induction into the feeders, and scheduling the input of mail into the feeders.","Accordingly, in embodiments of the invention, there is provided a material management system that operates to, among other things, obtain data from sources external to the P&DC, obtain data from sources internal to the P&DC, and generate material receipt, storage, movement, and dispatch schedules for material in the P&DC in real time. The material management system may include features of the Dock Management System (DMS) disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2006\/0271234, published Nov. 30, 2006, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The material management system is a system and method that integrates various systems to provide an overview of existing containerized mail including but not limited to pallets, trays, tubs, and rolling stock, expected containerized mail, and sortation equipment capacity and predicted throughput in a facility such as a P&DC. The material management system comprises a server that utilizes existing databases to efficiently identify staging area assignments, schedule internal material deliveries, automatically calculate internal plant routing of materials, notify when internal delivery commitments cannot be met, and incorporate internal delivery verification. This information can then be used to perform numerous tasks such as, for example, storing, tracking, and managing pallets on the dock and throughout the sortation process, predicting workload, generating and monitoring sortation schedules. Additionally, the material management system automatically provides staging assignments for incoming pallets, provides staging areas within the existing facility footprint, schedules and tracks pallets from the dock to the point of consumption, assists in scheduling and tracking of sorting operations, alerts personnel when priorities and schedules cannot be met, and generates alternate processing recommendations in the event of exception conditions such as sortation system failures and pallet cancellation.","In further embodiments, the material management system also takes into account data from external sources such as, for example, global positioning system (GPS) and data from other facilities, while applying the methodology to a facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. For example, as depicted in , a P&DC  utilizes the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system comprises a system management server (SMS) . The system management server  may be the same as the system manager described in other parts of the instant application. In embodiments, the system management server  may be implemented in the computer infrastructure shown in . In further embodiments, the system management server  comprises appropriate programming to provide some or all of the functions of a DMS server (referred to as element \u201c10\u201d in U.S. Pub. No. 2006\/0271234), or may be communicatively connected to a DMS server, to perform the processes described herein. For example, the system management server  may be programmed with logic and business rules that provide handling assignments (e.g., receipt, movement, storage, processing, and dispatch) for all of the mail in the P&DC  in real time based upon data from sources internal and external to the P&DC .","According to aspects of the invention, the system management server  receives or obtains data regarding incoming mail from at least one external data source including, but not limited to: incoming trucks , a surface visibility database , another P&DC , and a presort house, warehouse or other facility . The system management server  also receives updates from sources internal to the P&DC , including, but not limited to: available pallet storage space within the facility, anticipated future incoming pallets, characteristics of the pallet, time needed to process the pallet, schedules of other pallets, deadline for processing the pallet, operational status of components of the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system machines (e.g., input feeders) needed to process the pallet, sort plan of the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system, etc.","Based upon the data from both the internal and the external source(s), the system management server  generates assignments and schedules for handling mail within the P&DC . For example, the system management server  may generate handling assignments including, but not limited to: where and when to receive mail (e.g., pallets) at dock receipt , where and when to move pallets to the staging area , where and when to move pallets to the preparation area , where and when to move pallets to the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system , where and when to dispatch sequenced mail from the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  to dock dispatch , and what personnel will be utilized to perform such tasks.","As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, the system management server  dynamically updates the handling assignments for all of the mail within the P&DC  based upon updates received from the internal and\/or external data sources. For example, the act of assigning a pallet to a particular storage location may affect the management and handling of other pallets of the facility. Put another way, when the system management server  assigns a pallet to a location, then that location is no longer available for other pallets. This new data (e.g., one less storage location) may affect the results of subsequent operations of staging assignment, scheduling assignment. As another example, if a pallet is moved from location \u201cA\u201d in the staging area  to location \u201cB\u201d in a preparation area , then the system management server  can ascertain that there is now an open storage location at area \u201cA\u201d and may determine that an anticipated incoming pallet may be placed in this location upon receipt of that incoming pallet at the dock .","As an example of data received from an external source, a presort house  may transmit data to the system management server  that a shipment of eight thousand periodicals will be delivered to the P&DC  at noon on the next working day. With this data, and based upon already known data of what loading docks will be in use at the expected delivery time, the system management server  may generate an assignment to receive the shipment at a particular loading dock, at a particular time, and with particular personnel assigned to the task. Additionally, based upon other data parameters (e.g., due date of the periodicals, availability of storage space within the P&DC , availability of input feeders of the facility wide sorting system, etc.), the system management server  may generate a movement schedule for the periodicals throughout the P&DC . This schedule may include, for example, the schedule to place the periodicals in frames by use of frame inserters, etc.","In another example of external data, the system management server  may receive data from another P&DC , which is sending mail to the P&DC . Particularly, a centralized processor in a facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system at the other P&DC  records information of every mail piece in its facility wide sorting and\/of sequencing system. The information may include, for example: address information, size weight, and even position in the system. This information is stored in internal databases, reported to postal mail tracking applications, and is available to other authorized systems and users in accordance with the invention. At the other P&DC , outgoing mail is input into the system and subsequently output to waiting trucks. As soon as the mail is processed, the information may be recorded to databases. The estimated time of arrival from the other P&DC  to the receiving P&DC  may be calculated from the daily truck arrival schedule and historical transportation data. This information, amongst other information such as, for example, the type of mail, the sort depth of the mail, etc., is then forwarded to the system management server  of the receiving P&DC , which may use this information to update its own handling assignments (e.g., receipt, movement, storage, processing, and dispatch) of mail within the P&DC .","In another example, GPS data associated with incoming trucks  may be utilized by the system management server . Particularly, when the system management server  receives or obtains data from any one of a surface visibility database , another P&DC , and a presort house , the data may include an indication of a shipment of incoming mail on an incoming truck . More specifically, the data may include, but is not limited to: a unique identifier of the incoming truck , pallet characteristics (e.g., type of mail, class of mail, due dates, sort depth of the mail, etc.), and expected delivery date and time. Furthermore, the incoming truck  may be equipped with a GPS system that gives a real-time location of the truck. The system management server  may receive the GPS data, transmitted from either the truck  or the GPS service provider. By monitoring the GPS-based location of the incoming truck  in real time, the system management server  may periodically refine its estimation of when the incoming truck  will arrive at the loading dock. Accordingly, the system management server  may use this updated arrival time (e.g., based upon the GPS data) to update its handling assignments (e.g., receipt, movement, storage, processing, and dispatch) for all of the mail in the P&DC  in real time.","As another example, based upon real-time updated data (from both internal and external sources), the system management server  may verify that a previously assigned receiving dock at dock receipt  is available for an incoming truck , or may assign a different receiving dock to the incoming truck . The updated receiving dock assignment may be transmitted to the incoming truck  (or the driver told when the incoming truck  arrives). Additionally, based upon the totality of the data, the system management server  may schedule dock personnel to unload the incoming truck , and notify the scheduled personnel via computer  and\/or PDA .","Moreover, data from external sources (e.g., GPS data from an incoming truck  or an outgoing truck ) may be used by the system management server  in scheduling the processing of mail in the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system and dispatch of mail from the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. For example, based upon data that loading dock space is not available at dock dispatch , or if outgoing trucks  are not available to receive dispatched mail, the system management server  may instruct the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  to delay dispatching mail from the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system until such dock dispatch  and outgoing trucks  are available. As mail can be temporarily stored in the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system, the system management server  may be programmed to delay dispatch until just before dock dispatch  and outgoing trucks  are available.","In another example, the system management server  may delay dispatch from the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  to await inclusion of mail that is inbound on an incoming truck . In embodiments, the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  performs one dispatch per day. Also, as a general rule, first class mail is processed by a P&DC on the day it is received. The system management server  may be programmed to delay dispatch by a predefined amount of time if GPS data associated with an inbound truck  carrying first class mail indicates that the first class mail will arrive within a predetermined acceptable amount of time. The system management server  may also be provided with logic that determines (e.g., based upon GPS data of an inbound truck ), that the first class mail on incoming truck  will arrive too late for inclusion in the current sequencing of the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system . Accordingly, the system management server  would allow the dispatch to occur at the scheduled time, and alert a supervisor that the incoming first class mail needs special handling upon arrival.","In an even further example, the system management server  updates handling assignments for mail within the P&DC  based upon operation status of the processing machinery. For example, if the system management server  ascertains from internal data that a first input feeder of the facility-wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  is operating at maximum capacity or even behind schedule by a certain amount of time, then the system management server  may dictate that no more pallets be moved to that first input feeder until the backlog is cleared, or that pallets be routed to other input feeders that can handle the workload.","Thus, according to aspects of the invention, information from internal and external sources is received by the system management server  at the local P&DC  and is used to update material handling operations in the P&DC  and the planning for processing within the facility wide sequencing machine. In embodiments, the system management server  updates the handling assignments (e.g., receipt, movement, storage, processing, and dispatch) for all of the mail in the P&DC  in real time when updated data is received. Although particular data may be associated with a subset of mail, the data may have an effect on the handling assignments (e.g., receipt, movement, storage, processing, and dispatch) for potentially all of the mail within the P&DC . In this manner, the system management server  provides a comprehensive material management system for facilities that utilize a facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system.","In addition to coordination input (receipt) operations from other P&DCs, dispatch operations can be coordinated with incoming trucks delivering mail to local delivery unit (post offices). For example, if trucks arrive late and the mail is dispatched from the system, the result is a need for a staging area until the truck does arrive and the need to transport the mail from the staging area to the actual dock. This extra effort could be reduced by having truck arrivals automatically estimated by GPS. Therefore the mail could remain in the system until right before the truck arrives. If any manual processing is required due to trucks arriving late, this labor can be automatically scheduled and coordinated through the system. The system also can communicate directly with the delivery unit to help with individual scheduling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0463","num":"0500"},"figref":["FIG. 6C","FIG. 6B"],"b":["660","625","660","643","645","643","645","625"]},"In the example shown in , the interface  shows detailed tracking information for a tray in the P&DC . For example, when an operator inputs the tray ID number  using a PDA , the PDA  transmits the tray ID to the system management server , which accesses stored data associated with the tray ID. The system management server  transmits the stored data to the PDA, where the data is displayed via interface .","More specifically, the interface  shows details of the particular tray, such as: tray ID number ; date and time the tray was input into the system ; origination of the mail in the tray ; type of mail ; weight of mail in the tray ; type of tray ; quantity of mail pieces in the tray ; current location of tray in the facility ; and history of locations in the facility . The information shown in interface  is merely exemplary, and any suitable information may be displayed in accordance with aspects of the invention.","In addition to coordinating facility operations, inter-facility communication can also facilitate mail processing. In conventional system, the first time a mail piece is input into the system a bar code is assigned to the mail piece. It takes far fewer resources to recognize a barcode than to recognize a written address. Therefore, even today, address information (e.g., the ZIP code) is shared between facilities so an address recognized at one facility can be looked up by barcode at another facility. However, a facility wide sorting machine assigns individual mail pieces to individual containers (e.g., folders, frames, etc.). In the individual containers, the mail piece bar code may not be present. Therefore the individual containers have identifiers associated with them. Because of the individual container identifiers, it may not be necessary to track mail pieces by a \u201csprayed\u201d on barcode on the letter itself. Instead, the mail piece may be tracked through its association with the container, and such information may be shared between respective system management server  at respective facilities for planning purposes.","Modular Partitioning and Expansion of a Facility-Wide Mail Sorting and\/or Sequencing System","The present invention relates to a modular partitioning and expansion system. More specifically, the invention relates to a mail processing system that has a modular design. In this regard, the modular design allows the mail processing system to easily conform to the size of a particular mail processing facility. That is, the system of the invention is modular in nature, so that it may be sized appropriately for the unique mail handling capacity requirements, and size limitations of a particular facility. Sizing for a facility starts with a base module, and adds additional expansion modules to meet the capacity requirements and size limitations.","In embodiments, the modular design may include a base module and one or more expansion module(s). The base module, as well as any of the expansion modules, can include subsystems of the sorting and\/or sequencing system discussed in the instant application. These subsystems can be, for example, feeders, sorters, sequencers, conveying or transporting mechanisms such as lead screw modules, storage systems, buffers, induction units, frame inserters, frame extractors, etc. The expansion modules can include any combination of these subsystems in order to increase efficiency of the unique facility. For example, the addition of an expansion module serves to increase a quantity of mail that the system can process daily. It can include all capacity-limited subsystems and functions (such as sequencing and storage), but without the need for the management systems, as this is provided with the base module.","In one illustrative example, the expansion module might increase daily mail handling capacity by 500,000 mail pieces. Therefore, the capacity of a system of the present invention with one base module and one expansion module would be 1 million mail pieces. Similarly, the capacity of the system with one base module and three expansion modules would be 2 million mail pieces. Many expansion modules can be added to a base model, depending on the required scaling.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0470","num":"0507"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7C","FIG. 7A"],"b":["700","700","700","700","700","700","700","700"],"i":["a ","n","a ","n ","n ","a ","a ","n "]},"The base module and expansion module(s) are physically very similar, and designed to be easily integrated together to function as a single system. Therefore the system of the present invention is an easily scalable system. Sizing the system of the present invention to a particular facility requires very little design work. Also, after initial installation, capacity of the system of the present invention could be increased (or decreased) with relative ease (through the addition or removal of expansion modules) by a plug and play system.","The base module and expansion module may include any and all of the subsystems of the present invention which are required to process mail. These systems may include, for example, feeders, cancellers, frame inserters and mail extractors, transport mechanism, buffers, accumulators, split mail induction devices, split pathway induction unit, docking stations, storage areas, compression and decompression zones, etc. The feeder may include devices such as scanners, sensors, OCRs, printers, BCRs, photo eyes, cameras, and thickness detection mechanisms to identify, monitor, track, and assist in directing mail pieces. However, although possible, it is not necessary that the expansion module(s) include all of the subsystems of the base module ","The base module may also include a system manager SMGR, which can be implemented in the computing infrastructure shown in . Also, the base module may include a frame management FMGT and shuttle (e.g., any suitable type of cart for managing transportation of frames) management SMGT. The frame management FMGT and shuttle management SMGT may be implemented in the computing infrastructure of . In embodiments, the frame management FMGT and shuttle management SMGT will manage the movement of the frames and shuttles throughout the entire system, knowing the location of the frames and shuttles with respect to other systems and other frames and shuttles. This can be accomplished by use of RFID sensors, photodiodes or other known sensors, for example, placed throughout the system. For the frames, this can also be accomplished by use of encoders placed on the transport systems, which would maintain track and control of the frames as they are sorted, sequenced and\/or stored, for example. As the base module includes the frame management FMGT and shuttle management SMGT, it may not be necessary to provide such systems on the expansion module(s) . Additionally, frame inspectors may be provided in the base module and expansion modules to inspect frames for signs of degradation in order to remove frames from the system prior to failure. This may be implemented as a camera system (which detects fatigue cracks), vibration sensors (which detects vibrations above a threshold that may be indicative of a crack or other degradation of the frame), etc.","Further, the base module may include a storage manager which may be implemented with the system manager SMGR or as a separate unit. The storage manager manages the storage of mail pieces contained in frames that are awaiting final sorting\/sequencing and dispatch. In this regard, it is possible to provide the storage manager in both the base module and expansion module(s) ; although as this function is preferably implemented in the computing infrastructure it is contemplated that only the base module would require this feature. As such, when an expansion module is plugged into the base module , the functionality of the storage manager can automatically detect the base module and provide its functionality to the base module ","In embodiments, the expansion module(s) may be designed for a plug-and-play operation. For example, adding an expansion module(s) to the base module may be automated such that the system manager SMGR automatically (and immediately) recognizes when an expansion module(s) has been plugged in and added to the system. Thus, the system manager SMGR provided with the base module would be fully capable of managing the systems of the newly-added expansion module(s) (similar to the FMGT and SMGT).","Additionally, as shown in , each of the base module and the expansion module(s) may include an input segment ISGT for introducing mail pieces into the mail processing system, a processing segment PSGT for processing the mail pieces, and an output segment OSGT which receives processed mail from the processing segment PSGT. In this regard, the input segment ISGT may include, e.g., an induction feeder IFDR, mail induction MI, and frame inserter FITR subsystems, as well as a presort accumulator PACC which may serve as a buffer for mail entering a processing segment PSGT. The processing segment PSGT may include, e.g., a sequencer subsystem SQ which sequences the mail. The output segment OSGT may include, e.g., storage segments STSUB for storing the mail pieces.","In further detail, the presort accumulators PACC of the base module and expansion module(s) may also perform an initial separation of mail pieces contained in frames and load the frames into shuttles for transport. Similarly, the sequencers of the base module and expansion module(s) may perform several sorting and\/or sequencing steps including (but not limited to) sorting\/pre-sequencing, initial sequencing, and post sequencing.","Additionally, each of the base module and expansion module(s) may include a container loader that extracts mail pieces from frames and loads containers for dispatch. Further, both the base module and expansion module(s) may include a container dispatcher that transports containers filled with sorted\/sequenced mail pieces within the mail center.","Further, the base module and\/or expansion module(s) may include a transport subsystem TSUB (e.g., a multiplexer or transport controller) to transport mail pieces between different subsystems of the base module and expansion module(s), as well as transport mail pieces to other expansion module(s). Additionally, the base module and\/or expansion modules may also include a container dispatch for receiving sorted and sequenced mail. The base module and expansion module(s) may be interconnected by a transport subsystem TSUB. Additionally, multiplexing may be accomplished by the transport subsystem TSUB. In this regard, mail intended for a particular destination (e.g., ZIP code) may be transported to a corresponding area (e.g., branch) of the mail processing system.","Facility-wide processing of mail in a single system has not previously been accomplished. This solution for facility-wide mail processing is better than a single standardized system design because it allows sizing of the system to the unique space constraints and mail processing capacity requirements of each postal facility. This solution is better than designing a customized system for each facility in that it requires minimal unique design work on a site-by-site basis. Also, it has the additional advantage of being easily scalable after initial installation. This allows flexibility in the event of changing mail flow trends.","Also, the base module and expansion module(s) of the modular subsystem of the present invention may include any number of the subsystems, in any desirable combination. It is also easy to integrate the modules together as they are plug and play compatible. Therefore the system can be easily scaled to a wide range of capacities e.g., 500,000 to millions of mail pieces. The addition of an expansion module also includes all capacity-limited subsystems and functions (such as sequencing and storage), but does not require functions that do not have a capacity limit. (These functions are already included in the base module, so the base module will perform these functions for the entire system.)","Redundancy of Parallel Independent Segments, Subsystems, and Components to Improve Reliability","The invention relates to a system and method of improving the overall reliability and availability of a large, facility-wide machine that sorts and sequences letters and flats mail. This improvement is accomplished by configuring the facility-wide mail processing system as a network of parallel, independent branches, at multiple levels. A parallel configuration has at least two significant advantages. Firstly, when configured in independent, parallel branches, a single point failure in one branch will not affect the other branches. Secondly, being configured in parallel allows the addition of extra parallel branches. For example, if 10 parallel branches are required to be operating at any given time, it is possible to include an 11branch in the design. Therefore it is possible to have any one of the 11 branches offline, and still have the required 10 branches operating. This allows for a cyclic rotation. For example, with the example of 11 parallel branches, operational wear would be evenly distributed across all 11 branches by rotating out one of the branches (for maintenance) during processing. Furthermore, this allows for earlier detection of a fault in any one branch than might occur if a redundant branch were left idle for days or weeks. These advantages of parallel systems can be used to increase the overall availability of the system and can be integrated into the modular design of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0483","num":"0520"},"figref":["FIG. 7D","FIG. 7D","FIG. 7C","FIG. 7C"]},"For example, as shown in , each branch BR of the mail processing system (i.e., the branches of the base and expansion module(s)) may include components from a base module and expansion module arranged in parallel with components of other branches. Accordingly, if any one of the parallel components of the branches BR are not in operation (e.g., due to maintenance) the other branches BR may continue to operate and take over the processing capabilities for the inoperable component. In this regard, the overall availability of a large, facility-wide machine that sorts and sequences letters and flats mail is improved. In particular, the improvement may be accomplished by configuring the facility-wide mail processing system as a network of parallel, independent branches BR, at multiple levels.","As an illustrative example, a segment level SL may include arranging the same type of components (segments) of the base module or the expansion module in parallel. For example, in the segment level SL, three input segments, processing segments and\/or output segments can be arranged in parallel. In this configuration, if any of these segments fail in a branch, another of the segments of a different branch can compensate for such inoperability; that is, a parallel branch BR of the mail processing system having an inoperable segment will not significantly affect operation of the other segments and processing of the mail pieces. In fact, when more than the required segments are provided, an inoperable segment will have no affect on the throughput of the system, as this inoperable segment can simply be cycled out for maintenance. This, of course, increases the availability and efficiency of the overall system. It should be understood by those of skill in the art that more or less than three segments and types of segments can be provided in the segment level, and that these segments should not be considered a limiting feature of the present invention.","In another example, similar in concept to above, a subsystem level SUBL may include arranging subsystems (e.g., the mail induction systems) in parallel. In this illustrative example, each subsystem level SUBL includes two subsystems such as, for example, a buffer or presort accumulator that can be arranged in parallel. In this configuration, if any of these subsystems fail in a branch, another of the subsystems of a different branch can compensate for such inoperability; that is, a parallel branch BR of the mail processing system having an inoperable subsystem will not significantly affect operation of the other subsystems and processing of the mail pieces. In fact, when more than the required subsystems are provided, an inoperable subsystem will have no affect on the throughput of the system, as this inoperable subsystem can simply be cycled out for maintenance. This, of course, increases the reliability and efficiency of the overall system. It should be understood by those of skill in the art that more than two subsystems can be provided in the subsystem level SUBL, and that these subsystems should not be considered a limiting feature of the present invention.","Still referring to , a component level CL may include arranging components such as transporting systems, e.g., lead screws (for conveying mail pieces) in parallel. In this illustrative example, each component level CL includes three components such as, for example, a sensor, OCR, lead screw, etc. that be arranged in parallel. As shown in , for example, the components may be a container induction station CIS, that allows empty containers and container labels to be received into the mail processing system. In this configuration, if any of these components fail in a branch, another of the components of a different branch can compensate for such inoperability; that is, a parallel branch BR of the mail processing system having an inoperable component will not significantly affect operation of the other components and processing of the mail pieces. In fact, when more than the required components are provided, an inoperable component will have no affect on the throughput of the system, as this inoperable component can simply be cycled out for maintenance. This, of course, increases the availability and efficiency of the overall system. It should be understood by those of skill in the art that more or less than three components can be provided in the component level CL, and that these components should not be considered a limiting feature of the present invention.","In this regard, a parallel configuration has many significant advantages. Firstly, the parallel branches BR of the present invention are configured to process mail independently of each other. For example, if (for any reason) a presort accumulator PACC provided in one path of the mail processing system is inoperable (e.g., due to mechanical breakage or routine downtime of one of the branches), the other branches BR are still fully capable of processing mail. That is, as the mail processing system can be arranged in parallel it is possible to provide a plurality of independently operational branches BR. In regard to the mail processing system of the present invention being arranged in parallel at the component level CL, by way of non-limiting example, the components of the container induction station CIS, that allows empty containers and container labels to be received into the mail processing system, may also be arranged in parallel and independent of each other.","Secondly, arranging the branches BRs in parallel allows that addition of parallel branches BRs, e.g., in order to increase the mail processing capacity of the mail processing system. For example, if a particular mail processing facility requires ten parallel branches BRs in operation at any given time (i.e., in order to meet the particular mail processing facility mail processing requirement), an additional parallel branch BR (i.e., eleven parallel branches in total) may be included in the mail processing system design. Therefore, it is possible to have any one of a number of the branches BRs off-line and still meet mail processing requirements of a particular facility. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that each additional branch BR added to the mail processing system increases the reliability and availability of the mail processing system.","Thirdly, the mail processing system of the present invention allows for all of the parallel branches BRs to be rotated in and out of service at any particular time. For example, routine maintenance may be performed on any number of the parallel branches BRs while the remaining parallel branches BRs process mail. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary and uneven wear on the mail processing system, branches BRs can be rotated routinely from in-service and out-of-service states while still meeting the mail processing requirements of a particular facility. In other words, operational wear can be evenly distributed across all of the parallel branches BRs of the mail processing system.","Further, it should be appreciated, that any of the subsystems not specifically mentioned in this portion of the detailed description, may also form part of the modular design of the mail processing system and be arranged in parallel. That is, so that independent branches are capable or operating when other branches BRs of the mail processing system are not in service.","The invention provides a central management system to monitor facility-wide mail processing machines. In current processing and distribution centers (P&DCs), the United States Postal Service (USPS) mandates the use of a proprietary interface. However, this proprietary interface creates several problems. For example, there are several problems with the architecture including: (1) the underlying transport of the USPS specification does not easily permit sharing of information between facilities (especially, for example, facilities on disparate networks and behind firewalls); (2) the proprietary interface does not easily permit forwarding, aggregating, and\/or processing of information in a hierarchical fashion; (3) there is no smart translator on the mail processing equipment (MPE) or mail handling equipment (MHE) that can be updated to extract new data from existing data streams and databases (and thus, vendor equipment should be updated with each new request for data); (4) the proprietary interface does not address system and network management (currently there are a number of commercial products cobbled together to perform these tasks); and (5) the proprietary interface does not address system wide configuration and update of MPE.","Moreover, these problems are compounded when being used with a facility-wide machine that has many subsystems and components that store information in a hierarchal nature. That is, for example, data may be stored in a hierarchal nature where it makes most sense, depending on, for example, where the data is generated and where (and how often) the data is used. With a current approach, for example, all mail piece information is forwarded to a data warehouse when the data itself may be infrequently queried.","Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention, another interface may be used, which is much more extensible than the proprietary USPS interface. In embodiments, the interface uses web services and a service oriented architecture as a basis, which can utilize commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) based business rules engines in hierarchical control and data aggregation centers and COTS based interface modules that reside on the MPE. According to an aspect of the invention, this infrastructure allows for the centralized control and management of one or more of remote and system management functions and equipment specific processing functions, from disparate mail processing machines (e.g., different devices from, e.g., different manufacturers). The infrastructure, e.g., interface, can be implemented in the computer infrastructure of . Moreover, the present invention allows for data to be stored once, aggregated, where necessary, and queried in the most efficient manner. Additionally, implementing the present invention reduces network bandwidth while maintaining the ability to make fast queries to the data. Also a facility-wide sortation and or sequencing machine may easily obtain data from other sites for scheduling purposes.","Remote and System Management","The remote and system management functions may include:\n\n","Equipment specific processing functions may include:\n\n","According to an aspect of the invention, the centralized system uses as its backbone a Service Oriented Architecture. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a software architecture where functionality is grouped around business processes and packaged as interoperable services. SOA also describes IT infrastructure which allows different applications to exchange data with one another as they participate in business processes. The aim is a loose coupling of services with operating systems, programming languages and other technologies which underlie applications. SOA separates functions into distinct units, or services, which are made accessible over a network in order that they can be combined and reused in the production of business applications. These services communicate with each other by passing data from one service to another, or by coordinating an activity between two or more services. SOA concepts are often seen as built upon, and evolving from older concepts of distributed computing and modular programming. In accordance with aspects of the invention, the SOA architecture may be provided in the computer infrastructure of .","In embodiments, a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) of the present invention has the following characteristics:\n\n","Furthermore, XML tags of a service oriented architecture facilitate easy grouping, searching, and\/or aggregation of data of the raw data stream (e.g., permitting easy aggregation, filtering, and\/or forwarding of data for a hierarchical management structure) and easy storage to databases.","In addition, this same interface could be used for mail piece image and data dissemination for video coding purposes. For example, using either SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME), or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) or another method of encapsulating binary data into a SOAP message, mail piece images may be routed on the same hierarchy. According to an aspect of the invention, this would allow video coders (personnel that manually key in address information from a mail piece, typically because the address could not be recognized by an automatic recognition software program) to be positioned anywhere that has a network connection, e.g., a high speed connection to the Internet. Moreover, web services can forward any video or results through firewalls, and be encrypted to even use the Internet as a network, which is facilitated by the easy encryption offered for SOAP messages.

The MPE interface module  is responsible for the communications, security, connectivity, and control of the messages. The actual implementation of the MPE interface module  includes a business rule engine  that is operable to control the routing of messages to internal plug-in modules. In embodiments, these plug-in modules may be implemented in a dynamic link library (DLL). In this exemplary implementation, requests may be received from a control center  and routed to the business rule engine . In embodiments, the business rule engine  may be implemented, for example, in custom software or with a COTS Business Rule Engine with scripting to control individual message routing. COTS Business Rule Engines typically also include the communication and security functions to communicate over a web service interface (shown in the SOA communication module  in ).","As shown in , the business rule engine  routes the message to the appropriate internal software module. Since the standard USPS MPE interface is the P&DC Interoperability Specification interface (based on ISO 9506 and IEC 61850 international standards), one of the interface module types would facilitate this standard USPS MPE interface which, in embodiments, would communicate to all legacy systems. However, as discussed above, the current USPS interoperability standard is unsatisfactory for inter-facility communication, especially through firewalls and in a hierarchical architecture.","The MPE  also has subsystems which would also communicate with the control center  over the same architecture. That is, communication may occur using the same software modules hosted on the control center  and subsystem controllers. In embodiments, these software modules, for example, may be implemented in Service Oriented Architecture themselves and be based on web services, or they may be software (e.g., agents, plug in DLLs, applications, services, Demons, routines, etc.) that run on the actual MPE, on other computers for the purpose of interfacing between disparate threat scanning machine, and a centralized command and control center . Additionally, in embodiments, these interface module functionalities could also be hard-coded within the MPE interface modules  themselves.","In embodiments, there are two types of interface software modules: a translator module  and a functional module . The translator module  is responsible for interfacing translating data from the control center  to a source of data within the MPE . In embodiments, the translator module  may include interfaces to:\n\n","The functional module  is responsible for capturing, transmitting, commanding, or otherwise communicating to the MPE  (through an MPE interface module ) in relation to a task or a group of tasks. Examples of responsibilities of the functional modules  include:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0509","num":"0613"},"figref":"FIG. 8D","b":"804"},"According to an aspect of the invention, control center geographic location is not important as long as there is an Internet connection  to the network (or a connection to a Wide Area Network ) due to the ability for the Service Oriented Architecture to pass messages to the individual MPE interfaces . This Service Oriented Architecture allows the system to be dynamically configurable. For example, if an MPE is not able to process the load or for any reason fails, another control center  (or another MPE) can be configured to pick up the load.","In embodiments, messages to and from the MPE  and control centers  may be composed of XML and composed of Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) format messages. Before encryption, these messages are human readable and self-descriptive, thus providing messages that are easy to troubleshoot. Moreover, these messages do not have message translation problems between different operating systems and memory storage formats (as is the case with many binary messaging implementations). Furthermore, the XML tags and available Document Object Model (DOM) processing algorithms allow easy filtering and aggregation of message data.","The architecture of the present invention incorporates XML web services to communicate to and from the MPE . These messages may use hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to communicate, although the invention contemplates that other transport methods, for example, e-mail or HTTPS may be used with the present invention. This protocol can be routed through firewalls . This allows encrypted information to be routed to and from any site with Internet access. Thus, near real-time two-way communications between MPE\/MHE  and the control center  may be achieved, for example, through the use of polling and\/or true asynchronous communication.","According to a further aspect of the invention, a Service Oriented Architecture allows commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software business engines to implement the basic message routing, tracking, authentication, message delivery, and associated business rules, e.g., allowing developers to concentrate on the business object logic. Business engines also use open source scripting languages and web service objects, allowing multiple sourcing. According to an aspect of the invention, new functionality can easily be added later as stand-alone objects with just simple changes to the scripting. Moreover, system administrators may distribute only the new business objects and scripts, thus eliminating the expensive re-compile and re-release cycle of an entire application, traditionally associated with custom software. In addition, new services can be discovered with Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) and integrated without human configuration.","As shown in , the control center architecture consists of a business logic rules and SOA messaging module  and includes a number of software modules. In embodiments, the software modules include an address recognition image logic module  for transmitting address recognition images, an MPE status and control module , and a maintenance server module .

For example, the workflow manager  may be aware of which central address recognition nodes  have spare capacity and may, e.g., assign a mail piece to a particular address recognition node for address recognition. Moreover, the workflow manager  may provide particular address recognition node with, e.g., fifty-five seconds to determine the address of the mail piece. If the fifty-five seconds expire without the particular address recognition node determining an address for the mail piece, the workflow manager  is operable to reassign the mail piece address recognition task to a local video coding machine via the local video coding interface .","Further, as shown in , the local video coding interface  and central address recognition nodes  are both in communication with an address database .

Since these messages are already in Internet-ready format, the messages can be forwarded to, for example, many distributed video coders (making their efforts virtually independent of location). Thus, it is possible to take advantage of video coders in disparate places, such as, for example, within many different USPS facilities, distributed locations (such as video coders operating from their homes) or even the ability to take advantage of cheaper labor from foreign labor pools.

The frames can be filled with mail pieces of different sizes, shapes and types, such as, for example, flats and letters. The present invention is also directed to a method of controlling and coordinating the movement of a high volume of mail pieces held within individual frames through the system for efficient sorting and\/or sequencing. The present invention also provides related mechanisms to sense, monitor, and control, e.g., divert, high volumes of individual frames independently of other frames along a given conveyance path within the conveyance system. The system of the present invention provides advantages over known systems in that it is now possible to sort and\/or sequence different types of object types or mail pieces, i.e., letters, flats, parcels, etc. effectively and efficiently in a single facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","In embodiments, conveyance mechanisms are configured to transport the frames through the system at a canted angle of about 45 degrees (with relation to the stream of travel) and in a front-to-back orientation (as compared to a lengthwise orientation). This orientation allows for a dense and efficient way to transport the frames in volume, and allows the frames to efficiently be diverted along different paths, e.g., at right angles, without slowing the speed of transport. Also, as the mail pieces are in a front-to-back orientation, more mail pieces can be carried on the conveyance mechanism in less amount of floor space, in a faster manner than conventional lengthwise conveyances. That is, angling the frames at 45 degrees allows for more efficient transporting and diverting of the frames in less space from one conveyance path to another. The conveyance mechanisms may be, but are not limited to, lead screw mechanisms, tooth belt mechanisms, pinch belt mechanisms, individual roller mechanisms, chain mechanisms or any combination of the different conveyance mechanisms.","In various embodiments, as described below, mail pieces in frames are sorted and sequenced using right angle diverts (RADs), merges, compression zones, decompression zones, and shuttles. For example, RADs split a stream of frames into different streams, e.g., at right angles, by diverting individual frames. Due to the 45 degree angle orientation of the frames through the system, RADs can divert the frames without stopping either stream by sliding them from between adjacent frames. Merges merge two streams of frames into a single stream, again using RADS. Again, due to the 45 degree orientation angle, two streams of frames can be merged without stoppage. Compression zones remove gaps from between frames within a stream and decompression zones insert gaps between frames within a stream. When individual handling of frames is not required, frames are moved as batches contained in shuttles. After mail pieces have been sorted and sequenced, they are extracted from the frames and inserted into trays for delivery. The process of extracting mail pieces from frames is referred to as \u201cextraction\u201d.","In embodiments, the conveyance mechanisms transport the frames forward, backward, up, down, or divert the frames from one conveyance path to another provided throughout the sorting and\/or sequencing system. In an aspect of the present invention, the conveyance mechanisms also allow the frames to be compressed or decompressed for more efficient movement of sorted (and\/or sequenced) frames through the sorting and sequencing system. More specifically, e.g., the compression zone mechanisms are structured to compress frames closer together as they move throughout the system, thereby increasing overall usable space on the conveyance mechanisms.","In embodiments, movement (e.g., diversion and compression) of the frames is controlled by a control unit (i.e., also known as a Frame Routing Agent) which coordinates the movements of individual frames using real-time location notifications from a plurality of sensors communicating with the control unit. In other words, best-path routing of the frames through the sorting and sequencing system is determined by a series of request and response messages between the plurality of sensors and the control unit monitoring each individual frame as discussed in the instant invention.","Based on the foregoing, the present invention provides a conveyance system for efficiently and reliably transporting a high volume of individual frames carrying mail pieces through a sorting and\/or sequencing system in less space. It is also contemplated that the present invention may be implemented in any type of postal service or company mail center that needs to presort, sort or sequence mail pieces.","Right Angle Diverts","In sorting millions of mail pieces a day, mail pieces are conveyed at high rates from many inputs (e.g., a conveyance path) and may be selectively diverted to one of many outputs (e.g., branched conveyance paths). Effective diversion (i.e., re-routing) of an individual frame (carrying a mail piece) from one conveyance path to another, as provided by the present invention, does not affect the position or velocity of a neighboring frame on either conveyance path, does not require space on the path (in addition to its own dimensions), and does not require either conveyance path to slow or stop the frames to accomplish the diversion.","In this regard, . C generally show various right angle diverts along the conveyance system in accordance with aspects of the present invention. For example, as shown in , initially frames having a leading edge and a trailing edge are conveyed along the (linear) conveyance path \u201cA\u201d at a 45 degree angle with respect to direction of travel. In the example of , the initial conveyance path is conveyance path \u201cB\u201d. Referring specifically to , at a point of diversion (where the input conveyance path \u201cA\u201d converges with conveyance path \u201cB\u201d, e.g., at a location where the frame intersect with an output conveyance path \u201cB\u201d), the frame's forward motion is redirected at a right angle down the output conveyance path \u201cB\u201d starting at its trailing edge.","In the example of , interestingly, the frames can be diverted from conveyance path \u201cB\u201d to either of conveyance path \u201cA\u201d or \u201cC\u201d, depending on the sorting scheme. In the example of , interestingly, the frames can be diverted from conveyance path \u201cA\u201d to either of conveyance path \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC\u201d, depending on the sorting scheme. In both of the examples of , the frames will remain in a 45 degree angle when transported to a conveyance path that is at a right angle; whereas, the frames will be reoriented onto the output conveyance paths when they are not at a right angle. However, in any scenario, the frames will remain in a front-to-back orientation. That is, the frames (and their respective mail pieces) are oriented such that the front of one mail piece is laterally stacked (at the 45 degree angle) next to the back of a neighboring mail piece, thereby enabling mail pieces to easily move from one conveyance path to another.","In any of the embodiments shown in , the frame transitions from the input conveyance path to the output conveyance path without slowing conveyance path speed and without disturbing any adjacent frames. That is, the frames can be merged into streams and removed from streams at full transport speed, without interruption to the processing. In embodiments to accomplish this advantage, forward motion of the leading edge of the frame stops at the point of diversion and the trailing edge of the frame initiates the diversion to the output conveyance path (i.e., the trailing edge becomes the leading edge down the diversion pathway).","Additionally, the following is contemplated by the present invention:\n\n","Diverts may be implemented in a variety of machines within the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. For example, diverts may form the basis for a mail stream multiplexer as shown in . In particular, the multiplexer is located between sections of large sorting and\/or sequencing machines which are capable of routing mail pieces (frames) from one of many input conveyance paths to one of many output conveyance paths. The multiplexer may, for example, route mail pieces to paths that will process, store, package, unpackage, and deliver the mail pieces to their appropriate destinations within the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","By way of further example, diverts may also be implemented in a mail sorter and\/or sequencer, itself. As shown in , frames can be streamed through an input conveyance path in an un-sequenced order and divided into a plurality of divert paths (or \u201csections\u201d) corresponding to the number of diverts associated with the sequencer (e.g., nine diverts). As the frames are streamed to the different divert sections, a sorting process can begin. For example, in the example of , each frame is designated with a number from 1 to 9, as there are nine different diverts. Numbers 1-9 also represent the order of each mail piece in the group of nine. These incoming unsequenced mail pieces are diverted into the sorting \u201caisles\u201d based on that sequence number. The sequence number only refers to the position within that group of 9 (and does not have any relation to the position of letters in other groups). In this example, all mail frames designated with \u201c1\u201d will be diverted to the first divert, all mail pieces designated with a \u201c2\u201d will be diverted to a second divert, and so on. In this way, each divert will handle a certain designated mail frame. As the frames are diverted to the outgoing transport, they are placed in a numerical order, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This numerical order can be a first sorting of the mail pieces. In this way, the frames (mail pieces) can begin the process in a random order and end a first segment of the process in a numerical order indicative of a first level type sort. The sequence itself, as should be understood by those of skill in the art, may be a configurable algorithm that corresponds to a mail piece destination, a delivery sequence, a mail carrier preference, or other criteria. It should be noted that the numbers in  show a mail sequence of mail pieces relative to other mail pieces in the same \u201csection\u2019 for illustrative purposes. For example, a number 5 mail piece in one \u201csection\u201d of mail has no relationship to the sequence of a number 5 mail piece in another \u201csection\u201d of mail.","It should further be noted that each mail piece includes a designated sequencing number and each frame transport \u201cFT\u201d includes a frame transport number. As shown, as each individual mail piece arrives at its designated frame transport \u201cFT\u201d, the RAD diverts the mail piece into the designated frame transport \u201cFT\u201d.","As further shown in , the mail pieces travel along their respective frame transports \u201cFT\u201d (also referred to as frame transport tubes) are merged via a respective RAD (not labeled) onto the outgoing path or main branch. Moreover, as can be observed in , upon being diverted to the main branch, the mail pieces are in a sequenced order with relation to one another. This may be considered a first stage of sorting and\/or sequencing. For example, mail pieces are numbered 1-9, which is representative of nine diverts (frame transports FT). In embodiments, these numbers do not represent mail addresses, ZIP codes, etc. but are numbers relating to the number of transports FT. Each respective numbered mail piece will be diverted to its respective frame transport FT, e.g., mail pieces numbered 1 will be transported to a transport , etc. As the mail pieces exit each of the frame transports FT, they will be placed in a sequence, e.g., 1-9 for further processing. So, in the example shown in  there are a plurality of groups of mail pieces in a sequence 1-9.","Similarly, diverts may further be implemented in cascading sections of a mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.  illustrates how smaller batches of mail pieces which are themselves in relative sequenced order may be grouped together to form larger batches of sequenced mail pieces, in accordance with aspects of the present invention. In this exemplary embodiment, upon being merged, the mail pieces are within groups of nine, as there were nine frame transport tubes in the first stage of sequencing.","As further shown in , the output of the first stage is cascaded to a second stage. In the second stage of the sequencing\/sorting, the mail pieces are diverted via RADs (not labeled) into respective frame transports. It should be noted that the numbers on the mail pieces in the second stage reflect the second stage group ordering. Additionally, it should be noted that with this exemplary embodiment, upon being merged, the mail pieces are within groups of ninety, as there were nine frame transports in the first stage of sequencing and ten frame transport tubes in the second stage of sequencing. It should be appreciated that the output of the second stage can be cascaded to a third stage, etc. As such, additional stages and frame transports may be added to sequence any size group of mail pieces. Thus, with this exemplary embodiment, the third stage can be an intermediate or a final stage. Moreover, in embodiments, as each frame transport in sequenced order in a final stage the output may be retrieved at full conveyor speed.","More particularly,  shows frames being diverted from a main branch MB into different divert sections DS. From these divert sections, the frames can then be further diverted into a second main branch MBand thereafter into additional divert sections DS. Although only two main branches and divert sections are shown, those of skill in the art will realize that more than two cascading sections are contemplated by the present invention. In this example, the main branch MB includes some frames that may have been sequenced to a certain depth with relation to other mail pieces in the group. The frames are diverted to the diverts DS and, depending on the sorting algorithm, are diverted in a certain order to the main branch MB. Positions on an output conveyance path, e.g., main branch MB, that mail pieces will occupy after sequencing are shown with dashed lines. Thereafter, the frames are diverted into the diverts DSin a certain order based on the sorting algorithm. This cascading process can continue until all of the mail pieces with a frame are sorted to a certain depth or sequenced. As such, the bottom of the figure representatively shows a snapshot of on-going sequencing operations.","As should be recognized, the input stream brings in a continual stream of mail pieces. For the sortation to work, the conveyor does not have to slow down or stop but just continually sort the mail. For this sortation, it does not matter about the sequence of future or past mail pieces; just the mail pieces in the group. Therefore, there is no need to know the destination of every mail piece before sorting can begin (as with current \u201cn-pass\u201d sorting used by the USPS). All the sorting requires knowing is the order within the group. However, it should be recognized that using the ZIP code, it is possible to use a sort scheme or plan to always determine the order of a group of mail pieces. Second, all mail pieces are sequenced in relation to all other mail pieces. So another sorting stage is introduced with reference to , for example. In this stage the sequence groups are each diverted to a separate tray. For illustration purposes, 10 sort trays are used for this sorter. As should be understood, mail pieces are diverted out in sequence, e.g., groups of 90 mail pieces in sequence order. Additional stages can be added to have any group size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0558","num":"0750"},"figref":["FIG. 9G","FIGS. 9A-9E"],"b":["900","900","901","901","903","903","903","903","903","903"],"i":["a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b "]},"It should also be understood by those of skill in the art that the module  is configurable; that is, the modules are designed in such a way that the two or more modules can be interconnected to one another at the docking stations, for example, or at any of the conveyance paths . This makes the system flexible for enlarging or minimizing the processing capabilities of the system by simply adding or subtracting modules from the system. Also, it should be understood by those of skill in the art that any of the conveyance paths may also be eliminated or added, depending on the particular application. For example, the middle conveyance path can be eliminated or an additional middle conveyance path can be added to the system. As such, it is contemplated that the module provided in  may be reconfigured to accomplish any necessary filtering of mail pieces required by being expanded, multiplied, reduced, or otherwise reconfigured so as to accommodate the various needs of a given sorting and\/or sequencing system. The module  also forms the basis for various machines including, but not limited to, multiplexers, sequencers, induction units, and presort accumulators.","More particularly,  shows various conveyance paths and diversion options of a frame conveyed through the module of , from an entrance to an exit. In embodiments, at the point of any diversion, the trailing edge of the frame (in the input conveyance path) will direct the frame to the divert direction. That is, the frame will be diverted into an alternative path by its trailing edge. In an active divert area, frames may either be diverted or they may bypass the point of diversion to continue along the input conveyance path to some subsequent output conveyance path (depending on the specified algorithm controlling movement of the frames). Frames may also be merged with other frames as they are diverted.","By way of illustration, at induction, the frame can perform an active left angle divert or a passive left angle divert. More specifically, the frame can be actively diverted leftward at divert area DA. This is an active divert because the frame has the option of traveling in a straight path. Alternatively, the frame can be passively diverted leftward at divert area DA. This is a passive divert, as the frame must be diverted at this position.","Taking the flow path from the active divert area DA, the frame can travel to either divert area DAor divert area DA. At divert area DA, the frame can be actively diverted rightward and then passively diverted left at divert area DA. At this left angle divert, the frames are merged in the conveyance path with frames that were passively diverted at divert area DA. In a merge, the input conveyance path runs into an output conveyance path carrying a plurality of frames and extending in perpendicular to the direction of the input conveyance path. Again, there is an active divert because the frame has the option of traveling in a straight path. The frames from divert area DAand divert area DAwould then merge at divert area DAwith frames passively diverted at DAto the exit.","Taking the flow path from divert area DA, the frame can be passively diverted through right angle divert at divert area DAto the exit. Similar to the diverting process at divert area DA, the frames are merged in the conveyance path with frames that were passively diverted at divert area DA.","As thus described, utilizing diverts allows mail to be continuously processed to various locations throughout the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system without compromising the speed of the conveyance system. Diverting of the mail pieces improves sorting, sequencing, and storing mail pieces for delivery to predetermined destinations. Processing of mail pieces is further enhanced because slot spaces for frames need not be fixed (e.g., during a merge) for a given diverted mail piece. That is, since the overall system knows the thickness and monitors the position of the mail pieces at all times, only the space necessary for the mail piece may be reserved for increased efficiency during conveyance. Using the diverts in this manner is also an improvement over existing mail systems in that waiting for all the mail to arrive to start processing is eliminated, as is having to manually run the mail through many different passes to properly sort, sequence, store, and deliver the mail.","Divert Mechanisms and Related Conveyances","The right angle divert advantageously achieves a high throughput of frames (i.e., frames per second) at low transport speeds (i.e., inches per second). Achieving the high throughput is accomplished by orienting the frames in the front-to-back stacked manner as discussed above such that the distance between frames (or \u201cpitch\u201d) is as small as possible. In embodiments, each frame is provided with at least one pin (e.g., at a top end of the frame) or other mechanism in order to effectuate diversion. Also, in embodiments, the distance between pins of stacked frames will be the same as the distance between the frames, respectively. Therefore, since the distance between frames should be small, the distance between pins should also be minimized.","Active diverts are accomplished by a divert mechanism. The divert mechanism selectively diverts any, all, or none of the frames that cross its path. Thus, the divert mechanism is capable of acting on each individual pin such that the divert mechanism may switch from the input conveyance path to the diverted output conveyance path and back to the input conveyance path between each approaching pin (i.e., frame). This requires fast switching times to accommodate the high throughput and small frame pitch. Alternatively, the divert mechanism may allow a plurality of frames to be diverted before switching back to the input conveyance path to allow other frames to bypass the divert. Thus, the present invention contemplates a variety of divert mechanisms used in conjunction with the various conveyance mechanisms to efficiently move mail pieces throughout the mail sorting and sequencing system.","Rotating Cam Divert Mechanism and Lead Screw Conveyance",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0567","num":"0759"},"figref":["FIG. 9I","FIG. 9G"],"b":["9","900","902","900","9","906","908","910"]},"FIG. I(B) shows the four lead screw conveyance system as further described with respect to  and . The four lead screw conveyance system includes a set of at least four lead screws (two provided at a lower portion of the conveyance path and two provided at an upper portion of the conveyance path). The upper lead screws are parallel to each other in a width direction and parallel to the lower pair in the height direction as both ends extend along the length of the main conveyance path. The lead screws are designed and structured to support the frames F at upper and lower edge ends thereof. The lead screws also rotate parallel to each other.","Threads of the lead screws have a pitch such that the frames F are angled at 45 degrees to the direction of travel of the lead screws and are transported along the lead screws to readily and easily engage various divert sections and compression zones without compromising the conveying speed of the system. In this regard, and referring to FIGS. I(B) and X, the lead screws may be powered by an independent motor . More specifically, lead screw drive shafts  are driven by the motor  (which in turn drives the lead screws ) and may include at least one, one-to-one right angle gear box  to provide uniform synchronized rotation of the lead screws during operation based upon the output of the motor . The right angle gear box  is provided so as not to limit the configuration of the system, and may be utilized in an unlimited number of possible configurations for the motor , drive shafts , and lead screws  depending on spacing constraints, etc.","Using the one-to-one gear ratio, it is ensured that all of the lead screws in a given conveyance system rotate at the same speed. This includes main conveyance paths, as well as any divert sections or compression zones the main conveyance path may encounter. As such, the uniform rotation speed of the lead screws ensures, e.g., that during a divert bypass, even though the frame F contacts lead screws of the diverted conveyance path, the contact will not impede the forward progress (or constant speed) of the frame along the main conveyance path. However, during a divert, the speed of the diverted frame F is also not affected because of the 45 degree orientation the frame F has with respect to the a direction of travel. That is, the frame F has a natural tendency to move in the direction of the divert and transition of the trailing edge does not impede the speed of the diverted frame F, nor does it slow subsequent frames traveling down the main conveyance path.","Referring to FIGS. I(B), W and X, the lead screws are supported at a lower surface thereof by a plurality of roller cam brackets . The roller cam brackets  also maintain the lead screws level with a floor surface. In alternative embodiments, the roller cam brackets  may also provide the driving force to rotate the lead screws , in lieu of, or in conjunction with the motor . The present invention further contemplates that the motor  may be set to rotate the lead screw shafts  at about 110 rpm and tolerances may allow for about a 10% variance in performance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0572","num":"0764"},"figref":["FIG. 9J","FIG. 9J","FIG. 9X","FIG. 9X","FIG. 9L","FIG. 9L"],"b":["906","902","908","910","908","910","902","902","993","995","918","920"],"i":["b ","b ","a"]},"As further shown in , frames F are conveyed along the conveyance path  and conveyance path  (via the lead screws). In embodiments, the frames F include a plurality of projections  that engage the lead screws. As the lead screws are at the same pitch and at the same speed, the lead screws in the conveyance path  will not interfere with the movement of the frames F as they are being transported along the conveyance path , past the intersection of the conveyance path . However, when the frames F are to be diverted, the lead screws of the conveyance path  will engage the frames F to divert them to the conveyance path , by use of the rotating cam divert mechanism .","As shown in the exploded views of , the rotating cam divert mechanism  includes a motor  and a rotating cam  for diverting the frame F. The rotating cam divert mechanism  is provided adjacent the intersection of the conveyance path  and the conveyance path , and is preferably mounted to a support member located outside and below an upper lead screw (not shown) of the conveyance path . This ensures that the rotating cam divert mechanism  will not interfere with the movement of a bypassing frame F.","In operation, the rotating cam  may rotate (or switch) between a bypass setting (as seen in ) and a divert setting (as seen in ). By activating the motor, the rotating cam  will rotate such that the pin  will engage a channel or slot  of the rotating cam , and be diverted into an angled groove  of the support member thereby directing the frame F to the conveyance path . In a deactivated position (i.e., a bypass setting), the rotating cam  will block the pin  from entering into the angled groove  such that the frame F will continue along its original path.","In embodiments, the rotating cam  should not commence a switching action until the previous pin  is clear of the rotating cam . However, if several adjacent frames are to be diverted, the rotating cam  can remain in divert setting so that multiple frames can be diverted to the conveyance path . This would minimize the need to constantly rotate the rotating cam . Also, due to the high throughput and small pitch of the frames F, the length of the rotating cam  should be longer than the pitch between pins . Therefore, one or more pins  can enter the rotating cam  prior to the switching event, and start down the path of the previous pin .","In the process of switching to the divert setting, the rotating cam  may have to push the pin(s)  within the rotating cam  back to the conveyance path . The pushing of pins  should be minimized, though. To minimize the pushing of pins  (without reducing throughput or increasing pin pitch) the point of cam rotation  can be extended. By extending the point of cam rotation, the channel length of the rotating cam  may be shortened. Therefore, only one of the pins will enter the inlet of the rotating cam  prior to the switching action. This reduces the torque required of the rotating cam , and the frictional wear on the frames F.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0578","num":"0770"},"figref":["FIG. 9K","FIG. 9G","FIG. 9K"],"b":["908","910","908","910"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0579","num":"0771"},"figref":["FIG. 9L","FIG. 9K","FIG. 9L"],"b":["908","910","914","926","920","930","910","920","930","920","908"]},"Thus, in operation, as the frame F travels down the input conveyance path , the pin  extending from the upper end projection  passes into the channel  of the rotating cam . At the point of insertion into the channel  a sensor, e.g., photodiode or encoder, communicates with a computing infrastructure or with the rotating cam divert mechanism  to actuate the motor  to rotate (or switch) the rotating cam . This will divert the frame F down the output conveyance path . In embodiments, the sensors can determine the particular frames that need to be diverted using the sorting methodologies as discussed in the instant application. At this time, the pin  is guided through the angled groove , and the projection  engages the upper lead screw of the conveyance path  to complete the diversion of the frame F.","In this regard and as shown in , the rotating cam  includes a front wall  and an outwardly tapered back wall  which defines the channel . As noted above, the channel  accommodates pins  either bypassing the conveyance path  or being diverted to the conveyance path . The front wall  is generally flat such that it is parallel to the support member when in the bypass setting. The tapered back wall  is angled at a receiving end of the channel  (i.e., the point of cam rotation). The tapered back wall  may be angled, for example, at 22 degrees, so that in the divert setting it allows pins  to continually be fed into the angled groove  and hence towards the conveyance path . This will eliminate the need for the rotating cam  to be switched back and forth even though successive, adjacent, frames F are to be diverted to the same conveyance path. Thus, many successive frames F can be efficiently diverted into the angled groove  and hence to a right angle transport lane, e.g., conveyance path , by only turning the rotating cam  one time. In other words, the tapered back wall  allows the rotating cam divert mechanism  to quickly divert frames F, while reducing wear on components and minimizing pin pushing. In embodiments, the rotating cam  will rotate about 22 degrees, in the divert setting such that the tapered back wall  will be flush or substantially flush with a surface of the frame, e.g., does not extend beyond the support member , in the divert setting.","Pinch Belt Divert Mechanism and Tooth Belt Conveyances","In embodiments, diverts in a tooth belt conveyance system may be accomplished by a pinch belt divert mechanism. To this end,  shows perspective view of a pinch belt divert mechanism in accordance with aspects of the invention.  shows an exploded view of  showing lift mechanisms in accordance with aspects of the invention.","Referring to , a non-limiting example of a tooth belt conveyance system  includes an input conveyance path  and an intersecting output conveyance path . The tooth belt conveyance system  includes a plurality of teeth  at spaced intervals extending along at least two outer sides  of the conveyance path such that frames F are supported at upper edge ends by the teeth . The frames F include projections  at lower surfaces of the upper edge ends so as to engage spaces in between the teeth , and thus allow the frames F to be suspended (i.e., to hang) as they are transported along the conveyance path. The frames F also include upward projecting pins  provided at a center portion of a top end of the frame F for use during a diversion.","The tooth belt conveyance system  further includes a pinch belt conveyance system  provided for diversion of the frames F to conveyance path . The pinch belt conveyance system  is provided at the intersection of the conveyance systems , . In embodiments, the pinch belt conveyance system  is positioned above the input and output conveyance systems ,  to provide clearance for frames F (and upward projecting pins ). This also prevents interference during a bypass operation (i.e., when the frames F are not diverted to the output conveyance path ). The pinch belt conveyance system  includes at least two parallel horizontal belts  continuously running in a loop. The horizontal belts  provide a guide path  therebetween such that the upward projecting pins  may be engaged between the two horizontal belts . In engagement, the horizontal belts  carry the frames F from the input conveyance path  down the output conveyance path .","Lifting mechanisms  having vertically disposed belts  are provided along the tooth belt conveyance system . The vertically disposed belts  include horizontal indexes . At the point of diversion, the lifting mechanisms  may engage the frames F and push them upward (disengaging the frames F from the input conveyance path ). That is, the horizontal indexes  engage upper edge ends of the frames F and push the upward projecting pins  into the pinch belt conveyance system . In this regard, the upward projecting pins  are securely inserted into the guide path  between the horizontal belts . The horizontal belts  may then carry the diverted frames F to the conveyance path , from conveyance path .","The horizontal belts  may also carry the diverted frames F until they clear the input conveyance path . More particularly, after the frames F clear the input conveyance path , the frames F may be placed on another tooth belt conveyance system until diversion or other action is required. It is contemplated that several different belts in series may be provided along the tooth belt conveyance system  such that frame F may be compressed or decompressed for more efficient sorting and sequencing of the mail pieces.","In operation, the frames F (suspended by the projections  at either side of the upper edge ends of the frames F along the tooth belt conveyance system ) are driven down the input conveyance path . At the point of diversion (intersection of the input and output paths), a timing sensor detects the approaching frames F to determine whether or not the at least two lifting mechanisms  are activated for diverting a given frame F. During a diversion, the frames F are vertically lifted such that the upward projecting pin  becomes wedged between the two horizontal belts . The horizontal belts  divert the frames F from the input conveyance path  by capturing the pin  in the guide path . As this happens, the frame F disconnects from the teeth  of the input conveyance path  and the trailing edge of the frame F becomes a new leading edge of the frame F. The new leading edge of the frame F may engage a guide channel (not shown) to keep the frame on track. At an end of the pinch belt conveyance system , the leading edge of the frame F (more specifically at the projection ) engages teeth on another tooth belt conveyance path and the tooth belt conveyance path drives the leading edge of the frame F down the output conveyance path . As the frame F begins to engage the other tooth belt conveyance system, the upward projecting pin  disengages the pinch belt conveyance system  allowing the new tooth belt conveyance system to continue the progress of the frame F through the module .","Vertical Divert Mechanism","In embodiments, diverts may also be accomplished with a vertical divert mechanism. Specifically, referring to . T vertical diverts may be implemented, e.g., when facility space is limited. The vertical divert mechanism allows selected frames F to vertically divert and serves as a bridge to guide bypassing frames F (i.e., frames not diverted) across a gap  at an intersection of an input conveyance path  and an output conveyance path  (i.e., a point of diversion). The conveyance paths ,  move the frames F via timing belts . The timing belts  engage the frames F by pins  extending at upper edge ends of the frames F and move the frames F along the conveyance path. The pins  support the weight of the frames F.","In embodiments and as shown in , a slotted cam  is provided at the point of diversion.  shows the vertical divert mechanism in a bypass setting (i.e., the frame F is not diverted). Here, the pin  of the approaching frame F passes through a slot  in the slotted cam . In a divert setting (shown in ), the slotted cam  rotates so as to direct the pin  (and the frame F) down the diverted output conveyance path . In operation, as the frame F approaches the slotted cam , a sensor detects the frame such that system controls and frame tracking software indicate whether the frame F should be diverted or not. If the frame F is to be diverted, the slotted cam  will actuate (i.e., rotate) so as to allow the frame F to engage the vertical timing belts . If consecutive frames F are to be diverted, the slotted cam  will remain actuated open until such time a frame F is detected that should travel across the gap  and remain on the input conveyance path . An advantage of this cam-style actuation is that fewer actuations will be needed for a batch of frames F that need to travel in any given direction. The mechanism only needs to actuate open or closed once for a large batch of frames F to pass either along the input conveyance path  or down the output conveyance path  instead of having to continually rotate for each individual frame .","The vertical divert mechanism also includes a guide  to bridge the gap for the frames F bypassing the divert from the slotted cam . The guide  can be integral to the vertical divert mechanism itself, or a separate boom that extends from the slotted cam  to the next area of horizontal support.","In embodiments and as shown in  and , the vertical divert mechanism may alternatively include a latch or gate  (pivotally attached to guide ) that is actuated to divert the frames F down a vertical descent (or up a vertical ascent) of the diverted timing belt . In a bypass setting (as shown in ), the gate  is closed and the frames F travel across a top end of the gate  past the guide  to continue along the input conveyance path . In a divert setting (as shown in ), the gate  is open such that the frame F is directly transferred from the input conveyance path timing belt  to the output conveyance path timing belt .","In embodiments, gravity assists in pulling the frames F downward; however indexes may be used if necessary to maintain separation or orientation of the frames. Using gravity to propel frames reduces complexity of the vertical divert mechanism (e.g., reduces the dependency on motors, belts, pulleys, chains, rollers, etc.). Frames may also simply slide on rails to their next destination. At the bottom of the timing belt , frames F may be gated for merging into a subsequent conveyance path, which may travel in any direction.","Rotatable Slotted Cam Device","In yet another embodiment, diverts may be accomplished in a roller conveyance system. Referring to , the roller conveyance system  includes adjacent threaded rollers  that transport frames F along an input conveyance path  and selectively divert the frames F to a diverted path or output conveyance path  that intersects input conveyance path . The frames are oriented at 45 degrees to both paths ,  as they are carried along the plurality of adjacent threaded rollers .","In embodiments, the frames have horizontal tabs  at top corners thereof. The bottoms of these tabs are \u201cknife-edged.\u201d The tabs  hang from tops of the threaded rollers . Thus, the weight of the frames F is carried by the threaded rollers , and the frames F can be moved and positioned by controlled rotation of the threaded rollers . The frames F also include vertical pins  in at least the upper edge end of the trailing edge of the frame F. The vertical pin  controls whether the frame F travels down the input conveyance path  or the output conveyance path . In this regard, the pin  passes through a rotatable slotted cam device , similar to that described with respect to the rotating cam divert mechanism  discussed above. However, the rotatable slotted cam device  is positioned above a support member and the pin  passes through a lower portion of the slotted cam. The present invention contemplates either orientation for both embodiments.","The rotatable slotted cam device  rotates to engage and direct the pin  (and the frame F) either along the input conveyance path  or down the output conveyance path . If the pin  is diverted to the output conveyance path , e.g., by turning the slotted cam device  towards the output conveyance path , the frame F will travel around a smooth, e.g., 90 degree curve and be diverted to the output conveyance path  (this is similar to the concept of providing an angled groove as discussed with regard to the rotating cam divert mechanism). In this manner, a single stream of frames F may be smoothly separated into a diverted stream and the original stream, with both streams moving at constant speed.","45 Degree Divert Mechanism","Diverts in a tooth belt conveyance system (as discussed above) may also be accomplished with a 45 degree divert mechanism. Referring to , the 45 degree divert mechanism  provides a tooth belt conveyance system , a pinch belt conveyance system , and a slotted flat drive belt conveyance system . The conveyance systems are provided above a top plate to transport the frames \u201cF, which are provided below the top plate. In this regard, the operation of the 45 degree divert will be described. The frames F have movable pins at upper edge ends thereof and a center pin provided at a center top end. The movable pins and the center pin are engaged in the tooth belt conveyance system , i.e., the input conveyance path. The movable pins are in a home position (positioned downward) while traveling along the tooth belt conveyance system ","The frames F approach a point of diversion, and the movable pins activate up (from the home position) so as to engage slotted flat drive belts (at ) to drive the frames into a 45 degree divert. Simultaneously, the center pin is engaged to the pinch belt conveyance system  which also pulls the frame F at a 45 degree angle away from the initial tooth belt conveyance path (at ).","At an approximate midway point of the 45 degree divert (also termed the \u201ctransition area\u201d) one of the slotted flat drive belts will disengage one of the movable pins of the frame F, which will drop down and return to the home position on the frame F so as not to interfere with movement of the frame F along the divert path. That is, at the transition area the frame F is driven via two contact points, the center pin (engaged with the pinch belt conveyance system ) and the other movable pin (engaged to the slotted flat drive belt ). At an end of the transition area, the frame F engages a center top drive belt to further transition the frame F onto another tooth belt conveyance path (not shown) for continued movement through the mail sorting and sequencing system.","Compression Zones","In the course of conveying millions of mail pieces through the conveyance systems of a mail sorting and sequencing system, it is oftentimes necessary to be able to adjust gaps between the frames that carry the mail pieces. Reasons for adjusting the gap between frames may include, but are not limited to, reducing the required amount of conveyance space being used, machine availability, facility space restrictions, machine efficiency, or utilization of storage space. Additionally, it is contemplated that adjusting the gaps may also aid in more efficiently and reliably merging various conveyance paths, or aid in positioning the frames in such a way as to match work station spacing.","Adjusting the gaps may be defined as compressing the gaps or decompressing the gaps. Compressing of the gaps includes reducing the spacing between frames traveling through the conveyance system. Decompressing of the gaps includes adjusting the frames to provide additional spacing between frames. Compressing and decompressing may be done independently, or simultaneously, depending on the desired throughput configuration of the frames through the conveyance system.","It is further contemplated that adjusting gaps between frames in a conveyance system can be accomplished using a compression zone. The compression zone may be provided at a segregated section of the conveyance path, and includes an independent drive system. The compression zone, while it may include similar conveying structures as the conveyance system leading to it, may alternatively include different structures to accomplish the task of adjusting the gaps. The compression zone may include, but is certainly not limited to, belts, power rollers, wheels, ball screws, lead screws, linear motors or even robotic arms to adjust the gaps between frames.","Sensors at the compression zone monitor the flow of frames approaching from the conveyance path and the compression zone is configured to receive the frames such that subsequent approaching frames can be held back, slowed down, backed up, or sped up as needed for purposes of spacing the frames to be transitioned to additional locations in the mail sorting and sequencing system. The output result of the frames that are sent through the compression zone may include, but is not limited to, frames that are evenly spaced, frames that contact one another, frames grouped by quantity or characteristic (e.g., thickness, state, city, ZIP code, street, dimension), or gapped in any specific desired configuration for transitioning to other locations throughout the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","The compression zone operates efficiently such that it does not slow down the overall mail system for sorting, transporting and conveying mail pieces. In embodiments, the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system may process five million mail pieces in a twenty four hour period, compared to current systems in operation that process approximately one million mail pieces in a given 24 hour period. It is also contemplated that even without a compression zone, the present mail sorting and\/or sequencing system including the main conveyance paths are capable of conveying up to 80,000 mail pieces per hour, double the current handling ability of existing conveyance systems. To accomplish this end, the compression zone works fluidly, integrally, and reliably with main conveyance paths leading to the compression zone such that frames (and mail pieces) are conveyed to their appropriate destinations within a specified time period.","Inset Compression Screws",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0604","num":"0796"},"figref":["FIG. 9W","FIG. 9X","FIG. 9W","FIG. 9W","FIG. 9X"],"b":"985"},"In the embodiment of  and , the compression zone includes a set of at least four compression screws  (two provided at a lower portion of the conveyance path and two provided at an upper portion of the conveyance path) inset from main conveyance lead screws . That is, the compression screws  are positioned between the main conveyance lead screws  in a parallel relationship along the length of the main conveyance path. The lead screws  and compression screws  also rotate parallel to each other.","At a point of compression, compression screws  engaging the leading edge of the frames F are positioned parallel to the main conveyance lead screws  such that an end portion of the main conveyance lead screws  extends along side receiving ends of the compression screws . This provides a smooth transition between the lead screws  and the compression screws . Compression screws  engaging the trailing ends of the frames F are positioned such that a gap is created between the end portion of the main conveyance lead screws  and the receiving end of the compression screws . This ensures that the lead screws  do not interfere with the compression operation. Additionally, the compression screws  are offset from each other to accommodate approaching frames F angled at 45 degree to the direction of the conveyance path.","The lead screws  and the compression screws  are positioned along parallel lead screw drive shafts  and compression drive shafts , respectively. Because the compression zone  is provided at a segregated section of the conveyance path, break points  separate the lead screws  from the compression screws . At the break points , no lead screw portion is provided along the lead screw drive shaft . Instead, only the lead screw drive shaft  continues to extend along the conveyance path such that the lead screws  do not interfere with the frames F making the transition between the lead screws  and the compression screws  during a compression operation.","The lead screws  and the compression screws  are supported at a lower surface thereof by a plurality of roller cam brackets . The roller cam brackets  maintain the lead screws and compression screws level with a floor surface. In an alternative embodiment, these roller cam brackets may also provide the driving force to rotate the compression screws  and the lead screws .","The lead screw drive shafts  are driven by a single motor  and may include at least one, one-to-one right angle gear box  to provide uniform synchronized rotation of the lead screws  during operation based upon the output of the motor . The right angle gear box  is provided so as not to limit the configuration of the system, and may be utilized in an unlimited number of possible configurations for the motor , drive shafts , and lead screws  depending on spacing constraints, etc. In embodiments, the compression screw drive shafts  are driven by an independent motor  and also include one-to-one right angle gear boxes  for at least the same reasons as provided for above in the description of the lead screw drive shafts . The motor  rotating the lead screw shafts  may be set to operate at about 110 rpm and tolerances allow for about a 10% variance in performance.","The compression screws  of the compression zone  adjust gaps between frames being sorted\/sequenced through the mail sorting and sequencing system. In this regard, the compression screws  can either compress the gaps between a predetermined number of frames F having varying or uniform thickness, or decompress the gaps, and create larger gaps between adjacent frames F. It is contemplated that the lead screws  have the capability of compressing from about 11 frames a second (i.e. about 2 inches a second) up to about 22 frames a second (i.e., about 4 inches of mail a second). To achieve this end, the compression screw threads are preferably designed having a pitch range (distance between frames F on the compression screws ) from about 0.177 inches to about 0.25 inches in the direction of the rotation. Tolerances for the pitch characteristic of the compression screws  allow for about a 10% acceptable variance range.","The compression screws  also easily and readily accept frames F from the lead screws . In this regard, it is contemplated that the compression screws  are beveled at 60 degrees at ends interfacing with ends of the lead screws  (i.e., at the break point ). The bevel allows frames F to easily transition from the lead screws  to the compression screws  (and vice versa) without interrupting the flow or speed of approaching or departing frames F.","In operation, the frames F are transported along the lead screws  at a 45 degree angle. As the frames F approach the compression zone , a sensor monitors and detects the position of individual frames F (and information logged in the control unit about the individual piece of mail attached thereto, e.g. thickness) on the lead screws . The sensor communicates with the compression screw motor  to begin rotation of the compression screws  such that the entire frame  (including the mail piece) is positioned in the compression zone . Once the frame  is securely positioned on the compression screws  at the desired position, the compression screw motor  is shut-off and rotation of the compression screws  stop. The frame  is suspended from movement along the conveyance path. The sensors continue to monitor the lead screws  for new approaching frames F containing mail pieces. When a new frame  reaches the compression zone , the sensors communicate with the compression screw motor  such that additional frames F are either compressed or spaced according to a predetermined configuration with the frame already provided in the compression zone . When a predetermined number of frames F are compressed or spaced, the compression screws  rotate until the compressed\/spaced load is transitioned back online to the lead screws  to continue through the conveyance system. The sensors used for compressing may include, but are not limited to, laser sensors, optical sensors, diffuse lasers, magnetic proximity sensors, or encoders.","Outlying Compression Screws","In embodiments, the compression screws  may be positioned along the conveyance path outside the lead screws  in the parallel relationship similar to that discussed above with respect to the inset compression screws. That is, the lead screws  are positioned between the compression screws . The lead screws  and the compression screws  rotate parallel to each other such that the frames F of individualized mail pieces can be transported along the same for purposes of compression or decompression, and for continued efficient conveyance through the mail sorting and sequencing system.","Inline Compression Screws",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0614","num":"0806"},"figref":["FIG. 9Y","FIG. 9Z","FIG. 9Y"]},"As shown in , in embodiments, the compression zone  is in-line with the lead screws . In-line compression screws are provided along the same path (as opposed to a parallel path) with lead screws . More particularly, at the break point  of the lead screws  where the compression zone  initiates operation, the compression screws and lead screws  extend along the same horizontal axis.","In embodiments, the lead screws  are hollow outer casings having a thread profile at an outer surface. The hollow outer casing also serves as the drive shaft for rotation of the lead screws . An inner surface of the hollow casing includes a plurality of ball bearings (or alternatively spur gears) to support compression drive shafts  extending from the compressions screws through the inner surface of the lead screws . An independent servo motor (as discussed above) drives the hollow casing. The ball bearings also allow the lead screws  to rotate independently of the compression screws which are rotated by the compression drive shafts  driven from another independent motor (not shown). Thus, the compression screws rotate at a different rate than the lead screws  along the same axis to aid in compressing or decompressing frames F depending on the desired operation.","The ends of the lead screws  leading to the break point before the point of compression cooperate with a cutback thread mechanism located on the compression screws at the break point . The cutback thread mechanism includes an end thread design configured such that every other thread is machined back. That is, the cutback thread mechanism includes a full thread, followed by a cut back thread, followed by a full thread, etc. The full thread engages the frames F from the ends of the lead screws . Thus, the compression screws may accept a frame F from the lead screws  to increase the spaced intervals between frames F or to reduce spaced intervals between frames. The spacing created is dependent on the competing rotation speeds of the screws , , respectively.","It is noted that the last thread of the lead screws  may be beveled at, e.g., 60 degrees. The bevel profile does not impede the cutback thread mechanism as it accepts frames from the lead screws  at the break point .","The lead screws  and the compression screws are supported by roller cam brackets . The roller cam bracket may also be a mesh profile gear that mates the screw threads with the gear teeth such that the gear teeth drive the screws. In embodiments, the roller cam brackets may function as the independent servo motors to start and stop the rotation of the screws based on input received from the sensors at the break point  of the lead screws  for the approaching frame F.","Thus, the present invention provides a conveyance system for efficiently and reliably transporting a high volume of individual frames carrying mail pieces through a sorting and sequencing system using a variety of conveyance mechanisms. The conveyance mechanisms may include divert mechanisms and compression zone mechanisms to deliver frames from one conveyance path to another without compromising speed of the conveyance path and enhancing the efficiency of the sorting and sequencing system.","The present invention relates to extraction of mail pieces, such as letters and flats, from individually containerized frames, particularly with regard to such mail pieces being part of a facility-wide automated mail processing system. In addition to mail pieces, the invention encompasses the transportation and processing of other articles, such as, but not limited to, sheets of paper, metal, wood, plastics, etc., as well as CD's, DVD's, and\/or their jewel cases, books, photographs, etc. More specifically, the present invention is directed to the extraction of individual mail pieces, such as letters, flats and small parcels, from their individualized frames, particularly with regard to such mail pieces being part of a facility-wide automated mail processing system.","Described elsewhere herein are various types of mail extraction methods and apparatus which generally rely upon a force initiated adjacent, but outside the processing stream of frames and mail pieces. As described in greater detail below, mail piece extraction can alternatively be accomplished by an apparatus, in the form of so-called \u201cextractor frames,\u201d which move along the processing stream itself and which act upon the individually containerized mail pieces via right-angle-diverts (RADS).","As a brief summary before describing details and particular embodiments of the extractor-frame extraction of mail pieces, a facility-wide mail processing system according to the invention relates to individualized frames for mail pieces, such as letters and flats, for use in moving such mail pieces in a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. Such frames are herein referred to as a \u201cframe,\u201d a \u201cfolder,\u201d or a \u201cframe\/folder.\u201d Each frame is constructed for the purpose of containing a single mail piece as the mail piece is sorted and sequenced with other such containerized mail pieces, or as they are stored for subsequent processing. Each mail piece is inserted into a frame when inducted into the system, and extracted from its frame during preparation for dispatch.","Within a given system, frames of different types can be utilized to accommodate letters and flats, e.g., which can vary in size and shape. However, the frames within a system have a standard shape-factor, which makes automated handling easier; although different shapes are also contemplated by the present invention.","A frame, occasionally referred to as a \u201cframe\/folder,\u201d includes (1) a frame portion that is transported along a processing path by a driving mechanism, such as lead screws, e.g., which driving mechanism drives a plurality of successive frames within the mail processing system, and (2) a folder portion having at least one portion movably connected to the frame portion, the folder portion having at least a portion movable or deformable relative to the frame between a first position for facilitating selective insertion and extraction of a single mail piece within the container, and a second position, wherein the folder portion is empty of any mail piece.","According to a particular aspect, the engageable portions of the frame are positioned to orient the frame during travel within the mail processing system other than in a direction along the length of the frame. In this manner, a stack of successive frames occupies a minimal length along the travel direction relative to known systems. More particularly according to that aspect of the invention, the aforementioned orientation of the frame is an angle of 45\u00b0 with respect to the direction of travel.","According to various embodiments according to the invention, in the first position of the folder, insertion and extraction of the mail piece is facilitated. In the second position of the folder, no mail piece is contained in the folder and the folder has a minimized width. In embodiments, the folder can additionally include other positions such as, for example, an intermediate or partially open state to accommodate different sizes of mail pieces.","The frame part of the frame\/folder, or \u201cframe,\u201d is rigid, whereas the movable portion of the folder is movable\/deformable away from the rigid frame to the first position. The frame is generally rectangular. In the particular embodiments described below, extraction of mail pieces is accomplished through a side opening of the frame.","Mail pieces in frames are sorted and sequenced using Right Angle Diverts (RADs), merges, compression zones, decompression zones, and shuttles. RADs split a stream of frames into two streams, moving at an equal speed, by diverting individual frames. Because of the 45\u00b0 orientation of the frames, RADs can divert frames without stopping either stream by sliding frames out from between adjacent frames. This results in a sliding or shearing relative motion between adjacent frames.","Merges, or merge areas, merge two streams of frames into a single stream. Again, because of the 45\u00b0 orientation, such merging is accomplished without requiring the streams to stop. A merge also results in a sliding or shearing movement between adjacent frames.","Compression zones remove gaps from between frames within a stream. Decompression zones insert gaps between frames within a stream. When individual handling of frames is not required, frames are moved as batches contained in shuttles. After mail pieces have been sorted and sequenced, they are extracted from the frames and inserted into trays for delivery.","As described elsewhere herein, mail pieces are individually contained in a frame\/folder, generally referred to as a \u201cframe,\u201d as the mail pieces are sorted, sequenced, and otherwise processed in the mail processing system. While it may be possible to leave the mail pieces in their respective frames for delivery to the customer, the additional weight and package size, in addition to potential waste\/recycling cost or reuse of the individual frame would be generally prohibitive. Therefore, the better approach is to utilize the individual containers, or frames, for sorting and transport within the mail processing system and to remove the mail pieces from their frames prior to placement into a delivery container.","The present invention, therefore, relates to the removal, or extraction, of flat articles from the individual frames for placement into delivery containers. The invention is applicable to any system that transports flat or mail piece-like articles, including single or multi-sheet documents in individual frames, and requires the removal of such articles from their individually containerized containers, or frames, prior to further processing internally within the system, or externally thereof.","To these and other ends, the invention relates to apparatus and methods of extracting individually containerized flat articles from respective frames during transport of a succession of such containerized mail pieces along a transport path. Extraction of mail pieces can be accomplished by any of a variety of apparatus and methods. For example, an end effecter, such as a vacuum extractor which operates with a perforated belt can engage and extract the mail piece from its frame, while another device, such as a driven friction wheel, withdraws or diverts the emptied container from the transport path.","In an alternative embodiment, end effecters in the form of articulating pushers engage mail pieces by sliding into their respective opened frames to move the mail pieces toward respective grippers for extraction and subsequent handling of the mail pieces. In accordance with alternative embodiments, extraction is accomplished by mechanisms integrated within the mail piece frames, such as a pinch-belt extractor or a slider-in-folder extractor. In other alternative embodiments, the extraction is accomplished by gravity.","In alternative embodiments of methods and apparatus for extracting mail pieces, the mail pieces are extracted from frames being transported via lead screws through the utilization of an extractor frame (or pusher-frame) in conjunction with RADs, merges, compression zones, and decompression zones.","The extractor frame is similar to the mail frame in that it engages lead screws and it can function with RADs, merges, compression zones, and decompression zones. It is diverted into a decompressed stream of frames. This results in a sliding motion between it and the adjacent frames. A particular mechanism (described further below) of the extractor frame engages the mail frame, and uses the sliding motion to slide the mail piece out of the frame. In one embodiment, the mechanism is a \u201cpop-up pusher\u201d that engages the frame and the mail piece via a slot in the side of the frame. The extractor frames are then diverted out of the stream of mail frames, for subsequent reuse.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0638","num":"0830"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 10A"],"b":["1002","1001","1002","1001"]},"The vacuum extractor includes a stationary vacuum chamber  positioned within the course of a perforated endless belt , the belt being driven by at least one of the cylindrical drums , . More particularly, a vacuum is pulled through the perforated belt as the containerized mail pieces approach.","The frame F can take the form of the frame\/folder described elsewhere herein and shown in, for example, , whereby the folder maintains the mail piece  between a pair of membranes, one of which includes a C-shaped cutout on the side facing the vacuum extractor . The cut-out exposes a portion of the mail piece for engagement by the vacuum.","As each containerized mail piece, i.e., mail piece  within a frame F, approaches the vacuum extractor , the mail piece itself is acquired by the negative pressure of the vacuum chamber . While so acquired, the perforated belt drives the mail piece through a side opening of the frame (i.e., in the direction of the opening of the \u201cC\u201d of the C-shaped cutout of the folder), thereby extracting the mail piece  from its frame F. As the mail piece is extracted from its frame, or after such extraction, it is engaged by another transport mechanism, such as a pair of pinch-belts  for further processing into a delivery container.","While the mail piece  is being extracted by means of the vacuum extractor, the emptied frame F is driven in a direction opposite of the direction of the extraction of the mail piece by a friction contact wheel  for example, as shown in . Such emptied frames can thereafter be driven by means of the aforementioned lead screws or other means of conveyance to a frame inserter for insertion of another mail piece.","The extraction apparatus of the embodiment shown in  allows for the vacuum chamber to be as large as necessary to be able to acquire mail pieces accurately within the individual frame and remain in a fixed location. Instead of moving the vacuum head in and out between the individual frames and thereby increasing the gap needed between successive frames, the frames are moved laterally allowing each one to be presented to the vacuum chamber. This eases the mechanical design by not requiring vacuum lines to move with the chamber and sizing the chamber for weight and space constraints between containers. In addition, moving the individual frames is achieved more quickly and consistently because they are of a common form factor. Additionally, mail pieces may be moved directly into a pinch belt transport allowing for a multiplicity of further operations to be performed upon the mail piece including, but not limited to, detection and validation of mail piece extraction, mail piece dimensional characteristic measurements, mail piece orientation correction, mail piece reorientation, hazardous material detection, optical recognition of external markings and identifiers, including indicia marks, addresses, ZIP codes, or other of the like as discussed in the instant application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0644","num":"0836"},"figref":["FIGS. 10B","FIGS. 10B-10D"],"b":["10","10","1011"]},"The apparatus of , under command of the computing infrastructure shown in , operates in the following manner.","The shuttle  is rotated by 90\u00b0 by means of a \u201cshuttle flipper\u201d mechanism which is, in exemplary embodiments, provided by way of a gear system structured to rotate the shuttle. More particularly, such a mechanism is configured to capture the shuttle and rotate it 90\u00b0 and then release it. For example, it could capture the shuttle via a pin-in-hole arrangement, traction belts, gripper paddles, or by design of the shape, such as, but not limited to a 90\u00b0 angle iron type shape that allows the shuttle to be driven onto it at an orientation of 0\u00b0 and then rotated 90\u00b0 and then driven off. To accommodate operating while on its side, the apparatus requires a shuttle structured and arranged to include, for example, a mechanism such as a clamp used with the shuttle described elsewhere herein, for holding the shuttles or frames on the shuttle while the shuttle is rotated.","The rotated shuttle  docks with lead screws , which to convey the frames F along the processing path at the 45\u00b0 angle, as shown. Frames F are extracted, with expanded pitch, from the rotated shuttle  onto the rotated lead screws .","The mail pieces are extracted via gravity force through the bottom of the frames. More specifically, the mail pieces drop via gravity into available spaces between a plurality of separation paddles . Separation paddles  are positionable relative to the frames F, to ensure the mail pieces are released directly over respective spaces between separation paddles . This position can be accomplished by the movement of the frames F versus the movement of the available spaces between separation paddles . Additionally, a sensor or an array of sensing apparatus such as, for example, a photodiode, weight sensor, etc., can be used to verify that each mail piece is collected within the available spaces between separation paddles.","The separation paddles  reorient from a less than 90\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (perpendicular) to the bottom reference edge or deck. The slots are to be oriented at, or approximately at, 45\u00b0 to accommodate the angle of the mail piece while it is falling out of the frames. According to a particular embodiment, a requirement can be made for the slots\/paddles to be able to rotate\/change angles. The paddles can either rotate individually or rotate together.","The separation paddles  can withdraw by means of various possible arrangements of linear or radial movement via a solenoid or other driving mechanism known to those skilled in the art. The separation paddles  are to move in a direction that will not lose the edge reference of the mail pieces. Thus, if the edge reference is the bottom right corner of the mail pieces, then the separation paddles  are to be moved in a direction that would not lose the edge reference, i.e., a downward or a rightward, or a down and rightward movement would be optimal. Separation paddles  may withdraw simultaneously or slightly out of time from each other to aid in the reduction of adhesion of mail pieces to the separation paddles.","A final compression of mail pieces is made via compression paddles and . The compression paddles and move toward one another to close up gaps created when the separation paddles  are withdrawn, and to create a tighter mail stack that can be moved or conveyed or dropped into a transportable container. Compression paddles can move by means of various possible arrangements, e.g., via a solenoid or other driving mechanism known to those skilled in the art.","In an alternative embodiment, a self-sweeping frame can be utilized for extraction. For example, based upon the need for a mechanical assist to the force of gravity, it is contemplated within the scope of the invention to use rotation of one frame side, or an accordion-like folding side, to sweep against the other frame side and extract the contents. Hinges are integral components of the frame, allowing the frame to fold and recover during an extraction cycle. Clips or latches are incorporated in a frame with symmetrical sides, allowing one side to detach, rotate 180 degrees and reattach the next side after sweeping, as discussed with reference to the frames.","Alternative arrangements for extracting mail pieces from their respective frames are described elsewhere herein in connection with a description of particular embodiments of frames.

In the second position of the folder, no mail piece is contained in the folder and the folder has a minimized width.","According to another aspect of a mail container according to the invention, the frame is rigid and the movable portion of the folder is movable away from the rigid frame to the first position. According to a further aspect of a mail container according to the invention, the frame is generally rectangular and the folder is generally rectangular. In a particular embodiment, the movable portion of the folder portion is pivotable away from the rigid frame to contain a mail piece at a common connection between the frame and the folder.","According to another aspect, the frame includes at least one actuator tab adapted to be manipulated by a mechanism for moving the folder to the first position. According to a particular embodiment, the movable portion of the folder is slidable relative to the frame, the movable portion of the folder being maintained generally parallel to the frame during movement to the first position. According to another aspect of the invention, at least one opening is maintained between the frame and the folder for insertion and extraction of a mail piece relative to the frame. Such an opening is located at a top and\/or at a side of the container.","The individualized frame for each piece of mail (i.e., a letter or a flat), generally referred to herein as a frame (alternatively, as a folder or a frame\/folder), can take any of various forms, including those further described herein and depicted in various drawing figures. As described elsewhere herein, the system sorts and sequences such containerized mail pieces, ultimately resulting in the placement of the mail pieces into trays for delivery by a postal carrier.","As described elsewhere herein, each mail piece is inserted into a frame. The process of inserting a mail piece into a frame is called \u201cinsertion\u201d.","In a particular embodiment, in which the frame has a generally rectangular shape, the frame is conveyed via four lead screws, one positioned at each of the corners of the rectangle, as shown elsewhere herein. The lead screws turn synchronously to move the frames through the system. As mentioned above, successive frames are oriented at 45\u00b0 to the direction of travel. Due to this stack orientation, the spacing between frames (center to center) can be very small. Therefore, high mail piece throughput can be achieved at low transport speeds, particularly relative to known mail transport systems, whereby the mail pieces are conveyed by pinch belts along their lengths, rather than at 45\u00b0. Although the invention encompasses transporting the frames at angles other than 45\u00b0, advantages are realized within the system, as explained elsewhere herein, with that angle.","As the thickness of the frame increases, or as spacing between frames increases, the transport speed can also be increased in order to achieve constant throughput. Furthermore, increased frame thickness requires an increased storage space. For these reasons, the thickness of individual frames should be as thin as possible.","Further, the invention encompasses a system containing multiple, e.g., millions, of frames. Therefore, in order to minimize the cost and weight of the system, the cost and weight of individual frames should be minimized. The physical dimensions of mail pieces handled by a system according to the invention can vary widely. Exemplary ranges of dimensions for letters and flats are the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0699","num":"0895"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Height","Length","Width",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Type","(inches)","(inches)","(inches)","Weight"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Maximum","Letter","6.125","11.5","0.25","3.5","oz."]},{"entry":["dimensions","Flat","12","15.75","1.25","6","lbs."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Minimum","Letter","3.5","5","0.007","N\/A"]},{"entry":["dimensions","Flat","4","4","0.007","N\/A"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Because of this wide dimensional range of mail pieces, the system can be implemented with the simultaneous use of multiple frame designs or structures, i.e., non-identical frames. For example, the system can use frames of both a \u201cheavy-duty\u201d design as well as frames of a \u201clight-weight\u201d design. In such a scheme, all letters and some thin light flats can be transported\/processed in light-weight frames, and the remaining heavy, thick flats can be transported\/processed in heavy-duty frames. In addition to mail pieces, the invention encompasses the transportation and processing of other articles, such as, but not limited to, sheets of paper, metal, wood, plastics, etc., as well as CD's, DVD's, and\/or their jewel cases, books, photographs, etc.","The simultaneous use of multiple frame designs has a number of advantages. For example, a heavy-duty design can be more robust, to handle the relatively larger flats. A light-weight frame could be employed only to carry small mail pieces and, therefore, it can be constructed thinner and less expensively than the heavier frame design, while still reliably performing its intended function. The relatively thin and inexpensive light-weight frame offsets the more robust and expensive heavy-duty frame, such that the average cost, size, and weight of the frames can be reduced and within limits specified by the user.","The thickness of an empty frame, i.e., one carrying no mail piece, and the distance between immediately successive threads, i.e., adjacent threads, on the lead screws can be sized such that empty frames can occupy successive threads with no gap. The thickness (e.g., front to back) of a frame containing a mail piece can be greater than that of an empty frame. According to particular embodiments, described in greater detail below, such increase in thickness can be manifested on only one side of the frame, rather than on both sides. Therefore, such increased thickness can thereby only require one successive empty thread, e.g., on the side to which the thickness expands, rather that requiring a successive empty thread on both sides of the frame.","Many alternative configurations and embodiments for the system are described herein. This includes various configurations for both insertion and extraction. In some configurations, mail pieces are inserted into the frames from the side. In other configurations, they are inserted from above. Similarly, in some configurations mail pieces are extracted from the frame from the side. In other configurations, they are extracted from the folder through the bottom.","The term \u201cframe,\u201d as generally used herein, can be considered an abbreviated version of the term \u201cframe\/folder,\u201d the latter term implying a two-part construction that includes both a \u201cframe\u201d part and a \u201cfolder\u201d part. In this context, the frame part gives the frame\/folder its structural rigidity and engages the lead screws. The folder part can be generally regarded as that part of the frame\/folder that captures and carries the mail piece, albeit, in certain embodiments, in conjunction with the frame part. Generally, the frame of a frame\/folder is the more rigid of the two parts and the folder of a frame\/folder can be generally regarded as the movable part of the two parts, such movement facilitating insertion and extraction of a mail piece with respect to the frame\/folder. Movement of the folder part can be manifested as any of various forms of movement, such as pivoting movement in the form of a hinged connection, pivoting in the form of a parallelogram linkage connection, and movement by virtue of movable components within the folder. Still further, movement of the folder can be manifested by merely the deformability of the material of which the folder is composed.","All frames within a system use a similar design, or shape. In some embodiments, described in greater detail below, the frame is rectangular with tabs extending horizontally from each of four corners. A pin extends vertically from one or each of two top tabs. These pins facilitate the diverting and merging of the frames while engaged with the lead screws. The top and bottom of the frame can be knife-edged (or has a rectangular edge) in order to ensure positive engagement with the lead screws. It is contemplated that such edges might incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws. Therefore, the edges can be made to be easily removable and replaceable, such that as wear occurs the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame.","A frame, according to particular embodiments according to the invention is approximately \u215b\u2033 thick (0.125 in.; 3.18 mm). A rectangle is cut out of the center of the frame, such that the material remaining on all four sides of the cutout is approximately 0.5-1.0 in. (12.7-25.4 mm) in width. This cutout reduces the overall weight of the frame; although other dimensions and sizes, etc. are contemplated by the present invention. It also allows the mail piece to nest inside the frame, such that the overall thickness is minimized. In some designs, the folder part also nests inside the frame part, thus further reducing the overall thickness. As an alternative to creating the frame by cutting out a rectangular center, the four sides can be constructed by welding or otherwise connecting them together at the four joints.","To ensure that the frame\/folder expands in only one direction, many of the designs incorporate a piece of thin, inflexible material, attached to one side of the frame and covering the entire area of the cutout. This thin, inflexible material is referred to as a backer. In the following description, reference is made to exemplary embodiments of frames, folders, and frame\/folder combinations illustrated in the various drawing figures.","FIGS. Aa-Ad show an accordion type of frame, having a frame part  and a folder part . FIG. Aa shows the frame in perspective; FIG. Ab shows the frame in side view, in an open state; and FIGS. Ac and Ad show, in top views, the frame in a closed state and in an open state, respectively. The perspective view of FIG. Aa shows a pleated or accordion hinge side  of the folder part and an opposite side , which can be used for insertion or extraction of a mail piece, which can be made of a light-weight material, such as aluminum or cardboard, for example. This construction aids in insertion and extraction of a mail piece, whereby the folder part  ensures that each mail piece is justified and does not protrude outside the folder part and into the frame part on the far side of the folder\/frame. This construction also allows the folder to collapse to the \u215b-inch dimensional requirement, when empty and\/or closed, as depicted in FIG. Ac.","FIGS. Ba-Bf show various views of a frame\/folder according to certain aspects of the invention. In various alternative embodiments, the frame\/folder design in these views accommodates mail piece insertion and extraction in any direction. In one embodiment, the frame\/folder includes a rectangular frame  and a sub-frame, or folder, . FIG. Bd shows the sub-frame  removed from any attachment to the frame, and FIG. Ba shows a front view of the frame\/folder, with the sub-frame  assembled onto the frame . The sub-frame of the frame\/folder could be completely removed during insertion and\/or extraction of mail pieces. Alternatively, the top of the sub-frame could be disconnected and opened, while the bottom remains fixed to the frame. In another alternative, the bottom of the sub-frame could be disconnected and opened, while the top remains fixed to the frame. In yet another alternative, both the top and bottom could remain fixed to the frame, but due to the flexibility of the spring steel, the sides could be opened. All of these options are made possible by the configuration of the spring-steel closure tabs on the sub-frame, such as upper closure tabs  and lower closure tabs , and their associated closure slots on the frame, such as upper closure slots  and lower closure slots  (as discussed below).","The frame  is rectangular, or generally rectangular, with tabs extending horizontally from all four corners, such as tabs  and . A pin  depends vertically from each of the top tabs . These pins facilitate the diverting and merging of the frame\/folders while being transported via the lead screws. The top  and bottom  of the frame  are knife-edged (or have rectangular edges) for ensuring positive engagement with the lead screws. These edges might incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws. Therefore, one option is to make the top and bottom edges ,  easily removable and replaceable, such that as wear occurs the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame\/folder.","The frame  has a thickness of approximately \u215b inch (0.125 in.; 3.18 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. The frame can be made by cutting out the center of the frame, such that the material remaining on all four sides of the cutout has a width of approximately 0.5-1.0 inch (12.7-25.4 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. The cutout reduces the overall weight of the frame\/folder. It also allows the mail piece to \u201cnest\u201d inside the frame, within the thickness of the aforementioned material, such that the overall thickness of the frame\/folder, while carrying a mail piece, is minimized. In this design, the edges of the sub-frame do not nest within the frame. Rather the edges are positioned flush against the frame and, therefore, they add to the overall thickness.","To ensure that the frame\/folder expands in only one direction, by virtue of movement of the sub-frame (i.e., movement of the folder part of the frame\/folder), the frame  of this embodiment incorporates a piece of thin inflexible material , attached to one side of the frame, which covers the entire area of the cutout. This thin, inflexible material  is referred to as a backer. In a particular embodiment, the sub-frame  (see FIG. Bd, e.g.) is made of a thin, generally rectangular piece of spring steel. Actuation tabs, such as tabs , protrude from the sub-frame . They facilitate the opening and closing of the frame\/folder. The sub-frame  also has four closure tabs, i.e., upper tabs  and lower tabs , which extend vertically from each corner of the sub-frame. The frame  has four closure slots, i.e., upper closure slots  (see FIG. Be) and lower closure slots  (see FIG. Bc), i.e., one in each of the horizontal tabs. As shown in FIGS. Ba, Bb, and Bf, the closure tabs ,  of the sub-frame are inserted and captured in the closure slots ,  of the frame . When a mail piece is contained within the frame\/folder and the frame\/folder is being processed through the system, all four closure tabs of the sub-frame are captured within their respective closure slots of the frame.","The frame\/folder can be opened for mail piece insertion in at least three possible ways. In one embodiment, the actuation tabs  on the sub-frame  are caused to be moved away from the frame  some small distance. The spring steel of the sub-frame flexes, thereby opening a gap for side insertion of the mail piece. All four closure tabs remain in their respective closure slots. Alternatively, this actuation may also be configured to open a gap at the top, allowing for top insertion of the mail piece.","In another embodiment, the top two closure tabs  are caused to slide out of, and completely disengage from, their respective closure slots . This allows top or side insertion of the mail piece. After mail piece insertion, the closure tabs are caused to be re-inserted into their respective closure slots.","In a further embodiment, all four closure tabs ,  are caused to slide out of, and completely disengage from, their respective closure slots , . The frame  and the sub-frame  are thus completely disconnected and handled separately during the insertion process. This allows for insertion of the mail piece from any direction. After the mail piece is inserted, the closure tabs are re-inserted into their respective closure slots.","The frame\/folder can be opened for mail piece extraction in three possible ways. In one embodiment, the actuation tabs  on the sub-frame  are moved away from the frame  some small distance. The spring steel of the sub-frame flexes, opening a gap for side extraction of the mail piece. All four closure tabs ,  remain in their respective closure slots , .","In another embodiment, the bottom two closure tabs  are caused to slide out of, and completely disengage from, the closure slots . This allows bottom extraction of the mail piece. After mail piece extraction, the closure tabs are re-inserted into their respective closure slots.","In a further embodiment, all four closure tabs are caused to slide out of, and completely disengage from, the closure slots. The frame and the sub-frame are thus completely disconnected and handled separately during the extraction process. This allows for extraction of the mail piece from any direction. After the mail piece is extracted, the closure tabs are re-inserted into their respective closure slots.","With reference to FIGS. Ba-Bf, the frame\/folder design accommodates top or side insertion and side extraction of mail pieces. The frame  is rectangular with tabs  projecting horizontally from all four corners. A pin  projects vertically downward from each of the two top tabs . These pins facilitate the diverting and merging of frame\/folders while being driven by lead screws. The top  and bottom  of the frame is knife-edged (or has a rectangular edge) to ensure positive engagement with the lead screws. Because these edges might incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws, the edges can be made easily removable and replaceable, such that, as wear occurs, the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame\/folder.","FIGS. Ca-Cd show an alternative frame\/folder in accordance with aspects of the invention. FIG. Ca depicts a front view of the frame\/folder and FIG. Cb depicts a rear view. This frame\/folder shares certain attributes with other designs. For example, with reference to FIG. Cb, it includes a rectangular frame , with horizontal tabs ,  and a large center cutout area. Similar to other designs, the sub-frame , or folder, has a thin flexible membrane , which allows for expansion to accommodate the mail piece. The membrane  of the sub-frame is connected to the frame  on all sides. The frame  also has a thin backer . The backer could be made of a flexible material to allow for smooth bending for opening of the frame\/folder, creating the bottom shelf  as part of the whole of , , and . The backer is fixed to the frame  on all four frame pieces. Alternatively, the backer  could be made of an inflexible material to prevent protrusion into the negative direction by an included mail piece. A bottom shelf  could be made of a similar or different inflexible and rigid material such as to support an included mail piece.","The thickness of the frame  is approximately \u215b inch (0.125 in.; 3.18 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. A rectangle is cut out of the center of the frame , such that the material remaining on all four sides of the cutout has a width of approximately 0.5-1.0 inch (12.7-25.4 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. The cutout reduces the overall weight of the frame\/folder. It also allows the mail piece to nest inside the frame, such that the overall thickness is minimized. In this design, the sub-frame nests in the frame. Therefore, it does not add to the overall thickness. The left and right vertical members ,  of the frame  have two thinned areas. These areas, in a particular embodiment, can be thinned to approximately 1\/16 inch. They are positioned where the actuation tabs - of the sub-frame  (discussed below) lay across the frame  when the frame\/folder is closed. The actuation tabs can also have a thickness of approximately 1\/16 inch. Therefore, the actuation tabs can nest in the thinned areas, and the resulting thickness of the tabs upon the vertical members is about \u215b inch. Alternatively, the tabs may not be a necessary attribute as the opening operation of the folder may be accomplished via a vacuum or suction cup gripping the folder's flat and smooth surface of  or  and moving in an opposite and upward direction.","For ensuring that the frame\/folder expands in-only one direction, this design incorporates a piece of thin, inflexible material , attached to one side of the frame , which covers the entire area of the cutout. This thin, inflexible material is referred to as a backer of the frame.","The folder can include a rigid rectangular sub-frame  and a flexible membrane . The flexible membrane can flex to allow expansion to accommodate the thickness of a mail piece being inserted. The flexible membrane  can be transparent. This provides the advantage of allowing an optical determination of the presence of a mail piece within a frame\/folder. Actuation tabs , , ,  protrude from the sub-frame . They facilitate the opening and closing of the frame\/folder. The flexible membrane  can also form the bottom U-shaped pocket  of the folder by extending from the bottom of the sub-frame  to the bottom of the frame  (or the bottom of the backer ).","Alternatively, the sub-frame  can be made of a non-flexible material. The sub-frame  is connected to the frame  at all four corners. It is connected at each corner via hinges , . These hinges create a parallelogram linkage to allow for the sub-frame  to extend away from the frame , or to collapse towards the frame, while remaining generally parallel to the frame. See, e.g., the perspective view of FIG. Cc and the side view of FIG. Cd, which shows the sub-frame positioned parallel to the frame, relative movement of which being controlled by manipulation of the actuation tabs of the sub-frame. This movement allows the opening of the frame\/folder for mail piece insertion and extraction.","In an alternative embodiment of a frame\/folder according to the invention,  illustrates a so-called \u201cback door\u201d opening folder. In this embodiment, the backer piece  is attached only at the bottom edge  of the frame  and retains its normal vertical and tight to the frame orientation based on its spring properties. This backer allows spring flex along its vertical length but prevents conformance to include mail piece articles. A thin, conforming membrane  comprises the folder area. This membrane is attached at all four sides of the frame. The folder membrane allows compliance for protrusion of mail piece to be in the positive direction as it is resisted upon by the non-conforming backer. Insertion and extraction may occur via side or top as the backer may be flexed away from the frame based upon its lower mounting and justification.","In a further embodiment, FIGS. Ea-Ec show a frame design with a two-part frame, one being a movable, sliding component  and one being a static component . A mail piece is inserted from the top of the frame and extracted from the bottom. This frame enables an active insertion and semi-passive extraction operation. A feature of this frame design is that once the mail piece is gripped by the two components , , it is does not slide or alter its orientation within the frame due to gravity. When the mail piece is acted upon by gravity, it wants to move down, but because the sliding component  has a rubbery surface , the mail piece will want to pull it down with it. Because the sliding component  is mounted upon slanted sliding guides , the downward pull will also give the sliding component  an additional clamping force to hold the mail piece.","The sliding component  has a metallic frame structure . One side of the structure has a plate with a rubbery surface  mounted thereon to maintain an inserted mail piece in position. Four holes  are drilled at a downward angle through the frame structure and rubbery plate of the sliding component. The placement and angles of the holes correspond to those of the sliding guides  on the static component.","The static component  also has a metallic frame structure. However, it does not contain a rubbery surface like that of the sliding component. Instead, the static component  has four sliding guides  projecting from a surface thereof at an angle. These guides support the sliding component , and allow it to slide between open and closed positions. The static component  has flanges  so that it can travel between a set of four lead screws that lie above and below the frame.","FIG. Ec schematically shows, with five successive illustrations, the operation of the frame of this embodiment. The frame begins closed, in the left-most illustration, with the sliding component  resting on the sliding guides  and pressed up against the static component's frame structure . An actuation from a bottom mounted plunger-like device or cam pushes the sliding component  so that it slides upwardly along the sliding guides until the open position is reached and is maintained by the plunger or cam, as depicted in the second illustration from the left. In the open position, a gap  has been created between opposing faces of the two components , . A mail piece M is inserted from above into the gap , as shown in the center illustration of FIG. Ec, and removal of the plunger or cam allows the sliding component  to a position forcing the mail piece against the static component , as shown in the next successive illustration. Because the sliding component is mounted on the angled sliding guides , the weight of the sliding component  creates a horizontal force as well, holding the mail piece in place. As gravity pulls on the mail piece, it wants to move downward, but the sliding component has a rubbery or high friction surface so the mail piece wants to drag that down with the mail piece. The angled sliding guides  convert this force into additional clamping force, ensuring that the mail piece does not slide away. Finally, when the mail piece needs to be extracted, another actuation opens the sliding component, as shown in the right-most illustration, and the mail piece m is free to fall out. The weight of the sliding component  causes it slowly slide back into the closed position as the frame is made ready for the insertion of another mail piece.","FIGS. Fa-Fd show an alternative frame\/folder design which accommodates top or side insertion and bottom extraction of mail pieces. As further described below, FIG. Fa shows the frame\/folder in an empty, collapsed position and FIGS. Fb, Fc and Fd show the frame\/folder in an open position.","With reference to FIG. Fc, the frame  of the frame\/folder has a generally rectangular shape with tabs  extending horizontally from all four corners. A pin  extends vertically from each of the two top tabs; although in a contemplated embodiment, the pin can extend upwards from one or more of the corners and more preferably from an upper corner on a trailing edge of travel (which is contemplated by each of the embodiments). These pins facilitate the diverting and merging of frame\/folders while in lead screws. The top  and bottom  of the frame  is knife-edged (or has a rectangular edge) to ensure positive engagement with the lead screws. In the event the edges ,  incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws, one option is to have the edges easily removable and replaceable, such that as wear occurs the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame\/folder.","The frame  has a thickness of approximately \u215b inch; although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. The frame can be solid, with no cutout (as in embodiments described above), or it could be cutout with a thin inflexible material (i.e., a backer) positioned over the cutout. In this design, the folder does not nest in the frame. Rather, it is positioned flush against the frame and, therefore, it adds to the overall thickness of the frame\/folder. The folder part of the frame\/folder takes the form of a rigid rectangular sub-frame  and a bottom ledge .","The sub-frame  is connected to the frame  on the left and right sides, as shown in FIGS. Fa-Fd, by one or more hinged lever-arms . These hinged lever-arms allow the sub-frame  to be extended away from, or to be collapsed toward, the frame . This movement allows the opening of the frame\/folder for mail piece insertion. The bottom ledge  is the surface on which the mail piece rests. At its upper edge (in the collapsed position), the bottom ledge  is connected to a slider  and, at its lower edge, it is connected to a bottom support . Both of these connections are made via long hinges , , running the length of the bottom ledge . The bottom support  is also hinged to the frame , via a long hinge , at its lower edge.","The slider  is also fixed to the frame , such that it slides up and down along the frame. As the slider slides up, it pulls the bottom ledge  and the bottom support  toward the frame . This movement opens the bottom of the folder, such that the mail piece can be extracted. As the slider  slides downward, the bottom ledge  and the bottom support  are pushed outward, to close the bottom of the folder. At their fully closed positions, the bottom ledge  is horizontal and the bottom support  is below the bottom ledge at approximately a 45\u00b0 angle. In this position, the bottom support  supports the bottom ledge  and carries the weight of the mail piece.","In the closed position, the bottom ledge  and the bottom support  push upward on the sub-frame , and keep the sub-frame in its extended position. After the folder has been opened and the mail piece has been extracted, the sub-frame  is allowed to collapse downward, due to gravity. In this empty, collapsed condition, the frame-folder is thinner. Therefore, it takes up less space in storage.","FIGS. Ga-Gc show an alternative frame\/folder design which accommodates top or side insertion and side extraction of mail pieces. As further described below, FIG. Ga shows the frame\/folder in an empty, collapsed position and FIG. Gb shows the frame\/folder in an open position.","With reference to FIG. Gc, the frame  is rectangular with tabs  projecting horizontally from all four corners. A pin depends vertically from each of the two top tabs  (which can be extending upward from a single upper corner). These pins facilitate the diverting and merging of frame\/folders while in lead screws. The top  and bottom  of the frame is knife-edged (or has a rectangular edge) to ensure positive engagement with the lead screws. In the event the edges were to incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws, one option is to have the edges easily removable and replaceable, such that as wear occurs the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame\/folder.","The frame has a thickness of approximately \u215b inch; although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. It could be solid, with no cutout, or it could be cut out with a thin inflexible material (backer) in place of the cutout. In this design, the folder does not nest in the frame. Instead, it is positioned flush against the frame, and therefore adds to the overall thickness.","The folder includes a rigid rectangular sub-frame  and a bottom ledge . The sub-frame  is connected to the frame  at the top two corners via hinged upper lever-arms . These hinged lever-arms allow the sub-frame  to be extended away from, or be collapsed towards, the frame . This movement allows the opening of the frame\/folder for mail piece insertion. The bottom ledge  is the surface on which the mail piece rests. The bottom ledge  is connected to the sub-frame  via a long hinge , running along the lower edge of sub-frame. The bottom ledge  is also connected to the frame, via two hinged lower lever-arms .","The configuration of the lower lever-arms  is such that, when the frame-folder is open, i.e., in the position depicted in FIGS. Gb and Gc, the bottom ledge  is horizontal and at the same level as the bottom lead screws. An advantage of having the bottom ledge at that level allows it to be externally supported during insertion of the mail piece. At the point of insertion, a robust, flat surface could be positioned between the bottom lead screws, such that the bottom ledge  slides across the surface, and is supported by the surface. Therefore, as the mail piece is inserted, the momentum of the mail piece is absorbed by the surface, and does not have to be absorbed by the bottom ledge alone.

They are positioned such that they extend above and below the bottom  of the folder's \u201cV\u201d.","In the design of the frame\/folder of , mail pieces can be simultaneously extracted from a batch of frame\/folders. Extraction of the mail pieces is accomplished in the following manner. Rods  extend through the holes . More particularly, the rods  are inserted at the bottom of the holes such that the top of the rods are below the bottom of the \u201cV\u201d and, therefore, below the bottoms of the mail pieces within the multiple frame\/folders of the batch from which the mail pieces are extracted.","The rods  are then moved slightly upwards, such that they lift the mail pieces out of the bottom of the \u201cV\u201d. In that position, the mail pieces rest upon the top of the rods . The rods  are connected to a rotating mechanism, such that the rods are rotated around their longitudinal axes.","All of the rods  rotate in the same direction. This rotation, occurring while the mail pieces are positioned upon the rods, pushes the mail pieces to one side, i.e., in the direction S, to the right in , and out the side of the folder.

Such vibration would ensure that the mail pieces do not stick or adhere to the folder, if such were found to occur for any of a variety of reasons, such as humidity or the presence of a foreign substance on any of the mail pieces. Vibration could be accomplished in any of a number of ways. For example, the shape of the rotating rods and their associated holes can be such that when the rods rotate, they rub against the side of the holes, creating a vibration in the folder. Alternatively, additional rods, such as rods , can be employed to engage the folder  in a different configuration, with the sole purpose of vibrating the folder.

As a result of this configuration, as the pull tabs ,  are moved in a direction in or out relative to the frame\/folder, and the membranes rotate about the rods, in the form of a pair of conveyor belts.","The membranes and their respective pull tabs can be in either of two positions, namely, a normal position and an extended position. The membranes and their pull tabs are in the normal position throughout most of the system's daily operations, such as during mail piece sequencing and storage. In the normal position, the pull tabs project just beyond one side of the frame\/folder. In this normal position, the pull tabs are accessible to be engaged via mechanization, but do not stick out excessively, to minimize the risk of unintended snagging. The membranes and their pull tabs are in the extended position for a few moments during extraction and, in some embodiments, during insertion, to facilitate transfer of the mail pieces from (and, in some embodiments, to) the folder, as described below.","In certain embodiments, in preparation for mail piece insertion, the pull tabs ,  are engaged via mechanization and are pulled outward, so that they project relatively far from the folder. Then, as the mail piece is inserted into the folder, the membrane is rotated in the opposite direction, and the pull tabs move inward, as shown in the top view of FIG. Kd, i.e., back to the normal position. The movement of the membrane is in the same direction as mail piece insertion, so that, during insertion, there is no relative motion or slip between the mail piece and the inside of the membrane.","In an alternative embodiment, the membranes and their pull tabs stay in the normal position throughout the insertion process. Thereby, in such embodiment, there is relative motion or slip between the mail piece and the inside of the membranes.","During extraction, the pull tabs are pulled from their normal position to their extended position. This movement serves to rotate the membranes about their rotator rods. The insides of both membranes, i.e., the sides contacting the mail piece, move in the same direction. Due to frictional forces between the mail piece and the insides of the membranes, the mail piece, thereby engaged, also moves in this direction. Thus, the mail piece is ejected from the folder, where it is then captured by other mechanization. After the mail piece is removed from the folder, the pull tabs are pushed back, i.e., inward, returning them to their normal positions, as depicted in the front and top view of FIG. Kd.","FIGS.

More specifically, the actuation tabs are caused to flip from the vertical (closed) position to a horizontal (open) position. Thus, the front membrane of the folder moves away from the back membrane (at the top) due to the lever-action of the actuation tabs and the living hinges.","The inside of the folder has a slider  built into it. The slider facilitates the extraction process. The slider can be in two positions, namely, a normal position and an extraction position. The slider is in its normal position throughout most of the daily operations, such as during mail piece insertion, sequencing, and storage. FIG. Ld shows the slider moving to the normal position. During mail piece extraction, the slider is moved from its normal position to the extracted position, as depicted in FIG. Lb. As the slider is moved to the extraction position, it pulls the mail piece out of the folder.","The slider has one or more pull tabs . When the slider is in its normal position, the pull tab(s)  protrude slightly from the folder, on the extraction side.

The elastic material  then serves to pull the slider back into the folder, from the extraction position to the normal position.","Variations of the frame\/folders thus far described are also encompassed by the invention. For example, the frame can be made of plastic with metal and strip magnets and a soft membrane center for expansion. Further, the frame could be constructed with pins on the side in a downward fashion to support the folder, and a center pin in an upward fashion for driving the folder from the mid-point. Still further, the frame could be made rigid with a spring steel frame having a mid point restraint on each side, with a flexible membrane center, a stiff backer material, and actuation tabs on either side. As a still further variation, the frame could be made rigid with a spring steel frame, side and bottom restraint, flexible membrane center, a stiff backer material, and actuation tabs on one side.","Further still, the frame\/folder could have a folder with living hinges all around. The top of the folder is opened using side tabs and living hinges on the top to drive the opening to its full open position via pressure between side tabs and top hanging mechanism. The folder bottom is opened via a mechanism that separates the bottom flaps and let the mail fall. The bottom flaps are held closed via memory in the living hinge material and also via small springs. Further, replaceable wear strips can be fitted at the top and bottom of the frames.","FIGS. Ma and Mb show a plastic frame with metal strips  and magnet strips , with a soft membrane  center for expansion. This frame\/folder design accommodates insertion and extraction of mail pieces in any direction, i.e., such as at the top or either side. It includes two identical halves, which are not permanently coupled to each other, as shown in FIG. Ma, and can therefore be separated from each other as necessary. In order to hold the mail piece, the two halves are combined and held together by magnets, such that one half is the front side of the frame\/folder, and the other half is the back side.","Each half, one of which is shown in FIG. Mb, is rectangular (or other shape) with tabs  extending horizontally from two adjacent corners. The edges with these two horizontal tabs can be where the frame\/folder engages the lead screws. The edge might be knife-edged (or have a rectangular edge) to ensure positive engagement with the lead screws. In the event the edges were to incur frictional wear due to their movement on the lead screws, one option is to make the edges easily removable and replaceable, such that as wear occurs the edges can be replaced, rather than disposing of the entire frame\/folder. As noted above, one or more pins can extend upward from the tabs in order to facilitate the diverting of the mail pieces.","Each half can have a thickness of approximately 1\/16 inch (0.0625 in.; 1.59 mm), such that the frame\/folder has a thickness of about \u215b inch (approximately 0.125 in; 3.18 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. A rectangle is cut out of the center of each half, such that the material remaining on all four sides of the cutout has a width of approximately 0.5-1.0 inch (approximately 12.7-25.4 mm); although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. This cutout reduces the overall weight of the frame\/folder. It also allows the mail piece to nest inside the frame, such that the overall thickness is minimized. Instead, it is positioned flush against the frame and, therefore, adds to the overall thickness.","The cutout in each half is covered by a thin material , in order to contain the mail piece while adding minimal thickness. Either both halves could have an inflexible material, or both could have a flexible material, or one could have a flexible material and the other could have an inflexible material. The thin material can be transparent. This would have the advantage of allowing for optical determination of the presence of a mail piece within a frame\/folder.","Two actuation tabs  protrude from each half. They are parallel to the horizontal tabs and are located near the other end of the half. They facilitate the opening and closing of the frame\/folder.","Each half has two magnetic strips  and two ferrous metal strips  fixed on the side that will face the other half (or other count). The four strips form a rectangle around the cutout. The magnetic strips  are on adjacent sides to each other (i.e. they are at 90\u00b0 to each other). Similarly, the metal strips  are on adjacent sides to each other. The remainder of the half is made of plastic, or some other non-ferrous material, such that the magnets do not interact with it. One advantage of this type of frame is that the two halves can be mated together as a part of the mail insertion process.","Two halves are combined to form the frame\/folder, as shown in FIG. Ma. They are combined with one of the halves upside-down from the other; such the horizontal tabs from one half are on top, and the horizontal tabs from the other half are on bottom. They are combined with the magnets and metal strips facing each other, such that the attraction between them holds the two halves together. In an alternative embodiment, the metal strips are replaced with magnetic strips, with their polarity in the opposite direction of the original magnetic strips. Therefore, when the halves are combined, the polarity of the original magnetic strips and the new magnetic strips are aligned such that they will be attracted to each other, thus holding the two halves together.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0784","num":"0980"},"figref":["FIG. 11N","FIG. 11N"],"b":["11153","11154","11155","11154","11156","11157"]},"Most of the folder is made from a single piece of molded plastic.

In this design, the edges of the folder do not nest in the frame. Instead, the folder is positioned flush against the frame, and therefore adds to the overall thickness.","To ensure that the frame\/folder expands in only one direction, this design incorporates a piece of thin, inflexible material  (such as spring steel) attached to one side of the frame and covering the entire area of the cutout. This thin, inflexible material is referred to as a backer.","The folder includes a rigid rectangular sub-frame . The sub-frame may be made out of plastic. The sub-frame has two long, horizontal hinges  at the top, and two more hinges  at the bottom. These hinges can be living hinges. The very top and the very bottom of the sub-frame are mounted flush to the frame. In this hinge configuration, weight of the mail piece and the sub-frame tends to hang downwards and moves the sub-frame closer to the frame. Therefore, the frame\/folder is biased closed by gravity and is thinnest in this closed position.","A portion of the sub-frame  has a cutout . The area of the cutout allows an \u201cend-effecter\u201d or vacuum pick-off head to act through the sub-frame on the mail piece. Such action can be that for extracting a mail piece from the frame\/folder. The end-effecter can utilize vacuum, friction, or some other means to extract the mail piece. Alternatively, such end-effecter could serve to push and\/or pull the mail piece.","The cutout  can have any of a variety of patterns in accordance with the invention. For example, it could be rectangular, circular, an elongated slot, be oval shaped, diamond shaped, or triangular. It could also be a pattern of multiple shapes. For example, the cutout could comprise multiple horizontal slots. The cutout could also be in any of a variety of positions. For example, the cutout could be in a bottom corner, with all the mail pieces justified to that corner of the frame\/folders. It could also be across the entire bottom of the sub-frame. This cutout would have the additional advantage of allowing for optical determination of the presence of a mail piece within a frame\/folder.","In certain embodiments, this frame\/folder design would open for extraction via vacuum suction serving to pull the sub-frame and\/or the mail piece away from the frame. In other embodiments, the sliding motion of the mail piece will sufficiently wedge open the folder for extraction. In other embodiments, actuation tabs can be connected to the sub-frame to allow opening the frame\/folder for extraction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0809","num":"1005"},"figref":["FIG. 11R","FIG. 9U","FIG. 9U"],"b":["11225","11225","11227","11227","11228","11229","11230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0810","num":"1006"},"figref":["FIG. 11S","FIGS. 9O and 9P","FIGS. 9O and 9P"],"b":["11235","11235","11235","11237","11238","11239","11239"]},"As shown in , the mail piece frame is made of thin plastic film (e.g., polyfilm), monofilament line and several hooks. It also would be large enough to contain (length of 15\u2033 and height of 12\u2033) the largest flat mail piece. Its overall thickness of the empty frame should be negligible to minimize storage space. Because of the way the frame is folded, as the extraction rod shown in  is raised, the mail piece is also raised. The mail piece is extracted when the extraction rod is fully raised. A mail piece holder is constructed to hold many frames side by side. The extraction rod can be raised to about an inch of the top when the mail is to be delivered by a postal carrier. This is enough to still hold the mail piece captive, but will allow the carrier to thumb through the addresses. Therefore the mail piece frame does not need extensive machinery to extract the mail piece.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0812","num":"1008"},"figref":["FIG. 11U","FIG. 11U"]},"As also shown in , the frame includes alignment tabs, sidewall alignment surfaces and sideway movement gear teeth. The alignment tabs, sidewall alignment surfaces provide for alignment in the container and on the conveyor, respectively. The gear teeth allow for sideway movement, e.g., for movement onto other conveyors, using a gear and worm system, known to those of skill in the art. The frame additionally includes a capture latch and movement initiation mechanisms. The capture latch may be conveying on the conveyor or holding in the container.","Using the frame embodiment of , for example, the mail piece frame can ride on a conveyor at 45 degrees. The frame of  can be transported on two conveyors at right angles, with a threaded rod and a belt with timing nubs. As such, the frame can be conveyed primarily with a Teflon timing belt (cogged belt) with nubs designed to keep the containers in alignment. Assisting also in keeping the alignment is a designed threaded rod. When the mail piece is being conveyed down the conveyor, threaded rods are over the \u201cforward movement divots\u201d in the container (See, ). The outer threads on the rods only the frame when it gets slightly out of alignment. Because of the divots the inner teeth on the rod do not touch the frame. When the frame needs to be conveyed sidewards, a solenoid initiated pin contacts the \u201cmovement initiated hammer zone\u201d on the side of the container. This stops the forward motion of the frame and initiates the sideward motion. As the frame moves sidewards, the inner teeth of the threaded rods contact the \u201csidewards movement gear teeth\u201d. The movement of the threaded rod mates with the gear teeth and reliably diverts the container off the conveyor. A similar threaded rod and timing belt is waiting to capture and move the container.","The present invention relates to an apparatus for the output packaging of mixed mail pieces. More particularly, the invention provides for the collection of mail pieces into one homogenous mass for handling and\/or transportation after such mail pieces, such as letters and flats, have completed processing within a mail processing system. In this regard, the invention allows mail pieces of mixed dimensions to be collected into a uniform stack and then be moved into a transportable container. Moreover, the apparatus of the invention provides for mixed mail pieces to be intermixed and handled automatically into a transportation container or packaging.","To these and other ends, the invention relates to an apparatus for output packaging of mixed mail pieces after the mail pieces have completed processing in a mail processing system. More particularly, the apparatus includes a staging area for receiving a stream of stacked mixed mail pieces, a stream of empty containers, each of the empty containers being adapted to contain a predetermined segment of the mixed mail pieces, and a plurality of stack-segmenting elements movable selectively and individually from outside the stream of stacked mail pieces to within the stream, whereby a containerable stack segment is created at the staging area by at least a downstream one of the stack-segmenting elements and an upstream one of the stack-segmenting elements. The apparatus further includes a slide panel for receiving, from the staging area, the containerable stack segment held by the upstream and downstream stack-segmenting elements, the slide panel being movable from a receiving position to a releasing position, whereby movement of the slide panel to the releasing position exposes the containerable stack segment held by the upstream and downstream stack-segmenting elements to one of the empty containers. The stack segment is then released by the stack-segmenting elements and the stack segment is positioned within the one of the empty containers.","According to a particular embodiment, the plurality of stack-segmenting elements takes the form of a plurality of paddles selectively positionable within the stream of mixed mail pieces. The paddles are effective for maintaining the perpendicularity of the mail pieces relative to a reference support surface. More particularly, according to such embodiment, the plurality of paddles includes three such paddles. A first of the constitutes a downstream paddle for engaging a downstream end of the containerable stack segment, whereas second and third paddles are upstream paddles which are movable alternately to replace one another in positions for (1) retaining the stream of mixed mail pieces, and (2) creating the containerable stack segment with the downstream paddle.","According to another aspect of the invention, the stream of empty containers is positioned along a path lower than a height of the slide panel. Thereby, successive ones of the empty containers are positionable directly beneath the slide panel, whereby the release of the containerable stack segment by the stack-segmenting elements allows the stack segment to fall by means of gravity into the one of the successive ones of the empty containers. In a particular embodiment, the slide panel is movable to the release position in a direction away from containers containing respective mixed mail stack segments.","According to a particular embodiment, each of the empty containers has a volume substantially equal to a volume of respective ones of the containerable stack segments formed by the apparatus. Further according to a particular embodiment, the containerable stack segment is held by the upstream and downstream stack-segmenting elements by means of pressure applied toward each other to compress the stack segment. Further, the stack segment is released by means of the upstream and downstream stack-segmenting elements releasing the pressure.","The present invention contrasts with conventional mail-processing systems, in which mail pieces are not processed and outputted in a mixed mail stream having a variety of dimensional characteristics. Rather than requiring human intervention to containerize the processed and outputted mixed mail pieces, the present invention provides an automated apparatus for receiving and containerizing such mixed mail stream.","In this regard, and with reference to , a stream of mixed mail pieces  enters a staging area  of the conveyor apparatus, such mail pieces having been stacked by means of a mixed mail stacker arrangement (not shown), which is well-known to those skilled in the art and common in the mail processing industry. According to the invention, through the use of a plurality of stack-segmenting elements, here in the form of three paddles , , and , the mail stack  is managed to a size that can be accommodated by the transportable container  to which it is advanced. That is, the paddles create a containerable stack segment having a volume substantially equal to a volume of respective ones of the transportable containers. In addition, the paddles , , and  maintain perpendicularity of the mail pieces with reference to a reference support surface, such as the mail stacker's bottom plate or deck. The paddles can be driven, e.g., rotated, by use of a solenoid or a gear system, both known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","When the process according to the invention is initiated, the paddle  can be considered a downstream paddle and is positioned just beyond the upstream paddle . As the stream of mixed mail pieces  advances and the mail stack  has reached a predetermined size for the transportable container , paddle  is moved down into place in the front of the mail stack , thereby separating the desired mail stack  from the influx of new mail pieces . The sized mail stack  is conveyed to a slide panel  between the paddles  and . The paddles  and  slightly compress the mail stack  by being moved closer together and they move in unison towards the slide panel  with the sized stack .","A stream of empty transportable containers  is fed by means of a conveyance such as, for example, driven rollers or a belt drive, slightly below the level of the slide panel . An empty transportable container  is in direct vertical position under the slide panel  so that the mail stack  can be dropped into the container. The slide panel  is made to slide in the direction of required mail edging. This action ensures that mail pieces are maintained justified to the desired edge. Additionally, the direction of travel of the slide panel  is such that it becomes positioned over the empty transportable container . That is, the slide panel is not moved in the direction of filled transportable containers , so that the slide panel  does not compete for space occupancy with mail pieces in the filled transportable containers , exposing the compressed mail stack  to the empty transportable container that is in direct vertical position beneath the slide panel . The paddles  and , which have maintained the stack  in position, are then driven slightly away from each other, thereby releasing the compression force on the mail stack  and allowing the force of gravity to drop the homogenous mass into the awaiting empty transportable container .","Once the mail stack  has dropped into the transportable container , the slide panel  is returned to its original position to receive a successive stack of mail pieces. The filled transportable container  is moved in the same direction of travel as the empty transportable container  had been directed by the conveyance. The paddle  is moved to slip in place behind the upstream paddle  that retains the new influx of mail, thereby creating a new mail stack , while the other upstream paddle, i.e., paddle , rotates up and moves forward into a position in preparation of separating the newly created mail stack  from the continuing influx of new mail pieces .","During the above-mentioned output packaging of mixed mail pieces, the paddles are moved in the following manner. Paddle  waits behind paddle  or . Paddle  or  then separates the new influx of mail pieces from the desired mail stack. The upstream paddles  and  then alternately replace one another as the operation of a paddle that separates the influx of new mail  from the desired mail stack , and the operation of a paddle that compresses, conveys, and decompresses\/drops the desired mail stack  in conjunction with paddle .","According to an additional embodiment, in place of the tray insertion and take-away conveyor system, a shrink sleeve bagging device can be installed at the end of the stacker. The shrink sleeve bagging device would then accept mail pieces directly into it, and use heat to shrink a thin plastic material around the mail stack, thereby packaging the mixed mail pieces into one homogenous mass package, similar to the means by which flat mail pieces are bundled or hay is baled.","The design of the apparatus here described allows for automatic sweeping of a filled mail stacker and transportable container filling. The apparatus here described can be utilized by any system that packages or containerizes mail piece-like articles, including single or multi-sheet documents, and has need to handle the multiplicity of pieces as one homogenous mass. This system can be used with any combination of mail pieces such as, for example, flats and letters, or can be used with folders\/frames as described in the instant application.","The invention is directed generally to mail handling and processing and, more particularly, to a method and system for receiving sort plans and configuration information from a centralized server in a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. As the facility-wide mail and flats sequencing system may contain numerous interrelated subsystems having redundant components, a fault in any one component may cause any (or all) subsystems to route mail differently throughout the system. Accordingly, in embodiments, a sort plan server is provided to modify and distribute a sort plan to various subsystems.  may be representative of the sort plan server and subsystems in accordance with aspects of the invention.","For example, in accordance with aspects of the invention, a sort plan server may obtain a system-wide sort plan, determine the consequences of a path within the system being unavailable based upon system data from a system manager, compose individual subsystem specific versions of the sort plan based on the system data, and distribute the subsystem specific versions of the sort plan to the respective subsystems. In this manner, implementations of the invention provide the system manager the ability to acquire a system level sort plan, modify it as necessary for individual subsystems, and then forward it to the subsystems. Accordingly, in implementations, each subsystem server is directed to sequence mail pieces according to the sort plan and also to route mail pieces based upon system availabilities (or non-availabilities).","Within the conventional postal service paradigm, there is a centralized server for each processing and distribution center (P&DC) where all sort plans reside. This centralized server acts as a centralized repository for all sort plans for the P&DC, and distributes sort plans to individual Mail Processing Equipment (MPE) or Mail Handling Equipment (MHE) of the P&DC via a wide area network (WAN). These sort plans determine how mail will be sorted. For example, a sort plan controls the sorting and sequencing of the processed mail in a particular MPE or MHE. More specifically, in current mail processing systems, a sort plan determines which mail is forwarded to which pocket or holdout bin of a particular MPE or MHE.","In conventional systems, all sorting is done in independent islands of automation. Therefore all machines are independent, and each MPE or MHE retrieves its sort plans from the centralized server directly. Put another way, what is happening on one MPE or MHE does not affect the sorting taking place on another MPE or MHE. Moreover, in conventional systems, the postal service (e.g., USPS) creates sort plans for a specific machine (MPE or MHE) based upon addresses of mail that will be sorted using the specific machine. Once the postal service creates a sort plan for a particular machine for a particular group of addresses, the sort plan is run on the machine without modification and without regard to what is happening on other machines (MPE or MHE) in the P&DC.","However, in next generation sequencing systems, the sorting and sequencing of the mail may be accomplished by the paths in which the mail follows as it is processed, rather than by merely routing a mail piece into a designated output bin. For example, in the inventive facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system described in this application, mail pieces may go through many subsystems, components, and paths before it is output as sequenced mail. For example, according to aspects of the invention, mail pieces may travel through any one of many presort accumulators, sequencing segments, storage segments, etc., while being arranged in a sequenced stream of mail pieces.","Moreover, in accordance with aspects of the invention, flats and letter feeders and sequencing elements are combined into machines as many subsystems, where each of these subsystems utilizes a sort plan. In embodiments, these machines may have many different sorting and sequencing subsystems, each with individual controllers running a sort plan that is distributed to the machine. Due to network topology, some subsystems are located physically on segregated data networks and may not have access to the facility WAN. For example, in embodiments of the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system, network flow of traffic is partitioned for efficiency reasons. Also, to control accessibility, some subsystems and\/or components might be partitioned from the WAN. In such cases where access to the WAN is not available to a subsystem and\/or component, the subsystem will not be able to access the centralized sort plan server to receive a sort plan. However, according to aspects of the invention, a sort plan server that does have access to the WAN can obtain the sort plan and distribute the sort plan to the various subsystems and\/or components.","Furthermore, subsystem and component availability is a significant operational parameter in the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. For example, in embodiments of the invention, the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system comprises many redundant paths, components, and subsystems. According to aspects of the invention, this redundancy allows mail to be routed to a different path, component, or subsystem when a particular path, component, or subsystem is unavailable (e.g., due to a jam, bottleneck, scheduled maintenance, etc.). Accordingly, in embodiments of the invention, in order to provide sort plans to remote components, and to coordinate sorting between the various interrelated subsystems and components, a sort plan server function is provided within the facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system that obtains, controls, and forwards sort plans to the subsystems and\/or components within the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0835","num":"1031"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1400","1405","1405","1410"]},"According to aspects of the invention, a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system includes a sort plan server  (e.g., system level sort plan server) that has access to the centralized server  via the WAN .

Moreover, the boxes at intersecting transport lanes  represent switches  that are structured and arranged to divert a shuttle from one transport lane to another. Conveyors and switches are well known, such that further explanation of their basic operation is not believed necessary. It is noted that the network of lanes and switches shown in  is merely exemplary, and the invention is not limited to this example. Instead, any suitable combination of lanes and switches may be used between components of subsystems.","As can be seen from , there are multiple redundant paths between the components -of the input segment subsystem  and the components -of the sequencer segment subsystem . In this manner, for example, when a particular transport lane is inoperative for any reason (e.g., jammed, broken, scheduled maintenance, etc.), a shuttle may still be transported from third presort accumulator to fourth sequencer segment by utilizing an alternate route. Similarly, when a particular component is inoperative (e.g., second sequencer ), then a shuttle may be routed to an alternate component (e.g., first sequencer ) that is capable of performing the same processing operations.","In embodiments, the transport controller  is operatively connected to various sensors throughout the transport network (e.g., that shown in ). These sensors may include, for example, photo-diodes that indicate the passage of shuttles past a predefined point. These sensors may also include, for example, encoders that indicate the amount of travel of a transport lane. These sensors may also include, for example, position sensors that indicate the output position of switches.","These sensors may also include, for example, broken or inoperative machinery. By utilizing data from such sensors, the transport controller may determine the state of the switches and lanes in the network, including when a particular transport lane is congested or inoperative, or the location of any of the shuttles throughout the system.","As seen in , some transport lanes  may be arranged as spurs for shuttle buffering. For example, lane represents a loop-through spur (e.g., first in first out), while lane represents a dead-end spur (e.g., last in first out). Shuttles may be temporarily directed into such spurs to relieve congestion over the transport network.","In implementations of the invention, the switches  are highly reliable mechanisms that have an extremely low probability of malfunctioning. Nevertheless, some sections of transport may be unavailable due to conditions such as unavailable destination segments, jams, or planned maintenance.

The system transport map  also maintains the operational status of each switch position. The system transport map  is described in greater detail with particular reference to the exemplary system depicted in .","In the exemplary embodiment shown in , each switch  provides one, two, or three switched output positions, which are referred to as Left, Center, and Right. The available output positions for each switch  are dictated by the architecture of the transport network. Each switch position has a status (e.g., enabled or disabled) associated with it. According to aspects of the invention, an enabled status for a switch position means the switch may be set in that position, while a disabled status for a switch position means the switch may not be set in that position. If all positions are enabled, the switch is fully available. If a position is disabled, then the switch is only partially available and may only be capable of providing limited switching or just a single path. If all positions are disabled, then the switch is completely unavailable. Switches may also have one or more inputs.","In embodiments, each switch  is assigned a unique identifier, and this identifier is stored in the system transport map  (as shown in ).

In the system transport map, columns are provided for \u201cDestination Left,\u201d \u201cDestination Center,\u201d and \u201cDestination Right,\u201d which correspond to the possible output positions for each switch. A destination that is not valid for a particular switch (e.g., based upon the transport network architecture) is represented by a \u201c0\u201d in the system transport map, while a destination that is valid is represented by the name of the switch or component that is downstream in that direction. So, for example, referring to  and Table 1, switch \u201cMS\u201d has a center destination of switch \u201cMP,\u201d a right destination of switch \u201cMS,\u201d and no left destination (indicated by \u201c0\u201d in the system transport map). Similarly, switch \u201cMS\u201d has a center destination of first sequencer segment (represented by \u201cSEQ\u201d in the system transport map), but does not have a left destination or a right destination.","The system transport map  also includes a value of \u201cenabled\u201d or \u201cdisabled\u201d for each switch, which represents whether the particular switch output position is currently operative, as described in greater detail herein. In embodiments, the system transport map is initially populated through data communication with the system manager  of the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. For example, the physical layout (e.g., configuration) of the components, transport lanes, and switches is provided to the FRA  via the system manager  (e.g., via user input).","As further depicted in , the FRA  also includes a divert watchdog , which monitors and updates the status of every switch in the system transport map . In embodiments, notification messages may be sent by the various subsystems , ,  and transport controller  to the divert watchdog  whenever a situation is detected that could result in a routing change within the transport or between system segments. The notification may be a message that identifies the situation which may impact the system transport map .","For example, the transport controller  may send a notification message to the divert watchdog  indicating that the status of a particular switch should be changed due to some activity (e.g., jam, broken, etc.). In embodiments, the notification message indicates the ID of the switch (e.g., \u201cMS\u201d), the affected switch positions (e.g., \u201cdestination left\u201d), and a status of \u201cDisabled\u201d for the affected switch position. Upon receipt of the notification, the divert watchdog  updates the status of the identified switch position(s) in the system transport map. At some later point, another notification message maybe sent by the transport controller  to the divert watchdog  to change the status to \u201cEnabled\u201d, once the condition is resolved.","In another example, the sequencer segment subsystem  may send a notification to the divert watchdog  indicating that the availability of a component (e.g., one of -) has changed due to maintenance activity or a jam. The notification message indicates the sequencer segment ID and a status of \u201cUnavailable\u201d. The divert watchdog looks up the sequencer segment ID in the system transport map and changes the status of all transport switches that direct shuttles to that sequencer segment. The status change disables switch positions so that the shuttles are directed to another sequencer segment. When the original sequencer segment becomes available, another notification message is sent that indicates sequencer segment ID is \u201cAvailable\u201d, upon which the divert watchdog updates the status of the applicable switch positions to \u201cEnabled\u201d.","In yet another example, the storage segment subsystem  may send a notification to the divert watchdog  indicating that a component of a storage segment is not available for use. The divert watchdog  changes the status of the system transport map based upon the notification.","According to aspects of the invention, when a major section of storage is unavailable, frames cannot simply be diverted into a different storage area. This would cause two potential issues: overflow of a storage area that is allocated to a different portion of the destinating mail stream and fragmentation of the diverted mail stream given that some mail is most likely already in the unavailable storage area.","Accordingly, in embodiments, if the estimated time for storage to become available is short, it may be possible to buffer shuttles on the transport by placing them into spurs. A timer would be activated after the notification of unavailability is received and would allow enough time for some simple event, such as a machine restart, to be completed. Once the timer expires, and if storage is still unavailable, then shuttles would be directed down a special output path to be manually handled.","In another example, the system manager  may send a notification to the divert watchdog  indicating some change in the system. For example, in the event that a system segment loses power or is unable to communicate for any reason, the system manager  sends a notification to the divert watchdog  that indicates the segment is unavailable. In embodiments, the system manager  determines that a segment is unavailable when the segment does not respond to a heartbeat message sent by the system manager . The notification message indicates the segment ID and a status of \u201cUnavailable\u201d. The divert watchdog  then looks up the segment ID in the system transport map and changes the status of all transport switches that direct shuttles to that segment. The status change disables switch positions so that the shuttles are directed to another segment. When the original segment becomes available, another notification message is sent that indicates the segment ID is \u201cAvailable\u201d, upon which the divert watchdog updates the status of the applicable switch positions to \u201cEnabled\u201d.","As should be apparent to the skilled artisan from the description herein, the divert watchdog  updates the data in the system transport map  based upon notification received from various parts of the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. In embodiments, only the switch status values are changed in the system transport map in response to notifications, while the switch identifications and destinations are fixed. This is because the switch identifications and destinations are based on the physical network, not the current status of each destination. However, the switch identifications and destinations may be altered by the system manager  (e.g., via user data entry).","As depicted in , the FRA  also includes a routing advisor , which determines a path through the transport to the next destination segment. In embodiments, a subsystem initiates a move of frames to another subsystem by sending a request to the FRA . Based upon the target subsystem and the data in the system transport map , the routing advisor determines a best path for the frames to travel to the target subsystem. The determination of the best path may be made using logic and business rules pre-programmed in the FRA .","The operation of the routing advisor is demonstrated by the following example, the steps of which are depicted in the flow chart shown in . The steps of  may be performed by a program application, such as that described with respect to . At step , starting with the presort accumulator, when frames are ready to be sent to a sequencer segment, the presort accumulator sends a request message to the Frame Routing Agent. The message identifies the ID of the sequencer segment to which the frames will be sent. The message requests that the routing path to the sequencer segment be returned. The message may be sent using any suitable communication protocol, such as, for example, the Internet, intranet, LAN, wireless, etc.","At step , the routing advisor receives the request message and looks up the sequencer segment ID in the system transport map. Based upon the target sequencer segment ID, the available transport lanes and switches defined in the system transport map, and any predefined decision rules and\/or logic, the routing advisor determines one of two unique routing paths: a path to the target (e.g., specified) sequencer segment, if that sequencer segment is available, as determined by the status of the routing switches; or a path to a different available sequencer segment, as determined by the status of the routing switches.","At step , the routing advisor returns a response message that includes the selected routing path. For example, the routing path that a shuttle would travel from the first presort accumulator to the second Sequencer segment in  is represented by the following data sequence, in which the switch ID is followed by a \u201c\/\u201d followed by the switch position (R, C, or L for right, center, or left):","MS\/R-MS\/C-MS\/R-MS\/C-MS\/C-MS\/C-MS\/L-MS\/C-MS\/C-SEQ","At step , the presort accumulator hands off the frames and frame manifest to the transport controller subsystem, and also provides the determined routing path to the transport controller.","At step , the transport controller receives the frames, manifest, and routing path. The group of frames enters the collection point into which the frames are put into a frame transport shuttle. The transport controller subsystem uses the routing path to direct the shuttle through the transport. The routing path defines the switches to move the shuttle through and the switch positions that should be thrown for the routing to occur. The transport controller manages the traffic of shuttles throughout the transport, including, for example: moving each shuttle independently, staging each shuttle through the network of switches, and temporarily directing shuttles into spurs to alleviate bottlenecks.","At step , once the shuttle reaches the end of the routing path, the shuttle is docked and the frames unloaded. The frames enter the sequencer segment and after initial sequencing of the frames is completed, the sequencer segment sends a request message to the Frame Routing Agent, which identifies the ID of the Storage Segment to send the frames to. The message requests the routing path to the Storage Segment be returned.","At step , the routing advisor receives the request message and looks up the Storage Segment ID in the system transport map. The routing advisor then determines the path to the specified Storage Segment, as determined by the status of the routing switches.","At step , the routing advisor returns a response message that includes the selected routing path. At step , the sequencer segment hands off the frames and frame manifest to the transport controller subsystem. It also provides the selected routing path to the transport controller.","At step , the transport controller receives the frames, manifest, and routing path. The group of frames enters the collection point into which they are again put into a frame transport shuttle. As in step , the transport controller uses the routing path to direct the shuttle through the transport. At step , once the shuttle reaches the end of the routing path, the shuttle is docked and the frames unloaded into the Storage Segment.","In embodiments, after a shuttle is emptied at an undocking station, the empty shuttle may be returned to a docking station to receive another group of frames. Shuttles are returned on a dedicated set of transport lanes, which may be located in a plane at a different height from the transport that delivers filled shuttles. Additionally, the system transport map may also contain the routing paths for the return of empty shuttle returns, although the transport network for shuttle returns may be much simpler (i.e., fewer switches and spurs) than the main transport.","In implementations, the lanes of the transport network of the entire facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system move generally in one of two directions. Lanes operating in the first direction transport loaded shuttles (e.g., containing frames) from one component to the next, while lanes operating in the second direction return empty shuttles to their collection points. Each direction of transport provides at least two paths to each destination for redundancy.","In accordance with aspects of the invention, the movement of mail pieces within a facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system having plural redundant paths and components places emphasis on determining where each mail piece is destined and how each mail piece should reach its intended destination. In embodiments, the process is controlled by the Frame Routing Agent and coordinated by real-time location notifications from each system segment to the Frame Routing Agent, and the interchange of request\/response messages between each system segment and the Frame Routing Agent to determine best-path routing.","Optionally, as shuttles are moved through the transport, it may be necessary to stage a shuttle into a spur. Spurs provide a short-term buffer area that helps relieve congestion through the transport and at undocking stations. Spurs could either be \u201cdead end\u201d spurs, which would operate as a \u201clast in first out\u201d (LIFO) buffer, or as a \u201cthrough loop\u201d that would operate as a \u201cfirst in first out\u201d (FIFO) buffer.","Although this invention describes a method for controlling and coordinating the transport of mail pieces contained in frames that are contained in shuttles, the invention is not limited to the use of shuttles. Instead, methods described herein may alternatively be used to control and coordinate the transport of individual mail pieces (without frames or shuttles) or mail pieces contained in frames (without shuttles) through multiple paths.","The present invention relates to a split pathway induction unit used in a presorting unit and a method to control and coordinate the movement of products, e.g., mail pieces (letters and flats), into frames via a conveyance system having a plurality of split pathways. In embodiments, products (hereinafter referred to as mail pieces) are directed into one of many different split pathways towards a respective frame inserter for induction into frames and for entry into, e.g., a mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. In embodiments, the split pathway induction unit can feed mail pieces at about a rate of 40,000 mail pieces per hour, and with the use of the present invention, each of these mail pieces can be inserted reliably into a frame at a frame inserter mechanism. This can be performed without bottlenecks occurring at the frame inserter, as the mail pieces are split into different pathways such that more than one frame inserter can be used for a single induction unit. Thus, the present invention provides an apparatus and a related method to allow for an efficient and reliable mail induction operation, thereby ensuring that the mail pieces can be properly inserted into frames regardless of the output of the induction unit.","Processing restraints of existing induction systems may include, inter alia, limits on the amount of time given to process a predetermined volume of mail pieces, and structural limitations (e.g., due to vibration, weight, etc.) of the system for processing a given volume of mail pieces in a given amount of time. As a result of these restraints, the existing systems are unable to keep up with the demands of, e.g., the U.S. Postal System, to process and deliver mail pieces to mail recipients in an acceptable amount of time. A solution is to provide the induction unit with split pathways of the present invention.","In embodiments, the split pathway induction unit increases the amount of time allotted for inducting the mail pieces into the frames and thus allows for reliable frame insertion of mail pieces. This is accomplished by diverting mail pieces from a single induction unit (e.g., input feeder) to separate pathways. These pathways, in turn, feed the mail pieces to a respective frame inserter. Thus, it is now possible to use two or more frame inserters for each induction unit, thereby permitting ample time for the frame inserters to insert mail pieces into its respective frame. The induction unit of the present invention also reduces kinetic energy build-up by allowing more time for opening frames and reliably and stably inserting the mail pieces within the frame for entry into the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","The present invention also contemplates best-path routing of the mail pieces. That is, movement of the mail pieces before, during, and after induction is controlled by the present invention to perform best-path routing, such that throughput of the mail pieces through any given pathway is reduced and bottlenecking is avoided. For example, in the configuration of the present invention, the induction unit is provided with additional operational time to perform desired functions such as an induction of the mail pieces into the frame and then into the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system, respectively.","The best-path routing may be controlled by a control unit (as implemented in the computing infrastructure shown in ) and is coordinated by real-time location notifications from a plurality of sensors and monitors (discussed throughout the instant application) to the control unit (also referred to as a Frame Routing Agent). The plurality of sensors and monitors are provided at various locations along the induction unit to detect and monitor the products (hereinafter referred to as mail pieces) traveling through the induction unit. The plurality of sensors and monitors communicate data regarding the mail pieces (e.g., location within the induction unit, destination outside the induction unit, speed, mailing information (e.g., state, ZIP code, etc.) back to the control unit. Thus, an exchange of requests from the control unit and responses from the plurality of sensors and monitors aids in the determination of best-path routing through the induction unit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0904","num":"1106"},"figref":"FIGS. 17A-17C","b":["1700","1700","1705","1705","1705","1710","1705"]},"The mail pieces are fed from the feeder  to the pathway  which, in turn, feeds mail pieces to a plurality of split pathways  extending from the pathway  and towards a respective frame inserter .

Additionally, mail pieces not directed to one of the plurality of split pathways  may be directed to a reject unit  () of the pathway , wherein it may be re-entered into the system at a later time to be re-processed for induction or extraction.","The plurality of frame inserters  are configured to receive individual mail pieces from the plurality of split pathways  and to place the individual mail pieces into frames, which were provided from multiple frame induction pathways .

The invention also provides a system and method for buffering mail pieces contained in or supported in individual mail frames or clamps in a facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system during completion of address recognition (in particular, video encoding).","Letters and flats mail pieces (generally referred to as mail pieces), when inducted into a sorting system, may require address recognition be performed to obtain address information. These mail pieces should be temporarily buffered until address recognition operations (e.g., automatic address resolution and\/or video encoding) are completed.

If the configurable time threshold has elapsed, the mail pieces can be extracted from the frames and\/or clamps and removed from the system. This solution is advantageous because, among other things, it precludes the need to reject and re-feed mail pieces while waiting for an address result. Buffering mail pieces thus saves operational time and work force labor.","The frame buffer function of the present invention provides a staging area for frames (and\/or clamps) containing a mail piece for which address results are not yet available (i.e., the image is being video encoded).

In this regard, the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) of the present invention provides for the merging of DPS letters and DPS flats, which previously had to be separately sorted and sequenced by different machines (i.e., due to differences in size and shape). This increases the efficiency of the postal system by reducing the manual effort required to process and deliver mail of different types. More simply put, the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) is capable of accepting DPS letters and DPS flats, and merging the DPS letters and DPS flats together into a single stream of mail pieces for delivery.","Currently, the United States Postal Service (USPS) sorts a large percentage of mail to DPS using multiple passes on Delivery Bar Code Sorters (DBCSs). USPS is also in the process of deploying a Flats Sequencing System (FSS) which sorts flats to DPS using multiple passes. The separated DPS flats and DPS letters are then manually merged by a postal employee (e.g., mail carrier) prior to delivery at the delivery point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0987","num":"1197"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},"Additionally, the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) of the present invention may utilize the technologies described herein for meeting only a smaller part of the facility's mail processing requirements. In this regard, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004\/0211709 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","In further detail, still referring to , in the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) of the present invention, letters mail may be sequenced to DPS using existing technology, e.g., DBCS. Similarly, flats mail may be sequenced to DPS using existing technology, e.g., Advanced Flats Sortation Machines (AFSM 100s), Upgraded Flats Sorting Machines (UFSM 1000s), or the Flats Sequencing Systems (FSS machines), known to those of skill in the art. Subsequent to the separate sequencing of DPS letters and DPS flats by existing technology, the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) accepts the previously separated DPS letters and DPS flats in batches of some number of mail pieces. In this regard, each batch may be contained in, e.g., a container or tray (or any other suitable holding area).","In embodiments, the separated DPS letters and DPS flats are inserted into an induction system of the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) and merged together by inserting individual mail pieces (i.e., DPS letters and DPS flats) into frames. This provides the individual mail pieces with a substantially uniform shape and\/or size. The frame induction system as well as the transporting and\/or merging systems are described in the instant application and are incorporated into the present invention.","In yet another non-limiting embodiment, the invention may accept DPS letters and DPS flats in separate continuous streams from the upstream machines (e.g., DBCSs and AFSMs). Thus, in this embodiment, the separated DPS letters and DPS flats may be continuously inserted into the induction system of the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) and merged together by inserting individual mail pieces (i.e., DPS letters and DPS flats) into frames. In other words, in the aforementioned embodiment, DPS letters and DPS flats may be introduced directly into (e.g., from the DBCSs and AFSMs by a transportation subsystem (TSUB) which connects an output end of the DBCSs and AFSMs to the system of the present invention) the system of the present invention without any manual intervening steps.","For example, an inductor of the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) of the present invention may be provided with letter frame inserter(s) (LFI) appropriately sized for introducing DPS letters into the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) and flats frame inserter(s) (FFI) appropriately sized for introducing DPS flats into the mail-merger processing system (MMPS). Accordingly, the frame inserter(s) (LFI and FFI) may insert the DPS letters and flats into the frames. Subsequently, the DPS letters and the DPS flats may be introduced into a portion of the mail processing system which may include the right angle divert (RAD) and other conveying mechanisms in order to merge the DPS flats and letters together in a DPS order. Therefore, after the DPS letters and the DPS flats have been merged into a mixed stream (MS) (i.e., a stream including both DPS letters and the DPS flats) they may be extracted from the frames for delivery to an appropriate destination.","It should be appreciated that the DPS letters and DPS flats may be merged into any number of mixed stream (MS), and extracted from the frames for delivery to any number of destinations. For example, it is contemplated that the DPS letters and flats may enter the system downstream from unsequenced mail pieces. More specifically, the DPS letters and DPS flats may be inserted into the sequenced mixed mail stream at a location where the other mail pieces (which are being sequenced in the system of the invention) is at the same sequencing stage. This ensures that the DPS letters and DPS flats do not have to needlessly be sequenced and thereby increasing the efficiency of the MMPS.","In further embodiments, saturation mail may be inserted into the sequenced mixed mail at any stage of the sequencing process. In one example, the saturation mail may be inserted into the mixed mail at a final sequencing stage or at a stage prior to the mail, in sequence, being extracted from the frames. Saturation mail can also be sequenced with the mixed mail as the mail pieces are being extracted from the frames. In this example, the saturation mail would not need to be inserted into a frame, but instead would be injected directly from a hopper into the sequenced mail as the mail is extracted from each frame. This can be done by way of a pinch belt feeding mechanism, for example. It is further contemplated by the invention to include an address printer or address label printer to print addresses on the saturation mail prior to it being inserted into the sequenced mixed mail. In any of these embodiments, the insertion of the saturation mail advantageously allows for less storage requirements for the saturation mail and, in embodiments, provides additional facility floor space for other operations (other than the storage of the saturation mail).","In further embodiments, residual mail may be inserted into the sequenced mixed mail at any stage of the sequencing process. In one example, the residual mail, in a sequenced order, may be inserted into the mixed mail at a final sequencing stage or at a stage prior to the mail, in sequence, being extracted from the frames. In this case, the residual mail may also be placed in frames prior to the insertion. Residual mail can also be sequenced with the mixed mail as the mixed mail pieces are being extracted from the frames. In this example, the residual mail, which is in a sequenced order, would not need to be inserted into a frame, but instead would be injected directly into the stream of the sequenced mixed mail by way of a pinch belt feeding mechanism, for example. Prior to the insertion of the residual mail, an address or other identification of the residual mail is read or manually keyed by an operator such that the residual mail can be inserted into the proper location of the sequenced mixed mail.","In any of these embodiments, the insertion of the residual mail will eliminate the need to manually sequence (intermix) the residual mail with already sequenced mail, or have the residual mail placed in a separate bin for a postal carrier. Advantageously, in any of the embodiments, manual processing steps can be eliminated or reduced, as well as eliminating the need for a separate bin for the residual mail for the postal carrier.","Additionally, the mail-merger processing system (MMPS) may be provided with buffering and storage (BF\/S) capabilities. For example, buffering and\/or storage (BF\/S) may be provided between outputs of the DPS letters and DPS flats and frame inserter(s) (LFI and FFI). Further, buffering and\/or storage (BF\/S) may also be provided between an output of the frame inserter(s) (LFI and FFI) and an input of the right angle divert (RAD) or other portion of the system. In this regard, since the present invention is useful in automatically merging DPS letters and DPS flats, DPS letters and DPS flats (as they become available) may be input into the present system and buffered and\/or stored (BF\/S) until it is determined that sufficient DPS letters and DPS flats are present and should be merged, sequenced, sorted, etc.","Additionally, after the DPS letters and DPS flats are merged the mail pieces may be extracted from the frames and placed in a tray(s) intended for any number of desirable destinations (e.g., for delivery to any number of street addresses).","Further, it should be appreciated that, upon extraction, the frames may remain within the mail-merger processing system so that the frames may be re-used by returning the frames to a beginning of a cycle (e.g., a point in the mail-merger processing system where insertion of the mail pieces occur). In this regard, the frames may be cycled continuously from a point in the system where mail piece insertion occurs, to a point in the system where buffering occurs, to a point in the system where merging of the DPS letters and DPS flats occur, to a point in the system where mail piece extraction occurs, and returning the frames back to the point in the system where mail piece insertion occurs.","Further, it should be appreciated that the mail processing system of the present invention may be employed as an intermediary transitional system while transitioning to a facility-wide solution of the present invention. In this regard, the mail processing system of the present invention may be scaled to a certain size, e.g., a scaled system containing only the subsystems required for processing mail such as, for example, a base module, a scaled down base module, or a modular system including an expansion module, as described in other aspects of the facility wide mail processing system.","The invention is directed generally to a user interface for mail handling equipment and, more particularly, to a methods and systems utilizing a user interface to perform plural functions in a centralized flat and letter facility-wide mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.

Such training usually takes place at a centralized site (e.g., a regional mail center). However, because of high turn-over rates in the employment of operators, it is relatively difficult and expensive to keep operators trained. Moreover, this difficulty is compounded by updates to existing equipment, which may require re-training.","According to aspects of the invention, the user interface  provided a fast, flexible, and relatively inexpensive way to train operators. In embodiments, this training can take the form of determining if an operator has taken the training when he or she first logs on to the system, and if not, giving the training on-line before the operator is permitted to run the machine. The training may also include periodic retraining, on-line tests, and safety training (e.g., lock-out\/tag out, conveyor safety, etc).","By providing training through the user interface , an operator may be trained using any suitable computing device  such as that shown an described with reference to . This allows the operator to be up to date without having the high expense of instructor-led off-site training.

For example, when a problem occurs in the system, the user interface may be used to present a visual screen to a user to help diagnose the problem. More specifically, the system may be provided with artificial intelligence (e.g., using Bayesian Analysis techniques) that is utilized to associate machinery problem symptoms to maintainer actions. As maintenance actions occur, the program incorporates repair actions into its database, and the system updates its fault troubleshooting procedures based on the most relevant repair issues in the database.","When a subsequent event (e.g., problem) occurs and is detected by the system manager, the system determines symptoms of the event and searches its database for similar symptoms.

If no bar code or ID tag is detected, the system may choose to either hold out the mail piece from further processing and place it in a holdout bin , or apply the next step in the induction process.","In step S, if a mail piece does not already have an ID tag or an address result, an ID tag is applied to the mail piece. The ID tag provides a lookup key into the ICS for address results. At this point in the process, all mail pieces must have either an ID tag or address result.","In step S, any known engine performs automatic address recognition to determine whether the address is a recognizable address. The engine is either an \u201con-board\u201d (i.e., directly encapsulated within the induction process) or part of a centralized address recognition system under the control of a centralized control unit in, for example, the computer infrastructure of the invention. Either way, an address result is returned from the engine. The address result can be either (1) a finalized address, (2) a partial address, or (3) no address. A mail piece may be held out from further processing and placed in a holdout bin , if for example, the address is outside of the local delivery area.","In step S, the image may be sent to a remote encoding (i.e., video coding) system, if the automatic address recognition can not achieve a finalized address. Personnel, who are referred to as video coders, work at manual keying stations, and they attempt to resolve the address. Again, a mail piece may be held out from further processing and placed in a holdout bin  if the address cannot be finalized or, for example, the address is outside of the local delivery area. Address results from video coding are retrieved from the ICS.","In step S, an arbitration process or address selection (of a known type) determines which address result (automatic address recognition or remote encoding) should be selected. An example of these rules is depicted in . For example, a determination is made whether there is a barcode in step S, and if there is no barcode, a determination is made in step S whether there is an ICS result. If there is no barcode result and no ICS result, then a determination is made in step S that there should be no sorting of the mail piece. However, if there is a ICS result in step S, then the address selection is based in step S on the ICS alone. If there is a barcode result in step S, then a determination is also made in step S whether there is an ICS result. If there is no ICS result and only a barcode result, then the address is based on the barcode alone in step S. If there is both an ICS result and a barcode result, then a determination is made in step S regarding the length of the results. In step S, a determination is made whether the results are the same. If the results are the same, then it is determined in step S that the barcode and ICS ZIP code agree, and an address selection is made based on the ICS and barcode results. If the results are the not same, then it is determined in step S that the barcode and ICS ZIP code differ, and that address selection should be based on the barcode result. If the results of step S are not the same, then it is determined in step S whether the barcode is longer. If the barcode is longer, an address selection is made in step S based on the barcode result. If the barcode is not longer, a determination is made in step S whether the first five digits of the results agree. If the first five digits of the results do not agree, then an address selection is made in step S based on the barcode result. If the first five digits of the results agree, then an address selection is made in step S based on the ICS result","Referring back to , in step S, if required, detection and verification of mail indicia, including metered mail, is performed. Mail pieces may be held out from sequencing and placed in a holdout bin , if specific indicia can be detected or verified.","In step S, the address result and image are sent to an external system that checks for address redirection. The external system currently used by the U.S. Postal Service is the Postal Automated Redirection System (PARS), which uses a National Change of Address (NCOA) database. For mail pieces that have an address bar code, PARS returns a redirection status directly. For mail pieces that have only an ID tag, PARS sets the redirection status in the ICS. Mail pieces that are flagged for redirection are held out from acceptance into the system, and placed in a holdout bin .","Embodiments of the present invention either provide an integrated address redirection system or provide an interface to the existing PARS system. If the PARS system determines that a mail piece needs to be redirected, the system of the present invention is notified, and the mail piece is moved to the redirection holdout bin .","Referring now to , a more detailed flow chart illustrates steps S-S. In step S, if only an address bar code is found on the mail piece, the address is sent to the address redirection system  to determine if the mail piece should be held out for redirection via an address redirection system interface . In step S, if only an ID tag is found on the mail piece, the ID tag is queried in the ICS  to retrieve the address. Address redirection status is retrieved from the ICS  to determine if the mail piece should be accepted or held out for redirection in the redirection holdout bin . In step S, if both an address bar code and an ID tag are found on the mail piece, a selection or arbitration process at step S is followed to select the best address to use (i.e., the address on the mail piece or the address in the ICS ). The selected address is sent to the address redirection system  via the interface  to determine if the mail piece should be held out for redirection in the redirection holdout bin  or accepted.","If no address bar code or ID tag is found on the mail piece, then in step S an ID tag is applied to the mail piece and then automatic address recognition is attempted in step S. If a finalized address result is returned at step S, then the address is sent to the address redirection system  to determine if the mail piece should be held out for redirection in the redirection holdout bin  or accepted. If the address is not finalized, in step S, a video coding task is initiated to attempt to resolve the non-finalized address via a video coding system . While the video coding task is being performed, mail pieces are buffered in a staging area . The ICS  is checked for an address result by looking up the ID tag on the mail piece. The ICS  is checked periodically until either an address result is found or a configurable video coding time threshold is exceeded. If an address result is found, redirection status is retrieved from the ICS  to determine if the mail piece should be held out for redirection. If no address result is found or the timeout is exceeded, the mail piece is held out from further processing in manual holdout bin .","Buffering mail pieces in the staging area , while the addresses of the mail pieces are being determined or verified, provides a significant advantage over current systems. Such buffering allows substantially more time to determine or verify an address on the mail pieces which are potential holdouts from the system. Accordingly, this additional opportunity substantially increases the number of mail pieces which can be sequenced automatically, and reduces the number of mail pieces which must be processed manually or redirected to other external systems.","The process of inserting letters and flats mail pieces into individualized transport devices (frames) for sorting, after having been singulated and fed, has a long history of problems, particularly with regard to article insertion jams. In this regard, mail sorting\/sequencing machines, within the United States Postal Service (USPS) and other organizations, frequently use an insertion process whereby each article is initially synchronized to an adjacent individualized transport device, after which it is inserted into the transport device, but only after a required change of travel direction. Sorting\/sequencing machines, such as the AFSM-100 (Automated Flats Sorting Machine) used by the USPS, utilize such a method by transporting mail pieces to a position directly above its targeted transport device, at which time the successive mail pieces come to a complete stop, changing direction 90 degrees, and then being inserted into the targeted transport device.","Within the facility-wide letters\/flats sequencing system, the invention utilizes a component in the form of an \u201cinserter\u201d to provide the function of removing the mail piece variability from sorting\/sequencing considerations by placing the mail pieces into individualized transport devices, i.e., frames, described in greater detail elsewhere in the instant application. In embodiments, the inserter includes pinch belts that are synchronized with the frames at a certain position in order to insert mail pieces therein. These frames\/folders, referred to generally as \u201cframes,\u201d have common physical attributes, i.e., they have a common form factor, which make them suitable for automated manipulation, while containing individual mail pieces (with their inherent variability in size and shape) within their common perimeter.","To improve insertion process performance, the invention maintains the leading edge of the singulated mail pieces, thereby eliminating the need to stop and re-accelerate the article for insertion, as is done in the prior art. Thus, the invention improves upon the prior art by not requiring the mail pieces to stop and re-accelerate just prior to insertion. The smoother transition of the singulated article into the transport device, i.e., into the frame improves the overall performance of the insertion process. Particularly, the invention would reduce the prevalence of mail piece jams which are a source of concern with apparatus such as the aforementioned AFSM-100.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1051","num":"1261"},"figref":"FIG. 26A","b":["1","2","3","1","2","2","3","1","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1052","num":"1262"},"figref":"FIG. 26B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1053","num":"1263"},"figref":["FIGS. 26C and 26D","FIG. 26B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1054","num":"1264"},"figref":"FIG. 26E","b":["2614","2601","2604","2605","2602","2602","2611"]},"Because the processing system of the invention encompasses the use of so-called heavy-duty frames as well as the use of light-duty frames, as described elsewhere herein, the pre-synchronizer transport section  depicts separate pathways ,  for letters and flats, respectively, and the stream  of empty frames is depicted in  as a mixed stream of empty frames.","As the mail pieces travel within the pre-synchronizer transport section , their mail piece data (i.e., address destination, size, weight, and current position along the pinch belt path) is identified by a plurality of mail piece data collection devices , which effects subsequent diversion by one of the diverters ,  (for letters and flats, respectively) into one of the light-duty or heavy-duty pathways ,  of the mail\/frame synchronization arrangement .","As each mail piece is synchronized by the target frame synchronizer  of the arrangement , as it approaches the stream of empty frames, one of the inserters , i.e., a pinch belt arrangement, e.g., inserts it into a respective one of the frames F. The insertion can be accomplished by simply \u201cshooting\u201d the mail piece into the frame, while maintaining the original direction of the mail piece at the frame opener\/closer , which is one of a plurality of frame openers and closers, which synchronizes the position of the empty frames F with the incoming mail pieces M. This synchronization can be performed by the main control system implemented in the computing infrastructure of , generally represented in  as . As an illustrative example, after each mail piece is read, by means of OCR or BCR, e.g., it is inserted into a respective frame by synchronizing the placement of the frame and the position of the mail piece, such as, e.g., by use of encoders, photodiodes, etc. The placement of the frame, in a particular embodiment, is in the path of the mail piece, e.g., aligned with the pinch belt mechanism.","With the apparatus and method of the invention, there is no need to stop and reaccelerate the mail pieces just prior to insertion, particularly inasmuch as the inserter maintains the leading edge of the singulated mail piece. The smoother transition of the mail piece into the frame improves the overall performance of the insertion process. In this regard, rather than being a fixed-piece arrangement, such as a prior art carousel into which pieces are stopped and dropped from above, the transport path  can present empty frames F to the inserters  by variable movement of the frames (by means of compression and decompression according to methods and apparatus described elsewhere herein). In addition to variable movement of frames F within path  and\/or instead of such variable movement, synchronization of the mail pieces m with the empty frames F can be accomplished by relative movement of the inserters . Such movement of the inserters  is depicted in , by arrows, as a pivoting or slewing movement. Because the leading edge of each of the mail pieces is maintained and the mail pieces are not decelerated, stopped, and then accelerated to accomplish insertion into the frames, insertion jams are greatly reduced.","Further, the leading edge of the mail pieces can be maintained whether insertion is through a side opening of a frame or whether insertion is from above into a top opening of a frame. In this regard,  shows an alternate method of insertion in accordance with aspects of the invention. As schematically shown therein, the mail piece M is inserted into a frame F by means of an inserter from above, while maintaining leading edge orientation. Despite top insertion of the mail pieces, there is no stopping of the mail piece prior to insertion. As in the previously described embodiment, the respective movements of the mail pieces and frames are synchronized and the insertion of the mail pieces within frames is then accomplished without stopping either the mail pieces or the stream of frames.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1060","num":"1270"},"figref":["FIG. 26G","FIG. 26E"]},"As shown in , a rotary inserter  can be used to insert mail, such as letters and flats, into respective frames. By way of example, the rotary inserters include two pinch belts , . As the mail passes between the pinch belts, it is inserted within the frames as the empty frames F are automatically expanded about a radius of the frame, before continuing along the transport path  carrying respective mail pieces M. (The frames open as they revolve around a carousel.) The rotary inserter, in embodiments, has the capability of about 35,000 insertions per hour. In implementation, it is contemplated that there would be one inserter for every DBCS or every two FSM machines.","Following insertion, as explained elsewhere herein, the successful insertion of the specific mail piece into the specific frame is reported to the main control system for subsequent tracking and processes. The main control system can then coordinate the movement of the frames throughout the system. Additionally, the control system can also match the ID of the mail with the frame, maintain track of the frames in the system, as well as perform other functions described herein.","The invention relates generally to transportation of objects within a facility and, more particularly, to a method and system to track the movement of mail containers (e.g., frames) throughout a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sequencing system (also referred to herein as a facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system). According to aspects of the invention, a Frame Tracking Agent (FTA) maintains a data structure that defines a location for each frame in the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. Through communication with subsystems of the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system when frames are moved from one subsystem to the next, the FTA continuously updates a data structure, such that a location history of every frame (and, therefore, mail piece) in the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system can be provided.","More specifically, in embodiments, when a subsystem of the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system physically moves a bundle of frames to another subsystem, the sending subsystem creates and transmits a manifest of the frames to the FTA. In embodiments, the manifest is a data structure that contains various information associated with the frames (e.g., frame ID, sending location, receiving location, timestamp, etc.). The FTA receives the manifest and updates a location repository that contains a location history for each frame currently within the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. By creating manifests at each sending and receiving location for each move of frames between subsystems, and by storing the manifest data in the location repository, the movement of each frame throughout the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system may be tracked. Moreover, the data stored in the location repository can be used to detect missing frames and to perform validation metrics and mail flow metrics.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1065","num":"1275"},"figref":"FIG. 27A","b":["2700","2700","2702","2702"]},"For example, in embodiments, the induction manager subsystem  operates to induct mail pieces (e.g., letter and flats) into the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system . Induction may include, among other things, reading address information from each mail piece and transmitting that address information (e.g., address result) to a system manager . The induction may also include, for example, sending each mail piece to a frame inserter subsystem  after address capture.","In embodiments, the frame inserter subsystem  inserts each single mail piece into a container, referred to throughout this disclosure as a frame. According to aspects of the invention described elsewhere in the instant application, each frame has a unique identification (e.g., frame ID), and the mail piece inserted into the frame is associated with that frame ID while the mail piece is processed in the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system.","Still referring to , after mail pieces are inserted into and associated with frames, the frame is passed to a presort accumulator subsystem . In embodiments, the presort accumulator subsystem  groups frames together in bundles according to predetermined criteria, and sends the bundles to the sequencer subsystem  where the frames are sequenced into a delivery point sequence. The bundles of frames are moved from the from the sequencer subsystem  to a storage subsystem , and ultimately to a container loader . Presort accumulators, sequencers, storage, and container loaders are described in greater detail elsewhere in the instant application, such that further explanation is not believed necessary here.","In embodiments, the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system also includes at least one transport controller  that coordinates the movement of mail pieces between components of at least the presort accumulator, sequencer, storage subsystems , , . For example, the transport controller  operates to control the loading of frames into a shuttle from component \u201cA\u201d (e.g., a presort accumulator), the movement of the shuttle from component \u201cA\u201d to component \u201cB\u201d (e.g., a sequencer segment), and the unloading of the frames from the shuttle into component \u201cB\u201d (e.g., via a shuttle unloader).","According to further aspects of the invention, the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system  includes a Frame Tracking Agent (FTA) . In embodiments, the FTA  is a real-time, high availability server that manages location data of frames and checks for missing frames. The FTA  may be implemented in the environment of .","In implementations, when a mail piece is inserted into a frame at the frame inserter subsystem , the mail piece ID and frame ID are transmitted to the FTA . The transmission of the mail piece ID and frame ID, and all other data transmissions described herein, may take place using any suitable communication protocol, including, but not limited to: the Internet, an intranet, LAN, WAN, and wireless. In embodiments, the LAN or WAN, for example, can be segmented between subsystems in order to minimize overall congestion on the network, as discussed in the instant application. In embodiments, based upon the transmitted mail piece ID and frame ID, the FTA  creates an association between the mail piece and frame in a location repository , which also may be a database shown in . In particular embodiments, this association identifies the mail piece, the frame the mail piece is contained in, and the address result of the mail piece destination.","As described above, frames containing mail pieces are moved in groups or bundles throughout the system (e.g., between presort accumulator  and sequencer ). In embodiments, when a group of frames is loaded into a shuttle and moved between subsystems, the sending subsystem creates (or updates) a frame manifest and sends the manifest to both the receiving subsystem and the FTA . The frame manifest may include various information, including, but not limited to: the frame ID of each frame in the shuttle; the shuttle ID; the order that the frames are loaded into (e.g., arranged in) the shuttle; a timestamp of when the manifest is created; an ID of the subsystem that created the manifest; and the address result associated with each frame ID.","When a shuttle arrives at the receiving subsystem, the receiving subsystem creates (or updates) a manifest of the frames received and transmits the manifest to the FTA . In embodiments, the FTA  updates the location repository  each time it receives a manifest. In this manner, the location of each frame is recorded as the frame travels throughout the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system. Since frames are re-used in the facility wide sorting and\/or sequencing system, when a mail piece is removed from a frame, data associated with the frame ID is deleted from the location repository . In this manner, when the frame is used again in the future, a new entry may be created for the frame ID in the location repository . Accordingly, the location repository  may be considered to be a transient data store.","According to aspects of the invention, the FTA  also includes a data integrity module  and a data aggregation module . In embodiments, the data integrity module  comprises a programming module (e.g., a program control, such as that described with respect to ) that analyzes data in the location repository  to detect missing frames. Generally speaking, a missing frame may be defined as a frame whose actual (physical) location does not match the expected location of the frame via the manifest and location repository. For example, a missing frame might include a frame that does not arrive at its intended destination (as defined by a manifest). Similarly, a missing frame might include a frame that arrives unexpectedly at a location (e.g., not on a manifest). The data integrity module  analyzes the data of the location repository  to detect such situations, which indicate that the frame either did not show up where expected or showed up somewhere unexpected. Missing frames may be caused, for example, by conditions where a frame or set of frames are removed from the system to fix a jam, and then not re-entered into the system or are re-entered into another portion of the system.","In embodiments, the data integrity module  performs a missing frame analysis on a periodic basis, as defined by a timer  (e.g., clock) programmed in the FTA . The period of time between each missing frame analysis may be defined by a user who defines the time period in the timer  (e.g., via user input and\/or appropriate programming).","In embodiments, when the data integrity module  detects a missing frame, data associated with the missing frame (e.g., frame ID, date detected, location history, etc.) is stored in persistent memory in a validation metrics data store . Data from the validation metrics data store  may be pushed or pulled to a user interface . The interface  may be implemented on any suitable computing device, such as, for example, a computer, personal digital assistant, the I\/O device of , etc. Data provided by the FTA  and displayed with the interface may include, for example: immediate notification of a number of missing frames exceeding a threshold; periodic reports associated with missing frames over a predetermined period of time; user requested reports associated with missing frames over a user-defined period of time, etc. Such reports may be used by facility personnel to analyze trends including, but not limited to: data associated with a group of missing frames, data associated with a subsystem where missing frames are frequently detected, etc.","Still referring to , the FTA  may also include a data aggregation module . In embodiments, the data aggregation module  comprises a programming module (e.g., a program control, such as that described with respect to ) that utilizes data in the location repository  to aggregate data about the flow of frames throughout the system. For example, by accessing the location and time history of how frames move throughout the system (as stored in the location repository ), the data aggregation module  may generate reports that indicate: processing rate of the entire system; processing rate of particular subsystems; and processing rate of particular components, just to name afew. It should be noted that the data aggregation module  is not limited to these specific types of reports, and any suitable aggregation of the data stored in the location repository  may be performed by the data aggregation module .","Similar to the data integrity module , the data aggregation module  may also be run periodically as controlled by the timer . However, the data integrity module  and the data aggregation module  need not run on the same schedule, and timer  may be programmed to actuate the two modules ,  on different schedules (e.g., at different predetermined intervals).","In embodiments, data aggregated by the data aggregation module  may be stored in persistent memory in a mail flow metrics data store . Similar to the validation metrics data store , data from the mail flow metrics data store  may be pushed or pulled to a user interface .","As discussed supra, the location of a frame is described by a location ID that is stored in the location repository .

According to aspects of the invention, the stackable cart has a hinged bottom that is biased to an intermediate position. When an object, such as a mail tray, is placed on the bottom, the bottom pivots downward to a horizontal position and supports the object. On the other hand, when empty stackable carts are nested together, a first cart inserted into a second cart causes the bottom to pivot upward to an almost vertical position, to facilitate compact stacking of the carts. In this manner, substantial space savings may be obtained by nesting carts that are not in use.

Although four lanes are shown, fewer or more lanes can be utilized depending on, among other things, the size of the mail carts. The trays  are directed into one of the four lanes  by a directional paddle system , for example. The trays  advance down each lane  until they reach a vertical tray lift .","Each lane  provides linear space for multiple trays . In this way, as trays  are received, they can either be fed in parallel down each of the lanes , or staged into a single lane , or any combination thereof, depending on the destination and mail content of each tray .

In one example, the CDD system can be sized or configured for the highest volume day of the week, excluding specific peak days throughout the year (mostly during holiday mailings).

Compression reduces the amount of space between the trays  so as to maximize the capacity of the backbone conveyor .

Multiple lanes can be assigned to a single dispatch area in these circumstances, whereas normally only a single dispatch lane would be allocated.","The invention relates to a method and system for sequencing products or mail pieces within a storage unit. The storage unit cycles the products through the storage unit in at least a first cyclic path and a second cyclic path. Selected products are diverted from the first cyclic path to the second cyclic path. The products are diverted between the first cyclic path and the second cyclic path, in accordance with a sequencing control or algorithm which places all the products in a predetermined delivery point sequence within the storage unit. Finally, the mail pieces from multiple storage units are diverted into a final sequencing lane that places all the products in a delivery point sequence within the entire system.","Delivery Point Sequence","A delivery point is a unique identification for each deliverable address for the United States Postal Service (USPS). For each section of a route such as a city block, numbers 00 to 99 (or other designations) are assigned to each delivery point. The order of delivery points that the mail carrier delivers to is commonly referred to as the \u201cdelivery point sequence\u201d (DPS).","Sequence vs. Sort","The DPS order creates a distinction between sequencing and sorting, where sorted mail is not concerned with the order of delivery, but sequenced mail is arranged in the preferred order of delivery. In addition to the mail being sequenced, a mail carrier must currently sift through at least two mail streams before delivering mail. Typically, a mail carrier is provided with at least a first container of sequenced letters and a second container of sorted or sequenced flats. As the mail carrier delivers mail to a home or delivery point, the mail carrier typically has to retrieve letters from the first container and the flats from a second container. A mail carrier's productivity, therefore, is greatly increased, if a single, mixed mail stream of both flats and letters is sequenced to the mail carrier's delivery or \u201cwalk\u201d order.","Automation of Individual Mail Frames","Automation of the sequencing process preferably involves a system that handles both flats and letters simultaneously, as described in the present application. The resolution of sequenced mail is an individual mail piece for a specific delivery point, whereas the resolution for sorted mail is a batch of mail pieces for a group of delivery points. The automation of sequenced mixed mail dictates that an individual mail piece, e.g., a letter or flat, be placed in individual folders attached to frames, which are described in more detail in the instant application. Since flats and letters vary greatly in physical dimensions, the invention contemplates a frame to process the flats and letters, such that the dimensions of the individual frame will facilitate automation. It should be understood, though, that frame size can also be matched to the size of the mail piece in order to increase the carrying capacity of the system.","45 Degrees & Right Angle Divert (RAD)","According to the system and method of the invention, each individual mail piece is placed in an individual frame that moves through a machine or group of machines. These machines and frames of mail, however, can quickly occupy floor space. To keep the frames in a dense configuration and to facilitate the diversion of mail pieces while being transported through a machine, the frames are normally kept at a 45 degree angle. This orientation allows any frame to be extracted out of or inserted into a moving stream of frames without having to change the speed of the stream. The preferred technique for diverting a frame from the stream is to use a \u201cRight Angle Divert\u201d (RAD) as discussed in embodiments of the instant application. In embodiments, the RAD can divert frames out of a stream in the perpendicular direction of the trailing edge with respect to its current heading.","Vertical Divert","RAD's work on the horizontal plane, but many facilities also have vertical space to occupy. To best utilize the available vertical space, there is a need to divert, move, and store mail vertically. The use of vertical diverting solves this problem by allowing frames to travel up or down inside the embodiment of the invention, which is described in the instant application. Accordingly, diverting the mail in a vertical direction allows mail pieces to be stored in a vertical location, and vertical diverting increases the available storage locations where the mail can be sequenced.","General Concept","The sequencing of mail pieces while in storage, conserves floor space and minimizes the need for additional storage and sequencing units. Since storage takes up the most space relative to other processes in the sequencing system, the method and system of the invention utilizes vertical space for both storage and sequencing. Accordingly, the invention includes the use of a plurality of storage units which accept mail pieces including presorted mail pieces, and then sequence the mail pieces within the storage unit, which is described in the instant application. The sequenced mail pieces from each storage unit are released out to a final sequencing process that outputs from each storage unit into a final DPS order. The sequencing process preferably includes vertically recirculating mail pieces which are sequenced in either small blocks or in progressive increments. It should be understood that the term mail piece is used very broadly to include letters, flats and other objects of various different sizes.","Flow","Referring now to , the general flow of frames begins at the input of mail or an input lane . Preferably, the mail to be sequenced in accordance with the invention has already been inducted into individual frames which are angled at 45 degrees.  includes an exemplary frame F, which may be any one of several different types or embodiments of frames described in the instant invention. As depicted in , the mail pieces may be presorted, and are on lead screws or other conveyances described herein for transportation. As frames travel down the input lane , the frames fill up storage units  on a first come first served basis. RADs  divert the frames from the input lane  into individual storage units . Therefore, before entering the storage\/sequencing unit , frames go through a mechanism  for reorienting the frames to a perpendicular position to allow vertical diverts inside the storage units  to handle them properly in various embodiments. Once a storage\/sequencing unit  is full of frames, it begins to sequence the frames which are described in general terms within this section, but which may have several different embodiments that are described in more detail in other sections of the instant application.","When the sequencing is complete, the frames in each storage\/sequencing unit  should be in DPS order with respect to the other frames in the same unit . After the frames are sequenced, the frames are re-oriented from a perpendicular orientation back into a 45 degree position by orientation mechanism , thereby enabling the frames to be diverted into the stream of a final sequencing lane . The orientation mechanism  can be a mechanical system such as the RAD. The frames from each storage unit  are sequenced with those from other storage units  to create the final DPS order of mail.","The reason for a final pass is that mail pieces flow into the facility throughout the entire day and not all at once. If a machine begins sorting and\/or sequencing with the first batch of mail input, any additional input would make that sequence out of date and it would have to be redone. Although a machine can wait until the end of the day to commence sequencing, it would be an inefficient use of time. Therefore, batches of mail pieces are sequenced throughout the day, and a final sequencing pass is conducted near the dispatch time as described herein.","Sequencing Logic: Numbering","A control unit \u201cC\u201d controls the hardware components - and associated software via a bus \u201cB\u201d. The control unit can be implemented in the computer infrastructure described in , or can be provided in any of the subsystems described herein, depending on the particular architecture of the system. During sequencing, the control unit \u201cC\u201d keeps track of each frame and its relative order in the sequence. Control numbers are assigned to each frame, and the first frame in DPS order inside a storage\/sequencing unit  is assigned number 1 or other designation known to be a first frame. The numbers increment upward to the last frame in DPS order or other alphanumeric order. This scheme is repeated for each storage\/sequencing unit  where the first frame in DPS order with respect to the other frames in that storage unit is designated as the first frame. When the frames come out of the storage units  and into final sequencing, the invention renumbers the frames in all of the units using the same scheme. At this time all the frames are available for sequencing (e.g., numbering), such that the control unit \u201cC\u201d can assign the final DPS order to each mail piece.","Recirculation Zones","Referring now to , embodiments of the invention include a recirculation zone  where the actual sequencing is accomplished within the storage units . Preferred embodiments of the storage units  are illustrated in , and the storage units  include at least one storage area  and one recirculation zone . Other storage units can also be used herein, as described in other sections of the instant application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1134","num":"1358"},"figref":["FIG. 31B","FIG. 31C","FIG. 31C"],"b":["3112","3120","3112","3120","3120","3112","3112","3120"]},"Although there are different approaches for sorting and\/or sequencing within the storage units , the different approaches include the frames cycling inside each storage\/sequencing unit  and sequencing frames until all the frames are sequenced. The sequencing preferably occurs by having the frame at the bottom of the recirculation path merge between the frames on the upper level. A more detailed illustration of the sequencing within a storage\/sequencing unit  is depicted in . From , it can be appreciated that a plurality of frames cycle within the storage\/sequencing unit  in a counterclockwise direction; although the flow can be clockwise when the frames are oriented in a direction opposite to that shown. A vertical divert at point A causes selected frames to be diverted from the bottom path and to be sequenced into a desired location on the upper path. By diverting selected frames from the lower path to the upper path at the appropriate times, the frames can be sequenced in accordance with the desired DPS.","The embodiments of the invention include at least three different approaches for recirculating the mail pieces with the storage\/sequencing unit  in order to sequence the mail pieces. These different approaches are referred to as the \u201chold\u201d, \u201cpush back\u201d, or \u201cfloating divert\u201d approaches.","Hold Approach","The \u201chold\u201d approach includes collecting and sequencing a predetermined number of consecutive mail frames in the recirculation zone  and then attaching the sequenced frames to the growing chain of sequenced frames cycling inside the storage\/sequencing unit . As an example, the recirculation zone  could hold five mail pieces (e.g., frames), and the five mail pieces could be assigned numbers 11-15. As these mail pieces pass by the recirculation zone , they are captured and sequenced. In order to sequence these mail pieces, the captured mail pieces cycle inside the recirculation zone until the appropriate next lowest number of the chain is near the top of the recirculation path. If numbers 11, 12, 14 and 15 were captured and 13 was approaching, the frames inside would cycle until number 12 was at the top of the recirculation path so that number 13 could be accepted into the recirculation zone in relative order. Now mail pieces 11-15 wait for the already sequenced pieces 1-10 to pass by, and the recirculation zone  releases numbers 11-15 in order for them to be attached to the passing chain. Once attached, pieces 1-15 are sequenced and cycling throughout the storage\/sequencing unit .","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrates the steps of the \u201chold\u201d approach. In step S, the presorted mail pieces, which are assigned numbers or other designations such as alphanumeric designations (hereinafter referred to as numbers), enter the storage\/sequencing unit . In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines the first block of consecutive numbers to be sequenced. In step S, each consecutive number of the selected block of numbers is captured from the flow of cycling frames and stored in the recirculation zone . At step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d makes a determination whether the block of predetermined consecutive numbers has been captured. Once the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines in step S that all the consecutive numbers in the selected block have been captured, the flow continues to step .","At step , the block of selected frames is released back in the appropriate location within the flow of cycling frames. In step S, the control unit determines whether there are any other blocks of consecutive numbers which need to be sequenced. If so, the flow continues to step S. At step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines the next block of consecutive numbers and the flow returns to step S where the control unit determines when the block of predetermined consecutive numbers has been captured, and the control unit releases the captured frames back into the flow in step S. The flow continues to step S, and if the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines in step S that all the blocks of consecutive numbers have been correctly sequenced, the sequencing within the storage\/sequencing unit  is terminated.","Push Back Approach","The second approach for sequencing within the storage\/sequencing unit  is the \u201cpush back\u201d approach which sequences mail pieces in progressive increments. The mail piece at the bottom of the recirculation path will be \u201cpushed back\u201d behind another piece inside the recirculation zone . The concept is to push back mail pieces behind another mail piece with the next lowest DPS order. For example, numbers 10, 50, 20, 44, and 21 are inside a recirculation zone. Number 21 happens to be at the bottom of the recirculation path, so it gets moved behind 20. Now, the order is 10, 50, 21, 20, and 44. 44 is at the bottom and gets moved behind 21, making the order: 10, 50, 44, 21, and 20. 20 is now at the bottom and gets pushed behind 10, making the order 20, 10, 50, 44, 21. This continues . . . 21, 20, 10, 50, 44 . . . 44, 21, 20, 10, 50 . . . 50, 44, 21, 20, 10. Now that number 10 cannot be pushed back, it leaves the recirculation zone and a new number enters the recirculation zone .","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrates the steps of the \u201cpush back\u201d approach. In step S, the presorted mail pieces, which are assigned numbers, enter the storage unit\/sequencing machine . In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d causes a group of numbered and unsequenced mail pieces to be captured in the recirculation zone  for sequencing. In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines whether the bottom mail piece in the recirculation zone  can be pushed behind the next lowest number mail piece. If the bottom mail piece can be pushed behind, it is pushed behind in step S. If the bottom mail piece cannot be pushed behind the next lowest number mail piece, it is released back into the cycling flow of frames in step S. In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d makes determination whether all the mail pieces are sequenced in the correct numerical order. If all the mail pieces are not in the correct numerical order, then a new numbered mail piece enters the recirculation zone  in step S. Steps S to S are repeated until the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines in step S that all the mail pieces have been correctly sequenced. The sequencing within the storage\/sequencing unit  is then terminated.","Floating Divert Approach","The third approach for sequencing within the storage\/sequencing unit  is the \u201cfloating divert\u201d which causes the recirculation zone  to grow with the chain of sequenced mail pieces. If a storage\/sequencing unit  is fixed in size, then the vertical divert mechanism  used for the recirculation path is allowed to \u201cfloat\u201d inside the unit, expanding the recirculation zone  as needed. Instead of letting the chain cycle around the storage\/sequencing unit , the chain stays contained in the recirculation zone . When the number that is one greater than the highest number in the chain approaches the recirculation zone , the frames already in the zone cycle (if necessary) until the highest number in DPS order is at the top of the recirculation zone. Then, the divert would \u201cfloat\u201d over one so that the number which previously approached the chain is now a part of the chain. This allows the size of the cycling mail pieces that are not in the chain to decrease as the chain grows, making search times smaller. For example, if numbers 1-5 are in a storage\/sequencing unit  and no numbers were in the recirculation zone , then it would take up to 5 cycles for the number 1 to enter the recirculation zone . However, it would only take up to 4 cycles for the number 2 to enter, etc. This sequencing scheme can be enhanced with multiple recirculation zones  that merge in the end.","Referring now to , a flow diagram illustrates the steps of the \u201cfloating divert\u201d approach. In step S, the presorted mail pieces, which are assigned numbers, enter the storage unit\/sequencing machine . In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d allows the lowest numbered mail piece to enter the recirulation zone . In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d allows mail pieces to approach the recirculation zone  and determines whether an approaching mail piece is the next lowest numbered mail piece. If the approaching mail piece is not the next lowest numbered mail piece, another mail piece is allowed to approach the recirculation zone  in step S. When the next lowest mail piece approaches the recirculation zone , it is allowed to enter the recirulation zone  in step S. In step S, the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines whether there are any unsequenced mail pieces which have not entered the recirculation zone . If there any unsequenced mail pieces, steps S-S are repeated until all the mail pieces have been allowed to enter the recirculation zone . Once the control unit \u201cC\u201d determines in step S that all the mail pieces have been correctly sequenced, the sequencing within the storage\/sequencing unit  is terminated.","The invention is directed to a system for transporting mail in a sequencing system using clamps. In embodiments, mail pieces hang on clamps which are transported on the conveyance system of the invention. The clamps are configured to handle various types of mail (e.g., letters, flats, postcards, periodicals, odd shaped mail pieces, and even parcels up to a specified thickness) in a single sorting operation. The clamps are able to be efficiently sorted into carrier delivery sequence in a single or more pass, and then be dropped into a mail tray or packaged. Each clamp can include a unique identification for matching with an identification of a mail piece in order to sort and sequence the mail pieces as discussed throughout the disclosure and specifically with reference to the discussion of the frames.","In embodiments, the clamps are designed to accommodate known system operations such as measuring the dimensions of the mail piece, weighing the mail piece, printing information such as bar code information, reading information from the mail piece, etc. Additionally, as discussed herein, the clamps are configured to be conveyed on one or more lead screws or timing belts (e.g., cogged belts or other driving mechanisms) in order to process mail pieces and other objects. In particular, the present invention is geared to large scale mail sorting and sequencing systems in order to sort and sequence the mail for an entire facility. Mail or mail piece as described herein may be letters, flats or other objects or products, depending on its size.","As discussed herein, the present invention also provides a storage system for the mail. This includes an area (or several areas) with a matrix of multiple tracks to hold mail pieces (with the clamp still attached). These tracks hold rows of mail pieces within the clamps in both the vertical and horizontal directions. These storage areas buffer mail pieces between processing steps and also hold mail pieces prior to dispatch. This allows the ability to accept mail pieces into the system at any time and to dispatch when a mail truck is at the dock of the facility. The storage area(s) needs to be sized to hold a quantity, e.g., day's worth of mail. Additional benefits of the storage area in accordance with the invention include the following.\n\n","In embodiments, the clamps of the invention can vary in size including thickness, e.g., a minimum size clamp has a thickness of 0.2 inches or more, depending on the size of the mail piece. These clamps and accompanying mail pieces can be stored in the storage areas in a serial track or more preferably, two tracks in close proximity to each other to create areas that almost double the capacity of the storage area.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1148","num":"1376"},"figref":["FIG. 32A","FIG. 32A"],"b":["3200","3200","3202","3200","3200","3202","3202"]},"Advantageously, the configuration of the clamps thus makes it easier to control the entire mail piece during the sorting and sequencing operations. That is, by controlling a single side of the mail piece per clamp, it is possible to control the entire mail piece from curling, etc. which would otherwise potentially interrupt and\/or disrupt sorting and sequencing operations. More specifically, and as discussed in greater detail below, the backing  of two adjacent mail clamps  will control the mail piece when they are in a face to end orientation, e.g., squeeze the mail pieces between two adjacent clamps .","Still referring to , a grasping or holding device  extends over a portion of the backing . The grasping device  may be spring loaded or be made of a resilient material such as, for example, a plastic or metal or metal alloy. In this configuration, the grasping device  naturally rests against and is in contact with the backing . In this way, the grasping device  is capable of grasping and exerting sufficient force to hold mail pieces as small as a single thickness of paper or thicker mail pieces or parcels. This enables intermixing almost the entire mail stream within the sorter. Thus, the grasping device  is configured to hold one or more types of mail pieces firmly against the backing  (see, e.g., ) in order to sort and sequence both mail and flats within a single system. Also, in embodiments, the grasping device  will ensure that the mail piece is firmly clamped to the backing , and does not extend beyond edges of the backing .","The grasping device  is attached or connected to an upward extending arm . The upward extending arm  extends from the backing . The upward extending arm  includes a rail system  which is configured to interact with a channel and screw or belt system for transporting the clamp  throughout a sorting and sequencing system. More specifically, the rail system  includes a vertical member and two horizontal members and . The horizontal members and may be parallel to one another. As discussed in further detail below, in operation the upper horizontal member will interact or travel within a channel section of the sorting and sequencing system; whereas, the lower horizontal member will interact with a lead screw, belt or other driving system for moving the clamp  in either the forward or reverse direction. In embodiments, a lead screw, belt, etc., can be placed on both sides of the vertical member and interact with opposing portions of the lower horizontal member , where each will move the clamp  in opposite directions or at different angles.","The clamp  also includes a gap  or notch in the backing . The gap  is sized and structured to accommodate the placement of a grasping device  of an offset adjacent clamp (See, ). This allows nesting of two adjacent clamps . The gap  is preferably placed as close as possible to the upward extending arm  thereby minimizing the overall lengthwise dimension of two nested clamps.","Additionally, the clamp  includes an ear  and an upward extending divert pin . As discussed with reference to the right angle divert mechanism, the divert pin  is configured to interact with the diverting mechanism in order to divert the clamp  at right angles. As this feature of the right angle divert is discussed in other sections, no further explanation is required herein for an explanation of this feature.

The frame identification (frame ID) of each individual mail frame associates the contained mail piece with its physical and logical attributes such as size, destination, weight, etc. By automatically identifying each mail piece, a greater sorting efficiency and depth can be achieved based on one or more of those mail piece's attributes. The present invention also provides for automated tracking of mail pieces throughout any distribution technology process. A distribution system, with strategically placed frame ID readers, can track the progress of the mail pieces as they move through various phases of distribution. As in other embodiments, the components described herein such as, for example, the system manager, Architectures, etc, can be implemented in the computing infrastructure of .","The invention includes a unique frame ID and an associated ID reader. In the preferred embodiment, a barcode acts as an identifier, and a barcode reader is the associated ID reader. The frame ID is attached to the mail frame, and as the frame moves past the reader, the reader picks up a signal from the frame ID to identify the frame. In the preferred embodiment, the frame ID is not only attached to the frame, but etched directly onto it. Alternatives to a barcode identification system include compact disk (CD) reading technology, radio frequency identification (RFID), smart cards or a magnetic stripe. For example, using a CD reading head as an ID reader and a linear strip of a CD track as the frame ID, unique containers can be identified by reading the data on the CD track. An RFID system can transmit signals between the ID tag and a reader through radio frequency signals, eliminating the need for them to be in line of sight of each other. Smart cards can store the unique frame ID on a chip which is activated by a contact or a wireless reader to retrieve the frame ID.","The system of the present invention is unique because it allows for the identification and tracking of individually containerized mail pieces, and it allows for a finer resolution of sort depth. Each identification technology has its own benefits. The technologies and specific embodiments for each technology are discussed below. A first identification technology is barcode technology, which is a proven and relatively simple technique that adds little cost, weight, or complexity to the mail container, e.g., frame. A second identification technology is CD reading technology, which has the potential of high data density, read\/write capabilities, and error correction algorithms. A third identification technology is RFID technology which includes the flexibility of not requiring line of sight between the tag and reader. A fourth identification technology is smart card technology that allows for additional security and high data storage in the ID tags. A fifth identification technology is a magnetic stripe technology. These identification technologies are hereafter described in greater detail.","Automation of the sequencing process as described herein involves a system that preferably handles both flats and letters simultaneously. The resolution of sequenced mail is an individual mail piece, where the resolution for sorted mail is a batch of mail pieces. Therefore, sequenced mail calls for an individual mail piece container which is referred to herein as a \u201cframe\u201d. Flats and letters vary greatly in physical dimensions, so the individual frame preferably includes uniform dimensions for easier automation; although, different dimensions of the frames are also contemplated for use with the present invention.","A mail sequencing system with millions of individual frames is difficult to manage unless the system includes automatic identification of each mail piece. The present invention, therefore, preferably includes a reader and tag system for identification. The tag includes a unique identifier for each frame. A networked computer system such as that shown in  tracks the frame and inserted mail piece or product or other object. The reader identifies the tag, decodes the information associated with the tag, and sends the decoded information to the computer system or system manager.","The unique identifier, or tag, in this case is a set of numbers or other indicia that will identify not only the frame, but potentially the postal facility, lot number, manufacturer number, batch number, etc. Tags can also include letters and symbols. Usually, these identifiers are attached to the product that is to be tracked. Direct part marking, however, allows the product to become the identifiers themselves particularly in the case of barcode technology. There are many different part marking methods, and the quality of some of these methods depend on the type of material used. For example, part marked barcodes can be laser etched on metal.","A reader is usually specific to the type of tag technology. For example, in the case of a barcode having a one-dimensional (1D) symbology, a 1D reader can usually only identify 1D barcodes. Readers for use in the automation of individual mail pieces inserted into frames are strategically placed before key diverting points or common travel points so that the control system is able to verify the mail piece it is about to divert or verify the receiving of a group of frames. With an automatic identification system, a mail processing machine can efficiently sort and sequence mixed mail with accuracy. A deeper resolution of sort is achieved by sequencing mail for a particular mail carrier's route, according to any of the mail piece attributes. For example, mail can be sequenced by delivery point and within each delivery point can be ordered by size or weight, as the size and weight of the mail pieces can be determined as discussed in the instant application using sensors, etc.","Frame Identification Architecture","The system is designed to sort, store, sequence and dispatch all letters and flats mail processed at a United States Postal Service (USPS) Processing and Distribution Center (P&DC) or warehouse or other sorting facility on a daily basis. This requires handling streams of mail at high throughputs on the order of twenty-two mail pieces per second. A throughput of twenty-two mail pieces per second equates to one mail piece passing a stationary point every 45.5 milliseconds. At least two aspects of the system design allow it to accomplish these high throughputs. These aspects include capturing each mail piece in a \u201cframe\u201d, and handling the frames in a \u201cstacked\u201d or \u201ccompressed\u201d configuration. Capturing each mail piece in a frame allows each mail piece to have a common \u201cshape factor\u201d and common handling accessories (such as hooks, pins, etc). Handling the frames in a compressed configuration places their smallest dimensions (their thickness and height) in the direction of travel. This allows a high throughput (frames per unit time) for a given line speed (distance per unit time).","A hardware component of the system of the present invention is the \u201cRight Angle Divert\u201d (RAD), which is explained in detail in other sections of the instant invention. The RAD allows individual mail pieces to be diverted out of a \u201cmain\u201d mail stream and into a \u201cdiverted\u201d mail stream, with both mail streams moving at a constant speed. It also allows two mail streams to be merged into a single mail stream (again, with all mail streams moving at a constant speed). The RAD requires that all frames passing through it be oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle. Therefore all frames in the system of the present invention are preferably conveyed in a stacked configuration at a 45\u00b0 angle.","The space limitations of a P&DC dictate that the frames must be at a pitch of about \u215b\u2033 (center to center) while in a storage unit. Therefore, the frames should only be an average of, e.g., \u215b\u2033 thick, although other dimensions are also contemplated by the present invention. While being transported or conveyed, the spacing of the frames may be increased (say for example, to \u00bc\u2033 center to center). However, the twenty-two frame per second throughput (one frame every 45.5 milliseconds) are contemplated by embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, any increase in frame spacing should be accompanied by increasing the conveyor speed (distance per unit time).","An objective of the system is to accurately sort and sequence the mail. This requires tracking the location and identity of each mail piece. Functionally, this is accomplished by matching each mail piece with the specific frame in which it is contained. Each frame will contain a unique identifier, such that each frame (and therefore mail piece) can be periodically identified and tracked by reading the frame identifier (\u201cframe ID\u201d). The system will make decisions about how to handle a mail piece (whether or not to divert it down a certain path, for example) based on the results of frame identification.","Referring now to , a functional flow block diagram illustrates the operation of a frame ID reader system for frame identification which is controlled by a system manager. In step , the frame reader inducts a frame to be identified into a frame reading sub-system. The frame reader then reads the frame ID in step , which involves step  of capturing the data on the frame, followed by step  of decoding and step  of processing the data. After the frame ID has been read, the reader will in step  expel the frame from the sub-system and in step  send an update to the system manager or frame monitor.","For the frame ID reader structure, various types of structures are capable of capturing and reading the frame ID data.  is a block diagram illustrating a frame ID reader system  and five possible types of readable data, which include barcode data , CD reader data , magnetic stripe data , smart card data  and RFID data .

The technology candidates for the frame ID reader are listed in a section below.","Barcode Technology","A barcode is a machine-readable code used for storing data and information. The information is coded into a barcode symbol using a pattern of light and dark shapes. These areas of light and dark result in a pattern of high and low reflectance. When inspected by a barcode reader, the pattern can be interpreted as a binary sequence of 1's and 0's based on the sequence of the light and dark shapes.","The most common form of barcode symbol includes a black ink printed on a white background. Other forms of barcode symbols include laser-etched, chemical-etched, dot-peen, and thermal transfer barcode symbols. They can be applied on a variety of materials, including metal, plastic, rubber, and glass. There are a variety of considerations when choosing the proper form of barcode to use for a particular application. These considerations include cost, size, the type of material to be marked, and required permanence of the symbol. Barcode systems are widely used in a broad spectrum of industries today. Major benefits include high-speed, high-accuracy data entry to allow efficient identification and tracking, while being extremely low cost.","Barcodes may be classified as 1-Dimensional (1D), stacked, or 2-Dimensional (2D). 1D barcodes includes a pattern of parallel lines, and information is contained in the sequence and width of the lines. For example, extending the symbol in the dimension parallel to the lines does not allow for any more data to be stored in the symbol. However it does make the symbol easier to read by allowing a reader to obtain multiple scans of the symbol, and by compensating for symbol defects and less-than-perfect reader placement. 1D barcodes may be read with both laser-scanner and CCD barcode readers.","A stacked barcode is a 2D modification of the concept of the 1D barcode, with the goal of allowing more data storage. Functionally it is the same as several 1D barcodes stacked on each other in the direction parallel to their lines. Similar to 1D code, stacked barcodes may be read with both laser-scanner and CCD barcode readers.","2D barcodes store information in the pattern of light and dark symbols (usually circles or squares) in 2 dimensions. This allows for much greater data storage in a smaller symbol. It also allows for extensive error correction and the use of code words to verify proper symbol reads.","As shown in , a barcode  can be fixed on an individual mail frame F either by direct part marking such as laser etching or by labeling. Each frame F contains a mail piece \u201cM\u201d. Each barcode  contains a set of characters that uniquely identifies the frame F. The barcode  is positioned in the same place on each frame F so that a reader  can automatically identify each one as it passes by.","A fixed mount barcode reader  will attempt to read the encoded information in the barcode  on each moving mail frame F that passes the barcode reader. Each read of a barcode  can then indicate to a mail processing system that the location of a certain mail piece \u201cM\u201d has been verified and following the appropriate path.","Barcode readers may be broken into two major categories: laser-scanners and CCD (charge-coupled device) readers. Additionally, CCD readers may be divided into linear CCD readers and video-camera CCD readers.","Laser-scanners use a moving mirror or prism to scan in some defined pattern. As the laser beam passes over the barcode, a portion of the laser beam is reflected back to the reader. A photodiode, tuned to capture only that frequency of light, generates a voltage proportional to the amount of light reflected by the symbol.","Linear CCD readers include a largely one-dimensional array of photodiodes. Each photodiode captures light from whatever object is directly in front of the reader, and generates a proportional voltage. Therefore, across an array of photodiodes, a pattern of high and low voltages is generated, which matches the light and dark barcode pattern placed in front of the array.","Video-camera CCD readers include a two-dimensional array of photodiodes. The array captures an image of the barcode in the same manner as a digital camera captures a picture.","The preferred barcode embodiment envisioned for frame reading includes either a relatively thin 1D or 2D barcode symbol  placed on each frame F in the sorting and\/or sequencing system. This positioning of barcodes symbols  is such that a line of sight is available to the barcode symbols when the frames F are configured in a 45\u00b0 stack. Stationary barcode readers  are mounted in strategic positions along the conveyance path. In this manner, as the frames F move past the barcode reader , the barcode reader can read each barcode  (and associated frame ID).","The system of the present invention includes a throughput of about 22 frames\/second. Therefore, frame ID or barcode  should be read at this rate.","Some of the primary benefits of using a barcode  to track frames F include a relatively low cost, and a proven, relatively simple technology. Furthermore, it adds little weight or complexity to the frame F, and requires no mechanical or magnetic interaction between the frame F and the reader .","Compact Disk Technology","Referring now to FIGS. I(i)-(iii), illustrations are provided of compact disk (CD) technology and a mail frame that can be identified by CD technology. CD is a technology based on translating the reflective differences of a disk into a digital signal. The acronym CD refers to a CD on which data is pressed at the time of manufacture. CD-R refers to a CD on which a user can write data once and then read many times. CD-RW refers to a CD with no information initially, but which can be written and read many times.","FIG. I(iii) illustrates a CD  having a plastic layer , an aluminum layer , an acrylic layer  and a label . The reflective and non-reflective surfaces of the aluminum layer  correlate very well into 1's and 0's, enabling the CD's to store data.","Referring to FIG. I(ii), two of the main components of a CD reader include a laser diode  to emit the reading laser and an optical sensor  which is preferably a photocell. The CD reader also includes a motor to drive the disk. The CD  includes bumps or opacities to reflect the laser from the laser diode . The laser diode  emits a laser that will reflect off of the aluminum layer  of the CD . Lasers with higher powers can be used to change the phases of compounds on a rewritable disk which is known as CD-RW.","FIG. I(i) includes illustrations of a CD , a modified linear CD track  and frames which include the modified linear CD track  for identifying the frames. In order to implement a linear CD track, the normally spiral track of a CD  is modified into the linear track  which is affixed to the frames F. The linear CD track  includes a linear path of micron sized bumps for storing data. When the laser light from the laser diode  passes over a flat on the path, the light reflects back into the optical sensor , registering a \u201c1\u201d. When the laser passes over a bump, the light is reflected elsewhere, registering as a \u201c0\u201d. Not all disks have bumps, however. CD-R and CD-RW have additional layers of dye or phase changing compound that are either transparent or opaque. When a layer is transparent, the laser light passes through and reflects off the aluminum layer  like on a flat. When a layer is opaque, the laser will not be able to reflect onto the optical sensor . This layered technology, therefore performs the same function as the bumps, but allows for rewriting with an appropriately powered laser.","A CD reading system operates similarly to a barcode system. While a barcode reader picks up the differences between the bars and spaces on a barcode, a CD reader picks up the light reflected off the lands and bumps on a CD. The operation of the CD  involves reflecting light off the aluminum layer  of the disk onto the photocell . The bumps reflect light differently than the lands, which encodes the information that the photocell  picks up.","CDs hold their data on a single track of information, which is spiraled outwards from the center. As shown in FIG. I(i), individual mail frames F of the present invention are identified by moving the linear CD track  past the reader , instead of rotating a conventional spiral past a read head. As information capacity needed to identify an individual frame F is relatively small, a small strip of CD track is sufficient in accordance with the present invention. The frame IDs  are attached to the frame F with the readable side facing outward towards the reader . As frames F pass by the reader , the reader will pick up the optical reflections and identify them. Typically, the motor in a conventional CD reader changes speed as the laser reads different parts of the CD to keep a constant linear speed. With the embodiment of FIG. I(i), the linear speed is kept constant by the constant speed at which the frames F move past the reader .","The automatic identification of frames F throughout the system preferably involves attaching a strip of rewritable CD material  onto the top or side of the frames F and placing CD reader\/writer assemblies  at strategic decision points. Instead of a spiral track of a conventional CD, the track is straightened into a line so that frames F can be read as they move. Information including a unique identification number can be written and rewritten onto the linear CD material  as a frame F passes under or by a laser assembly of the reader . The benefits of the CD technology include high information density, low cost for both readers  and linear CD material , and read\/write capability.","RFID Technology","Radio frequency identification (RFID) represents a set of technologies that utilize radio waves for automatic identification. An RFID system is based on wirelessly accessing data devices which are commonly referred to as transponders or tags, and these terms are used interchangeably herein. Tags usually include antennas for receiving and transmitting a signal, and an integrated circuit for storing data and processing RF signals. Readers receive the data on the tags and send the data to tracking software for decoding. The tracking software correlates the data with the physical hardware to determine the location of the tag. Components of an RFID system include tags that hold unique information, readers to collect this information, and software to associate or integrate this information with physical hardware.","There are three types of tags: passive, active, and semi-passive. Passive tags do not have an internal power supply, and generate power from induced currents that RF signals in its vicinity produce. Active tags have an attached power supply to power the integrated circuit and broadcast a signal to the RF reader. Because of this additional power, active tags are able to transmit stronger signals which can make them effective even in environments unfriendly to RF signals. Semi-passive tags also have a power source, which is used to power the integrated circuit, but which is not used to broadcast signals. Semi-passive tags rely on induced current to broadcast signals in the same manner as passive tags.","The type of storage for RFID tags includes three different types: read only, write once read many (WORM), and read\/write. A read only tag has its identification embedded as part of its manufacture, and it cannot be changed. WORM tags can be programmed with more information than simply an ID number, but the programmed information cannot change. Finally, read\/write tags can have information overwritten numerous times.","RFID readers collect information from the tags. Some readers power an antenna to generate an RF field which passive or semi-passive tags utilize as a power source. The current induced by the RF field activates these tags causing them to transmit the information stored onboard their chips. If the tag is an active type of tag, onboard power is used to transmit this information. The readers send the tag information to a software system to be decoded and processed such as those used with reference to .","In order to use the information that the readers obtain from the tags, a software system must correlate the signals from the readers with physical hardware. The tracking software provides real-time interaction with the tagged materials, such as sending a box to be shipped down the appropriate conveyor.","An RFID system is an alternative to a barcode system, and unlike a barcode system, an RFID system does not require line of sight. RFID technology relies on the transmission of radio waves to detect whether a product is nearby. As illustrated in the embodiment of , passive tags  are placed on the frames F for containing mail pieces \u201cM\u201d, and the frames are identified by a reader  as the frames pass by the reader.","The range of an RFID tag varies according to its type. Very Short Range Passive RFID can communicate a distance up to around 60 centimeters. Short Range RFID communicates a distance up to around 3.5 meters. This increased checkpoint distance accommodates a greater variety of scenarios such as identifying assets that are moved by forklifts through a warehouse or crates that are transported from one slot to another. Active Beacon Long Range RFID communicates a distance of around 50 to 100 meters. Two-Way Active RFID tags have long range communication at a distance of around 50 to 100 meters. Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) have long range communication of around 50 to 100 meters. RTLS has the ability to locate tags to within 10 feet but resolution decreases in crowded environments, and it is difficult to translate the data information to a logical location such as the specific parking slot a trailer might be located.","The automatic identification of frames F using RFID tags in the system preferably involves placing passive tags  on each frame, and placing readers  at strategic decision points. As a frame F passes through one of these checkpoints, tracking software processes the signal that the RF reader  receives from the RFID tag  and verifies that a frame is at its appropriate position in the system. The benefits of RFID include no required line of sight, read\/write capability, tag resilience to environment, relatively long read range, multiple tag identification and increased data storage.","Smart Cards Technology","Smart cards provide another alternative embodiment to a barcode system, and a smart card embodiment is illustrated in FIGS. K(i) and K(ii). In the embodiment of FIG. K(i), smart cards  are placed on frames F for containing mail pieces \u201cM\u201d, and the frames are identified by a reader  as the frames pass by the reader. Smart cards are of the contact and contactless type, and typically have more capabilities than magnetic stripe cards or memory cards.","As illustrated in FIG. K(ii), a typical smart card  is capable of storing relatively large amounts of data on an embedded integrated circuit  that is in the form of a secure microcontroller. The embedded integrated circuit  allows smart cards to have encryption and authentication for keeping personal identification secure. Smart cards transmit their data to card readers either through a physical connection such as a contact  on the typical smart card or wirelessly through a radio frequency interface. Smart cards are categorized by various communication types, such as direct contact, contactless, dual-interface, and hybrid designs. Contact cards are the size of a conventional credit or debit card with a single embedded integrated circuit chip that contains just memory or memory plus a microprocessor.","Referring now to , an exploded view depicts a larger view of the contact smart card . The contact smart card  includes a card body , the contact plate  and the integrated circuit or chip . The smart card  transmits its information through the contact plate  which is located over the integrated circuit chip . The reader  must make a physical connection to this conductive plate to retrieve information. Since a contactless smart card would function similarly to an RFID embodiment, a contact smart card embodiment may be more preferable than contactless smart card embodiment. In FIG. K(i), a group of frames F with contact smart cards  are illustrated as passing by the reader , and the smart cards  make physical contact with the reader , thereby transferring information between the chip and the reader.","Referring now to , an exploded view depicts a contactless card smart . The contactless smart card  includes a front card body , a rear card body , an antenna  and an integrated circuit or chip . A contactless smart card uses radio frequencies to send information. Instead of a physical contact plate, the contactless smart card  and its readers have an antenna to communicate with each other. The contactless smart card  usually includes an embedded antenna  instead of contact pads attached to the chip  for reading and writing information contained in the memory of the chip. Like the passive RFID tags, some contactless smart cards use the RF field to generate power for the chip .","Referring now to , an exploded view depicts a dual interface or \u201ccombi\u201d smart card . A dual interface smart card  has one chip  with both a contact plate  and a contactless communication interface including an embedded antenna . The dual interface smart card  also includes a front body  and a rear body .","Referring now to , an exploded view depicts a hybrid smart card . A hybrid smart card has two chips , , and one chip typically includes a contact interface, and the other includes a contactless interface having embedded antenna . Accordingly, hybrid cards may include two or more embedded chip technologies such as a \u201cprox chip\u201d with its antenna and a contact smart chip with its contact pads.","Referring now to , an exploded view depicts a proximity card or \u201cprox card\u201d . A prox card  has one chip  with a contactless communication interface including an embedded antenna . The prox card  also includes a front body  and a rear body . A prox card  communicates through its antenna  similar to contactless smart cards except that they are read-only.","For each smart card connection type, there are also different types of integrated circuit chips. A microcontroller smart card can perform operations on the information stored in its memory. The microcontroller can not only hold larger amounts of data, but can perform functions on the data such as encryption, or authentication. A memory chip is capable of reading and writing data into memory, but has less security than a microcontroller. Usually, these chips rely on the security of the reader.","The solution envisioned for the automatic identification of frames throughout the system involves placing a contact or contactless memory chip on the frame where the structure of the frame would replace the card backing. Readers would be placed strategically at critical decision points and extract the information on the chips in order to verify the location of the frames. The benefits of smart card technology include security of information, the ability to do on-board operations such as encryption, large amounts of data and multiple interface methods.","There are emerging card technologies which are referred to as electronic cards or simply \u201ce-cards.\u201d These cards contain from one to three different types of embedded chip technologies: contact smart chip, contactless smart chip and proximity chip. E-cards that contain two or more chip technologies are referred to as hybrid cards or \u201ccombi\u201d cards, as described above, all of these different types of cards are contemplated for use with the present invention.","Magnetic Stripe Technology","Magnetic stripe is a well established technology commonly used in applications such as credit cards and automatic badge readers. The stripe includes fine magnetic particles in a thin bed of resin. In one method, the magnetic stripe is encased in a plastic film, and then affixed to a more rigid, often plastic card or surface. In a somewhat less expensive, less resilient method, magnetic slurry is applied directly to a (cardboard or plastic) card. The magnetic stripe may then be encoded with binary information, and is read by passing over a magnetic card reader, which reads and decodes the magnetic pattern encoded on the stripe.","Most common magnetic stripe applications conform to industry standards (ISO\/IEC 7811) and use 2 or 3 lines or \u201ctracks\u201d of information. These standards dictate that track  and  contain a bit density of 210 bits per inch, and track  contains a lower density of 75 bits\/inch. However some applications require and utilize higher information densities. Information on the stripe is commonly encoded as 5-bit numeric characters or 7-bit alpha-numeric characters.","Magnetic stripes are often categorized based on their coercivity. Coercivity is a measure of how hard it is to erase or change the information stored on the magnet stripe. High coercivity stripes are used in applications where the data is not often changed and maintaining readability and data integrity is important. Low coercivity stripes are used in applications where the data stored is often intentionally erased or rewritten.","The magnetic stripes are typically thin and made of soft materials, and therefore susceptible to wear and damage. Only limited protection of the stripe can be achieved by applying protective coatings, since extensive coatings interfere with reading the magnetic pattern. A magnet stripe passes over a card reader at a close proximity in a linear direction. This allows the reader to discriminate the magnetic signal of individual bits of the stripe.","To be read, a magnetic stripe must pass in a linear direction, in close proximity to a magnetic reader. This is hard to accomplish for frames moving in a 45\u00b0 stack of at a small pitch. The following is one possible configuration for using a magnetic stripe for frame reading and identification. A magnetic stripe can be affixed horizontally along the top of the frame on the leading side (with regard to the 45\u00b0 orientation). While moving at constant speed in the conveying direction, each frame can be partially \u201cpulled out\u201d of the stack at 45\u00b0 in the direction of the leading edge. A magnetic reader can be positioned a long this 45\u00b0 \u201cpull out\u201d path such that the magnetic stripe passes by the reader. The frame can be then slid back into its position within the stack. In order to read the magnetic stripe on each frame, the speed of the \u201cpulling out\u201d movement must be much faster than the speed of frame travel down the conveyance path.","The advantages of magnetic stripes for frame ID are is that it is a well developed, widely used technology. Both the magnetic stripes and the magnetic readers are also relatively inexpensive.","Barcode System Criteria","Automatic identification of frames in the system involves assigning unique numbers to frames. These numbers should not be reused when frames are removed from circulation, so the number of digits in the unique IDs should be able to accommodate all the frames that will ever be used internationally on all the systems of the present invention.","Number of Digits","Choosing the right number of digits for the ID may determine other aspects of the barcode system. For example, if many digits are needed for global coverage of the system of the invention, a 2D symbology may be desirable to fit the necessary data density of the barcode on the limited frame thickness. Another aspect that may be affected is the barcode reader selection. Readers have limits as to how many digits they can decode. If more digits are chosen than the selected reader can handle, the system will not be able to identify the frame. Therefore, proper selection of number of digits ensures that the frame ID barcode system can support enough frames for international coverage throughout the lifetime of the system of the present invention.","The calculation of the number of digits is based on the assumption that there could be up to approximately five million frames per system at any one time. If there are approximately 300 P&DC facilities in the U.S. there can be about 1.5 billion active frames in the country. Although each frame will be designed to last the lifetime of the system, multiplying 1.5 billion by a safety factor of 100 allows every facility to replace each frame ninety-nine times during the lifetime of the facilities' system. The result is 150 billion numbers, or twelve digits for national coverage. If the system of the invention system expands to ten nations, assuming they process equivalent volumes of mail, the result is 1.5 trillion unique numbers, or 13 digits for international coverage.","The number of digits necessary for worldwide coverage is at least thirteen digits. Barcodes having at least sixteen digits should be sufficient to provide unique frame IDs for future expansion of the system of the present invention within the United States or other countries. It may also be desirable to reserve a few digits at the front of the barcode for uniquely identifying a country's system or facility. A barcode of up to twenty-four digits should be adequate for accommodating such a country\/facility identifier. Examples of a unique country\/facility identifier include: 001=USA, 002=Canada, with numbers afterward to identify facilities.","After exploring the capabilities of potential linear barcode readers, it appears that both 16 and 24 digit barcodes can be relatively easily read. As such sixteen digit barcodes with the potential for expansion of up to twenty-four digits, should there be a need to uniquely identify countries or facilities, are suitable for use with the present invention.","Twenty-four digits were chosen mostly as a baseline, conservative number to begin narrowing down potential barcode reader candidates. Since all reader candidates could read approximately 32-40 digits, the issue of reader capability should no longer exist. The number of digits chosen should accommodate all the frames in the system of the present invention, while keeping in mind that more digits will require more physical space on frames.","Code Size\/Dimension Limitations","Frames are designed to travel at 45 degree slants to maximize density and allow in-motion diverting. As such, the placement of Frame ID barcodes to the top, bottom, and side edges of frames are preferred with other locations also contemplated by the present invention. Assuming the number of digits required for the frame identification is twenty-four, a 1D barcode should fit in the allowable frame space. If a twenty-four digit, 1D code is too large to fit on the frame, then 2D codes will have to be used for frame identification.","Knowing the dimensional limitations of a frame plays a role in deciding if 1D or 2D barcodes will be the most feasible option for identification; whereas the number of mail pieces and facilities determine the number of digits each code has on a frame. However, the frame dimensions determine the physical code size allowed. If an acceptable 1D barcode can fit on the sides of the frames, then 1D barcode reader is preferred over a 2D reader, because 1D readers are less expensive, simpler to setup, etc.","Exemplary frames can be about \u215b\u2033 thick and approximately 14.5\u2033 by 21\u2033 in width and height. If the barcodes are oriented in ladder fashion, then the width of the code no longer becomes an issue, and only the bar heights remain a consideration. Linear CCD barcode readers can read code heights as short as about 0.3 cm, and \u215b\u2033=0.3175 cm. Therefore, \u215b\u2033 is still in the readable range, and the thickness of the part of the frames that have codes on them should not be any smaller than about 0.3 cm. This was verified when testing sample barcodes with candidate readers. There is enough space on the side of the frame to handle many more digits than barcode readers can read. Also, code size will not be an issue for a 1D reader when the thickness of frames is greater than or equal to about 0.3 cm.","Physical code size limitations for linear barcodes should not be in an issue. The width of a code is not limited by the physical dimensions of the frame, only by the reader. However, the height of a code should preferably be at least 0.3 cm, or about \u215b\u2033; although other dimensions are contemplated by the invention. Also, it should be understood that if the frame thickness is reduced down, there will be less machining required for frame manufacturing, but there still needs to be 0.3 cm for the barcode height. This can be allowed, if there is an accommodation at a frame edge to flare out or chamfer to 0.3 cm (0.118 in.) for barcode placement. Additionally, the 0.3 cm barcode height was determined from an average of linear CCD barcode reader specification limits, as well as, testing with a reader candidate. Unless the tradeoff of manufacturing ease with thinner frames outweighs using 2D readers, it is preferable to maintain a \u215b\u2033 frame edge for Frame IDs.","1D or 2D Type of Readers","Choosing a 1D or 2D reader type is a decision point for reader selection. This choice influences reader selection, along with the symbology used, and how small the codes can be. This decision also influences the cost of the reader, and may determine whether the barcodes are printed onto labels or part marked because 1D readers tend to require higher contrast and light reflection. As such, both types of readers should be considered for use with the present invention. Most 2D readers can read 1D codes as well, but the majority of 1D readers can only read 1D codes. Therefore, if a 2D reader is chosen, almost any kind of code can be read, especially if there is a need to read low contrast part marks. However, if a 1D reader is chosen, then the reader capabilities may be limited.","Since 1D readers provide most of the functionality needed with the exception of low contrast part marks, a 1D reader is the preferred choice in accordance with aspects of the invention. The system of the present invention does not require the added flexibility provided by laser readers, so a CCD type reader is a suitable type of 1D reader for selection. However, if reading low contrast codes becomes a necessary task, then the readers should also include a few entry level 2D smart cameras.","Symbology","Two effectiveness measures for symbology selection include a high data density symbology and a widely used symbology. It is preferable for the code to be both dense, and also capable of being easily read by many different readers.","The barcode does not have to hold any special kind of information and acts only as an identifier throughout the system of the present invention. As a result, the code could be composed of only numbers and function similar to a licence plate tag. For 1D barcodes, CODE 128-C has the highest density for barcodes made up of numbers only. Normally, a character is made up of a set of bars and spaces. In other 1D symbologies, for example, the number \u201c10\u201d would have a set of bars and spaces for \u201c1\u201d and another set for \u201c0\u201d. In CODE 128-C, whenever there are double digit numbers, only one set of bars and spaces are necessary to represent both digits. CODE 128 also has more stringent standards for bar widths, making it stronger against random patterns of bars and spaces. These standard bar widths make the symbology less forgiving in regards to low quality bars, but depending on the printing or marking technology used, detecting these differences should not be a problem. Also, after comparing some common 1D symbology such as CODE 39, CODE 93, ITF, CODABAR, and CODE 128, CODE 128-C was chosen for its density, encoding strength, and commonality.","Candidate symbologies were printed on both a label printer and a standard laser jet printer in varying narrow bar widths. The codes were examined to determine which narrow bar widths had artifacts on the laser jet but not the label printer since the latter can produce higher quality prints. Although codes with narrow widths of around 9.8 mils were printed well on laser jet, the next highest setting of about 14.8 mils on the barcode generating software may be more preferably as it includes more margin for error. In terms of narrow bar width, about 14.8 mils was selected because of its generous size for reliable reading against low quality codes.","Mounting Position","Reader position is another factor in the barcode system that needs some consideration. The catalyst for investigating this came from tests. The goal is to have a convenient place for mounting readers that will not interfere with the operation of the components.","The position of the reader will affect maintenance access and maintenance time. The reader should not get in the way of folder\/frame maintenance, and be easily accessed for its own maintenance. It is less of a performance issue for the barcode system, and more of a maintenance\/housekeeping issue. Mounting is also affected by the frame design and any other components along the four screws that may affect the operation or maintenance of the readers.","Discovering a suitable mount position was done during reader tests on a breadboard RAD. Referring now to , there are four basic positions relative to the frame  that the readers , and can be located in embodiments of the invention. The readers , and are illustrated as square boxes having trapezoidal fields of view. These locations include the top, sides, or bottom. Although placing the reader \/on top\/bottom of the frame  may interfere with the RAD\/transport mechanization and motors, the present invention contemplates such location placement if carefully and properly positioned as to not interfere with such mechanisms. Also, since leads screws (e.g., transport mechanisms) are on the top and bottom of the system of the present invention, the reader can fit well on the side of the system, remote from the lead screws. The readers , and need to be only an inch or so away from the reader, so it does not take up much space. Frame maintenance also happens on the side so care must be taken to not impede the maintenance sections. It is possible to place the readers on the \u201cguide\u201d side near guide  so that the maintenance occurs on the other side of the screws.","Mounting the readers on the \u201cguide\u201d side of the screws appears to be the most preferable. Since the guide allows for maintenance on the other side of the screws, the reader will not interfere with frame\/folder maintenance. Possible barcode readers from various manufacturers contemplated for use with the present invention include, for example, Opticon NFT 7375B; Densei USA (NEC) BCR 5342H; Wenglor FIS-0003-0136; Cognex DataMan 100Q; Microscan Quadrus Mini Velocity; Microscan MS-3 Laser; and Keyence BL-180.","Part Marking vs. Labels","As to the medium for the barcode labels, it should be understood that choosing the medium for the barcode labels affects the life of the ID on the frame. The goal is to have the ID last as long as the lifetime of the frame. Therefore, the barcode medium should be resistant to environmental wear, yet inexpensive and easy to make in mass quantities. The barcode medium may also affect the frequency of folder repair, reader selection, and folder material. The approach for discovering what medium works best has been a combination of testing and finding examples of labelling\/marking techniques. Labels and laser etch on metal techniques have been tested because they were recommended as reliable methods with respect to the application of the invention.","Various types of other labelling and part marking may be incorporated into embodiments of the present invention. A number of different barcode system marking methods and recommendations are provided in a white paper published by Microscan on its website www.microscan.com. The white paper which is entitled, \u201cReview and Selection of Direct Part Marking Methods\u201d identifies various marking methods and describes the advantages and disadvantages of each marking method. The marking methods include, ink jet on substrate, pre-printed packaging, thermal transfer label stock, laser etch on silk screen, ink jet on plastic, thermal print on foil packaging, ink jet on glass, laser etch on metal, laser etch on glass epoxy, laser etch on rubber, chemical etch on metal, chemical etch on silicon, dot peen on smooth highly reflective metal, and dot peen on textured metal. Different marking methods may be used in designing different embodiments of the present invention; although the present invention should not be limited to such marking methods and recommendations found in the referenced white paper.","The invention is directed to a system and method for buffering frames containing mail pieces in a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. The invention also is directed to a system and method for buffering mail pieces contained in or supported in individual mail containers, e.g., \u201cframes\u201d, in a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system utilizing a presort accumulator. The invention also provides a method of buffering frames in a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system while the mail pieces are being presorted and batch loaded onto transport shuttles.","Presorting and batch loading mail pieces into transport shuttles requires buffering mail pieces to prevent induction bottlenecks and maintain induction throughput. The current state of mail sorting and\/or sequencing machines do not require buffering because they send mail pieces to pre-allocated output bins, which are re-fed into the machine multiple times to achieve sequencing.","According to one non-limiting aspect of the invention, a presort accumulator can be utilized which has \u201cn\u201d presort tubes into which containerized mail pieces, i.e., letters and\/or flats in frames, are placed. Each accumulator tube can be segmented into a collector segment and a buffer segment. When frames fill the collector segment, they are loaded onto transport shuttles while subsequent frames begin filling the buffer segment. Once the collector segment is emptied of frames, the frames in the buffer segment are advanced to the collector segment and the process repeats itself. This solution can far exceed the state of mail processing equipment in use today because it provides a systematic and automatic pipeline within a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system to ensure that mail induction bottlenecks are avoided. Furthermore, the present invention reduces the number of mail handling operations and associated labor required.","In a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system, the function of \u201cpresort accumulation\u201d enables frames containing mail to be buffered as they await the first step of sequencing known as \u201cpresorting\u201d. Presorting the mail flow results in a division of the mail flow into multiple streams of equal or nearly equal volume based on predetermined criteria. The primary criterion for presorting mail is mail piece destination. Buffering the mail flow during presort accumulation prevents mail piece overflow during heavy induction periods.","The function of presort accumulation is preferably performed in a presort accumulator. A presort accumulator includes multiple accumulator tubes into which the mail flow, i.e., frames containing mail, is divided or presorted. The presort accumulator utilizes a multiplexer that feeds an array of accumulator tubes. All frames containing mail are received through a single input feed and can be directed to the correct accumulator tube via, e.g., a right-angle divert.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1277","num":"1519"},"figref":["FIG. 34A","FIG. 34C","FIG. 34C"],"b":["3400","3400","3401","3411","3460","3460","3460"]},"Again with reference to , the frame reader  reads a frame identification (ID) and communicates with a control function sub-system  which includes a multiplex controller , an accumulator controller , and an accumulator selector . The control function sub-system  and its components may be implemented on the computing infrastructure shown in  of the instant application. The accumulator selector  interfaces with an accumulator allocation plan . A system of accumulator tubes  receives the read frames from the frame reader  and places the frames into a buffer segment of one or more of the accumulator tubes . In embodiments, this transfer can be via a right-angle divert as discussed in more detail in the instant application.","Each accumulator tube  has an arrangement for moving the frames within the tubes such as, e.g., a lead screw system in which screws engage each of the corners of the frame so as to cause its movement. The details of exemplary moving systems are described in greater detail in other sections of the instant application. The frames then move from the buffer segment  to the collector segment  in each tube , and are then loaded onto shuttles by shuttle loaders . The accumulator controller  controls movement of the frames in the accumulator tubes  to ensure that there are no bottlenecks, etc. by the use of, for example, encoders or sensors such as, e.g., photodiodes or other types of sensors discussed throughout the instant application. Furthermore, the control function system  communicates with the induction units  in order to coordinate the presorting of the frames leaving the induction units .","The operation of the system  shown in  will now be described with reference to .

This data determines the allocation of mail piece destinations to each accumulator tube . One or more destinations can be allocated to a single accumulator tube .","In step , as each frame is received, the frame reader  reads the frame ID and communicates the frame ID to the multiplex controller . The multiplex controller  manages the process of directing frames to the correct accumulator tube .","In step , a decision is made by the accumulator selector  as to which accumulator tube  to place the frame in. The accumulator selector  searches for the address of the mail piece using the frame ID in the accumulator allocation plan . The accumulator allocation plan  may not contain every specific and unique address, but can instead include segments or ranges of addresses. The address can therefore be located based on making the best (i.e., most detailed) match possible. Once a match is found, an allocated accumulator tube identifier can be retrieved from the accumulator allocation plan .","In step , the accumulator controller  is utilized to control the movement of frames into and out of each accumulator tube . Each accumulator tube  is preferably, in embodiments, a FIFO (first in first out) buffer space that is logically divided into two main segments: a buffer segment  and a collector segment . The collector segment  accumulates mail piece frames until enough frames have been collected to fill a transport shuttle. Once collected, the frames are loaded into a shuttle for transfer to another function in the mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. Given that the process of loading a collection of frames into a shuttle consumes a small amount of time, the buffer segment  within the accumulator tube  allows subsequent mail piece frames to be staged until the collector segment  is emptied. Once the collector segment  is emptied, the frames in the buffer segment  can be advanced into the collector segment  and the process repeated.","In the event that a particular accumulator tube  is only partially filled and no further frames containing mail pieces are inducted, the accumulator controller  can utilize a configurable timeout threshold. Once the timeout threshold has elapsed, the accumulator controller  can load the remaining frames in an accumulator tube  onto a shuttle.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1285","num":"1527"},"figref":"FIGS. 34C-34E","b":["3400","3460","3460","3460","3460","3460","3460","3460","3463","3463","3463","3465","3466","3466","3467","3463","3463"]},"The shuttles stop and dock to one of the insertion tubes  (a docking location indicated by \u201cD\u201d in ) so that the empty frames can be inserted into the respective insertion tube . Once all of the frames are transferred to the insertion tube , the empty shuttle travels down the path  and then transfer onto an inlet section  of the presort accumulator . The empty shuttles can then move to the grid path system  of the presort accumulator  whereupon they can receive frames containing mail exiting the accumulator tubes , and then onto other sections of the mail system.","As can be seen in , the grid path  allows the shuttles to move horizontally and vertically along a grid (i.e., over or under other docked shuttles) so as to allow the shuttles to move through each of multiple levels of accumulator tubes  even when other shuttles are docked to exit areas of the accumulator tubes , and then out of the presort accumulator . The grid path  thus includes upper horizontal path , lower horizontal path , as well as vertical paths connecting the paths  and . In embodiments, two horizontal paths for shuttle movement in the grid are utilized. The first path is the top-most horizontal level in . The other path is the 2nd level up from the bottom (labeled \u201cEmpty shuttles\u201d). The bottom-most path is preferably a half-height path in which GTUs (grid transport units) move. A GTU is a component of the grid and preferably resembles a shelf that moves through the grid on which a shuttle will rest. In embodiments, the grid can preferably contain several GTUs.","Again with reference to , other empty shuttles SH can enter another grid path  so as to receive frames containing mail which exit an end of the insertion tubes . The grid path  allows the shuttles to move horizontally and vertically along a grid (i.e., over or under other docked shuttles) so as to allow the shuttles to move to the section . These shuttles loaded with filled frames proceed down grid path  and dock to section  of the presort accumulator system . The frames containing mail are then transferred into the section  via, e.g., right-angle divert, and proceed horizontally down one of plural main transport tubes  ( shows two tubes ), which can be arranged one above the other. The frames containing mail are then transferred to a respective accumulator tube  via, e.g., right-angle divert, where they pass into the buffer segment  and then the collector segment , and eventually are loaded onto empty shuttles  docked to exit ends of the tubes  within the grid path section . A filled shuttle in the grid then moves up to the highest level of the grid and then travels horizontally to dock section . In this way, the filled shuttles can exit the grid while other upstream shuttles remain docked.","The presort accumulation process can also handle volume skew during mail induction. Specifically, the induction of presorted mail (e.g., large groups of pre-barcoded mail that a mailer sends to the same destination area) may cause an allocated accumulator tube  for the intended destination to overflow, despite the buffering capability within the tube. In this case, additional empty accumulator tubes  can be dynamically allocated to the presorted mail flow to mitigate the possibility of overflow. During the induction of presorted mail, there will naturally be empty accumulator tubes  available. In the event that no tubes are available due to, e.g., residue of mail that was inducted prior to the induction of presorted mail, then the presort accumulator  can eject the mail frames in those tubes into shuttles, thus emptying the tubes  to handle the volume skew.","A non-limiting advantage of using the presort accumulator  relates to preventing the mail induction units from going off line. If there is a bottleneck, or if a path or shuttle is not available for incoming mail, it will accumulate. When a buffer in the accumulator nears overflow, feedback can be provided back to one or more induction units to stop or pause their input. The system can thus prevent this accumulation when using random mail distributions. However, multiple units inducting presorted mail will, at times, cause the buffer to fill up, and thus cause the feedback which causes the induction units to stop. The presort accumulator  should thus be sized to allow a certain time period of all induction units running worse case presorted mail, before the induction units must be suspended.","The present invention is related to matching mail pieces with an appropriately sized frame. The matching of mail pieces and frames may be performed prior to sequencing\/sortation processes and, more specifically, used in a sequencing\/sortation system as described in the instant application. In embodiments, the frames may provide a common handle for automating mail processing, and facilitate the transportation and sorting of one or more mail pieces in a stack, which reduces speed while increasing throughput. As an example, and discussed in more detail in the instant application, the frames may be transparent or opaque and include an identifier such as a barcode, RFID, alphanumeric and\/or numeric code, etc. In embodiments, an identifier may be provided for each frame. In embodiments, the frame may be transparent in which case the mail piece mounted therein can include a visible identifier. The frames may instead be a clamp.","The frames may be ridged, elastic or partially elastic, and can encompass many different sizes for different mail pieces. As there are many sizes of mail pieces, the frames may be used to fit the largest size of mail piece designated for the frame in order to increase the efficiency of the system. The partially elastic frames may be used to allow frames to expand and contract in one or more directions to save space when placing one or more pieces of mail into the frame. For example, the back end of a frame may be partially elastic to allow a piece of mail to fit into the frame without unneeded protrusions.","As discussed herein, several frame sizes may be used for different mail pieces such that profiling or measuring the mail piece is necessary to match mail pieces with an appropriate size frame. Advantageously, the invention provides for such profiling to ensure that the sorting and\/or sequencing system maximizes the use of as many frames as possible in order to increase sorting and\/or sequencing throughput.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1294","num":"1536"},"figref":["FIG. 35A","FIG. 35A"]},"The steps of  may be implemented in the computer infrastructure discussed in the instant application. More specifically, at step , the control detects mail pieces on a transport. The transport may comprise pinch belts or other known conveyance mechanisms configured to move mail pieces through a sorting and\/or sequencing system. At step , a profiler will be directed to automatically or semi-automatically measure attributes of the detected mail piece. These attributes may be used to assign a mail piece to a correctly sized frame based on measurements and attributes obtained about the mail piece. Exemplary attributes may include, e.g., height, length, width, weight, stiffness, projections, and\/or an indication of a delivery area (such as a ZIP code), etc., of a piece of mail. The projections may include non-uniform thicknesses, dog eared pages of magazines, etc. One or more of these measurements are made by the profiler, at step , using known systems as discussed herein.","In embodiments, the profiler may be comprised of one or more elements configured to measure at least one attribute. Exemplary mechanisms for detecting one or more of these attributes may include, e.g., one or more cameras, an array of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or charge-coupled devices (CCDs), weight sensors, photodiodes, encoders, etc. Any number of mechanisms may be used individually, or in combination with one another, to determine one or more mail piece attributes. Moreover, while examples of mechanisms are provided herein, it should be understood that the examples are non-exhaustive and should not be used to limit the present invention.","Illustratively, in embodiments, one or more cameras may be used to determine the height, thickness, and\/or projections of a mail piece. An array of LEDs or CCDs may be used to calculate height and\/or width attributes of a mail piece. The thickness of a mail piece may also be determined, e.g., by measuring the distance between pinch rollers while the mail piece is being transported. The stiffness of a mail piece may be measured, e.g., using a mechanical probe, which is configured to contact the mail piece and, based on an electrical resistance, determine the stiffness of the mail piece. Additionally, barcode or address information may be obtained, e.g., from a barcode scanner and\/or camera.","The weight of a mail piece can be determined by a weight sensor, such as a scale. However, in embodiments, the weight of a mail piece may be estimated using one or more calculations based on the dimensions of the mail piece. For example, the weight may be calculated using the height, width, and length information to determine an area, which may be multiplied by the average density of the mail piece to obtain the weight of the mail piece. In embodiments, the average density may be obtained, e.g., by a probe, much like discussed above. The weight of a mail piece may also be estimated by, e.g., determining the inertia of a mail piece by observing how the mail piece is deflected while it is moved on the transport.","At step , the computer infrastructure receives the attributes, such as height, length, and\/or width, etc., from the profiler. The received attributes may be stored in a database or data storage unit, represented at . Exemplary data storage units may comprise any type of digital storage location where values can be recalled by frame type or by frame attributes, such as size. The data storage units may be any known databases detailed herein and well known to those of skill in the art.","At step , configuration information relating to the mail piece limits may be obtained by the computer infrastructure. This information may be obtained from a configured database or data storage unit, represented at . The data storage unit may be a database or other storage unit that is discussed with reference to the computing infrastructure described with reference to . In embodiments, the configuration data storage unit () may be the same as or different from the data storage unit () used to store the mail piece's attribute data.","The configuration information obtained from the configuration data storage unit () may include information on the maximum dimensions of mail pieces that can be placed in a frame or clamp. In embodiments, the maximum dimensions may be the dimensions of the largest frame used by the sequencing\/sortation machine. As the maximum dimensions may change as frame sizes are added or taken out of use, the present invention allows a configuration data storage unit to be updated with frame sizes. By using a configuration data storage unit to store frame size, instead of hard coding frame sizes into a software program, the invention allows frame sizes to be easily changed without the need to recompile the entire software program that performs the frame assignment.","At step , a determination is made as to whether the dimensions of a mail piece are larger than the maximum dimensions. This determination may be performed by comparing the dimensions of the mail piece from the data storage unit () with the maximum dimensions obtained from the configuration data storage unit (). If the mail piece exceeds the maximum dimensions, the computer infrastructure instructs the mail piece conveyance to route the mail piece to a holdout, such as a hold bin or a reject bin, at step . The mail piece may be held in the holdout until it is manually sorted and\/or re-inserted into the sequencing\/sortation system, at step .","If the mail piece is within the maximum dimensions, configuration assignment parameters may be obtained regarding one or more of the frames, at step . The configuration assignment parameters may be obtained from the configuration data storage unit () and include the maximum dimensions of one or more of the frames. In embodiments, information related to the dimensions of one or more frames may be obtained from one or more subsystems, such as the control unit.","At step , a determination is performed as to which frame should be matched with the mail piece. In embodiments, this may include a comparison of the dimensions (or other attributes) of the mail piece and that of the one or more frames obtained at step . This determination is used to find the smallest available frame that can accommodate the mail piece. In embodiments, additional factors may also be included in determining what size frame to use with the mail piece. For example, the elasticity of a frame may be considered when determining the maximum dimensions of one or more of the frame. That is, if the mail frame is flexible, it may be able to accommodate a larger size mail piece and, as such, an initially smaller size frame may be selected to be used with the mail piece. Weight also may be a consideration in selecting a frame, due to its insertion force.","At step , the determinations may be used to direct an inserter to insert the mail piece into the next available properly sized frame, at step . The next available properly sized frame may be determined using a barcode reader or RFID, etc., or based on the known positions of one or more frames in the system. At step , the inserter selects the properly sized frame and routes the mail piece to the insertion area. At step , the mail piece is inserted into the frame by the inserter. Once inserted, additional attributes may be collected by the profiler and compared to the original mail piece and\/or frame attributes to assure that the mail pieces were inserted correctly. In embodiments, the process of frame insertion using the correct types of frames can be determined by the frame type selector .","Once the mail piece is inserted into a frame, at step , the frame identifier and the mail piece identifier may be stored in a database or data storage unit. This data storage unit may be an existing data storage unit, such as data storage unit () or (), or a separate data storage unit as discussed in the instant application.

The S.M.A.R.T. unit is configured to thoroughly diagnose the operating conditions of the processing system having a variety of conveyance and transport equipment incorporated into the same.","Processing systems are becoming more complicated and may include, e.g., individual processing machines (i.e., modules) interconnected with other like modules, to create very large integral processing systems including a variety of conveyance and transport equipment for mail sorting and sequencing systems. Monitoring and diagnosing the operating conditions of these systems has become complicated. To monitor such systems, currently software is developed to monitor, inter alia, sensors for jams, motors for overloads, power supplies for outages, and other catastrophic failures within the machine or system. A limitation of these known monitoring systems is that they cannot adequately predict a machine or system failure until after it has occurred, and the machine or system has failed. As a result of this limitation the machine or system may be damaged, the product being conveyed through the machine or system may be damaged, and valuable production time is lost.","A solution is to provide the S.M.A.R.T. unit that is configured to travel along a plurality of conveyance paths connecting the various processing modules of the system in a manner similar to a path that flat mail, flat letters, and small packages would travel during a mail sorting and sequencing operation. In embodiments, the S.M.A.R.T. unit contains at least a rugged single board personal computer including wireless communication such as infrared, WI-FI, or other wireless communication.

The S.M.A.R.T. unit compares readings from subsequent runs through the system with the initial base line operating conditions data. In this way, the S.M.A.R.T. unit can diagnose a problem prior to it becoming a catastrophic machine failure, and can alert the appropriate party so as to prevent any potential failures from occurring during operation. As a result, the operation is more efficient, and the life of the machine and\/or system is extended.","The S.M.A.R.T. unit senses and records operating conditions data at various points throughout the system and reports the data back to a central control, personal computer, or control unit, as disclosed. Preferably, the S.M.A.R.T. unit is battery powered with a small footprint.

The onboard personal computer as well as the other components are ruggedized to handle extreme vibrations and impacts such that data collection is not altered, and communication with the control unit is not interrupted. For example, circuitry of the unit can be encapsulated in an epoxy to provide stabilization and toughness when experiencing vibrations and impacts during operation. The personal computer board also has a very low power usage to optimize battery life.","The S.M.A.R.T. unit also includes physical connections such as video output, keyboard, mouse, USB, Ethernet, serial port, sound and other connectors known to those having ordinary skill in the art. The S.M.A.R.T. unit also utilizes solid state device(s) for bulk memory storage like solid state hard drives, flash cards, or similar devices.

For example, the microphones  are intended to pick up audio signals such as bearing squeal, mechanical impacts (e.g., clicking, banging, or frictional rubbing that should be absent from the system), etc. Audible noises recorded by the microphones  are transmitted to the control unit for analysis and diagnosis of any problem. However, it is also contemplated that the analysis may be performed in the S.M.A.R.T. unit , itself.","In embodiments, infrared thermometers  are provided just below the microphones  at the outer upper edges of the generally rectangular S.M.A.R.T. unit ; although the infrared thermometers  may be located at other positions in the S.M.A.R.T. unit . The infrared thermometers  detect hot spots throughout the system. Hot spots are areas of concentrated heat as compared to the surrounding environment. Generally, the infrared thermometers  can aid in detecting when and where a motor, a drive shaft, a gearbox, a bearing, a roller cam bracket, etc., is deteriorating to the point that the component may fail and impair system operation.

In subsequent passes, the data collected by the S.M.A.R.T. unit  is compared to the base line operating conditions data collected during the initial run. The control unit can detect any parameters or characteristics that fall outside the base line operating conditions data, and the appropriate correction can be made before a failure occurs. It is contemplated that the system is configured to provide a tolerable range of acceptable recorded data (that would be considered within the optimal operating conditions range) before alerting maintenance to a potentially catastrophic failure. In this manner, the proper personnel can take appropriate action such as ordering necessary parts and scheduling down time when it is least disruptive to the operation of processing mail.

The present invention contemplates that the shuttles may be implemented, for example, in any postal service or company mail center that presorts, sorts, and\/or sequences mail pieces or other products. Shuttle implementation provides a low cost solution to transportation needs for items stored singularly or in bulk amounts.","More specifically, , generally shows an embodiment of a shuttle  configured to transport at least one frame F. In embodiments, the shuttle  includes a generally parallel piped construction having e.g., at least two side walls , at least two open end walls , a bottom wall , and a top wall  to allow the at least one frame F to be loaded and unloaded from the shuttle . The at least two open end walls  are open to provide a pathway for frames to enter and exit the interior of the shuttle . The at least two side walls , bottom wall , and top wall  may also be open, or have a closed or partially closed surface. The present invention contemplates that the shuttle  may be constructed of injection molded plastic, or a machined aluminum, or any suitable material known to those having ordinary skill in the art so as to provide a sturdy, lightweight and cost effective material suitable for conveying items singularly or in bulk amounts.","In embodiments, the at least two open end walls  of the shuttle  are generally angled (e.g., at 45 degrees with respect to the direction of a conveyance path) such that open end walls  of subsequent shuttles  may nest with each other, as generally shown in . It is noted that the frames are also provided at a generally 45 degree angle with respect to the direction of a conveyance path in the shuttle interior. This configuration minimizes constraints on storage space and maximizes use of shuttle  interior space so as to provide additional interior room within the shuttle for transporting a higher volume of frames F. The present invention also contemplates that the shuttles  may also be square in configuration, or any shape conducive to the transport of frames along the conveyance path.","The shuttle  further includes at least four non-powered (e.g., driven) lead screws  provided at upper and lower sides of the shuttle  extending along the length of the shuttle  in a direction parallel with the conveyance path. The non-powered lead screws  support the frames F during conveyance, and assist in the loading and unloading of the frames F into and out of the shuttle . In embodiments, the non-powered lead screws  are configured to hold frames at a 45 degree angle (with respect to the direction of a conveyance path). In embodiments, the non-powered lead screws  are provided with a plurality of threads (i.e., a minimum pitch) such that about 110 frames F may be securely loaded on the shuttle  at any given time; however more or less threads and frames are also contemplated by the present invention depending on the requirements of the mail sorting and sequencing system. The non-powered lead screws  are configured to mate with corresponding powered (e.g., driving) lead screws  extending from an entrance (or exit) of a machine for purposes of docking the shuttle  in preparation of loading and unloading of frames F.","In this regard and as shown in  and , the non-powered lead screws  of the shuttle  align and engage with powered lead screws  extending from the machine  at a docking station . The docking station  ensures a secure engagement between the shuttle  and the machine  for efficient movement of the frames F on and off the shuttle . The non-powered lead screws  may be any non-powered conveyance mechanism so long as the mechanism is compatible with any known conveying system in any machine  to which it is docked. Further, the non-powered conveyance mechanism is designed to support the frames F during movement of the shuttle , properly align and securely engage the shuttle  to the docking station , and assist in the loading and unloading of frames F onto or off of the shuttle  after engagement with the machine .","In embodiments, each shuttle  may also include a unique identifier such that an exact location of a given shuttle  is known at all times as the shuttle  is conveyed from machine to machine. In this regard, the shuttle  may be transported through the conveyance path on COTS equipment (i.e., commercial off-the-shelf conveyance equipment) or carts, or any specialized conveyance equipment known to those having ordinary skill for conveying items singularly or in bulk. This may include standard cots material handling equipment or carts as discussed in the instant application to transport the frames F in volume to various machines  for sorting and sequencing. Transportation along these conveyance paths allow the shuttle  to carry bulk batches of frames F between machines  in an efficient (i.e., best path routing) manner.","As further shown in , the shuttle  also includes side posts . The side posts  define outer corner edges of the side walls  and the open end walls . In embodiments, each side post  includes at least two notches ; one of the at least two notches  is provided at an inner upper portion of the side post  and a second of the at least two notches is provided at an inner lower portion of the side post . The at least two notches  define upper and lower inner edges of the open end walls  to provide clearance for projections (e.g., wings) extending from upper and lower edges of the frames F being loaded and unloaded. The at least two notches  further provide clearance for lead end portions of the non-powered lead screws  and lead end portions of guide rods  connected to a braking mechanism  (which is described in more detail below).","Shuttle Docking System","As shown in  and , shuttle  may dock at either an entrance or an exit of the machine  to transfer or receive frames F. The docking station  may be provided at each entrance and exit of the machine . In embodiments, each docking station  includes the powered lead screws , which extend outward from the machine  entrance or exit along the length of the conveyance path to engage a corresponding non-powered lead screw  from an approaching shuttle .","As shown in  and  a docking joint  is provided where lead end portions of the non-powered lead screw  engage lead end portions of the powered lead screws . In embodiments, the lead end portions may be either a male connector or a female connector such that the female connector mates with a corresponding male connector. For example, lead end portions of the non-powered lead screws  may be female connectors that mate with corresponding male connectors provided at the lead end portions of the powered lead screws  extending from the docking station .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1347","num":"1604"},"figref":"FIG. 37E","b":["3720","3720","3722","3714","3718","3724","3712","3700","3722","3724","3722","3724","3714","3712","3714","3712","3722","3724","3720"]},"The male connectors  and the female connectors  are also self orienting. That is, even if the male connector  and the female connector  are misaligned as the shuttle  approaches the docking station , the error in alignment can be corrected such that the threads of the non-powered lead screws  and the threads of the powered lead screws  align for a smooth transition of the frames F on and off the shuttles .","In embodiments and as shown in , the male connector  is provided with a four sided tapered square tang  extending from a center portion of the lead end portion of the powered lead screws . The tapered square tang  allows the powered lead screws  to securely rotate the corresponding non-powered lead screws  having the female connectors . The tapered portions of the tapered square tang  assist in compensating for misalignment with the non-powered lead screws  of the shuttle  at the point of engagement with the female connector  and allow for an acceptable range of engagement points to complete the docking joint  when the shuttle  is docked. It is contemplated that the tapered square tang  may include any number of sides so long as it is able to engage the female connector  and drive the non-powered lead screws  to load and unload the frames F. It is further contemplated that the tapered square tang  may also include a retainer having spring loaded bearings at the tapered portions of the tapered square tang  for a more secure connection with the female connector .","In embodiments, the female connector  includes a broached hole  at lead end portion of the non-powered lead screws . The broached hole  further includes a countersunk rim  to allow the tapered square tang  of the male connector  to self align at the point of engagement with the female connector . In this regard, the countersunk rim  compensates for errors in alignment with the male connector . The countersunk rim  includes a plurality of countersunk notches  that extend into the broached hole . The countersunk notches  further aid in aligning and securing the lead screws ,  such that the powered lead screws  can drive the non-powered lead screws  for purposes of loading and unloading frames F. The countersunk rim  provides a self aligning lead-in for the male connector  such that registration of the tapered square tang  within the broached hole  corresponds to an alignment of the phase or peak of the mating lead screw threads. The present invention further contemplates that generally, as long as the lead ends of the lead screws are flat against each other in the docking joint , alignment is always achieved.","In operation, the shuttle  is directed towards the entrance or exit of the machine . The powered lead screws  are shut-off to receive the approaching shuttle . The non-powered lead screws  are aligned with the powered lead screws . More particularly, the female connector  is guided over the male connector . The female connector  engages the male connector  (via registration of the square tapered tang  with the broached hole ) to complete the docking joint . The powered lead screws  are turned on and rotate the non-powered lead screws . The frames F are loaded onto or unloaded from the docked shuttle . The powered lead screws  are turned off. Loaded or empty shuttles  are deployed from the docking station . The male connector  and the female connector  are disengaged and the shuttle  is directed to a predetermined destination within the mail sorting and sequencing system.","Shuttle Braking System","During transit from one machine  to another, shuttle  may experience vibrations and external forces acting on shuttle components; however, the non-powered lead screws  supporting the frames F, should not be negatively affected by the vibrations such that frames F are shifted, misaligned or disengaged from the non-powered lead screws  during transit on the shuttle . That is, the frames may prevent the non-powered lead screws  from rotating during conveyance. Additionally, preventing the non-powered lead screws  from rotating during transit ensures elimination of potential problems at the docking joint  during loading and unloading of the frames F. However, as an added measure to prevent accidental movement of the non-powered lead screws  during transit of the frames F, the shuttle  may include at least one braking mechanism . This ensures that the frames F remain secured and stabilized until arrival at the machine  docking station .","As shown in , each non-powered lead screw  has at least one corresponding braking mechanism . In embodiments, at least four braking mechanisms  are provided on the body of the shuttle , but less braking mechanisms  are contemplated by the present invention. The braking mechanism  generally includes at least two guide rod support blocks  secured to the shuttle  at the bottom wall  and\/or the top wall . A guide rod  is supported by and extending through the at least two guide rod support blocks . Each guide rod support block  includes an aperture for receiving a portion of the guide rod  to slidably pass through.","The guide rods  are provided adjacent an interior side of the non-powered lead screws . In this regard, the at least two guide rod support blocks  also rotatably support at least a lower side of the non-powered lead screws . The height and\/or position of the guide rod  and the guide rod support blocks  with respect to the bottom wall  of the shuttle  is generally lower than the height at which the non-powered lead screws  are mounted to the guide rod support blocks . This position and dimension ensures that the braking mechanism  does not interfere with the loading and unloading of the frames F traveling along an upper side of the non-powered lead screws . Similarly, the non-powered lead screws  provided along the top surface of the shuttle  are mounted on the guide rod support blocks  to hang lower than the height of the guide rod  extending from the top wall  to provide sufficient clearance for frames entering and exiting the shuttle  interior. The braking mechanisms  are also provided at either a front end or back end of the shuttle; however the present invention contemplates the braking mechanism  being provided at any location along the length of the non-powered lead screws .","As shown in  and  I, the braking mechanism  also includes a cam  provided along the guide rod  in between the at least two guide rod support blocks . The cam  is generally cylindrical in shape, wherein the diameter is gradually narrowed towards the center creating an indented curvature through the middle of the cylinder (i.e., similar to an hour-glass shape). At least first and second elastic members  (e.g., helical springs) are provided along the length of the guide rod  between an inner side of each guide rod support block  and an end surface of the cam . A third elastic member (e.g., spring)  urges a brake arm  in an opposing direction.","In embodiments, and as shown in , the braking mechanism  is in an activated position when cam  is urged into a rest or center position. That is, the at least first and second elastic members  effect a force on each end surface of the cam  and each inner side of the guide rod support blocks  such that the cam  rests in a center position between the guide rod support blocks . In the activated position, the braking mechanism  prevents the non-powered lead screws  from rotating or becoming out of phase during transit of the frames F. While elastic members are shown, it is contemplated that a magnetic system could also be implemented for urging the cam  into its rest position.","The braking mechanism  also includes a brake arm  operatively connected to the guide rod  for frictionally engaging the non-powered lead screws . The brake arm  is provided between the guide rod support blocks  and below the cam  and the guide rod . The brake arm  extends from a lower surface of the cam  to a lower surface of the non-powered lead screw . The brake arm  is pivotally engaged with a brake arm mount  to allow vertical movement of the brake arm . When the braking mechanism  is in the activated position, the brake arm  is urged towards its active position, i.e., the brake arm  engages the lower end of the non-powered lead screw . That is, the brake arm  is urged upward via a third elastic member  positioned below a lower surface of the brake arm  such that the brake arm  frictionally engages the non-powered lead screw  and prevents the non-powered lead screws  (and the frames F if loaded on the shuttle ) from moving during transit.","The brake arm  also includes a deflectable roller cam  (or domed protrusion), or any cam surface provided at an upper surface of the brake arm  such that the roller cam  is aligned beneath the indented curvature of the cam  in its activated position. When the braking mechanism  is in its active position, the roller cam  does not interfere with the central positioning of the cam , and the non-powered lead screws  are frictionally engaged with the brake arm .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1359","num":"1616"},"figref":"FIG. 37I","b":["3734","3700","3716","3740","3738","3736","3700","3740","3718","3740","3744","3746","3746","3744","3746","3744","3754","3744","3754","3754","3752","3748","3734","3712"]},"Simultaneous with the deactivation of the braking mechanism  during docking of the shuttle , the non-powered lead screws  engage the powered lead screws  and are freely rotatable for purposes of loading and unloading of the frames F. Thus, the frames F are conveyed on and off the docked shuttle , and the brake mechanism  is disengaged from the non-powered lead screws  until deployment of the shuttle  from the docking station . During deployment, the first and second elastic members  return the cam  to its rest position, thereby activating the brake mechanism  for transit between machines . It is also contemplated that the weight of the frames may also serve as a brake on the non-powered lead screws .","Shuttle Clamping System","To ensure alignment of the male connector  and the female connector  and accurate deactivation of the braking mechanism , a swing clamp mechanism  is provided at the docking station , as shown in . In this regard, a BCR, or any sensor known to those having ordinary skill in the art, monitors the approaching shuttle , and at a position in close proximity to the docking station , the swing clamp mechanism  extends and rotates (or swings) to engage the shuttle  and pull it towards the docking station  to align the powered lead screws  with the non-powered lead screws  and to deactivate the braking mechanism  (via the interaction between the guide rod  and the stationary stopper) for loading and unloading of the frames F. The swing clamp mechanism  prevents detachment of the engaged lead screws ,  and activation of the braking mechanism  during loading and unloading (and thus prevents disengagement of the shuttle  from the docking station ) to ensure that all of the frames F are properly transported to their predetermined destination.","More specifically, as shown in , the swing clamp mechanism  is provided at an outer side of the docking station  of the machine  that receives shuttles . The swing clamp mechanism  is provided to properly align and\/or securely engage the powered lead screws  of the machine  with the non-powered lead screws  of the shuttle .","In embodiments and as shown in , the swing clamp mechanism  includes a servomotor , a telescoping arm  having at least a base arm  and an extension arm , and a rotatable swing clamp arm . The swing clamp mechanism  is configured to retract from an extended position to a retracted position (as shown in ) to engage an approaching shuttle  at the docking station . The present invention contemplates that the swing clamp mechanism may alternatively be configured with a pneumatic rotary screw actuator for actuating engagement of the shuttle  with the docking station .","In embodiments, the swing clamp arm  is pivotally attached to a front end of the extension arm  and extends in a direction transverse to a telescoping direction of the telescoping arm . In the retracted position, the extension arm  retracts into an interior portion of the base arm  such that the swing clamp arm  is provided at a front end of the base arm . In the extended position, the extension arm  extends from the base arm  such that the extension arm  is provided between the base arm  and the swing clamp arm . The swing clamp arm  may also provide a grasp element  configured to securely engage a portion of the shuttle  with the swing clamp mechanism . In embodiments, the grasp element  may be provided at a side end of the swing clamp arm  opposite the portion of the swing clamp arm  pivotally attached to the front end of the extension arm . The grasp element  may include, but is not limited to a robotic arm, a magnet, a suction cup, a latch hook, a male or female connector, or any other element for grasping known to those having ordinary skill.","In embodiments, the swing clamp arm  may be provided in a deactivated position or in an activated position. In the deactivated position, the swing clamp arm  is in an initial upright position. That is, the swing clamp arm  may be in any position in which it does not interfere with the docking station , the conveyance path, and the approaching shuttle . In the activated position, the swing clamp arm  may be rotated to engage a portion of the approaching shuttle .","In embodiments and when the swing clamp mechanism  is in the extended position, the swing clamp arm  may be rotated from the deactivated position to the activated position to engage a portion of the approaching shuttle . For example, the swing clamp arm  may swing into the conveyance path to engage an inner front side edge of a front frame member of the shuttle  and guide the shuttle  into engagement position with the docking station . That is, the swing clamp mechanism  ensures that the male connector  and the female connector  are securely aligned for smooth engagement, as well as ensuring that the braking mechanism  is deactivated so as to allow free rotation of the non-powered lead screws . It is also contemplated that the swing clamp arm  may be provided in a deactivated position when the swing clamp mechanism  is in the retracted position.","In embodiments and as shown in  (when the swing clamp mechanism  is in the retracted position), the swing clamp arm  is in the activated position. That is, the swing clamp arm  engages the approaching shuttle  and pulls it towards the docking station  to securely align the shuttle  with the docking station  for loading and unloading of frames F.","In operation, the docking station  provides the swing clamp mechanism  in an extended position and a sensor detects an approaching shuttle  on the conveyance path at a pre-determined distance. The swing clamp mechanism  actuates the servomotor . The swing clamp arm  rotates into the conveyance path. The grasp element  engages a portion of the shuttle . The swing clamp mechanism  retracts the telescoping arm  and pulls the shuttle  such that the powered lead screws  extending from the docking station  align and securely engage with the non-powered lead screws  of the shuttle . The braking mechanism  is also deactivated in this state. The shuttle  is securely docked when the swing clamp mechanism is in its retracted position and the swing clamp arm  and grasp element  are operatively connected to the shuttle . That is, as the shuttle  approaches and the grasp element  makes contact with the shuttle , the extension arm  retracts towards the base arm  to guide and secure the shuttle  to the docking station  (and prevent detachment) for loading and unloading of the frames F. It is also contemplated that the docking station  provides the swing clamp mechanism  in a retracted position such that when an approaching shuttle  is detected, the telescoping arm  having the swing clamp arm  extends outwardly in a direction parallel to the conveyance path for engagement with the approaching shuttle .","The swing clamp mechanism  releases contact with the shuttle  so that the shuttle  can be deployed to another machine . More specifically, in embodiments, a sensor may detect the last frame F either loaded onto or unloaded from the shuttle . The servomotor  actuates the telescoping arm  to extend from the retracted position to the extended position. In other words, the extension arm  is extended from the retracted position within the base arm  and the swing clamp arm  releases its hold on the shuttle . In the extended position, the swing clamp arm  rotates out of the conveyance path into its deactivated position until a subsequent shuttle  approaches. The present invention also contemplates that during deployment of the shuttle  from the docking station , the swing clamp mechanism  may also be in the retracted position until actuated.","While not limited by the abovementioned embodiments, the shuttle mechanism, including the components related to shuttle docking, shuttle braking, and shuttle clamping, ensures secure transportation of frames between machines, as well as the loading and unloading of the frames into the machines. The shuttle mechanism provides low cost components that are reliable and enable a mail sorting and sequencing system to efficiently process bulk amounts of mail therethrough.","The invention provides, in embodiments, a system architecture for a facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system. The mail sorting and\/or sequencing system of the present invention combines and sequences both letters and flats together which provides a major benefit and cost savings to the postal industry. As such, the present invention contemplates the architecture for sequencing letters and flats throughout an entire mail processing facility using the facility-wide letters\/flats mail sorting and\/or sequencing system.","Prior to the present invention, no known system has yet successfully achieved a combined letters\/flats sequenced mail stream. For example, DBCS (Delivery Bar Code Sorter) systems sequence letters mail for the USPS today. FSS (Flats Sequencing System) provide the USPS with a system for sequencing flats mail only. DPP (Delivery Point Packaging) was a prior attempt by the USPS to solicit a letters\/flats sequencing machine, but this effort was abandoned. Thus, any type of postal service or mail center that needs to sequence letters and flats mail can benefit by utilizing the systems and methods of the instant application.","A fundamental strategy of the architecture is to provide a facility-wide system that performs one continuous mail operation, which requires significantly reduced human labor than is required by the multiple operations that must be performed on the individual letters\/flats sorting\/sequencing machines in use today. As such, according to non-limiting aspects of the invention, the system architecture includes a plurality of inter-related functions. For example, the following system architecture and inter-related functions are contemplated by the present invention.\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1374","num":"1644"},"figref":"FIG. 38A","b":["3800","3800","3801","3800"]},"The system  also utilizes processing functions  which include a presort accumulator that performs an initial quick sort and buffers frames prior to transport to a storage segment. A transport controller includes numerous conveyors which transport the mail frames internally to storage segments and container loading operations. A sequencer controls all sorting and sequencing operations. The details of these sub-systems will be described in detail below.","The system  further utilizes output functions . For example, a container loader packs the mail pieces into delivery containers and labels the containers. A container dispatcher moves the delivery containers from the loader to the dispatch preparation areas. The details of these sub-systems will be described in detail below.","The system  further utilizes management functions . These functions include, for example, a frame manager that receives frames into the system, inspects frames, and recirculates empty frames in the system for subsequent use. A shuttle manager receives shuttles into the system. A storage manager provides a massive storage facility for daily sequencing operations and stages mail for final sorting and sequencing. A frame tracking agent provides real-time tracking of the location and contents of all filled frames. A system manager maintains system status, authenticates access to system resources, provides tables containing operational data, manages configuration data and software updates, and provides self test and diagnostics capabilities for all system functions. The details of these sub-systems will be described in detail below.","The description that follows presents and describes a logical architecture of the complete system (level 1). Another section will provide a further decomposition (level 2) and description of each function in the logical architecture.","The logical architecture for the system is shown in . This is the highest level (Level 1) decomposition of the architecture, which shows the major functions that comprise the system and their primary interactions. The level 1 system  thus includes a plurality of inter-related functions, beginning with an induction manager  that manages letters and flats mail induction into the system. A frame inserter  assigns each mail piece to a \u201cframe\u201d containment device. A presort accumulator  loads frames into frame transport shuttles and allocates each shuttle to one of \u201cn\u201d sequencing segments. A transport controller  moves shuttles to their allocated sequencing segment. Then, a sequencer  performs the task of sequencing the frames into delivery point order by unloading and then reloading shuttles.","A storage manager  manages the buffering and staging of shuttles\/frames in storage. Then, a container loader  extracts mail pieces from the frames and loads delivery containers. A container dispatcher  then prepares the containers for delivery. A system manager  provides data management tasks. A frame tracking agent  manages real-time location tracking of frames and a frame manager  manages induction, inspection, and replenishment of frames. A shuttle manager  manages induction and inspection of shuttles.","Table 4 shows non-limiting tasks which are preferably performed by the induction manager  shown in .

A frame receiver  accepts empty frames into the system through a manual or automated induction process. The frames could be new (i.e., never used) frames or frames that were rejected to manual inspection but were determined to be fit for recirculation. Empty frames in shuttles are also forwarded to the frame inspector  via a shuttle unloader which removes the empty frames from the shuttles, forwards the frames to the frame inspector, and forwards the empty shuttles to a shuttle manager (see ). All frames that are inducted are sent to a frame inspector  for inspection. This inspection is preferably completely automated. Empty frames are returned to the frame manager  for inspection by several system functions.

The purpose of the accumulator allocation plan is to allocate each tube of a presort accumulator to a unique subset of the entire domain of destinating mail. In embodiments, every input segment within the system has its own presort accumulator and every presort accumulator has the same number of tubes. Each presort accumulator is comprised of n accumulation tubes, where n is defined in the system master configuration plan. All tubes within a presort accumulator have the same length. However, tube length may vary from one presort accumulator to another. The length of a tube does not affect the accumulator allocation plan, because once an accumulator tube fills up to a configurable threshold, its contents are immediately sent to a Sequencer Segment.","The domain of destinating mail is preferably divided into subsets that are comprised of unique groups of ZIP codes. Each group of ZIP codes is allocated to a different accumulator tube. The grouping of ZIP codes is preferably based on two criteria: (1) the average daily mail volume of the ZIP codes in each group; and (2) the volume of mail that can be contained by the Storage Segment assigned to each group of ZIP codes. During presorted mail induction, additional accumulator tubes may be dynamically allocated as needed to maintain induction throughput. Additional information on dynamic allocation is discussed below.","As shown in , the output of each accumulator tube of input segment  follows a path through the rest of the system. Specifically, input segment   sends mail through sequencer segment   and on to storage segment  . However, any sequencer segment \/ can serve the needs of any input segment ; therefore, alternate paths are available to reach a storage segment \/. Furthermore, multiple sequencer segments may serve a specific input segment at any one time, which can help alleviate congestion due to mail volume skew and presorted mail induction. Note that only one input segment is shown in the figure; however, each input segment can have the same configuration.

would have the configuration accumulator allocation plan  shown in , which includes input segment , sequencer segments  and , storage segments  and , container loader segments , and dispatch areas . As with the configuration shown in , the exemplary configuration  of  utilizes main transports  and , as well as a container transport .","The system also utilizes a sort allocation plan which can preferably define which pre-sequence sorter tube a mail piece frame should be placed in. In embodiments, the pre-sequence sorter is the first of two components of a sequencer segment, which also includes the sequencer stages. Just as a presort accumulator provides a breakdown of the total destinating mail flow, a sorter can provide a further breakdown of the mail flow allocated to a specific accumulator tube. Each sequencer segment may receive mail from any accumulator tube of any presort accumulator. Therefore, each sequencer segment should be capable of sequencing different subsets of destinating mail as determined by the ZIP codes contained in each group of received mail. The group of ZIP codes will preferably always match one of the tubes in the accumulator allocation plan.","Each pre-sequence sorter is preferably comprised of n tubes, as defined in the master configuration plan. The length of tubes may vary across each sequencer segment, but all tubes within a single segment will have the same length. Pre-sequence sorter tubes will fill depending on the flow of mail. Once a tube fills to a configurable threshold, the tube contents are sent to the sequencer stages. During presorted mail induction, additional pre-sequence sorter tubes may be dynamically allocated as needed to maintain induction throughput. Additional details on dynamic allocation are discussed below.","The sort allocation plan attempts to balance the estimated volume of mail and number of routes across pre-sequence sorter tubes. Balancing the volume of mail minimizes the possibility that a specific tube could become overloaded. Balancing the number of routes helps to balance the quantity of containers to load for dispatch across the loaders in each container segment. To achieve this balance, all routes are preferably ordered by volume (highest to lowest) and assigned in a round-robin fashion to each pre-sequence sorter tube. The sort allocation plan also defines which aisle of a storage segment to place the frames in. The groups defined in the sort allocation plan, one per pre-sequence sorter tube, are directly mapped to each aisle in the destination storage segment.","Table 27 shows an exemplary plan creation process illustrating a five-step process used to create the sort allocation plan.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-1487","num":"1795"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00030","num":"00030"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"252pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 27"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Step 1","Determine the number of tubes in the Pre-Sequence Sorter (N)"]},{"entry":[{},"This value is contained in the Master Configuration Plan."]},{"entry":["Step 2","Determine the groups of ZIP codes to allocate to the Pre-Sequence Sorter"]},{"entry":[{},"This information is contained in the Accumulator Allocation Plan.

includes input segment  , sequencer segment  , storage segment  , container loader segments , and dispatch areas . As with the configuration shown in , the exemplary configuration  of  utilizes main transports  and , as well as a container transport .","The system also includes a sequence plan. In embodiments, the sequence plan is used by the sequencer and the storage manager when receiving mail from the transport controller to determine the DPS order for every route. The first column can be the 11-digit ZIP codes, all listed in numerical ascending order. This is the column the look-up would be performed on. Column  can be the route.

When mail is prepared for dispatch from the system, frames are unloaded and containers are filled with sequenced mail. Each container is transported to a dispatch area on the plant floor. Dispatch areas are \u201cholding\u201d areas for filled containers of mail. Mail handlers at each dispatch area pull the containers off the conveyor as they arrive and load them onto mail carts that can be transported to each dock. The number of dispatch areas will vary by mail facility. The purpose of the dispatch plan for the system is to identify the dispatch areas and the docks and stalls that they hold the mail for. The P&DC will define the dispatch areas and dock\/stall assignments. In embodiments, it is anticipated that each dispatch area will hold mail for a consecutive set of dock stalls, which will increase efficiency of cart transportation.
