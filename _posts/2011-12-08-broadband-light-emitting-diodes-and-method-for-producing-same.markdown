title: Broadband light emitting diodes and method for producing same
abstract: A III-Nitride semiconductor LED provides broadband light emission, across all or most of the visible light wavelength spectrum, and a method for producing same. The LED includes a polarization field management template that has a three-dimensional patterned surface. The surface may be patterned with an array of hemispherical cavities, which may be formed by growing the template around a temporary template layer of spherical or other crystals. The method involves growing a quantum well layer on the patterned surface. The topographical variations in the patterned surface of the template cause corresponding topographical variations in the quantum well layer. These variations in spatial orientation of portions of the quantum well layer cause the polarization field of the quantum well layer to vary across the surface of the LED, which leads to energy transition shifting that provides “white” light emission across a broad wavelength spectrum.

The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates generally to semiconductor light-emitting devices (LEDs) including gallium-nitride (GaN)-based quantum wells, and more particularly to a GaN-based semiconductor LED providing broadband (multi-spectra) emission producing \u201cwhite\u201d light suitable for home illumination, and a method for producing same.","A quantum well is a potential boundary that confines particles to a planar, substantially two dimension region. As used herein, the term \u201cquantum well\u201d refers to a thin-layer structure comprising alternate layers consisting of a first semiconductor layer with a thickness smaller than the de Broglie wavelength of about 200 \u212b to 300 \u212b with respect to electrons or holes and at least a second semiconductor layer with a bandgap greater than that of the first semiconductor layer. A \u201csubstrate\u201d is an underlying template or substratum, such as a GaN substrate, a GaN\/sapphire template, a Si substrate, a SiC substrate or a ZnO substrate.","The electrons and holes in the quantum well layer cannot move freely in the direction of thickness and are substantially confined two-dimensionally in a plane perpendicular to the thickness direction. The two-dimensional confinement increases bound energy of Coulombic electron, and hole attraction so that excitons occur under heat energy at room temperature.","A quantum well can be formed as part of a semiconductor by having a material, such as indium gallium nitride (InGaN), sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material such as gallium nitride (GaN).  is a diagrammatic representation of an exemplary prior art gallium-nitride-based quantum well  that includes an active layer  of InGaN sandwiched between higher bandgap barrier layers  of GaN. For example, the InGaN active layer  may have a thickness of approximately 20 \u212b to 50 \u212b, and each barrier layer  may have a thickness of approximately 50 \u212b to 250 \u212b.","A quantum well effect can be achieved in a device by alternating two kinds of very thin semiconductor layers with different bandgap characteristics. As well known in the art, such structures can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). These procedures can provide a layer having a thickness as small as a molecular monolayer.","The GaN-based quantum well semiconductor suffers from large charge separation in the quantum well. Due to the polarization fields in an InGaN quantum well, the electron and hole wavefunctions are confined in opposite directions leading to reduction of the electron-hole wavefunction overlap (\u0393), as shown in . The detrimental effect from such charge separation becomes more severe, as the emission wavelength of the InGaN quantum wells is extended into green, yellow and red spectral regimes. This means that \u201cwhite\u201d light, comprised of multi-spectra emission across a broad band of wavelengths, that is a suitable alternative to the \u201cwarm\u201d light provided by incandescent lighting in home and general-purpose illumination, is difficult to obtain. In addition the ability to generate white light emission by using a light-emitting diode will result in significantly more energy-efficient light emitters.","Existing approaches for multiple-spectra broadband LED emission are not well-suited for solid state lighting applications. For example, one approach involves use of phosphor-based LEDs. However, such phosphor-based LEDs have relatively high packaging costs and an overall reduced efficiency due to Stokes shift, which means makes them generally poorly suited for widespread use in lighting applications. More specifically, the use of phosphor-based technology to down-convert blue-photons from blue-emitting LEDs is limited by the Stokes shift energy loss, which results in challenges in achieving high wall-plug efficiency LEDs that produce white light. By way of further example, an alternative approach involves use of carrier distribution of vertical multiple-stacked InGaN QWs. However, this approach leads to non-uniform carrier distribution, and therefore the light intensity and color spectra will be strongly influenced by current injection level. The use of vertically-stacked, dissimilar InGaN QWs will result in ratio of the light intensity of emission wavelengths from each QWs to be changing with current density, which in turn results in changing color temperature as the current density is varied. Yet another approach involves a \u201ctwo-facet\u201d quantum well, in which the use of the trapezoidal regrowth method enables the growth of GaN with facets of 0-degree and 60-degree orientations. The availability of the two facets enable the growth of InGaN QWs with two different polarizations\/orientations, resulting in two-color LEDs. However, this approach is inherently limited to provide two-peak spectra, which is insufficient relative to the visible light spectrum to provide \u201cwhite\u201d light.","What is needed is a nitride-based white light LED capable of generating supercontinuum and broadband emission that covers the whole visible light region (\u03bb\u02dc450-nm, 540 nm, 580 nm, and 630 nm), and provides warm white light suitable for home illumination.","Generally, the present invention provides a III Nitride-based semiconductor LED including a polarization field management template having a three-dimensional patterned surface on which the quantum well layer is formed. Thus, the quantum well layer has topographical variations corresponding to those of the polarization field management template. These variations in spatial orientation of portions of the quantum well layer cause the polarization field of the quantum well layer to vary across the surface of the LED, which leads to energy transition shifting. The LED thus provides broadband emission (multi-spectra, across all or most of the visible light wavelength spectrum), and thus emits warm \u201cwhite\u201d light that is particularly well-suited for home-illumination applications.","In one embodiment, a III-Nitride based semiconductor device is provided that includes a polarization field management template of a first GaN-based material having a first conduction type. The polarization field management template comprises a patterned surface defining a plurality of concave cavities. The device further includes a quantum well layer formed on and substantially conforming to the patterned surface of the polarization field management template. The quantum well layer comprises a quantum well active layer sandwiched between first and second barrier layers. The quantum well active layer includes an inner layer of a first nitride-based material having a first bandgap characteristic; and a pair of outer layers of a second nitride-based material different from the first nitride-based material. The second nitride-based material has a second bandgap characteristic greater than the first bandgap characteristic. The pair of outer layers sandwiches the inner layer. The device further includes a conduction layer of a second GaN-based material having a second conduction type opposite to the first conduction type. The conduction layer covers at least substantially all of the quantum well layer.","A light emitting III-Nitride based semiconductor device comprising further includes a first contact of a first metal of the first conduction type in contact with the substrate, and a second contact of a second metal of the second conduction type in contact with the conduction layer.","In certain embodiments, the concave cavities are arranged in closely-packed relationship and\/or in a substantially-uniform hexagonal array. In certain embodiments, the concave cavities are homogeneous and\/or hemispherical in shape, e.g., having a maximum diameter measuring less than 1 micron.","Also provided is a method for manufacturing a III-Nitride based light-emitting semiconductor device. The method includes providing a substantially planar substrate of a first GaN-based material having a first conduction type; providing a template layer of crystals on the substantially planar substrate; growing a shaped layer of the first GaN-based material on the substrate and around the crystals; removing the crystals to reveal a polarization field management template comprising a patterned surface defining a plurality of concave cavities; growing a quantum well layer on and substantially conforming to the patterned surface of the polarization field management template; growing a conduction layer of a second GaN-based material having a second conduction type opposite to said first conduction type on the quantum well layer, the conduction layer covering at least substantially all of the quantum well layer; depositing a first metal of said first conduction type on said substrate to form a first contact; and depositing a second metal of said second conduction type on said conduction layer to form a second contact.","Provided also is a method for producing broadband light emission using a III-Nitride based light-emitting semiconductor device. The method involves providing the III-Nitride based light-emitting semiconductor device; and exciting the quantum well layer to produce optical emission from the shaped quantum well layer.","The present invention provides a III-Nitride (e.g., GaN-based) semiconductor LED that provides broadband (multi-spectra, e.g., in the red, yellow, green and blue spectra, across all or most of the visible light region, \u03bb\u02dc450-nm, 540 nm, 580 nm, and 630 nm) white light emission. Further, the present invention provides a method for forming the III-Nitride semiconductor LED. More specifically, the LED includes a novel polarization field management template, which is formed by a novel process generally involving depositing a monolayer of crystals on a conductive substrate, growing conductive material on the substrate and around the crystals, and then removing the crystals to provide the polarization field management template. The polarization field management template thus has a three-dimensional patterned surface including an array of cavities, preferably hemispherical cavities. Forming a multiple quantum well (MQW) layer on the patterned surface causes the polarization fields of the MQWs to vary across the surface of the LED, and such variation leads to energy transition shifting, and thus \u201cwhite\u201d light emission across a broad wavelength spectrum.","Referring now to , an exemplary III-Nitride semiconductor LED  including a polarization field management template is shown diagrammatically. As is typical of conventional III-Nitride semiconductor LEDs, the exemplary semiconductor LED  includes a c-plane substrate  that is substantially planar. In this example, the substrate  is formed of a GaN material, as is known in the art, and thus functions as an n-type layer, and includes at least one n-contact (electrode)  in electrical communication therewith. By way of example, the c-plane substrate  may be formed as a 2.5 \u03bcm layer of n-type doped GaN. For example, the substrate  may be formed by a conventional MOCVD process. Alternatively, the substrate may be formed in the range of about 3 to about 5 microns in thickness, and of other materials such as AlIN or AlGaInN.","As is typical of conventional III-Nitride semiconductor LEDs, the exemplary semiconductor LED  further includes a p-contact (electrode) , though it should be noted that the p-contact of the exemplary LED  is not purely conventional but rather is consistent with the present invention in that is specially formed and\/or shaped (on at least one side) in correspondence with the polarization field management template as discussed in greater detail below; on an opposite side, the layer may be substantially planar, or non-planar. By way of example, the p-contact  may be formed as a conductive shaped layer  of p-type material, such as p-type doped GaN (pGaN) and a substantially planar layer  of p-metal formed thereon. For example, the conductive shaped layer  may be formed by a conventional MOCVD process, and the planar layer  can be deposited by electron-beam metal evaporation. The layers may be formed in the range of 200-300 nm thickness and alternatively, of other materials such as InGaN, AlInN, or AlGaInN.","In accordance with the present invention, the exemplary III-Nitride semiconductor LED  further includes a shaped layer  of n-type material, such as n-type doped GaN. The shaped layer  includes multiple cavities , each of which is hemispherical or partially-hemispherical, or substantially hemispherical (collectively \u201chemispherical\u201d) in shape. Thus, each cavity  has a valley portion , located generally horizontally with reference to  or , or in the 0-degree orientation, and a peak portion , located generally vertically with reference to  or , or in the 90-degree orientation. It will be appreciated that  shows the cavities in a two-dimensional representation for illustrative clarity, though in fact the cavities are three-dimensional in nature.","The combination of the shaped layer  and the substrate  form what is referred to herein as a polarization field management template , which has a three-dimensional patterned surface. Preferably, the surface includes cavities that are closely-packed and substantially homogeneous. Most preferably, the cavities are hemispherical.","Formed on the polarization field management template  is a semiconductor multiple quantum well (MQW) layer . The MQW layer may be formed in a generally conventional manner, using conventional techniques, materials and structures, except that the MQW is formed on the polarization field management template  in accordance with the present invention, and thus has a unique topography used to advantage in accordance with the present invention. In this example, the MQW layer  includes multiple quantum well stages, such as a MQW formed by 4-period growth. Each quantum well stage includes a quantum well confining the electrons and holes, and the quantum well is surrounded by adjacent barrier layers (such as a GaN layer) in a sandwich configuration. By way of example, each barrier layer may be formed of GaN, and each quantum well stage may be formed of one layer of InGaN (acting as an active layer) between two layers of GaN (acting as a barrier layer relative to the active layer). As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the barrier layer has a high bandgap characteristic relative to the electron and hole layers.","Accordingly, an exemplary four-period MQW  may include multiple layers as follows: GaN barrier\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN barrier. Alternatively, the MQW  may be considered to include multiple layers as follows: GaN barrier\/GAN\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN\/InGaN\/GaN\/GaN barrier. In these examples, each GaN (or GaN barrier)\/InGaN\/GaN (or GaN barrier) combination is a \u201cstage,\u201d and thus there are 4 stages, resulting from 4-period growth. For example, GaN barrier layers of 10 nm and four InGaN\/GaN stages each having a well thickness of 3.5 nm is suitable for this purpose. By way of alternative example, AlGaInN may be used as an alternative to InGaN, layers in the range of 3-10 nm may be used, and about 2 to about 6 stages may be used. Any suitable quantum well layer  may be used.","Thus, it will be appreciated that the MQW layer  substantially conforms to the patterned surface of the polarization field management template . Thus, portions of the MQW layer  are oriented at 0-degrees (see ), portions are oriented at approximately +90 degrees (see ), and portions are oriented at approximately \u221290 degrees (see ), as shown with reference to . Further, portions of the MQW layer  are oriented along the continuous curve of the cavities  from approximately \u221290 degrees to approximately +90 degrees, as shown with reference to . Further, portions of the MQW layer  are oriented along the continuous curve (from \u221290 to +90 degrees) of the cavities in three-dimensions, e.g., not only in the plane of the cross-section shown in , but also out of the plane of the cross-section shown in . This variation in the physical orientation in space of the portions of the MQW layer  causes corresponding variation in respective polarization fields formed by those portions. Collectively, these portions provide an overall variation in the polarization field for the semiconductor LED as a whole that leads to an energy transition shift, which in turn leads to emission of light across a broad range of wavelengths, spanning the red, blue, yellow and green spectra. This broadband emission in multiple spectra combines to provides a \u201cwhite\u201d light emission perceived as a \u201cwarm\u201d light that is a suitable alternative to incandescent light sources of a type often used for home, commercial, industrial and other general illumination purposes.","The exemplary semiconductor LED further includes a p-contact layer . The p-contact layer  may include a conductive shaped p-layer  covering the MQW layer and forming a substantially planar top surface for use as a mesa, and an additional substantially-planar layer . Optionally, these layers ,  may be formed in a single process step or in multiple process steps, as discussed below in greater detail. In accordance with the present invention, the p-contact  is formed on, and thus is shaped to conform to, the MQW layer , which generally conforms to the patterned surface of the polarization field management template .","An exemplary method for forming an exemplary GaN-based semiconductor LED including a polarization field management template and providing broadband light emission is described below with reference to -and . Referring now to and , the method begins with provision of a c-plane substrate  of material of a first conduction type, as shown at step . In this example, the first conduction type is n-type, but in alternative embodiments, the first conduction type could be p-type. As discussed above, the substrate  is conventional in nature and may be formed using any conventional technique. By way of example, a 2.5 \u03bcm layer of n-type doped GaN is suitable for this purpose. In accordance with the present invention, the method next involves depositing a very thin layer of crystals  on the substrate , as shown at step . Preferably, the crystals are homogeneous and are arranged in a closely-packed monolayer. The crystals  may be formed or provided in any suitable manner, and may be spherical or substantially spherical (collectively, \u201cspherical\u201d), or non-spherical. By way of example, a monolayer of substantially-uniform 1 micron-diameter SiOmicrospheres may be deposited for this purpose. Alternatively, the spheres may have a diameter in the range of 0.5 to 1 micron. By way of further example, alternative structures may be used, such as TiOinstead of SiOmicrospheres. Any suitable material may be used for this purpose provided that the material is amorphous, and thus prevents the growth of GaN having a single-crystal structure.","By way of further example, 1-micron SiOmicrospheres may be deposited by a rapid convection deposition involving providing a colloidal suspension SiOmicrospheres, providing a deposition blade above the substrate, depositing the colloidal suspension on the substrate, and sweeping the deposition blade over the substrate to distribute the SiOover the substrate. The sweeping speed may be varied to ensure proper deposition of a monolayer. For example, for a deposition blade angle of 25 degree (and for 1-micron diameter SiOsphere, the blade may be swept across the substrate at a speed of 45 \u03bcm\/s. By way of alternative example, for a monolayer deposition of 0.5 \u03bcm SiOmicrospheres and 1.0 \u03bcm SiOmicrospheres, the optimal deposition speed using a hydrophilic blade at an inclination angle of 80 degrees may be 65 \u03bcm\/s and 60 \u03bcm\/s, respectively. Suitable SiOmicrospheres can be prepared for example, by hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane, or by a sol gel process, or by spray drying a colloidal silica gel. Suitable size spheres can be in the range from 0.05 microns up to 4 microns in diameter, preferably 0.1 micron to 2 microns. Suitable SiOmicrospheres are commercially available from a variety of sources, such as Bangs Laboratories, Inc., 9025 Technology Drive, Fishers, Ind. 46038-2886 and are available in quantities with a standard size deviation of less than 1%. The SiOmicrospheres can be deposited in a suspension media such as DI-water. The SiOsuspension may be optimized for 13% volume fraction in DI-water.","This technique is advantageous in that it exploits the tendency of monosized sub-micrometer spheres to spontaneously arrange into a closely-packed two-dimensional array. Further, strong capillary forces at the solid\/air\/water interface induce crystallization of microspheres into a two-dimensional array.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"i":"b ","b":["12","30","30"]},"Next, the method involves growing a shaped layer  on the substrate , as shown at step  in , and as shown in . More specifically, this step involves adding similar conduction-type material to the substrate  in the interstices between the crystals, e.g., between the lower hemispheres of the spheres. In this manner, the spheres  act as a three-dimensional template for forming the shaped layer . By way of example, the shaped layer  may be formed by growing n-type material on the n-type substrate to a thickness up to a radius of the spheres. For example, a shaped layer of nGaN having a maximum thickness of approximately 0.24 \u03bcm is suitable for this purpose. By way of example, such a layer may be grown using a metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique and triethylgallium, which is a low growth-rate source material, at a temperature of about 730 degrees C. Alternatively, other growth methods, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), may be used to grow the shaped layer .  is a scanning electron microscopy image showing an exemplary resulting n-type shaped layer  and the spheres .","Next, as shown at step  of , the exemplary method involves removing the crystals  to reveal the shaped layer  and substrate , which collectively form the polarization field management template , as shown in . The crystals may be removed in any suitable manner. In the example involving use of SiOspheres, the spheres may be removed by etching with a hydrofluoric (HF) acid solution.  are scanning electron microscopy images showing the polarization field management template  at 0-degree and 45-degree orientations, respectively, for illustrative clarity. The exemplary polarization field management template  has a three-dimensional patterned surface  defining a plurality of closely-packed hemispherical cavities , as shown in ,  and .","The method then involves growing an MQW layer  on the polarization field management template , as shown in step  of , which corresponds to . In this example, the MQW layer  was formed by a MOCVD regrowth process. More specifically, in this example a four-period InGaN\/GaN MQW layer  was formed by depositing layers of InGaN and GaN alloys using the MOCVD process. By way of example, an InGaN\/GaN MQW layer having a 3.5 nm well thickness and a 10 nm barrier layer is suitable for this purpose. By way of alternative examples, an AlGaInN alloy may be used in forming the layers, 2 to 6 stages may be used, and alternatively the MBE process may be used to form the layers.","As shown at step  in , the method then involves growing a conduction layer  on the MQW layer . Preferably, this involves growing a conductive shaped layer  having one side conforming to and covering all or substantially all of the patterned surface of the MQW layer , and an opposite side that is substantially planar, and thus forms a mesa , as shown in . For example, this conductive shaped layer  may be formed using a p-GaN material, using the MOCVD process, and may have a thickness in the range of approximately 250 to 500 nm.","In this exemplary embodiment, the method further includes depositing n-type metal on the n-type substrate  to form an n-type contact , and depositing p-type metal on the conductive shaped layer  to form a p-type contact . For example, n-GaN and p-GaN may be used as layer  and layer , respectively.","In use, optical emission may be generated by exciting the active region of the semiconductor LED  by optically pumping or electrically injecting current into the device to produce optical emission from the MQW layer . The patterned three-dimensional MQW layer , provided in conformance with the patterned surface of the polarization field management template , causes portions of the MQW layer to be disposed in a variety of spatial orientations that cause variations in those portions' respective polarization fields. The collective effect on the polarization field results in significant red-shift in the emission wavelength. For example, the polarization field in a device including an InGaN QW with 15% Indium content enables a wavelength shift from approximately 410 nm to approximately 470 nm, due to the associated quantum confined Stark effect.","Accordingly, the continuous variation of the spatial orientation of the MQW layer  along the polarization field management template  results in continuous variation of the internal electric field within the MQW layer , which in turn results in tuning of the LED's overall emission wavelength from relatively long wavelengths (in the red range) down to relatively short wavelengths (in the blue range). The combined emission spans the blue, green, yellow and red spectral regimes, and thus provides an overall broadband \u201cwhite\u201d light emission. The change in the emission wavelength from the QW with different orientations is a result of the change in the electric field inside the QW at different orientations. This broadband emission in multiple spectrums combines to provide a \u201cwhite\u201d light emission perceived as a \u201cwarm\u201d light that is a suitable alternative to incandescent light sources of a type often used for home, commercial, industrial and other general illumination purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"]},"In sharp contrast,  is a graph of showing PL intensity as a function of wavelength for an exemplary GaN-based semiconductor LED including a polarization field management template  in accordance with the present invention. In particular, the GaN-based semiconductor LED in this example involved InGaN\/GaN QWs grown on a polarization field management template grown using MOCVD to a thickness of about 0.24 microns around 1 micron SiOspheres on a traditional 2.5 micron n-GaN c-plane substrate. This exemplary semiconductor LED includes a similar 4-period QW for comparative purposes. However, as will be noted from , the PL intensity has two peaks, around 425 nm and 600 nm, and spans a much broader wavelength band. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the semiconductor LED including a polarization field management template in accordance with the present invention provides a broadband, multi-spectra emission as compared to a comparable conventional semiconductor LED, and thus provides a warmer \u201cwhite\u201d light.","A semiconductor LED  in accordance with the present invention may be embodied in various types of optoelectronic devices including light-emitting diodes, and may find application in solid state lighting, and display applications.","While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred mode as illustrated in the drawing, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that various changes in detail may be effected therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF SUMMARY OF DRAWINGS","p":["The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the following drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["b ","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["c ","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["d ","c; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["e ","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["f ","e "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"g "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4("],"i":"b"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIGS. 7 and 8","FIG. 4"],"i":"d"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
