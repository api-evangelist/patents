abstract: A quantitative model that describes the assembly of diketopyrrolopyrrole-based donors and a perylenediimide acceptor into chiral superstructures, as a result of both hydrogen bonding and π•••π stacking. This model provides thermodynamic parameters (ΔH° and ΔS°) for all noncovalent interactions involved in the assembly and explains the subtle supramolecular cues that convert disordered aggregates into well-defined helical assemblies.

More specifically, the field of certain embodiments of invention relates to.","Small molecules that self-assemble into well-ordered hierarchical superstructures direct the most complex tasks in biology. To create synthetic structures with similar functionality, chemists have employed noncovalent interactions to organize chromophores into large, well-defined structures, including systems that utilize both hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) and \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 interactions. Examples include homoaggregates, such as oligo(p-phenylenevinylenes) (OPVs) or substituted perylenediimides (PDI), where H-bonding precedes aggregation into \u03c0-stacked helices, or heteroaggregates that assemble into superstructures via multiple noncovalent interactions, such as a system consisting of either melamine or OPVs H-bonding with PDIs. In self-assembling systems where one-dimensional aggregates form, models have been developed to obtain association constants (Ks), thermodynamic parameters (\u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0), and degrees of polymerization by attributing assembly to a single \u201cdominant\u201d noncovalent interaction. For heteroaggregation however, models that consider two or more components are rare and most simplify their description of assembly by only considering a single noncovalent interaction. This inability to model how different noncovalent recognition events work in concert to create superstructures limits the ability of scientists to create systems with the functional complexity found in natural systems.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of assembling heteroaggregates. A first component is interacted with a second component via a first noncovalent interaction to form a substructure. A plurality of substructures are assembled via a second noncovalent interaction to form a superstructure.","One embodiment of the invention relates to a method of assemblying heteroaggregates. A plurality of first components are interacted to form a disordered aggregation. A plurality of second components are interacted with the disordered aggregation. A superstructure is assembled comprising first components hetereoaggregated with second components and first components homoaggregated with first components.","One embodiment of the invention related to a self-assemblying composition. The composition comprises a plurality of diketopyrrole donors and a plurality of perylendiimide acceptors. Each of the plurality of diketopyrrole donors interacts with another of the plurality of diketopyrrole donors via \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking and noncovalently interacts with one of the plurality of perylendiimide acceptors.","Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the present disclosure may be set forth from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary of the present disclosure and the following detailed description are exemplary and intended to provide further explanation without further limiting the scope of the present disclosure claimed.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.","To develop new, quantitative models that describe how multiple noncovalent interactions bring together different components into well-defined superstructures, the aggregation of chiral and achiral diketopyrrolopyrrole-based (DPP) donors with a 1,7-substituted PDI acceptor () were studied. Upon mixing in solution, the PDI and DPPs assemble into well-ordered three dimensional superstructures () because of: (1) complementary triple H-bonds along one spatial axis (x), (2) large aromatic surfaces that drive aggregation via \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking along an orthogonal axis (z), and (3) solubilizing alkyl chains appended to each aromatic core that can interact along the third orthogonal axis (y) (). Variable temperature (VT) UV\/Vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic measurements revealed that the PDIs associate to disordered DPP aggregates, which subsequently reorganize into helical heteroaggregates of a single chirality. The resulting thermodynamic model quantifies the thermodynamic binding parameters (\u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0) associated with each interaction and elucidates the subtle supramolecular cues that induce the transition from disordered aggregates into well-defined helices.","DPP donor  and DPP donor  have diamidopyridine (DAP) groups, which can form triple H-bonds with the diimide groups of PDI acceptor  (). The donors differ only by their N-alkyl chains: DPP donor  possesses homochiral (S)-2-methylbutyl side chains, and 2 has racemic 2-ethyloctyl chains. Initially, the aggregation of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor  was analyzed by UV\/Vis spectroscopy because of the necessity to understand how the propensity to homoaggregate contributes to the formation and structure of heteroaggregates. The UV\/Vis spectra of DPP donor  in toluene has absorption maxima at 538 and 580 nm at 25\u00b0 C., which are the result of dipole allowed S-Selectronic transitions.","These bands undergo bathochromic shifts with increasing sharpness upon cooling, which are spectral signatures of J-type aggregation (). Although \u03c0-stacked chromophores with chiral side-chains often form chiral superstructures, the absorbance intensities exhibit a sigmoidal dependence with temperature and no observable signal was found in VT CD experiments. These observations indicate isodesmic stacking is occurring, where the binding constant describing the \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking is constant regardless of aggregate size. By fitting the changes in absorbance to an isodesmic model, \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 were determined to be \u22127.4\u00b10.5 kcal moland \u22123.0\u00b12.0 e.u. respectively, indicating the \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking is enthalpically driven (). DFT calculations (B3LYP\/6-31G(d,p)) on homoaggregates of a DPP that has methyl side chains to simplify the calculation revealed a slip-stacked binding geometry with thiophenes overlapping the diketopyrolopyrolle core (), which has been observed in a previously reported X-ray crystal structure of DPP-thiophene oligomers. The energy of binding (\u0394E=\u221210.5 kcal mol) from the density functional theory (DFT) calculations agrees well with the \u0394H\u00b0 derived from the fitting. Interestingly, intermolecular H-bonding between the DAP groups was observed in the calculated structure.","The ability to H-bond is known to affect the supramolecular assembly of 1,7-substituted PDIs, so the homoaggregation of PDI acceptor  was also investigated by VT UV\/Vis spectroscopy. The UV\/Vis spectra of 1,7-substituted PDIs typically display characteristic peaks arising from the S-Stransition that are broadened because of twisting in the perylene ring system that inhibits aggregation beyond \u03c0-stacked dimers. Previously studied PDIs without N-substituents display a sharp peak that is attributed to the J-aggregation of \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacked dimers interconnected by H-bonding. Alternatively, mono-N-substituted PDIs possessing complementary melamine moieties H-aggregate into helical superstructures as a result of intermolecular H-bonding. For PDI acceptor , the UV\/Vis spectra revealed a sharp absorbance maximum at 520 nm in toluene with pronounced vibronic fine structure. Upon cooling, these peaks decrease with a concomitant increase of a broad band with a maximum at 592 nm (). These spectral changes are similar to PDIs whose \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 aggregation is intermediate between J- or H-type. It is believed that the new absorption peak is attributable to a similar stacking geometry. A plot of the absorbance at 592 nm versus temperature reveals negligible aggregation above 37\u00b0 C., and below which absorption increases quickly, suggesting nucleation-growth assembly, in which an initial disfavored binding event precludes the formation of long stacks prior to the critical temperature, after which a new thermodynamically favored equilibrium arises that governs the assembly into \u03c0-stacked superstructures (). Suspecting intermolecular H-bonding plays a key role in assembly, the VT UV\/Vis experiment was repeated with a bis-N-cyclohexyl derivative of PDI acceptor  or in 3% DMSO in toluene, both of which inhibit H-bonding. No spectral changes that indicate \u03c0-stacking were observed in either control experiment, confirming that H-bonding promotes the \u03c0-stacking of PDI acceptor .","Heteroaggregate formation was investigated by VT UV\/Vis spectroscopy on a 2:1 mixture of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor , respectively, in toluene. At 40\u00b0 C., the spectrum is a linear composite of the individual spectra (), indicating that mixed \u03c0-aggregates are not present at high temperature. Upon cooling, the absorbance bands corresponding to PDI acceptor  decrease and two new bands arise at 563 and 615 nm, which are assigned to a S-Stransition from the \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking of PDI acceptor . Several aspects of the spectrum indicate heteroaggregate formation: 1) the absorbance at 615 nm begins to increase in the mixture at 21\u00b0 C., which is a much lower temperature than was observed for the onset of homoaggregates of PDI acceptor  (39\u00b0 C.), 2) the new bands at 563 and 615 nm are much sharper than the broad peaks formed by homoaggregates of PDI acceptor , suggesting J-type aggregation, meaning the \u03c0-stacked PDIs adopt a different geometry in the heteroaggregates, and 3) the change in the absorption at 615 nm for the mixture of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor  is more gradual () than for the homoaggregates of PDI acceptor , suggesting that homoaggregation pathways are suppressed and a different assembly mechanism is operating that is driven by the triple H-bonding between DPP donor  and PDI acceptor . Prior to the appearance of the PDI \u03c0-stacking bands 563 and 615 nm, the transitions previously assigned to \u03c0-stacking of DPP donor  (538 and 580 nm) increase steadily with decreasing temperature, suggesting extensive homoaggregation of DPP donor  precedes heteroaggregate formation. A bisignated Cotton effect, with peaks at 563 and 615 nm matching the \u03c0-stacking peaks of the achiral PDI, appeared in the VT CD spectra. The bisignated effect is a consequence of electronic coupling between conjugated segments in a helical array (). Notably, the transition temperature in the VT CD spectrum of the heteroaggregates is 5\u00b0 lower than in the UV\/Vis measurements, suggesting several molecules of PDI acceptor  need to be associated onto disordered aggregates of DPP donor  to induce rearrangement into chiral helices ().","The VT UV\/Vis experiments were repeated in a mixture of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor  (), and while the same trends were observed in the VT UV\/Vis spectra, no Cotton effect arose in the CD spectrum of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor . The structure of the heteroaggregate of DPP donor  and PDI acceptor  was modeled by DFT calculations using methyl and ethyl solubilizing chains on DPP and PDI, respectively. The \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 overlap between the DPPs remains almost unchanged compared to DPP homoaggregates whereas the PDI relative orientations did change compared to PDI homoaggregates, indicating that the preferred conformation of the DPPs dictates the \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking angle in the heteroaggregate superstructure. Furthermore, the assessment of PDI J-aggregation from the VT UV\/Vis spectrum of the heteroaggregate is supported by the skewed orientation of the PDIs in the calculated structure ().","The spectroscopic data were used to derive a new assembly model that describes formation of heteroaggregates that arise from both H-bonding and \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking. The corresponding thermodynamic parameters for each interaction were obtained by fitting to the changes in absorption with temperature to this model. The data indicate that PDIs bind to disordered stacks of DPPs to produce chiral superstructures (), which leaves an available H-bonding site on each PDI that can potentially be occupied by an additional DPP at higher concentrations. In the model (), disordered homoaggregates of DPP donor  assemble isodesmically according to microscopic binding constant K. Since there are four identical pathways by which this process can occur, Kis one-fourth the experimentally observed macroscopic K. The initial association event of one molecule of PDI acceptor  to a stack of DPP donor  of any size is governed by microscopic association constant K(). As there are two positions where H-bonding takes place in PDI acceptor  and n points on a stack of DPP donor , where n denotes the number of residues, the macroscopic Kis 2nK. Further association of PDI acceptor  to the stacks are described by Kand K, where Kis a dimensionless Kthat includes the energy contributions from \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking and any chelate cooperativity effects () associated with the aggregation of PDI acceptor  within the DPP donor  stacks. The resulting mass balance equations can be written as an infinite series that describes the total concentration of each species, [PDI]and [DPP], as a function of n:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","P","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},"mi":"t"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","P","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","P","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}}}},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"+","mrow":{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"nK","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}}},"mi":"i"}}]}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},"mi":"t"},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","P","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}],"mo":"\u2061"},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"msup":{"mrow":[{"mi":"n","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"4","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["D","P","P"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}}}},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"n","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"K","mn":"3"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":["P","D","I"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}]}}}}},"mi":"i"}}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}]}],"mo":"+"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}]}}}},"Equations 1 and 2 are both convergent and can be solved to obtain [PDI] and [DPP] for any value of K, K, K, [PDI], and [DPP]. \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 corresponding to Kwere fixed to the values previously obtained by studying the homoaggregation of DPP donor  and held invariant. By generating K values from the van't Hoff equation, the concentration of all species at each temperature can be obtained by fitting the experimental VT data. When both VT UV\/Vis and CD measurements were simultaneously fit to the same parameter set, the \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 for K(\u221224.1\u00b10.1 kcal moland \u221270\u00b12 e.u.) and K(\u221213.5\u00b10.1 kcal moland \u221240\u00b11 e.u.) were obtained. These values indicate Kis enthalpically driven, which is typical for H-bonded dimers. Interestingly, Kis also enthalpically driven, but an entropic penalty is associated with the rearrangement of PDI acceptor  into J-aggregates, presumably because the contorted perylene rings disfavor this stacking geometry. Nevertheless, the enthalpy associated with \u03c0-aggregation overcomes the disfavorable entropy below room temperature, which drives heterosuperstructure formation upon cooling.","In one embodiment, the self-assembly of heteroaggregates comprised of \u03b1-conjugated donors and acceptors provides synthetic hierarchical structures with functional complexity comparable to their biological counterparts, but models are needed that can describe the complex milieu of interactions involved in superstructure formation. By studying the heteroaggregation of a DPP donor and PDI acceptor a new model was elucidates the subtle structural cues that induce the transition from a disordered aggregate into a chiral helix. Using this new model, all thermodynamic parameters could be quantitatively determined, and both H-bonding and the subsequent helix formation process were found to be enthalpically favored but entropically disfavored. This new model could be used to create ordered superstructures of donors and acceptors, which are increasingly investigated in the context of photovoltaics and for understanding fundamental aspects of charge and energy transport in self-assembled systems.","1.

Since strong homoaggregation of PDI acceptor  occurs without a resulting signal in the CD spectra, the model presumes the DPP donor  molecules are present in a broad distribution of chain lengths as a result of isodesmic stacking as dictated by a macroscopic K(4K) determined previously. The binding of PDI Acceptor  to each of these stacks can be described by two Ks, Kand K. The former describes the strength of association of one 3 molecule to a DPP donor  stack of any length that does not already contain PDI acceptor . As there are two points by which H-bonding takes place in PDI acceptor  and n points on a stack of DPP donor  (where n denotes the number of residues), the macroscopic Kdescribing this event is 2nK.Kdescribes binding strength of additional PDI acceptor  molecules to DPP donor  stacks already containing PDI acceptor  molecules and includes 1) the additional binding energy yielded as a result of \u03c0\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 stacking between two PDI moieties and 2) the benefit of chelate cooperativity.
