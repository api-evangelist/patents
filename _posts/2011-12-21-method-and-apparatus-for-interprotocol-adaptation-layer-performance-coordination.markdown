{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS","DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Service providers and device manufacturers are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by, for example, providing compelling network services. One area of interest involves system performance and power management optimization in 60 GHz communication systems. According to current 60 GHz communication standards such as the Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig), protocol adaptation layers (PAL) serve as processing agents that are designed to optimize the performance for specific applications such as audio and video, USB data and PCIe bus traffics etc. in a 60 GHz communication system. The PALs are layers that are on top of media access control (MAC) and physical (PHY) layers in a network device. Existing PAL protocols do not communicate with one another. The lack of communication and coordination across PALs may result in uncoordinated actions among different applications. The uncoordinated actions may accordingly lead to un-optimized performance of the device.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for optimizing system performance and\/or power management by coordinating protocol adaptation layer performance.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises causing, at least in part, a schedule request message to be sent from a first PAL to a second PAL. The method also comprises causing, at least in part, a schedule response message to be sent from the second PAL to the first PAL. The method further comprises processing the schedule response message to cause, at least in part, a negotiated coordinated schedule between the first PAL and the second PAL.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more computer programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to cause, at least in part, a schedule request message to be sent from a first PAL to a second PAL. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a schedule response message to be sent from the second PAL to the first PAL. The apparatus is further caused to process the schedule response message to cause, at least in part, a negotiated coordinated schedule between the first PAL and the second PAL.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to cause, at least in part, a schedule request message to be sent from a first PAL to a second PAL. The apparatus is also caused to cause, at least in part, a schedule response message to be sent from the second PAL to the first PAL. The apparatus is further caused to process the schedule response message to cause, at least in part, a negotiated coordinated schedule between the first PAL and the second PAL.","Exemplary embodiments are described herein. It is envisioned, however, that any system that incorporates features of any apparatus, method and\/or system described herein are encompassed by the scope and spirit of the exemplary embodiments.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for optimizing system performance and\/or power management by coordinating protocol adaptation layer performance are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the discussed embodiments. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"The Wireless Gigabit Alliance (WiGig) version 1.0 specification, published July 2010, and beyond allows devices to communicate without wires at multi-gigabit speeds. For example, the WiGig specification supports data transmission rates up to 7 Gbps which is more than 10 times faster than the highest conventional 802.11n rate. The WiGig specification supplements and extends the 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) layer and is backward compatible with the IEEE 802.11 standard, published Jun. 12, 2007, and beyond. WiGig tri-band enabled devices, for example, which operate in the 2.4, 5 and 60 GHz bands, are capable of delivering data transfer rates up to 7 Gbit\/s.","A physical layer (PHY) in the WiGig specification enables both low power and high performance WiGig devices, and guarantees interoperability and communication at gigabit rates. The WiGig specification enables high performance wireless data, display and audio applications that supplement the capabilities of today's wireless LAN devices.","Protocol adaptation layers (PAL) are being developed to support specific system interfaces including data buses for PC peripherals and display interfaces for HDTVs, monitors and projectors. For example, in addition to the MAC layer in a WiGig 60 GHz system, multiple adaptation layers exist in order to support different type of applications which may include any combination of:","Audio\/video for wireless display through the WiGig Display Extension (WDE);","Uniform Serial Bus (USB) traffic through the WiGig Serial Extension (WSE);","Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) traffic through the WiGig Bus Extension (WBE);","Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) traffic through the WiGig SD\/SDIO Extension (SDIO PAL); and","Other traffic types that WiGig may define in the future.","It should be noted that while this disclosure discusses the WiGig specification and WiGig 60 GHz systems as an example, the various embodiments of this disclosure may also be applicable to any underlying radio system involving multiple PALs. Accordingly, the methods, apparatuses and systems discussed should not be limited to WiGig 60 GHz systems.","Each PAL may include various features to optimize the transmission for particular respective traffic based on application characteristics. In conventional systems, PALs do not communicate with one another. The lack of communication and coordination across PALs may lead to un-optimized performance.","For example, consider WSE (USB PAL) and WDE (A\/V PAL) and use power consumption as a performance metric. In general, WDE and WSE traffic are independent and it is likely that the MAC\/PHY will have to be in a wakeup state when either there is WSE traffic or WDE traffic in a MAC queue. Such independent performance can lead to frequent transitions between wakeup and sleep states, which leads to increased power consumption, and un-optimized system performance.","Accordingly, there is a need to optimize system performance and\/or power management by coordinating protocol adaptation layer performance. For instance, with regard to the example discussed above, it may be desirable for the WDE and WSE modules to have an intelligent coordination and operation such that the MAC can sleep longer and the frequency of transitions between wakeup and sleep states is minimized, which in turn may lead to reduced power consumption.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to optimize system performance and\/or power management by coordinating protocol adaptation layer performance.","According to various embodiments, the system  may cause any number of PALs to communicate with one another to coordinate an optimal performance schedule to maximize various performance metrics such as, but not limited to, power consumption, as discussed above.","Considering the above example referring to WSE (USB PAL) and WDE (A\/V PAL) communication using power consumption as a performance metric, the traffic specification (e.g., similar to the TSPEC in IEEE 802.11) of WDE and WSE may be communicated to one another. Each PAL can take other PAL information into account during its operation. For example, WDE can change parameters of its traffic flows, including burst size and inter-interval time, such that they have similar characteristics as that of WSE traffic. This way, both WSE and WDE will have traffic with approximately the same pattern, which will enable the MAC to schedule these traffics into one or multiple adjacent service periods and sleep longer during other times.","The communication and coordination between PALs can be in the form of different messages such as:","Information request: in this message, a PAL (requestor) requests another PAL (responder) to align its traffic schedule with its own schedule. The message may include the schedule (e.g., similar to the TSPEC in IEEE 802.11) of the first PAL to the second PAL.","Information response: in this message, the responder responds to the requestor confirming the alignment, or rejecting the alignment, or proposing an alternative alignment. The Information Response message may also include the schedule of the second PAL.","The system  may also enable multiple information request and information response exchanges between a pair of PALs, or a plurality of PALs if the MAC is attempting to optimize the performance of many PALs together, until either an agreement is reached or the process is stopped.","The communication and coordination between PALs may take place in an initiation stage (e.g., upon initiation of a new traffic flow), may be triggered periodically, or may be trigger based on certain events. For example, if the platform power has reduced to a threshold, then the communication between PALs can be triggered and each PAL can take actions accordingly to minimize the overall power. Other events may include, for example, traffic burst detection, or a change in operating state such as sleep mode, wake mode, power save mode, reduction in process speed, etc.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  having connectivity to a PAL management platform  which may be onboard the UE  or connected via a communication network . The UE  may also comprise a wireless application programming interface (API)  that may be a mean for the UE  to communicate with other devices over the WiGig 60 GHz standard as discussed above, or any other radio standard, by way of the communication network , for example.","By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a wired data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), WiGig, wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE , other UE 's, and PAL management platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["103","103","103","201","203","205","207","209"],"i":"n. "},"As discussed above, each PAL may include various features to optimize the transmission for particular respective traffic based on application characteristics. For instance, PALs may include audio\/video for wireless display through the WDE, USB traffic through the WSE, PCIe traffic through the WBE, SDIO traffic through the SDIO PAL, or other traffic types that WiGig may define in the future.","Considering again the example discussed above using WSE (USB PAL) and WDE (A\/V PAL) and using power consumption as a performance metric, the PAL management platform  enables the WDE and WSE modules to have an intelligent performance schedule coordination and operation such that the MAC can sleep longer to reduce the frequency of transitions between wakeup and sleep states, which in turn may lead to reduced power consumption.","The control logic , or the requesting PAL module , may determine that there is a need to cause the WSE to coordinate its traffic schedule with the WDE. Accordingly, in this example, the WSE may be represented by the requesting PAL module  and the WDE may be represented by the responsive PAL module . In other embodiments, the requesting PAL module , responsive PAL module , and other PAL modules may be representative of any combination of the example PALs discussed above. For simplicity, the following discussion will be directed to communications between the requesting PAL module  and the responsive PAL module , but various embodiments may enable any number of PAL modules including, for example, other PAL modules ","The control logic  instructs the requesting PAL module  to send a schedule request message to the responsive PAL module . Alternatively, the requesting PAL module  may initiate the schedule request message on its own. The traffic specification of the requesting PAL module  and the responsive PAL module  may be communicated to one another. Each PAL module can take other PAL module information into account during its operation. For example, requesting PAL module  can change parameters of its traffic flows, including burst size and inter-interval time, such that they have similar characteristics as that of responsive PAL module  traffic. This way, both requesting PAL module  and responsive PAL module  will have traffic with approximately the same pattern, which will enable the control logic  to instruct the scheduling module  to schedule these traffics into one or multiple adjacent service periods and enable longer sleep periods during other times. Alternatively, the PAL modules may implement a coordinated schedule without going through the scheduling module .","In one or more embodiments, the requesting PAL module  may send a request message to the responsive PAL module  to align its traffic schedule with its own schedule. The responsive PAL module  may send a response message to the requesting PAL module  and\/or the scheduling module . In this message, the responsive PAL module  may respond to the requesting PAL module  confirming the alignment, or rejecting the alignment, or proposing an alternative alignment of each PAL's respective performance schedules. The response message may also include the schedule of the responsive PAL module .","The control logic , in the event of a rejection, conflict or alternative suggested schedule may cause a negotiation session to occur between the requesting PAL module  and the responsive PAL module , or the control logic  may instruct the scheduling module  to conduct the negotiation session to determine the optimum schedule for the various PALs to align their respective traffic and performance. Request and response exchanges between any pair of PAL modules, or a plurality of PAL modules, may continue in the negotiation session until either an agreement is reached or the process is stopped. Alternatively, the negotiation session may also be conducted through direct communication between the requesting PAL module  and the responsive PAL module  without the scheduling module  as a mediator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","301","303","305","307","309","103"],"i":"n "},"To optimize system performance, the WiGig MAC  may enable the PAL's to communicate with one another to negotiate and align their performance schedules on their own, or in coordination with the MAC . The MAC  conventionally has to be in a wakeup state along with the WiGig PHY  for any PAL traffic to occur. Accordingly, to conserve power, and to optimize system performance, the MAC  may instruct the PAL's to align their performance schedules to minimize wake time transitions for both the MAC  and PHY , along with any other PAL's that may randomly be performing functions on their own independent schedules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["103","400","401","103","303","301"]},"Then, in step , the PAL management platform  causes, at least in part, a schedule response message to be sent from the second PAL to the first PAL. For example, the WDE  to the WSE . According to various embodiments, the schedule request message may be sent for any reason, such as at a predetermined time interval, or based, at least in part, on a determined trigger comprising one or more of a detected change of traffic flow, power condition, or operating state, for example.","The process continues to step  in which the first PAL processes the response message which may include and acceptance of a coordinated schedule based on the schedule of the first PAL, the schedule of the second PAL, a suggested coordinated schedule, or a rejection of the request to coordinate schedules. Next, in step , the first PAL determines to accept schedule in the response message, if not rejected, to cause, at least in part, an acceptance of the suggested coordinated schedule. If the coordinated schedule indicated in the response message is accepted, the process skips to step  in which a negotiated coordinated schedule between the first PAL and the second PAL is based on the accepted coordinated schedule which may be an affirmation of the request, or an alternative suggestion from the second PAL.","Alternatively, if the schedule suggested in the response message is not accepted, then the process continues to step  in which the first PAL determines to send another schedule request message from the first PAL to the second PAL in response to the suggested coordinated schedule which may be based on the second PAL's schedule or an alternative to initiate a negotiation session between the first PAL and the second PAL. The negotiation session may cause another schedule response message to be sent from the second PAL to the first PAL having another suggested coordinated schedule. In one or more embodiments, the negotiation session may be handled by the PAL management platform  in the scheduling module  in a case where a plurality of PAL schedules are being optimized, or the negotiation session should be mediated, for example.","Upon completion of the negotiation session, so long as an agreement is reached, the process continues to step  in which the negotiated coordinated schedule is set based, at least in part, on an outcome of the negotiation session.","The processes described herein for optimizing system performance and\/or power management by coordinating protocol adaptation layer performance may be advantageously implemented via software, hardware, firmware or a combination of software and\/or firmware and\/or hardware.
