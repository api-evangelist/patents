title: Location-based payer charging system
abstract: A method for charging a payer includes detecting a payer device, which is associated with a payer account, entering an event area. The payer device is then associated with an event invoice in a database. When the payer device is determined to have been involved in at least one payer charging event while being located in the event area, a charge is associated with the event invoice in the database for each payer charging event the payer device has been involved in. When the payer device is detected leaving the event area, a payment is charged to the payer account for the event invoice.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to online and\/or mobile payments and more particularly to a location-based payer charging system.","2. Related Art","More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as, for example, the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on-line merchant or retailer and the consumer, and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an online or mobile payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal, Inc. of San Jose, Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why online and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.","One limitation to online or mobile purchasing involves a payer attending an event such as, for example, an amusement park, a fair, carnival, a music festival, a sightseeing area, and\/or a variety of other events known in the art. Conventionally, the use of online or mobile payments with regard to events is limited to buying a ticket for the event online or with a mobile device prior to the event and then providing that ticket at the event in order to enter the event. Such conventional uses fail to take advantage of the benefits provided by mobile devices that could allow a wide variety of different event charging schemes. Furthermore, event providers may wish to charge the payer based on the areas of the event visited and\/or activities participated in during the event. Such charges typically must be paid for using cash, as the conventional methods of using of a mobile device to repeatedly make payments within the event is undesirable for both the event provider and the payer.","Thus, there is a need for an improved payer charging system.","According to one embodiment, a method for charging a payer includes detecting a payer device entering an event area and, in response, associating the payer device with an event invoice. Each time it is determined that the payer device is involved in a payer charging event while located in the event area, a charge is associated with the event invoice. When the payer device is detected leaving the event area, the event invoice is charged to a payer account that is associated with the payer device.","As a result, a payee may create an event area that allows payers to be charged based on their presence in the event area through the detection of the location of their payer devices. For example, the payer may be charged based on an amount of time located in the event area, based on their location in specific pay areas within the event area, and\/or according to a variety of other location based charging schemes. Electronic tickets may be provided to the payer device to allow entry to the event area or pay areas within the event area.","These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.","Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures, wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.","The present disclosure provides a system and method for charging a payer based on the location of the payer at an event such as, for example, a fair, a carnival, an amusement park, a music festival, a sight seeing area (e.g., a national park), a sporting event, and\/or a variety of other events known in the art. The payer includes a payer device that is associated with a payer account. The payer account may be provided by a payee\/event provider that is providing the event, an account provider (e.g., a credit account provider, a checking account provider, a savings account provider, and\/or a variety of other account providers known in the art), and\/or a payment service provider that provides payment services for the event (e.g., PayPal Inc. of San Jose, Calif.) by, for example, providing a payer account for the payer, a payee account for the payee, and\/or transferring payments from a payer account (e.g., provided by the account provider) to a payee account (e.g., provided by the account provider). A payer device detection system is operable to detect payer devices entering or attempting to enter and leaving or attempting to leave the area of the event. Upon detecting a payer device entering the event, the payer device is associated with an event invoice, and when the payer device is involved in a payer charging event while being located in the event area, a charge is associated with the event invoice. Upon detecting the payer device leaving or attempting to leave the event area, the payer account is charged for the event invoice.","Referring now to , , and , a method  for charging a payer is illustrated. The method  begins at block  where a payer device is detected entering or attempting to enter an event area. illustrates an embodiment of a location based payer charging system  that may include an event area that is bounded by a perimeter , a networking system , and\/or a plurality of event area entrances  and exits . In an embodiment, the payee\/event provider may define the event area using a plurality of positioning coordinates. For example, illustrates how the event area may be defined by the perimeter  that includes a plurality of Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates on a map. One of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of different sized and shaped boundaries (e.g., the oval shaped boundary provided by the perimeter  of the event area in the illustrated embodiment) may be created to define one or more event areas while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure. In an embodiment, the location based payer charging system  may be operated by the payee\/event provider, the payment service provider, a location based payer charging system provider, and\/or a variety of other entities known in the art. Thus, in an embodiment, the payee\/event provider may provide the positioning coordinates for the event area to the entity operating the location based payer charging system .","The event area may be provided for an event that requires a payer to pay in order to enter any portion of the event area. In one embodiment, the perimeter  of the event area may coincide or be positioned adjacent to fencing or other obstructions that are used to prevent entrance to the event area, while the event area entrances  may provide the only entrances to the event area and the event area exits  may provide the only exits from the event area . Thus, GPS coordinates may be provided to coincide with the event area entrances  and the event area exits  such that they are operable to be used to detect payer devices entering the event area through the event area entrances  and leaving the event area through the event area exits . Alternatively or in combination, GPS coordinates may also be provided to coincide with the event area such that they are operable to be used to detect payer devices located anywhere near or within the perimeter  of the event area.","In another embodiment, event area entrances and exits may coincide with each other. In such a case, the system may be determine an entry when a payer device first detected near an entrance\/exit and an exit may be determined when the payer device is next detected near an entrance\/exit. Alternatively, entry may be determined when the payer device is detected within the perimeter  and exit may be determined when the payer device is detected outside the perimeter .","In another embodiment, the event area may be provided for an event that does not require a payer to pay in order to enter the event area, or instead asks for voluntary donations to enter the event area. As such, the perimeter  of the event area may be unobstructed, and GPS coordinates may be provided to define the perimeter  such that they are operable to be used to detect payer devices entering and exiting the event area across any portion of the perimeter . Alternatively, GPS coordinates may also be provided to coincide with the event area such that they are operable to be used to detect payer devices located anywhere near or within the perimeter  of the event area.","In an embodiment, the networking system  may include one or more devices to provide a network that covers the event area and, in one embodiment, a limited area that extends outside the perimeter  of the event area. For example, the networking system  may provide a network such as, for example, a Local Area Network (LAN), that extends throughout the event area and approximately 5-10 feet beyond the perimeter  of the event area.","At block , a payer including a payer device approaches the perimeter  of the event area  and is detected by the location based payer charging system  as entering or attempting to enter the event area. In an embodiment, the payer device may include an application that allows the payer device to be used in the location based payer charging system . For example, the user of the payer device may have added the application to the payer device to attend the event and be charged using the location based payer charging system . In such an embodiment, the application may be updated with the GPS coordinates provided by the payee\/event provider to define the event area, and the application monitors the location of the payer device (e.g., using a GPS device in the payer device) to determine whether the payer device is within a predetermined distance of the event area. Once within the predetermined distance of the event area, the application communicates with the location based payer charging system  (e.g., over a network such as the Internet) such that the payer device is detected as entering or attempting to enter the event area by the location based charging system .","In another embodiment, the payer device may detect the LAN provided by the networking system  and be prompted to connect to the LAN such that the payer device is detected by the location based payer charging system  as entering or attempting to enter the event area. Connection of the payer device to the LAN may cause the location based payer charging system  to cause the payer device to connect to the location based payer charging system  through another communications link such as, for example, a cellular communications link that provides an Internet connection. While a few examples of systems and methods to detect the payer device have been provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that these should not be viewed as limiting, and a variety of other systems and methods to detect that the payer device is entering or attempting to enter the event area will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","Referring now to , , , , and , the method  proceeds to block  where the payer device is associated with an event invoice. In response to detecting the payer device entering or attempting to enter the event area at block  of the method , the location based payer charging system  communicatively connects to the payer device through a network such as, for example, the Internet, the LAN provided by the networking system , and\/or a variety of other networks known in the art. , , and illustrate an embodiment of a payer device  that is communicatively connected to the location based payer system . The payer device  includes a display . In response to detecting the payer device  in block  of the method , the location based payer charging system  sends a location based charge notification  to the payer device . In the illustrated embodiment, the location based charge notification  includes a map  having a graphical representation of the perimeter of the event area and a payer indicator that indicates where on the map  the payer device  has been detected.","The charge notification  also includes an information section  that informs the user of the payer device  that the payer device  has been detected. In the illustrated embodiment, the information section  includes an account number that is associated with a payer account. In an embodiment, the user of the payer device  may have already signed into the payer account the payee, with a payment service provider, or an account provider, and the account number may be retrieved using a cookie stored in the payer device  that associates the payer account with the payer device . In another embodiment, the user of the payer device  may have been required to sign into the payer account (e.g., when starting the application used to allow the payer device to be detected by the location based payer charging system , when connecting to the LAN provided by the networking system , etc.) such that the account number is available for display on the location based charge notification . In another embodiment, the account number may be partially obscured or even omitted from the charge notification .","The charge notification  also includes a plurality of pricing indicators  and . The pricing indicator  indicates that the cost of the event is $5.00\/hour, while the pricing indicator  indicates that the cost of the event is $25.00 total for more than 5 hours. The illustrated pricing indicators  and  are directed to a time based pricing scheme. However, one of skill in the art will recognize that such time based pricing may be appropriate for some events and not for others. As such, a variety of pricing schemes are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure, such as, for example, a one time entry fee, a pay-as-you-go scheme, and\/or a variety of other pricing schemes known in the art. The charge notification  also includes an entering confirmation button  and an entering denial button . The user of the payer device  may select the entering denial button  on the charge notification  to disconnect from the location based payer charging system .","In response to the user of the payer device  selecting the entering confirmation button  on the charge notification , the location based payer charging system  associates the payer device  (and the payer account that is associated with the payer device ) with an event invoice in a database. The location based payer charging system  may also send a ticket purchasing screen , illustrated in , to the payer device  that includes a ticket quantity section  having a ticket quantity input box and a submit button . The user of the payer device  may provide a number of tickets they would like to purchase in the ticket quantity box and select the submit button  in order to purchase a desired number of tickets. In response to selecting the submit button , the location based payer charging system  associates the number of tickets purchased (along with the ticket price) with the event invoice in the database and sends an electronic ticket , illustrated in , that includes a barcode or two-dimensional code, such as a Quick Response (QR) code , and a ticket quantity indicator . While a specific electronic ticket  has been described, one of skill in the art will recognize that the electronic ticket provided by the location based payer charge system  in the illustrated embodiment is provided merely as a example, and electronic tickets that do not include QR codes and\/or ticket quantity indicators will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In an embodiment, the electronic ticket  may be used by the user of the payer device  to enter the event area. For example, the user of the payer device  may provide the electronic ticket  for entry through one of the event area entrances  (e.g., by providing the QR code to a QR code reader operated by the event provider staff). The electronic ticket  may also be periodically requested in the event area to confirm that the user of the payer device  is being charged for attending the event. In another embodiment, the electronic ticket  may not be used to gain entry to the event area, but rather may simply provide the payer device  with a receipt that confirms the purchase of a ticket to the event.","The method  then proceeds to block  where it is determined that the payer device  has been involved in a payer charging event, and a charge is associated with the event invoice that is associated with that payer device . For example, in the illustrated embodiment, discussed above, once the payer device  enters the event area, the location based charging system  may begin tracking the amount of time the payer device  has been located in the event area. As discussed above with regard to the illustrated embodiment, any time spent in the event area may be considered a payer charging event, as the event charges the payer based on the amount of time spent in the event area, and thus the event invoice associated with the payer device  will be associated with a charge for any amount of time spent in the event area.","The method  then proceeds to block  where the payer device is detected leaving or attempting to leave the event area and the payment account associated with the payer device is charged for the event invoice. As the payer device  approaches the perimeter  of the event area , the payer device  is detected by the location based payer charging system  as leaving or attempting to leave the event area. In an embodiment, as discussed above, the payer device  may include an application that allows the payer device  to be used in the location based payer charging system . In such an embodiment, the application has access to the GPS coordinates provided by the payee\/event provider to define the event area, and the application monitors the location of the payer device  (e.g., using a GPS device in the payer device ) to determine whether the payer device  is within a predetermined distance of the perimeter of the event area. Once within the predetermined distance of the event area, the application communicates with the location based payer charging system  such that the payer device  is detected as leaving or attempting to leave the event area by the location based charging system . In another embodiment, the payer device  may be connected to the location based payer charging system  through the LAN and\/or a cellular communications link that allows the location based payer charging system  to monitor the location of the payer device  to determine that payer device  is leaving or attempting to leave the event area. While a few examples of systems and methods to detect the payer device have been provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that these should not be viewed as limiting, and a variety of other systems and methods to detect that the payer device is leaving or attempting to leave the event area will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In response to detecting the payer device  leaving or attempting to leave the event area at block  of the method , the location based payer charging system  sends a payment notification , as illustrated in , to the payer device . In the illustrated embodiment, the payment notification  includes the map  that includes the graphical representation of the perimeter of the event area and the payer indicator that indicates where on the map  the payer device  has been detected. The payment notification  also includes an event invoice area  that may include an account number of the payer account that the event invoice will be charged to, a total amount of the event invoice that will be charged to the payer account, a leaving event confirmation button , and a leaving event decline button . The user of the payer device  may select the leaving event decline button  if, for example, the payer device  was mistakenly brought too close to the perimeter  of the event area. The user of the payer device  may select the leaving event confirmation button  to confirm that the user of the payer device  is leaving the event area and that the payment for the total amount of the event invoice should be charged to the payer account associated with the payer device . The location based charging system  will charge the payer account for the event invoice. In an embodiment, charging the payer account for the event invoice may include the payee\/event provider or other operator of the location based payer charging system  sending a request to the account provider or the payment service provider to charge the account. Alternatively, the user of the payer device  may simply leave the event area and, in response, the location based payer charging system  will detect that the payer device  is no longer in the event area and charge the payer account for the event invoice.","Referring now to , , , and , an alternative embodiment of a payer charging event that the payer device  may be involved in at block  of the method  is illustrated. The payer charging event may occur in a location based payer charging system  that is substantially similar to the location based payer charging system  discussed above, but with the provision of a plurality of pay areas  within the event area, as illustrated in . In an embodiment, the payee\/event provider may define the pay areas  using a plurality of positioning coordinates in a manner similar to that used to define the event area (e.g., defining a perimeter, defining the area itself, defining entrances and exits to the pay areas, etc.). For example, illustrates how the pay areas  may be defined using a plurality of Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates on a map. One of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of different sized and shaped boundaries (e.g., the circular shaped boundary provided by the perimeter of the pay areas  in the illustrated embodiment) may be created to define one or more pay areas  while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.","At block  of the method , the payer including the payer device  approaches the perimeter of one of the pay areas  and is detected by the location based payer charging system  as entering or attempting to enter that pay area . As discussed above, the payer device  may include an application that allows the payer device  to be used in the location based payer charging system . In such an embodiment, the application is updated with the GPS coordinates provided by the payee\/event provider to define the pay areas , and the application monitors the location of the payer device  (e.g., using a GPS device in the payer device ) to determine whether the payer device  is within a predetermined distance of one of the pay areas . Once within the predetermined distance of one of the pay areas , the application communicates with the location based payer charging system  such that the payer device  is detected as entering or attempting to enter that pay area  by the location based charging system . In another embodiment, the payer device  may have detected the LAN provided by the networking system  when entering the event area such that the payer device  is connected to the LAN or another communications link such as, for example, a cellular communications link that is used to communicate with the payer device to determine the location of the payer device . While a few examples of systems and methods to detect the payer device  have been provided, one of skill in the art will recognize that these should not be viewed as limiting, and a variety of other systems and methods to detect that the payer device is entering or attempting to enter a pay area  will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In response to detecting the payer device  entering or attempting to enter the pay area  in block  of the method , the location based payer charging system  sends a location based charge notification  to the payer device , as illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment, the location based charge notification  includes a map  that includes a graphical representation of the event area , each of the pay areas within the event area, and a payer indicator that indicates where on the map  the payer device  has been detected.","The charge notification  also includes an information section  that informs the user of the payer device  that the payer device  has been detected as entering or attempting to enter the pay area . In the illustrated embodiment, the information section  includes a pricing indicator  that includes an amount that will be added to the event invoice associated with the payer device  and payer account if the user of the payer device chooses to enter the pay area . The pricing indicator  indicates that the cost of the pay area is $5.00. The illustrated pricing indicator  is directed to a flat fee pricing scheme for a particular location in the event area. However, one of skill in the art will recognize that flat fee pricing may be appropriate for some pay areas or event areas and not for others. As such, a variety of pricing schemes are envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure. The charge notification  also includes an entering confirmation button  and an entering denial button . The user of the payer device  may select the entering denial button  on the charge notification  to inform the location based payer charging system  that the payer does not wish to enter or be charged for the pay area .","In response to the user of the payer device  selecting the entering confirmation button  on the charge notification , the location based payer charging system  may send a ticket purchasing screen , illustrated in , to the payer device  that includes a ticket quantity section  having a ticket quantity input box and a submit button . The user of the payer device  may provide a number of tickets they would like to purchase to enter the pay area  in the ticket quantity box and select the submit button  in order to purchase those tickets. In response to selecting the submit button , the location based payer charging system  adds a charge for the number of tickets purchased to the event invoice that is associated with the payer device  and payer account, and sends an electronic ticket , illustrated in , to the payer device  that includes an image  and a ticket quantity indicator  (e.g., the charge added to the event invoice in the illustrated embodiment would be $20.00 for 4 tickets purchased at $5.00 per ticket). While a specific electronic ticket  has been described, one of skill in the art will recognize that the electronic ticket provided by the location based payer charge system  is provided merely as a example, and electronic tickets that do not include images and\/or ticket quantity indicators will fall within the scope of the present disclosure.","In an embodiment, the electronic ticket  may be used by the user of the payer device  to enter the pay area . For example, the location based payer charging system  may send the image  to a display device in the pay area  that the user of the payer device is attempting to enter, and the user of the payer device  may provide the electronic ticket  displayed on the payer device  to enter the pay area . A pay area operator in the pay area  may then check the image  on the payer device  to determine whether it matches the image on the display device in the pay area . The image  provided to each of the payer device  and to the display device in the pay area  may be periodically changed by the location based payer charging system  for security purposes. In another embodiment, the electronic ticket  may not be used to gain entry to the pay area , but rather may simply provide the payer device  with a receipt that confirms the purchase of a ticket to the pay area .","Referring now to and , the location based charging system  and\/or  may allow the payer device  to associate other devices with the event invoice. For example, at block  of the method , the location based payer charging system  may provide the payer device  with a device association screen  that includes a device association section  and a secondary device designation section , as illustrated in . The device association section  includes instructions to provide device identifications for devices to associate with the event invoice, along with a plurality of associated device input boxes and . The secondary device designation section  includes instructions to provide a device identification for a secondary device to associate with the event invoice in the event the payer device  leaves the event area, along with a secondary device input box . As illustrated in , the user of the payer device  may associate a plurality of associated device , , and with the event invoice by providing device identifications for each of the associated device , , and in the associated device input boxes and . The user of the payer device  may also associate a secondary device  with the event invoice by providing a device identification in the secondary device input box . In an embodiment, device identifications for the associated devices and secondary device may include phone numbers for the devices, email addresses associated with the devices, usernames associated with the devices (and, for example, an application on each of the devices used to detect and\/or track that device in the event area), and\/or a variety of other device identifications known in the art.","One of skill in the art will recognize that the association of associated devices and a secondary device with the event invoice provides a variety of benefits. For example, a family may include a parent with the payer device , another parent with the secondary device , and children with the associated devices , , and . Once each of the devices has been associated with the event invoice, the parents and children may split up within the event area, leave the event area at different times, enter different pay areas, etc. In one example, the parent with the primary device  may take one of the children with the associated device to a particular pay area in the event area, while the parent with the secondary device  may go to a location in the event area alone, and the two children with the associated devices and may go to particular pay areas in the event area. All payer charging events detected by the payer device , the secondary device , and the associated devices , , and will result in charges added to the single event invoice that is associated with the payer device . Furthermore, in the event the primary device  leaves the event area, the event invoice will then be associated with the secondary device  such that, for example, the associated device , , and may still add charges to the event invoice after the payer device  has left the event area.","Referring now to , while in the event area, the location based payer charging system  may send the payer device  an event invoice warning  that includes a spending warning section  having an current event invoice amount , along with an allow further charges button  and a disable further charges button . In an embodiment, the user of the payer device  may set a spending limit that is associated with the event invoice, and the location based payer charging system  will send the event invoice warning  in response to detecting that spending limit being reached. In response to receiving the event invoice warning , the user of the payer device  may select the allow further charges button  to allow further charges to be added to the event invoice, or select the disable further charges button  to prevent further charges from being added to the event invoice. If the event invoice is being charged based on an amount of time the payer device  is located in the event area, the payer device  may be sent a message to leave the event area in order to prevent further charges to the event invoice. In an embodiment, the location based notification  provides benefits when the event invoice is associated with associated devices and\/or a secondary device (as discussed above with reference to and ), as charges added to the event invoice by the associated devices and\/or a secondary device may be monitored or capped by the user of the payer device . In an embodiment, the event invoice warning  may include a listing of the different charges including the details of each charge (e.g., the name and\/or cost of a pay area entered.)","Thus, a location based payer charging system has been described that allows a payer device to be charged based on the location of the payer device within an event area and\/or pay areas within the event area. Through the association of the an event invoice with the payer device, associated devices, and\/or secondary devices, charges may be added to the event invoice as the devices enter and leave the event area or pay areas within the event area, providing a simple and easy method for charging one or more persons in the event area.","The location based payer charging systems discussed above provide substantial benefits to charging payers for a variety of events. For example, the location based payer charging system including the plurality of pay areas within the event area provide for charging a payer for specific areas of the event, which may be useful for rides or shows at a fair, carnival, or amusement park, acts or shows at a music festival, and\/or monuments or sights (e.g., a waterfall) at a national park. The time-based pricing scheme discussed above with reference to the location based payer charging system  may be useful for charging payers for time spent at a fair, carnival, amusement park, music festival, a national park, or sporting event. While a number of events have been provided as examples, one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other events will see substantial benefits to incorporating the location based payer charging system. Furthermore, the location based payer charging system may provide additional benefit due to its knowledge of the payer device location and its communicative connection to the payer device. For example, the location based payer charging system may detect that the payer device is located in a particular area of the event area and, in response, provide the payer device with information (e.g., text, images, web links, etc.) about that area (e.g., information about a monument in a sightseeing area may be provided to the payer device when the payer device is located at or near that monument.)","Referring now to , an embodiment of a networked system  used in the location based payer charging system described above is illustrated. The networked system  includes a plurality of payer devices  (including associated payer devices and secondary payer devices), a payee device , a payment service provider device , and a plurality of account holder devices  in communication over a network . Any of the payer devices  may be the payer device , discussed above. The payee device  may be a payee device operated by the payee\/event provider discussed above. The payment service provider device  may be operated by a payment service provider such as, for example, PayPal Inc. of San Jose, Calif. The account provider devices  may be account provider devices operated by the account providers such as, for example, credit card account providers, bank account providers, savings account providers, and a variety of other account providers known in the art.","The payer devices , payee device , payment service provider device , and account provider devices  may each include one or more processors, memories, and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and\/or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications, data, and steps described herein. For example, such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable mediums such as memories or data storage devices internal and\/or external to various components of the system , and\/or accessible over the network .","The network  may be implemented as a single network or a combination of multiple networks. For example, in various embodiments, the network  may include the Internet and\/or one or more intranets, landline networks, wireless networks, and\/or other appropriate types of networks.","The payer device  may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and\/or software configured for wired and\/or wireless communication over network . For example, in one embodiment, the payer device  may be implemented as a personal computer of a user in communication with the Internet. In other embodiments, the payer device  may be a smart phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), laptop computer, and\/or other types of computing devices.","The payer device  may include one or more browser applications which may be used, for example, to provide a convenient interface to permit the payer to browse information available over the network . For example, in one embodiment, the browser application may be implemented as a web browser configured to view information available over the Internet.","The payer device  may also include one or more toolbar applications which may be used, for example, to provide user-side processing for performing desired tasks in response to operations selected by the payer. In one embodiment, the toolbar application may display a user interface in connection with the browser application.","The payer device  may further include other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide desired features to the payer device . In particular, the other applications may include a payment application for payments assisted by a payment service provider through the payment service provider device . The other applications may also include security applications for implementing user-side security features, programmatic user applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces (APIs) over the network , or other types of applications. Email and\/or text applications may also be included, which allow the payer to send and receive emails and\/or text messages through the network .
