therefore the assistant and\/or care person can operate the Takizawa method with the guidance of experts, such as physical therapists and\/or occupational therapists.","Also, an expert such as a physical therapist or an occupational therapist can enforce the method with many patients.","The idea to motivate a patient's will is made within the Motivative exercise for lower extremities.","An example of the idea to motive a patient's will is when patients not only perform an active exercise with a weight band for a load and swing exercise for a lower extremities by themselves for a functional extremity but also an assistive exercise of lower extremities with the weight band for the load and swing exercise for a lower extremity even if they cannot move their own impaired extremity by themselves.","When the Motivative exercise is enforced following the method, thermo therapy may be necessary to remove pain during the exercises.","Thus, the Takizawa method includes and defines that thermo therapy, while sitting, must be enforced.","This invention is related and offers a method for managing rehabilitation exercises and muscle power strengthening and\/or the Takizawa method for rehabilitation and Motivative exercise.","This applicant describes the first embodiment of this Invention as following.","First, a list is named an \u201cExercise administration list\u201d.","The \u201cExercise administration list\u201d in which a \u201cname column\u201d, \u201cexercise columns\u201d and \u201cexercise date columns\u201d as a \u201cmain column\u201d and a \u201cremarks column(s)\u201d are laid out properly for use in this embodiment as a document.","Then, the name column consists of a \u201ctrainee name column\u201d and a \u201cplanner name column\u201d.","The exercise columns consist of \u201cdetailed exercise columns\u201d with the types of exercises that are set up in multiple steps, in which types of exercises and\/or a type of thermo therapy is listed and \u201csets of exercise columns\u201d in which the number of repetitions and length of enforcement time period for thermo therapy are registered.","In the sets of exercise columns, length of the application for performing thermo therapy and the number of repetitions for describing of amount of kinetic momentum is clearly indicated.","The exercise columns consist of combinations with \u201cdetailed exercise columns\u201d and the sets of exercise columns.","A part of the main column consists of multiple rows of \u201cexercise date columns\u201d and a \u201cname column\u201d.","A \u201cremarks column(s)\u201d is used for information such as an address, ages and any distinction of the dementia.","The administration of rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening is managed, depending on the steps of a procedure and technique with using an \u201cExercise administration list\u201d as follows.","A planner specifies an optional trainee and confirms that the trainee is able to keep a sitting position by oneself.","The planner fills a name of trainee in the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d.","The planner writes down his or her own name on the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d.","The rehabilitation, muscle power strengthening and thermo therapy prescribed by a planner enables performance in accordance with the planner's itinerary that indicates a trainee and planner specified by entering their names on each of the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d.","If necessary, it is possible to write down a trainee or planner's address when filling their names.","At the time of filling a trainee's name, it is possible to write down age and also records of diseases in the remarks column(s).","The planner authorizes that the trainee can rehabilitate and strengthen muscle power depending on the situation if the trainee can keep a sitting position.","It is possible to change the remarks column(s) to an age, disease record entry column if necessary and to add the age, disease record entry column.","It is also possible to write a daily life independence degree evaluation such as the Functional Independence Measure as an optional evaluation in the remarks column(s).","This is possible even if there is no remarks column.","The specification of a trainee is necessary to define the most suitable rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening for the trainee.","Even if there is no planner, the enrolment of a planner's name in the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d is effective as the basis that gives the caregiver confidence to perform the rehabilitation by the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise instead of enforcing the passive exercise for rehabilitation.","It is possible to omit writing a planner's name or omit the planner name column when a planner is clearly decided in the case of using the method in a facility. In the case that a trainee is being rehabilitated at home, it is possible to omit the trainee name column or the trainee name column.","If a trainee has joint contracture and\/or flexion, the planner may decide to secure the trainee's sitting position by using cushions.","In an \u201cExercise administration list\u201d, the planner describes the types of exercises such as lower and upper extremities' exercises, a trunk exercise, a standing exercise, a walking exercise and a thermo therapy in detailed exercises columns. And also, the planner distinguishes between assistive exercises and self-training regarding the lower and upper extremities' exercise, the trunk exercise, the standing exercise and the walking exercise.","A thermo therapy may also be described as physiotherapy.","The number of times (Repetitions) of the lower extremities' exercise, the upper extremities' exercise and the trunk exercise, counts per second of the standing exercise and walking distance of the walking exercise are entered in sets of exercise columns.","Furthermore, an exercise of the lower extremities is performed using devices for lower extremities' exercise and an exercise of the upper extremities is performed using devices for upper extremities' exercise.","An abdominal muscle exercise in a sitting position or gymnastics with a wall bar can be selected for a trunk exercise.","The abdominal muscle exercise is usually performed in a sitting position by pushing the body trunk down in front and turning the head down, as if to bow. The abdominal muscle exercise can be performed either as an assistive exercise or self-training.","Wall bar gymnastics are performed securely by using a wall bar.","In sets of exercise columns, the planner lists the following:\n\n","Thereafter the planner entrusts an optional manager to control the rehabilitation exercise as following the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d, which had been listed as consisting of combinations of a trainee name column, a planner name column and exercise columns that consist of detailed exercises columns with types of exercises and sets of exercise columns.","The manager, who is shown the exercise columns consisting of detailed exercises columns and sets of exercise columns in the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d by the planner, prepares the devices that correspond to the types of exercises listed in the detailed exercises columns for the trainee(s).","Subsequently, the manager specifies and confirms the trainee listed in the trainee name column and confirms for the trainee performing the exercise.","Subsequently the manager correctly organizes the entries of the exercise date column, confirms the remarks column(s) and controls the amount of sets of exercises that are listed in the sets of exercise columns.","When there are an excessive number of trainees to be trained by one manager, the planner assigns different managers to the trainees.","The manager, or a care person, prepares the devices to be used, correctly organizes the entries of the exercise date column and manages the enforcement of the designated amount of the exercise at home.","It is possible that a planner can double as a manager.","In the case that a manager is a planner, it is possible to omit entry of the manager's name when organizing and entering the exercise date column.","Furthermore, lower extremities' exercises can be segmented almost as a front and back reciprocating exercise, a vertically rocking motion exercise and a swing exercise with loading to lower extremities.","Standing exercises can be also segmented in to standing still exercises and gymnastics.","Walking exercises can also be segmented to walking inside parallel bars, types of walkers, walking circumference of parallel bars and stairs training.","Furthermore devices for a thermo therapy can be sufficient if the devices can warm regions of designation.","For example anything such as a warmed towel, a hot pack or a device for microwave irradiation can be used for thermo therapy.","Any kinds of walkers are acceptable for use.","The walkers can be specified not only to describe but also to check mark choosing from many kinds of walkers that are listed.","In the case of segmenting lower extremities' exercises to a front and back reciprocating exercise, a vertically rocking motion exercise and a swing exercise with loading to lower extremities, it is acceptable to segment these exercises by using devices that accommodate the segmented types of exercises.","Exercises such as a range of motion exercise, durability training and a breathing training are included in the types of exercises.","Optionally, individual facilities that perform this invention can change or add the exercises such as a range of motion exercise, durability training and breathing training and change or add the types of the devices.","In the case of adding the exercises such as a range of motion exercise, a durability exercise and a breathing exercise to the detailed exercises columns, it is also possible to manage the enforcement of exercises filling the repetitions in the sets of exercise columns as the following:\n\n","A manager who has been consigned to exercise administration by the planner is able to perform the rehabilitation, muscle power strengthening and thermo therapy that were accurately defined by the planner in the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d to the trainee(s).","When a manager controls the administration, the manager classifies a trainee who is unable to secure a sitting position into a diseaseful trainee.","In the beginning of the Motivative exercise, physically impaired people who can secure a sitting position do approximately twenty repetitions, usually twenty repetitions for both a front and back reciprocating exercise and a vertically rocking motion exercise.","A pulling capacity of 0.5 kg or 1 kg with twenty repetitions are suitable for a lower extremities' load and swing exercise, which are a lower extremities' exercise that is carried out under the condition that a knee joint is pulled downward.","In the case of providing a remarks column(s) enabled filling the repetition changes, it is possible to print repetitions of exercises in the sets of exercise columns in advance.","Devices to load tractional force are weight bands for the swing exercise.","Although anything is acceptable without limiting to a weight band for devices that are able to haul a knee joint downward when used for the swing exercise.","Devices for upper extremities' exercise are used for an upper extremities' exercise.","When training starts, twenty repetitions of an upper extremities' exercise are suitable.","In the case of providing a remarks column(s) enabled writing down the repetition changes, it is possible to print repetitions of an upper extremities' exercise in the sets of exercise column in advance.","With regards to the exercises, ten repetitions may be suitable about one week from the beginning.","In the situation where physical conditions are improved and walking becomes possible, approximately fifty repetitions may be suitable.","A thermo therapy usually warms up joints.","For example, it is possible to print words such as shoulders (right and left), elbows (right and left) and knees (right and left) in the sets of exercise column in advance in order to use the words by marking to specify the area.","The standing exercise is in ten-second units and it is also possible to write down the repetitions of the enforcement number.","A manager usually assists a trainee at the time of the standing exercise.","In the case of enforcing exercises at home, a care person usually assists a trainee(s).","A walking exercise is performed after the trainee is able to stand, but a manager assists the trainee in the beginning.","The trainee performs the front and back walking inside the parallel bars.","Usually the parallel bars are 6 m long and it is possible to fill the repetitions of round trips in the sets of exercise column.","In the case of a trainee(s) enabled walking by oneself in the parallel bars, it is possible to fill the repetitions of round trips of the parallel bars by segmenting forward walking, crosswise walking and backward walking.","Through exercises at home, it is possible to perform the walking exercise under the manager's indication of the repetitions of round trips of the parallel bars' distance by securing the safety of a trainee like using parallel bars.","Ten times of repetitions are preferable and recommended to perform the range of motion exercise in the Takizawa method and deep breathing training.","The repetitions of these exercises should be adjusted accordingly for healthy trainees who are suitable for durability training.","Of course, it is possible to decide repetitions of the range of motion exercise and deep breathing training in the Takizawa method.","It is possible not to fill directions concerning a standing exercise of the trainee who can perform a walking exercise.","It is possible to omit writing about a standing exercise of the trainee who can perform a walking exercise.","It is possible to perform a trunk exercise by the repetitions of the abdominal muscle exercise as a unit.","The abdominal muscle exercise can be performed either as an assistive exercise or as self-training.","It is possible to perform a trunk exercise by designating repetitions of wall bar exercises specified as a unit.","When a trainee can walk inside the parallel bars, a device to assist walking is selected.","There are cases to use devices to assist walking is not necessary.","The trainee can perform the exercise on the basis of circumference distance of 6 m of the parallel bars, even in the either case that they use any devices for assistive walking or they do not use any devices to assist walking.","It is possible to perform the exercise with the indication of repetitions on the basis of circumference distance of 6 m of the parallel bars.","This embodiment of this invention is shown above.","Therefore, one manager can confidently perform the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening and\/or the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise to many trainees.","And in the case where a manager is a doctor, physical therapist or other kind of therapist for rehabilitation, the manager can control to perform rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening as well as the medical chart entry by filling an exercise date in the exercise date column of the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d and matters of special mention in the remarks column(s).","And a manager can manage the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening by filling an exercise date in the exercise date column of the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d and matters of special mention in the remarks column(s).","When a manager must rehabilitate an excessive number of trainees, additional managers can aid to control rehabilitation.","A caregiver can control trainee(s)'s rehabilitation exercises at home in accordance with an \u201cExercise administration list\u201d.","Trainees are controlled by a manager in this way correctly and safely.","In other words, summary of mentioned above shown as follows:\n\n","Though physical therapists have enforced rehabilitation exercises as follows:\n\n","This applicant describes the second embodiment of this invention as following.","First, this embodiment is composed of an \u201cExercise control list\u201d and \u201cPerforming days list\u201d and is used for the control of the Takizawa method and

possible to write down a kinetic exercise momentum that is specified of the types of exercises in the sets of exercise columns with accommodating types of exercises that are described in the detailed exercises columns with the types of exercises that are segmented.","And, it is possible that the exercise columns consist of the combination of the sets of exercise columns that accommodate to types of exercises and types of thermo therapy that was written down in the detailed exercises columns with the types of exercises as well as the first embodiment.","Furthermore devices for thermo therapy can be sufficient if the devices can warm regions.","It is also possible that the exercise enforcement is managed by listing a number of times of range of motion exercises that are performed as defined in the Takizawa method, the number of times that the amount of a setup the exercise with the devices such as an exercise bike for durability training such as the number of times of deep breathing in the sets of exercise columns, such as range of motion exercises, durability training and breathe training were added in the detailed exercises columns as well as the first embodiment.","A manager who has been consigned the exercise administration by the planner is able to perform the rehabilitation, muscle power strengthening and thermo therapy that were accurately defined by the planner in the \u201cExercise control list\u201d to the trainee(s).","When a manager controls the administration, the manager classifies a trainee who is unable to secure a sitting position into a diseaseful trainee.","A manager who is shown the exercise group column consisting of the detailed exercises columns and the sets of exercise columns by the planner, prepares the devices that correspond to the types of exercises listed in the detailed exercises columns with the types of exercises.","The devices to be used are mentioned in the previous items in this embodiment.","Subsequently, the manager specifies the trainee by confirming the trainee name column.","Subsequently the manager manages enforcement of the amount of sets of exercise that are listed in the sets of exercise columns to the trainee.","It is possible that a planner can double as a manager.","In the case where a planner doubles as a manager, there are many cases that a planner controls exercises as a manager of the inside one optional number of managers.","Subsequently the manager correctly organizes and entries on the exercise date column, with confirming the trainee name columns with using \u201cPerforming days list\u201d.","When many trainees are managed at the same time, an exercise date is written down in one-step of the exercise date columns (usually, the column of the extreme front) and then it is possible correctly to organize and to write down a mark that means enforcement in an applicable step on the exercise date of the other trainee in the exercise date columns.","In the case of making the mark peculiar to the individual manager, the mark can substitute for the description of the name of the manager.","To stamp in the exercise date column can substitute for the description of the name of the manager as well.","In this case, the name of the manager column(s) may be omitted as well.","In the case that a manager is the planner, it is possible to omit entry of the manager's name when organizing and entering an exercise date column.","Remarks columns are composed for writing down matters for special mention that are related for both a trainee and an exercise date or either a trainee or an exercise date, it is good even if it is not specially set up in the case of writing memo of the matters for special mention in the trainee name columns or the exercise date columns.","The manager who was consigned the exercise administration with the planner is able to control the rehabilitation, the muscle power strengthening and thermo therapy, that were accurately defined by the planner such that the trainee works their rehabilitation, as they clearly described those to the \u201cExercise control list\u201d.","When the manager controls the administration, the manager classifies a trainee who has a body dysfunction and is unable to secure a sitting position.","It is possible not to fill directions concerning a standing exercise of the trainee who can perform a walking exercise.","It is possible to omit writing about the standing exercise for the trainee who can perform the walking exercise.","Managers assure trainees to rehabilitate and strengthen muscle power correctly and safely.","In other words, the summary of the above mentioned steps are as follows:","A planner who is a specialist specifies an optional trainee, decides contents of the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening and\/or the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise, writes down them in the \u201cExercise control list\u201d and delivered the \u201cExercise control list\u201d and an \u201cPerforming days list\u201d to an optional manager.","Subsequently, the manager supervises the trainee.","Thereafter, the trainee can perform the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise and\/or the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening, which substitute for the rehabilitation of one physical therapist to one patient comfortable in the condition of one manager to many trainees as well as a passive exercise in the rehabilitation of one physical therapist to one patient.","When a manager must train an excessive amount of trainees, the planner assigns different managers to the trainees under exercise.","And also a trainee can perform rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening and\/or the Takizawa method and The Motivative exercise at home by following the \u201cExercise control list\u201d by oneself or with assistances of the caregiver without performing a passive exercise without anxiety.","Then the manager, who is directed by the planner, confirms the enforcement of the exercise that conforms to the \u201cExercise control list\u201d.","Thereafter, the manager lists an exercise date in one-step of the exercise date column, and the exercise date columns are set up in multiple steps in the \u201cperforming days list\u201d.","Physical therapists decide the contents of rehabilitation according to a doctor's directions and prescription and enforce the rehabilitation exercise by checking physical conditions of a patient.","Physical therapists use their knowledge to compose the contents of rehabilitation exercise for individual patients and fill a medical rehabilitation chart containing and confirming this arrangement.","This invention can reduce the labor of filling the chart after the enforcement of rehabilitation for physical therapist.","There is the above-mentioned process in the embodiment.","Therefore many persons exercise by one administrator confidently when the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening and\/or Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise are performed.","A manager writes down an exercise date with using a \u201cPerforming days list\u201d and writes down matters for special mention in the remarks column as well as the \u201cExercise administration list\u201d of the first embodiment if necessary.","Therefore a manager, such as a doctor or physical therapist, can omit the complexity of the medical chart entry and can control the rehabilitation and muscular power strength training centering and\/or the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise.","A caregiver is able to perform and to control an exercise of a trainee in accordance with an \u201cExercise control list\u201d at home.","Furthermore, it is possible to name the name columns only \u201cname\u201d in the first embodiment and the second embodiment.","Also, the exercise date columns may be named \u201cdate\u201d.","A planner name column is as well possible to make \u201ccharge\u201d.","Detailed exercises columns is as well possible to make \u201cexercise\u201d and \u201csets of exercise columns\u201d is as well possible to make \u201camount\u201d, or it is possible to not describe such as \u201ctime\u201d, \u201camount\u201d or \u201cunit of distance\u201d if units are evident.","In other words, names of columns body forth meaning that has an idea, therefore it is possible to name any kind of names if column can show the meaning.","Also, there is the place where devices of exercises are prepared in advance in optional facilities.","In the case of enforcing and administrating by this invention in the facilities, it is possible to perform the rehabilitation and muscle power strengthening and\/or the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise out of order that shows in this embodiment, for example, an order such as the manager confirms the exercise working contents for each trainee, prepares necessary devices and then confirm the exercise date thereafter, the manager can control the exercises of each trainee.","Although the length of the parallel bars is described with 6 m, the length of devices may be changed, as an example, it is possible to use the parallel bars of 4 m as well.","It is sufficient to indicate a number that is converted the length to the standard value of 6 m.","Although the stairs made the height of 72 cm a standard, the height of application may be changed and it is possible to use the height that is converted on the basis of this height.","Use Possibility in Industry","This invention enables a trainee including the elderly and physically impaired people who require the rehabilitation with physical therapies to recover and improves and\/or strengthens a body's impaired function.","Additionally, this is a Control System of training by the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise for an elderly and\/or a physically impaired person.","This invention can dissolve the hard burden that physical therapists who examine variously based on the doctor's directions and think with the knowledge for each patient every time to build up contents of the rehabilitation with physical therapies and both doctors and physical therapists write down a medical rehabilitation chart with handwriting every time.","It is possible to reduce expenses by reducing the number of physical therapists because one manager can control and rehabilitate several trainees (patients) enforcing exercises that center on the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise instead of the rehabilitation with physical therapies heretofore with this invention.","In the case that caregivers rehabilitate a care needed person (trainee) at home, if it is not possible for trainees to perform active exercises, the caregiver with the advice of a physician and\/or a physical therapist has performed the passive exercise.","According to this invention, trainees can rehabilitate by performing the Motivative exercise that a healthy extremity leads an impaired extremity of trainees using devices themselves by the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise and\/or muscular power strength training because of receiving directions from a planner clearly by using the list that shows the Takizawa method and the Motivative exercise to rehabilitate.","Therefore, it is possible for caregivers to dissolve the burden of performing rehabilitation and anxiety such as performing a passive exercise.","And also caregivers can perform and control an assisted training by assisting the movement of a device correctly and safely.","According to the explanation, the invention has practical that can dissolve the burden of doctors and physical therapists.","This is practical, as costs will be reduced because fewer physical therapists are needed.","Furthermore, an at home caregiver's anxiety can be relieved when the patient (trainee) can use the devices without active help from the caregiver."],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
