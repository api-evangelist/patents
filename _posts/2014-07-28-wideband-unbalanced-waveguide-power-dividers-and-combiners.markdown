{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/859,384, filed on Jul. 29, 2013, and entitled \u201cWIDEBAND UNBALANCED WAVEGUIDE POWER DIVIDERS\u201d, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","Routing radio frequency (RF) signals from a source to an antenna array can involve many power dividers\/couplers (e.g., \u201cT\u201d splitters) to properly feed antenna elements with a desired signal and\/or signal strength. Two common approaches for such routing utilize printed circuit board type power dividers (e.g., microstrip or stripline dividers) or waveguide power dividers. Microstrip or stripline dividers are often used in applications that have wideband frequency operation and unbalanced power divisions. However, microstrip or stripline dividers can suffer from various signal losses (e.g., a high insertion loss) which can limit a maximum sensitivity of a communication apparatus that utilizes these types of dividers.","Waveguide dividers are desired due to their ability to be utilized with increased bandwidth in conjunction with low loss properties to facilitate increased system resolution in remote sensing applications and increased data transfer for wireless communications. However, wideband, unbalanced waveguide power dividers and combiners are not commonly utilized in radar systems, wireless communications, and other applications as there is little information available in literature regarding the design of such dividers and combiners. Accordingly, waveguide dividers are conventionally utilized used in narrowband applications (e.g., 5-10% fractional bandwidth) which utilize balanced power divisions. Typical unbalanced waveguide power dividers used in the aforementioned applications have a narrow operational bandwidth (e.g., less than 2.0% fractional bandwidth).","A number of challenges can be encountered during the design of wideband unbalanced waveguide power dividers, where such challenges can include:","a) Waveguides are not easily designed for broadband applications due to their dispersive nature.","b) There is minimal information available on how to formulate an unbalanced splitter design, and further, how to create a design that satisfies requirements regarding return loss, insertion loss, and\/or phase balance.","c) Conventional coupler designs may be used to achieve desired power splits, but these designs have a much larger footprint (e.g., 2\u00d7 or more) compared to a balanced waveguide divider, whereby the increase in size can be due to coupling through the broad wall of the waveguide, for example.","d) Conventional design methodologies to fabricate unique unbalanced waveguide power dividers with similar footprints to balanced dividers can be time intensive. For example, an impact on an electrical performance by various lengths\/sizes is not well known, and accordingly, parametric sweeps of many different waveguide dimensions\/features are required in electromagnetic modeling tools for each unique divider design.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","The various embodiments presented herein relate to unbalanced waveguide power dividers and power combiners. The waveguide dividers can be utilized in narrowband and wideband applications, e.g., in an application requiring high fractional bandwidth. In an aspect, the various waveguide dividers presented herein, and the associated methodologies of design, can result in design times that are faster by an order of magnitude or more over conventional design methods. The resulting designs can meet demanding RF performance requirements, e.g., with regard to such parameters as return loss, insertion loss, phase balance, etc.","Further, the various embodiments presented herein facilitate design and construction of radar or antenna array systems which are smaller and lighter in comparison with conventional arrays, while operating with losses which are also less than those encountered in a conventional system. In an aspect, a reduction in operational losses can enable improved system sensitivity.","A plurality of designs are presented, where such designs utilize a combination of any of a main septum, an iris, one or more pair of resonant septums, a notched input waveguide arm, and various transformer regions such as an input matching section, stepped transformers, etc. In accordance with the various embodiments presented herein, waveguide dividers can be manufactured to satisfy various requirements of waveguide standards. For example, waveguide dividers can be fabricated such that the respective sizes (e.g., aperture sizes) of the input port and output ports are in accordance with a WR-28 standard, for Ka band frequencies (e.g., 26.5-40 GHz). In another embodiment, aperture sizes for the respective ports of a waveguide divider are also customizable, and accordingly, do not have to comply with a particular waveguide standard.","The above summary presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the systems and\/or methods discussed herein. It is not intended to identify key\/critical elements or to delineate the scope of such systems and\/or methods. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Various technologies pertaining to waveguide dividers are now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects. It may be evident, however, that such aspect(s) may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing one or more aspects.","Moreover, the term \u201cor\u201d is intended to mean an inclusive \u201cor\u201d rather than an exclusive \u201cor\u201d. That is, unless specified otherwise, or clear from the context, the phrase \u201cX employs A or B\u201d is intended to mean any of the natural inclusive permutations.

While the various embodiments presented herein are directed towards Ka band frequencies (e.g., 26.5-40 GHz), the embodiments are not so limited, and can be applied to any desired frequency range and\/or waveguide standard. Furthermore, while the various embodiments are directed towards T-junction waveguide power dividers they can also be directed towards T-junction waveguide power combiners, or a combination thereof.","The various embodiments presented herein relate to an air-filled waveguide which can be machined into a standard waveguide block or substrate (e.g., an aluminum substrate). In an aspect, the various embodiments presented herein can be directed towards an in-phase H-plane, unequal way, T-junction, which can be formed by removing material in the substrate to form a first waveguide arm comprising a first port at one end. Second and third waveguide arms can be formed in a collinear arrangement and respectively comprise second and third ports. Depending upon the fabrication process, structures forming any of the first, second, or third waveguide arms can be formed by material removal (e.g., machining) or built-up by press-in, brazing, bonding, soldering, or similar fabrication process. The waveguide cavity formed by the first waveguide arm, the second waveguide arm and the third waveguide arm can be formed by placing a lid over the machined regions formed in the substrate. In an embodiment, a film or layer (e.g., aluminum foil) can be placed between the substrate and the lid to facilitate sealing of any gap that may occur between the substrate and the lid.","To facilitate understanding of the various embodiments presented herein, various desired electrical characteristics of the waveguide power dividers and combiners are now described. Desired characteristics can include:","a) Most of the input power is to be transmitted through the waveguide structure (indicated by the return loss value, |S|).","b) The actual power split engendered by the waveguide structure is to be close to the desired values (indicated by the insertion loss values |S| and |S|).","c) The phase balance is to be zero, or alternatively stated, the phase progression of the waves from the input port to the output ports is to be approximately the same (indicated from the insertion loss phase angle (S) and angle (S)).","Further, regarding the phase balance, a zero degree phase balance can be desired over a wide frequency range as for remote sensing applications a zero degree phase balance facilitates antenna elements to be fed with the same phase.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","121","131","120","130","100","111","110","111","110","120","130","121","131","100","111","110","121","131","120","130","100","110","120","130","121","131"]},"In an embodiment, the respective size and impedance of ports , , and  can be equal, and based upon such equality, the size and placement of other features which form waveguide divider  can be positioned accordingly, as further described herein. For example, the dimensioning of waveguide divider  (and other waveguide dividers  and  presented herein) can be based upon the waveguide standard WR-28, which can be utilized when operating in the Ka frequency band (e.g., 26.5-40 GHz). Accordingly, standard WR-28 specifies inside dimensions (or apertures) of the ports , , and  to each be 7.112 mm (b)\u00d73.556 mm (h) (0.280\u2033\u00d70.140\u2033) and having a characteristic impedance for the standard, e.g., to enable insertion of the various waveguide divider configurations presented herein into antenna systems configured to the WR-28 standard. However, as previously mentioned, the respective dimensions of the ports , , and  can be of any desired dimension, for example, in an embodiment, b=about 7.4 mm and h=about 3.7 mm.","With regard to a degree of unbalance, a waveguide divider which operates in a balanced manner can be expressed as a 50:50 waveguide divider, with an input signal being shared equally between two output ports. However, an unbalanced waveguide divider can operate in any division ratio, whereby a signal having a magnitude of 100% is divided in an x:y ratio of imbalance, whereby x and y are non-equal values that add to 100%. For example, in an embodiment, a waveguide divider can operate in a 64.5:35.5 ratio (which can be considered to be in a moderate degree of unbalance). In another embodiment, an unbalanced waveguide divider can operate in an 83.1:16.9 manner (which can be considered to be in a high degree of unbalance). It is to be appreciated that while various degrees of balancing are presented herein, the various embodiments are applicable to any degree of balancing from 50:50 (balanced) through to about 100:0 (severely unbalanced). It is to be appreciated that in some applications multiple unbalanced waveguide power dividers with unique power divisions can be cascaded together to form beam forming networks.","A number of features can be appropriately positioned and sized to achieve the desired degree of signal unbalance. As shown in the embodiment presented in , a first feature, an input matching section  (e.g., the shaded region, also known as a transformer, or a transformer region) can be positioned about a centerline c, whereby centerline c can be positioned relative to a midpoint of the first port , for example, distances wand wcan be of equal length about centerline c. Accordingly, the input matching section  can be positioned offset to the centerline c such that distance wis different to a distance w, (e.g., distance wis less than, or greater than, distance w).","In an aspect, adjustment of the position of the input matching section  about the centerline c can affect the reactive nature of a junction J between the waveguide arms , , and . In another aspect, adjustment of the position of the input matching section  about the centerline c can adjust the input impedance at the input port  to a value that is useable with regard to the desired characteristic impedances of input port  and output ports  and  (e.g., the characteristic impedances of ports ,  and  are equal to satisfy a waveguide standard). In another aspect, the relative positional offset of input matching section  (e.g., length wrelative to w) can also affect the signal power split (e.g., a first signal portion and a second signal portion) between the waveguide arm  and the waveguide arm  with the offset properties. For the example, from a field propagation viewpoint, with the configuration presented in , where w>w, more signal power is directed out of the output port .","Further, a septum  (e.g., a main septum) can be incorporated into the divider  to further split the input signal into the first signal portion and the second signal portion. In an embodiment, the septum  can be placed on the centerline c of the first port . In another embodiment, either, or both of the input matching section  and\/or the septum  can be offset from the centerline c. The septum  can have a length of L, whereby the length Lcan be customized. The septum  can be utilized to tune out capacitance at the junction J.","An iris  (e.g., a narrowed region) can be incorporated into the waveguide divider . As shown in the particular embodiment presented in , the iris  can result in the profile of one arm (e.g., the waveguide arm ) to be configured different to the profile of the other arm (e.g., the waveguide arm ). The iris  can have a size L\u00d7L. Further, the iris  can be placed adjacent to an edge of the input matching section . In an aspect, when the dimension Lis small, the iris  can act as an inductive septum. Incorporation of the iris  can result in a transformation of an impedance formulated from waveguide dimensions for waveguide arm  to a different impedance. For example, the iris  can cause an input into the third port  (e.g., when looking at the third port  from the junction J) to have a feature of a waveguide with a high characteristic impedance (e.g., no reactance) at a desired frequency, accordingly an impedance is transformed to a higher impedance. In an aspect, with the configuration presented in waveguide divider , a greater amount (or magnitude) of signal power can be directed along waveguide arm  compared to the amount (or magnitude) of signal power directed along waveguide arm , resulting in the power unbalance.","It is to be appreciated that while a higher equivalent impedance may be seen into waveguide arm , a higher power split can be achieved based upon the offset design of the input matching section  and the septum , as previously described. The input matching section , the septum , and the size and place of iris  can interact as follows with regard to signal splitting and control. Essentially, the power can be split preferentially by guiding electromagnetic waves to one waveguide arm (e.g., waveguide arm ) relative to the other waveguide arm (e.g., waveguide ). With an offset  (e.g., w>w), more signaling can be directed to the waveguide arm where the w dimension is largest in the input matching section . In the embodiment presented in , wis larger and hence, more signal power is directed out of port . The septum  can also facilitate the power division across the waveguide arms.","In an aspect, to compensate for differences in a field propagation path length between the two output waveguide arms  and , the iris  can act to increase a signaling phase velocity. Thus the iris  can act to correct phase balance experienced between the waveguide arms  and . However, incorporating the iris  can introduce issues with achieving a desired power split between the waveguide arms  and .","An effect of the iris  is that iris  can transform a waveguide impedance formed by the waveguide port dimensions at port  to a larger impedance when Lis approximately one fourth the waveguide wavelength (e.g., acting as a quarter wavelength transformer). In an embodiment, where Lis close to being one fourth the wavelength over an analyzed frequency band, the input impedance from the junction J to port  can appear higher than looking into port . In an aspect, owing to a greater amount of electromagnetic waves can propagate out a waveguide arm which has a smaller input impedance as seen from the junction J for a symmetric structure, asymmetry between the input matching section  and the septum  can be utilized to influence the power flow through the waveguide divider . The input matching section  and the septum  can be designed to facilitate a greater amount of signal power is directed into port  despite a higher input impedance, as shown in the divider .","Thus it can be seen that many of these design features are \u201ccoupled\u201d to achieve the desired electrical performance (e.g., return loss, insertion loss, phase balance, etc.)","As previously mentioned, power division (e.g., power unbalance) can be controlled in waveguide divider  by any of (a) a degree of offset of the input matching section  (e.g., respective distances wand wrelative to centerline c), (b) a degree of offset of the septum , and\/or (c) adjusting a length and\/or width of the iris .","Further, an input return loss for the waveguide divider  can be controlled by adjusting the respective length(s) and\/or respective width(s) of the input matching section  and\/or the septum .","Furthermore, the phase imbalance of waveguide divider  can be controlled by adjusting the length and\/or width of the iris .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-5","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","121","131","111","150","110","120","130"],"sub":["1 ","21","31 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","110"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["410","420","410","130","420","120","130","120","120","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["110","120","110","130","510"],"sub":["21","31"]},"Presenting exemplary results for a waveguide divider constructed in accordance with the various features presented above for waveguide divider , a return loss >20 dB, insertion losses within \u00b10.1 dB of their target values, and a phase balance of \u00b110\u00b0 can all be achieved over a 33-38 GHz operating range.","In an aspect, as illustrated in , incorporation of one or more input match sections (e.g., an input match section ) into a layout  comprising multiple waveguide dividers can result in available space reduction between two adjacent waveguide dividers, where such space reduction can occur over both a length and a width of respective waveguide dividers. Hence, as shown, input match sections IMS 1-3 can take up real estate with regard to size and placement of three waveguide dividers , , and . Accordingly, for example, where space limitations dictate, it may be desirable to form one or more waveguide dividers that are not limited in size by a respective input match section(s).","Turning to , a waveguide divider  is illustrated.  is a plan or top view while  is a 3D oblique or perspective view. The waveguide divider comprises two output waveguide arms  and  that have respective ports  and . The waveguide divider also includes an input waveguide arm  that has an input port , wherein the input waveguide arm  connects the input port  with the two output waveguide ports  and  of the output waveguide arms  and , respectively.","Comparing waveguide divider  with waveguide divider , waveguide divider  does not include an input matching section (e.g., as compared with the input matching section  of waveguide divider ) or an iris (e.g., as compared with the iris  of design ). However, waveguide divider  utilizes a pair of septums  and  (also referred to as a pair of resonance septums) to control signaling in the output port , whereby septums  and  can constitute an iris in waveguide arm . In another embodiment, a main septum  can be incorporated into waveguide divider . In a further embodiment, a notch  can be incorporated into waveguide divider .","The pair of septums  and  can act to constrict electromagnetic wave propagation to the output port  compared with the unconstricted wave propagation which can occur at the output port , whereby the constriction can cause signal unbalance between output port  and output port . For example, the septums  and  can reduce the width of the waveguide arm  to a width w, in comparison to the width of the waveguide arm  being non-constricted at a width w. The septums  and  can be placed at a desired distance wfrom a junction of the waveguide arm  and the input waveguide arm , as indicated by the junction line J. Further, septums  and  can have respective lengths Land L, which in conjunction with distance wcan be utilized to form a waveguide divider  having a desired signal unbalance with a high level of bandwidth.","A septum  (also referred to as a main septum) can be incorporated into the waveguide divider  to divide a signal input via input port  and waveguide arm , e.g., to achieve unbalanced power division. In an embodiment, the septum  can be placed on the centerline c of the input port , whereby wand ware equal. In another embodiment, the septum  can be offset from the centerline c. The septum  can be configured with a length of L.","Further, a notch  (also known as a step) can be incorporated into the waveguide divider . As shown in , the notch  can be located in the waveguide arm  of the input port . In an aspect, the notch  can be utilized to tune out an input inductance occurring at a certain distance away from input port . The notch  can be placed at a location nearest a junction of waveguide arm  with respect to waveguide arms  and , where the input impedance can appear to be inductive, which in comparison with waveguide divider , the notch  can operate as (e.g., a capacitance notch), and replace, the input match section , which allows for a reduction in size of the waveguide divider . The notch  can have a height of L, a width of L, and positioned a distance Lfrom the junction of waveguide arm  with respect to either of waveguide arms  and\/or waveguide arms . In an embodiment, the position and size of the notch  can be selected in accordance with any suitable data, e.g., a Smith chart. Accordingly, the size and the location of the notch  can be selected to define an operational frequency (e.g., a central frequency) of the waveguide divider .","With regard to design of a waveguide divider which includes a pair of resonance septums (also referred to as a septum divider, e.g., waveguide divider ) in comparison with a waveguide divider which utilizes an input matching section (also referred to as an input match divider, e.g., waveguide divider ), a number of benefits can be derived. As previously mentioned, an aspect of the input match divider is one or more interactions can occur at the waveguide junction (e.g., J) and the input matching section (e.g., input matching section ). For example, an interaction can occur as a function of the width of the input matching section. Accordingly, with an input match divider, adjusting one design parameter can lead to a plurality of other performance requirements being affected at the same time. For example, adjustment of a power division in an input match divider can be controlled by offsetting the input matching section (e.g., adjusting widths wand wabout centerline c) of the input match divider. However, offsetting the input match section to adjust the power division can also result in a change in of any of the return loss of the waveguide divider, the waveguide divider insertion loss, and\/or the phase balance for the waveguide divider. Similarly, adjustment of the iris (e.g., iris ) and\/or the septum (e.g., septum ) can result in accompanying changes in any of the power division, the return loss, the insertion loss, and\/or the phase balance of the waveguide divider. In an aspect, the interrelation between the plurality of design parameters can result in a complicated design process.","Removal of the input matching section and\/or the iris from a waveguide divider (e.g., per waveguide divider ) can enable a reduction in the complexity of designing a waveguide divider. In an aspect, the ports , , and  should be the same size and have the same impedance (per the waveguide standard), and accordingly, it is desired that unequal power division is achieved without changing the size or impedance of the ports. Designing with the following features achieves such a requirement. The main septum  can operate as an inductive feature and accordingly, can tune out a degree of the capacitative nature of the junction between waveguide arms , , and . The pair of resonance septums  and  can act as an inductive septum (or inductive iris), whereby the pair of resonance septums  and  can be placed at a position on the waveguide arm  such that an input into output port  (e.g., viewing along X into port ) can appear as a waveguide with a high input impedance at a desired frequency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["721","780","790","780","790","770","720","711","721","731","740","750","740","750","770","780","790","711","721","731","770","711","710","711","700","700"],"sub":["9","9A","9A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIGS. 9-11","FIG. 7"],"b":["700","721","731","711","760","710","720","730"],"sub":["6 ","21","31 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 9"],"b":"910"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1010","720","1020","730","720","730","720","730"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 11"],"b":"1110"},"Presenting exemplary results for a waveguide divider constructed in accordance with the various features presented above for waveguide divider , a return loss >13.5 dB, insertion losses within \u00b11.0 dB or better from their target values, and a phase balance of \u00b115\u00b0 can all be achieved over a 33-38 GHz operating range. It is to be appreciated that when comparing values presented in  with values presented in , the degree of unbalance is less for waveguide divider  (e.g., 64.5:35.5) than the waveguide divider  (83.1:16.9).

As previously mentioned, the main septum can be placed opposite and centrally with respect to the input port to divide a signal being input into the waveguide divider via the input port. In an aspect, central placement of the main septum with respect to the input port can separate the input signal into two signals of equal strength.","At , a distance can be identified at which a pair of septums (e.g., a pair of resonance septums) can be placed on the arm of the second output port. The distance can be determined based upon minimization of one or more resonances which may occur over a desired bandwidth of operation (e.g., 33-38 GHz).","At , the length of the respective septums in the pair of septums can be adjusted to enable a desired response being achieved. For example, with reference to the second output port, a response |S| can be achieved. In an aspect, the septums can cause a \u201cthrottling\u201d of signaling passing through, and accordingly, the septums can be utilized to control the power split between the first output and the second output.","At , the location of the pair of septums with respect to a junction of the second arm to the arm of the input port can be adjusted.
