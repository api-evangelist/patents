{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on, and claims priority to, provisional application Ser. No. 61\/053,928, having a filing date of May 16, 2008, entitled Media Adaptive Distribution System and Method.","The invention relates generally to the digital media entertainment industry, specifically the secure distribution of digital media across a network to a home network user for secure playout either standalone, wired or wirelessly through a viewing device such as a Personal Video On Demand Device (PVOD).","Presently, the digital media entertainment industry is buoyed by an ongoing fierce competition among the premier globally dispersed media distribution concerns. This competition is a result of the need to gain a competitive edge while at the same time establishing a viable, secure and profitable business model to serve an ever entertainment-hungry public. Many corporations sought to be ahead of the curve through the establishment of fiber-based broadband networks across the spectrum. Today, approximately 80% of households receive their content from cable or satellite providers. Entertainment is rapidly moving toward non-fixed-schedule on-demand, such as, but not limited to, cable, satellite, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), and time-shift viewing such as but not limited to personal video recorders or new age devices. The average in-home entertainment platform is evolving into a high quality media center punctuated with cable or fiber optic services (FIOS) legacy or modern Internet Protocol (IP) set top boxes or personal computers optimized for high quality media content playback serving as the central media server. The result of these improvements in the distribution architecture is the widespread availability of broadband connectivity, and as expected an increased consumer need for high quality and readily available high-quality content. There is a need to improve the quality and consistency of distribution in alignment with the advances in media distribution technologies. These advances enabled emerging distribution houses to take advantage of the proliferation of the Internet and advances in media compression to provide better service quality at lower costs.","With the advent of these advance compression technologies, there remains however some stubborn challenges to the protection of the distribution infrastructure. The protection of media from piracy therefore, still remains one of the biggest \u201cheadaches\u201d to the media distribution industry. The entertainment market is therefore \u201cprimed\u201d for a distribution platform that offers the best advantages to the industries of impact namely; consumer electronics, service providers, content owners and information technology. Home entertainment has also seen extensive enhancements through the creative advances of the electronic industry. Leading companies from the consumer electronics, service providers, content owners and information technology industries are most impacted by this emerging revolution that is primed to deliver enhanced entertainment options to the consumer experience. The entertainment industry has adjusted to these advances through the availability of content formatted for better quality and improved viewing capabilities. The standard media formatted for high-definition, high quality distribution becomes available at a much faster \u201cclip\u201d than previously imagined. Video-on-demand is common on all major distribution platforms as a subscribed option and is formatted to be delivered to high definition television (HDTV), personal computers and standard television endpoints.","Distribution of the aforementioned are consequently facilitated either through the cable or digital satellite distributions network(s), the Internet or through the movie rental houses option.","The adoption of new compression technologies and new modes of distribution is still however in its infancy stage and as a result, some reference areas for distribution are still being affected. For instance, the movie industry strives to be a valid in-home network player but for the absence of clear secure digital rights management standards and innovations. Competition among the video rental houses is also at its peak currently because of the need for a more profitable and secure distribution model of reference.","While the content provider and service provider industries have benefited immensely from this boom in demand, there still lies an opportunity for an alternatively more secure, advanced storage and cost effective media distribution method. The solution envisaged is driven by the vast advances in media compression technologies, enhanced digital rights management security technologies and the need for flexible programming in choosing video entertainment.","Content owners and service providers have long established a sincere demand for a robustly secure distribution platform to protect their assets. Content owners whose assets include games, movies and other forms of digital entertainment are exposed to great losses while reluctantly choosing service providers on an insecure platform at the highest risks to make content available online. Industry experts have estimated losses in revenue due to piracy to be $6 Billion USD yearly. There is a need for providing end-to-end secured home entertainment products and services. In complete cognizance of these challenges, there is a need for a secure, high quality distribution of high definition, enhanced media assets to portable viewing devices.","Embodiments of the invention concern distribution of media contents from a remote source to portable personal viewing devices. In particular, the invention relates to distributing media-on-demand (MOD) contents through a network such as the Internet for an end user to securely stream either wired, wireless or direct to his desired in-home playout location. The MOD content is encrypted and encoded end-to-end from the remote source to the end user's location. In an illustrative embodiment to which the invention pertains, the incoming media stream is processed at the end user's location in a portable contents distribution apparatus to be either wired or wirelessly transmitted in high definition to be viewed on a viewing device such as, but not limited to, a personal computer, a laptop, a portable digital player or a television.","Embodiments of the invention is directed to a portable media-on-demand (MOD) contents distribution apparatus, which includes a media input component for receiving and processing an incoming media stream from a remote distribution source. The media input component includes a media-input interface adaptable to communicate with and to receive the incoming media stream from the remote distribution source and a media-input processor configured to verify user access information for the secure delivery of the incoming media stream. It also includes a transcoding component for processing the incoming media stream received by the media input component configured to determine the bit rate of the media stream and to decompress the incoming media stream, thereby generating a processed media stream. A media output component, and a communication processor coupled to the media input component and the transcoding component are also included. The communications processor is configured to manipulate the processed media stream to produce a transmission-ready stream. A media-output interface adaptable to communicate with the media output component is coupled to the communications processor. The media output component streams transmission-ready stream to the media output device for transmitting to a viewing device. The system also includes a device distribution management component in communication with the transcoding component for managing the processed media stream. The device distribution management component includes a device distribution management platform; and computer-readable medium having stored therein data representing the processed media stream; and a processor in communication with the computer-readable medium. The processor stores therein computer-executable code to manage distribution of the processed media stream.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention include systems and methods for distributing digital video content that provides the content owner, service provider, video distributors and consumers with a method for secure delivery of digital media contents by encryption using a portable digital video storage and distribution device that includes a decoder and a HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) wireless interface to transmit digital contents wirelessly, a standard HDMI interface and a universal serial bus (USB) interface for viewing content on viewing device such as, but not limited to a High Definition (HD) capable television, laptop\/personal computer or other portable viewing devices. The system consists of a remote content-distribution management platform that provides end-to-end protection (e.g. ISMA Encryption and Authentication (ISMACryp)) and a portable digital video storage and distribution device using broadband wireless technologies such as 802.11n and ultra wideband (UWB).","Embodiments of the invention provide content owners, service providers, media distributors and consumers with a method for secure delivery of media assets. Embodiments of the invention may serve as a robust and secure storage device for the highest quality media content such as a library of themed movies from content distributors or general releases from content providers. Embodiments of the invention introduce an adaptive connectivity for both intelligent connectivity and intelligent media content transcoding.","Embodiments of the invention encompass apparatuses, systems and methods for distribution of media content over an adaptive connection platform.  shows a block diagram of the media adaptive distribution system  according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. The system comprises three main components, which are: (1) a contents-distribution management platform , (2) a portable user-end content-distribution apparatus , and (3) a portable playout or viewing system .","In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, a contents-distribution management platform  comprises a conditional subscription access head-end management system , an encryption engine , and a remote content storage  as a source for storing media-on-demand contents.","The contents-distribution management platform  provides an interactive platform for the user at the end-user location to select a desired media stored at the remote contents source, such as a video-on-demand. Upon the selection of the desired media asset, for example, a video file, a request for processing the media asset selection is communicated to the processor to retrieve the selected media asset at the remote contents storage source. After the selected media asset is retrieved, the media asset is encoded and encrypted via the encryption engine  and the conditional subscription access head-end management system , respectively.","The conditional subscription access head-end management system  is coupled to the encryption engine , an encoder processor engine and a processor to provide secure access to the media stream to be sent to the end user via a network  such as the Internet. The conditional subscription access system includes an enhanced digital rights management (DRM) module to prevent maliciously accessing unprotected media assets. In addition, unauthorized access to the assets stored on the device for copying purposes would also be prevented through the guarantees of the inclusive digital rights management (DRM) system. In an illustrative embodiment, an encryption method is used to enable secure distribution, identification and tracking of digital contents. Transport stream data is then encapsulated and transmitted over an IP network.","For a given media stream to be compressed and encrypted for transmission to the user end, a suitable encryption algorithm and compression method are used. A variety of encryption algorithms with different cryptographic media encodings and protocols may be used to encrypt the media file. Different techniques of discretizing components of the media files can also be used in the encryption. In the illustrative embodiment, key frames of the media file are selected to be encrypted so that the media data can be sent efficiently to best utilize computational resources. The encryption platform embodies the open platform that allows efficient flexibility in securely managing content, thus enabling the ultimate experience for consumers and content owners. The goal is to protect content in its distribution life cycle.","In the illustrative embodiment, ISMACryp is used as the encryption algorithm, which provides complete end-to-end protection with access units being protected by the content creator and being decrypted only right before decoding. The Receiver architecture includes interfaces to Key\/License Management (KEY MGT), a real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) control interface, and ISMACryp, the cryptographic services for media data. The ISMACryp Receiver can decrypt, authenticate, and check the integrity of encrypted media data. In the ISMACryp environment, a media stream may be mastered into a file or streamed directly from an encoding application to a network. In the illustrative embodiment, encryption occurs prior to transport, although message authentication is performed at the transport layer.","At the user's end, a stream may be received into a file, such as a personal recorder at a player or cache server, or directly to a decoder. ISMACryp transforms are applied at the arcs that emanate from the encoder; decryption occurs at the arcs that terminate at the decoder; message authentication transforms are applied at the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) sender and receiver. ISMACryp supports the replacement of its encryption and message-authentication (integrity) transforms. It is possible to replace the ISMACryp default encryption or message authentication transform with different ones. Existing transforms may be augmented for media authentication to be added to ISMACryp without necessarily replacing message authentication.","The ISMACryp modular design relies on external standards where appropriate, and is therefore suitable for the greatest variety of network environments. Thus, ISMACryp uses SRTP for message authentication of real-time media packets [RFC3711]. A modular design also permits use of a variety of key management and key establishment systems.","In addition to message authentication, there is also media authentication. Authentication of the rights holder that creates or publishes a content work\u2014and validation of the integrity of that work\u2014can be an important function for many applications. Typically, digests from hash functions will suffice for the integrity check, and digital signatures serve to authenticate the creator of the digest or catalog of published works. This solution is efficient for files that are reliably delivered and for which a single hash of the contents is feasible. Such a hash cannot be computed when parts of the file are streamed over a lossy channel. Whereas public-key cryptography (PKC) is suitable to authenticate media data in files, this is inefficient for packet data: Practical security systems generally do not use asymmetric cryptography for packets owing to the excessive per-packet overhead of digital signatures or public-key encryption. The packet-size and computation overhead are worse for media frames since there are often multiple frames to a packet. There are, however, two methods more efficient than PKC to authenticate stored and streamed media data independently of the message. The first method is to authenticate each media frame using symmetric keys. Use of a message authentication code (MAC) is arguably feasible for large media frames, but these frames may be fragmented across transport packets, thus causing additional complications. In fact, even symmetric authentication techniques are generally infeasible for small media frames since a message authentication code (MAC) can add 10 or more bytes to the length of each media frame. This technique has orders of magnitude less overhead than PKC and is not excessive for large (\u02dc500 byte) video frames. But it is excessive for small frames and low bit-rate audio and video data. The second method avoids the problem of authenticating fragments of media frames by pre-assigning media data into packet payloads, which are authenticated independently of the transport packet. This pre-assignment assumes that the size of the transport-packet payload is fixed prior to the time of transport.","Even the second choice, which has much less overhead than the first, usually doubles the amount of MAC data in each transport packet. This doubling is unavoidable if both message authentication and media authentication are desired. Of the two, message authentication is chosen as more important for several reasons. First, the receiver must trust the sender to have rights to disseminate the media and this trust relationship is realized in message authentication. Second, the authentication of the file creator can be no better than that of the sender whom the creator has authorized to disseminate the work. Third, it is not necessarily the receiver's responsibility to ensure that what the sender sends is exactly what the file creator authorized it to send. Finally, the sender may have rights to alter the media in various ways. Thus, media authentication is redundant to message authentication for many practical applications. The preferred packet design uses SRTP message authentication only and does not support media authentication independent of the SRTP message.","The ISMACryp file format transformation supports the encryption of files either for local playback (including file download) or prior to hinting for streaming. The transformation is self-contained; all the information needed to either play the file, or hint it for streaming (including generating SDP information) is in the file. This does not mean, of course, that the file contains, for example, all the keys; but it does mean that enough information may be included to identify the Key Management System (KMS) used and to enable a client to contact it and acquire the correct set of keys. The file transformation involves: (1) transforming the media samples themselves (encrypting them); and (2) transforming the description of the media samples, both to document the transformation of the media samples, and to avoid the encrypted samples being read as if they were in the clear.","The file may be optionally hinted, and the extra signaling must be generated in the hint tracks.","In its deployment, the promotion of protection against leaks in the distribution chain is its main boast. In addition, it allows storage of the received streams for later consumption in a standardized format while still being encrypted.","In this illustrative embodiment, the sign bits of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients and motion vectors from the video sequence are extracted and encrypted using the AES-128 CTR cryptosystem and then restored back to their original position in the encrypted form. It specifies cryptographic metadata for each access unit, identifying descriptive properties like selective encryption, key rotation and random-access while being unsusceptible to packet loss. In RTP the cryptographic metadata is added to the payload specific AU headers, specified therein. It contains a partial IV for AES128-CTR, a flag whether the following access unit is encrypted and a variable length field that identifies the used key.","Key frames are the significant ones that summarize the substance of the video scene. Video scenes for compression purposes are formatted and textured based on scene information including color and motion references to determine the structure of each frames (I-Frame, P-Frame and B-Frame). DCT information in the compression process is a subset of the macroblock lower level information used as a critical reference to each frame. The crucial part of the process is to select the key frames to be encrypted to maximize computing resources.","The most significant coefficients from either the final steps or the intermediate steps of compression are selected and are encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This selection is done in small segments for integrity protection purposes by retaining the most important significant bits as a most critical key in the final restructuring of the impacted data stream. This may also make the likelihood of any attacker recovering any information from the coefficient nearly impossible. The structure of standard MPEG streams use 8\u00d78 blocks of DCT, Huffman Coding and RLC (Run-length coding. The I-Frames in the video streams are used in the encryption process. The key to an effective selective encryption will then be to ensure that highly sensitive segments of the I-Frame coefficients are encrypted while at the same time maintain a light encryption structure by minimizing the selection of some of the DCT bits that comprises the I-Frame macroblocks. Thus the selection of the least amount of the most significant DCT bits will drastically affect the video stream. Consequently, a method to apply start codes to the decoding process based on these selective DCT bits will provide a secure structure to protect the integrity of the video file.","The method of selecting the critical bit information in the encryption process is performed at the vendor distribution head end. A compressed video stream is broken into sectors. At the top level, the compressed video stream includes a sequence header, groups of pictures (each individual group is denoted as a GOP) and an end sequence. Each GOP comprises a header and a number of pictures (in which these pictures and groups of pictures form a video sequence in the stream). A slice (is a standard for H.264\/MPEG-4 AVC, and is similar to an I-Frame) is segmented into a number of macroblocks. The macroblock contains a header and a number of blocks. The blocks are coded and contain different information, for example, ADDR, TYPE etc. Information about DCT coefficients can be determined in each 8\u00d78 block.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["110","120","130","140","150","160","170"]},"The encrypted and encoded media stream is then transmitted through to the end user via a network , which may be a private or public network as shown in . The public network may include, but is not limited to, the Internet. The private network may include for example, but is not limited to, a personal area network, a local area network, or an intranet. In an illustrative embodiment, industry standard user datagram protocol (UDP)\/IP network encapsulation, with real-time transport protocol (RTP) and real-time control protocol (RTCP) encapsulation is be used. A distribution architecture that can transport both at 100-megabits per second (Mbps) (full-duplex) and 1-gigabit per second (Gbps) Ethernet connections and that can process up to 256 individual streams can be used.","In the illustrative embodiment, the portable user-end content-distribution architecture  encompasses a complete platform that includes an media input component  with a media-input interface and a media-input processor adaptable to receive a media stream from a network gateway, an intelligent network adaptive connection module including a transcoding component, and a radio frequency (RF) remote interface and device for media output . It also contains multi-processor capabilities , enhanced memory module  and storage  along with a device management module .","The intelligent network adaptive connection module comprises an adaptive media streaming architecture , and an adaptive transcoder architecture. The adaptive media streaming architecture provides near real-time, download and playback streaming capability. In an illustrative embodiment, the adaptive media streaming architecture provides 50 Hours of H.264 hard disk drive (HDD) storage, transcoding\/transrating and intelligent adaptive network connectivity capabilities. The module has an intelligent connectivity technology that establishes and maintains a connection bit rate relative to the desired high quality playback feature. Once connectivity is initiated between the device and the network , an adaptive procedural call is initiated to identify the connection speed spectrum. Illustrative embodiments of the invention negotiate the network connection in the adaptive bit rate connection module  to determine the bit rate. The bit rate information is then used to establish the best possible connectivity for expediting a quality link for streaming of high quality video.","The adaptive transcoder architecture provides transcoding capabilities for legacy type media content. It is known in the art that most distribution channels utilize the popular but outdated MPEG2 content as the default for available stored movies and feature film. These movies, in addition to the minimally available high definition movies, consume a lot of bandwidth and download times increase when accessed through the Internet. Illustrative embodiments of the invention may provide optimal download and playback times in addition to the ability to transcode the contents into an appropriate format such as not limited to H.264\/AVC for playback on available end-point(s).","In one illustrative embodiment, as shown in , the adaptive transcoder module comprises a decoder processor engine , a transcoder co-processor  and an encoder engine . When the compressed and encrypted video file is sent from the remote distribution source through the network to the end user, the encoded and encrypted video file may be optionally stored on the memory storage of the apparatus to preserve end-to-end protection of the file until the user decides to play it. It may also be played out directly through an available output interface on the device to a portable playout or viewing system . If a user elects to play the file, the file is first decrypted to verify user information and whether the user has rights to the file. Then a decryption key is generated upon the aforementioned verification to decrypt the file. The decoder processor engine  then converts the file into its original format, for example, MPEG2. If the adaptive bit rate connection module determines that the file may be play out in the original format, the decoded file will bypass the transcoder . However, if a different format is needed to view the video file, for example, MPEG4, the transcoder  will up-convert the video file to the desired format, for example from MPEG2 to MPEG4. The transcoder  is coupled to the memory module  so that the format conversion is performed locally in the device. After sending to the transcoder , the video stream is sent to the encoder engine  to re-encode to a smaller form. The encoder  is adaptably connected to the in-home streaming packetizer  via the internal BUS 41 to transmit re-encoded video packets to the end user portable playout or viewing device  via any of the available interfaces .","In a further illustrative embodiment of the invention, surveillance video media data may be input into the portable user-end content-distribution architecture  for processing to be played out in the playout device .","As shown in , the processed media stream can be sent to playout devices  via high speed wireless transmission because of the emerging advances in broadband wireless technologies such as 802.11n and Ultra Wideband (UWB), which enables sustainable bandwidth of more than 100 Mbps over distances ranging beyond 100 feet to be achieved. A varied platform of playout devices located in the end user's home may include, but are not limited to, high definition televisions (HDTVs), personal portable media players, game consoles, laptops and personal computers, which may all be connected to the media output module of the portable user-end content-distribution architecture over a high speed wireless connection. This enables the delivery of processed media streams such as HD video and graphics wirelessly to the deployed playout devices .","In an illustrative embodiment, a WWCOM602X Full-HD-264 Codec Chipset is used in the portable user-end content-distribution architecture to support specifically wireless HDMI connectivity to the playout device, which may include game consoles, laptop computers, portable media players, set top boxes, DVD players and DVRs. Other chipsets may also be used by a person skilled in the art. The chipset also embodies WWCOMS Super Low Latency Technology\u2122 (SLL Technology\u2122), which achieves sub 1 ms 1080p60 encode-decode latency. Such \u201czero\u201d latency performance enables raw video bit rates to continue to outpace available wireless bandwidth in wireless HDMI applications. This chipset supports advanced error resiliency and concealment features that guarantee distortion-free and highest fidelity pictures under the most adverse wireless channel conditions. The chipset also supports channel adaptive bit rate, transrating and trans-sizing control. This allows a wireless HDMI solution to adjust in real-time the video data rate to match available channel bandwidth under any condition, as well as streaming HD content to devices that only handle lower resolutions and frame rates than the source material.","In another illustrative embodiment of the invention, the adaptive transcoder architecture may be designed also to interface with a standard legacy set-top box to provide transcoding capabilities for legacy MPEG-2 content from cable operators into H.264 HD format to be displayed on a portable viewing device , such as, but not limited to a digital television, a laptop, a screen with streaming capability or a personal computer. This architecture is adaptable to be connected to the Internet via network providers such as but not limited to standard cable provider, telecommunication company provider or terrestrial provider in-home installation. The adaptive system intervenes with the end user's in-home set top boxes (STBs)  either through its legacy connection or standard IP connection to transcode on-demand available media content into H.264 to be played back through the STB decoder to the HD-Television or optimized personal computer. STBs  may be connected to a multi-container output module , which contains different folders for converting media streams from the STBs  file formats as selected by the user.","Aside from encoding, decoding, and transmission over IP networks for real-time, the system also provides advanced networking capabilities, including Forward Error Correction (FEC), thereby providing a platform to address network imperfections.","In an illustrative embodiment, video specific references used may include as an example, but are not limited to: Real-time HD 1080i\/720p video; HD video transport data rates; on-board portable storage component with a capacity to accommodate HD content; surveillance camera capable of encoding at various media formats including H.264; surveillance application options being integrated into capabilities; and WW10K and WW20K H.264 HD codec chipset support; video I\/O, embedded host and decoder modules; HDMI, DVI, HD-SDI, component, composite and S-Video I\/O options; multiple video I\/O ports; full-duplex encode and decode; 10\/100Base-T Ethernet support; PCI add-on card form factor; stand-alone and PCI add-on card operation modes; complete set of device drivers and application programming interfaces (APIs); and Linux OS support.","The invention includes the methods as described herein, a computer readable medium programmed to carry out the methods and a computer system configured to carry out the methods, including the equivalents of the aforementioned.","The computer system includes a machine readable storage medium containing an executable code; an apparatus having one or more processors; memory coupled to a processor; a machine-readable medium having machine-readable program code; an input device and an output device connected to the processor to wirelessly transmit media files to portable viewing or playout devices.","While the invention has been described by illustrative embodiments, additional advantages and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art.
