Technical Field","The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for call center dialing, and more specifically a call center dialing system, method and computer program product for providing adjustable (customizable) algorithms that include predictive dialing functions conforming to continuous changes in both state and federally mandated guidelines such as do-not-call (DNC) and data scrubbing guidelines, for example.","2. Prior Art","Telephone call centers represent the front line for customer contact for new and current customers. In order to handle the volume of calls and the diversity of calling needs, predictive dialers are utilized to combine voice services with data services to provide seamless voice connectivity for the agent (an agent being a call center employee or representative, as the case may be) with low hold times. At times users need to adjust the dialing algorithm, and when using existing proprietary software, a highly trained Network Administrator is often required to setup a remote or local agent to dial. It is understandable that these methods are inadequate at times, in particular because existing technologies use older, out of date algorithms and are not adjustable for individual company needs. Most prior art is based on pre-internet technologies, and outdated un-adjustable dialing variables, and are therefore unable to meet the changing needs of the consumer or the requirements federally mandated guidelines for call center calling.","The use of certain prior art products such as the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,247,569, uses standard tasks and a dialing algorithm based on measuring past calls and predicting when to call next, based on those past results. While this technique was useful, it doesn't take into account federal requirements for call center compliance, drop rates, abandoned call messages, or answering machine messages that are required by law to be left on the recipient's answering machine.","In addition, these systems do not take into account the guidelines for do-not-call (DNC) compliance and data scrubbing that is required by federal law. Each business, depending on its type, will have federal requirements and likewise state guidelines for dialing in that state. The prior art is not dynamic or adjustable to meet the continuing changes in federal\/state guidelines.","Accordingly, a need remains for a dynamic (adjustable) call center dialing system and associated method for customizing the algorithm thereof in order to overcome the above-noted shortcomings.","The present disclosure meets the above-mentioned needs by providing a system, method, and computer program product for customizing a call center dialing algorithm that is able to continuously conform to changing state\/federal guidelines.","The present disclosure overcomes the aforementioned prior art shortcomings by using a combination of a unique dialing algorithm, versatile administrator adjustable settings, and Erlang C formula to determine delay between calls and max lines to dial per agent and per campaign. The problem of adjusting the dialing for individual business needs is overcome with complete compliance with federal laws and issues. Because of the fact that laws change, that businesses require change, and consumers as a whole are always changing, the call center dialing system of the present disclosure accomplishes these tasks by the use of adjustable dialing lines for each agent, adjustable call drop rate times, options for leaving messages on answering machines, and a message played for any call that hasn't been routed within two seconds, all of which are FTC requirements. Also, abandoned call messages would enable the administrator to adjust the dialer as the needs of the business and laws dictate.","The call center dialing system of the present disclosure provides substantial improvements over prior art. By using new technology that allows full integration to the internet for standardization, and non-proprietary requirements such as the operating system or hardware, agents can log in from anywhere there is internet access and dial as desired. This new technology also gives full security compliance and encryption via the Internet, so no VPN or other connecting mechanism is needed.","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure preferably includes an administrator user interface that provides the main entry point for an administrator to setup the dialing system a dialing engine that interfaces with the hardware and phone lines; an agent interface that connects the agent to the system both data and voice, and; a database that saves all work and settings generated.","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure preferably includes an administrator user interface preferably including pages of options and variable settings to setup a \u201cCampaign\u201d. A campaign is a combination of all the dialing variables, phone numbers to dial, and other dialing parameters and system settings that are specific for that calling campaign. All of these settings are written to a database and are saved for each specific campaign. This is also where the administrator can Start, Pause, or Idle the campaign. Due to the simplicity of the user interface, the unique dialing engine, and the processes of the present disclosure, administrators do not have to be highly trained as required with prior art systems. Training takes just a few hours instead of days, even weeks. The importance of the user friendliness of the present disclosure substantially broadens its appeal. In fact, it may be set up and used by relatively small, and inexperienced, businesses that otherwise could not afford their own call center, or would have to hire an outside contractor.","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure preferably includes a computer based training module. This computer based training module (CBT) provides live training to agents as they call. This CBT may include text slides, pictures, audio and video training materials. Since the CBT is web based, in one embodiment, the training materials can be of any format supported by any standard W3 compliant web server and browser. The CBT module is customizable and created by the manager during campaign setup. The CBT module can be changed, and or copied to another campaign for re-use saving time. On most all predictive dialing systems, an agent logs into the dialing system to receive calls, they will receive campaign script pages with a telemarketing script containing customer information as well as the selling script they are to read back to the customer. After the call is finished, the customer disposes the call. At this point, with conventional approaches, the agent would stare at a blank window waiting for the next call to come in. This \u2018waiting\u2019 time can be up to 3 or 4 minutes, adding up to several hours of wasted time in between calls during a single week. Exemplary embodiments of CBT fill that time with training materials for that campaign. While the agent waits for the next call, training materials can be played, to a specific agent, set of agents, or campaign.","The CBT may include an algorithm that is configurable so training scripts can be targeted to each representative based on past call result codes. For example, if agent 1 disposes over 50% of his calls as \u2018No Thanks\u2014Can't afford\u2019, he\/she would automatically receive the training pages on how to close a sale. The CBT algorithm can be manipulated to specify individual training per campaign or per agent. The manager (administrator) has the option to show all training pages, only specified training pages, or no training pages. This eliminates down time between calls and trains agents tailored to their needs, while the agent is working.","The dialing engine is an important feature of the call center dialing system, the engine routes both voice from the telephony and data from the database, to the appropriate agent, or pre-recorded voice message according to the dialing variables and other specific campaign settings.","The database is preferably RDBMS (relational database management software) to maintain data store standards that are exchangeable with other RDBMS on the market. This means the call center dialing system is not forced to use a single database system, but any RDBMS data store will work with the call center dialing system, thus making the system compatible with a multitude of databases and companies. This call center dialing system is a customizable CRM (customer relation administrator) that maintains a complete database of all potential customers in the same system.","In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the objectives of the present disclosure provide:","1) a call center dialing system that is adjustable to individual business needs on a campaign by campaign basis;","2) a mechanism for predictively calling customers and recording all relevant data in a RDBMS;","3) a mechanism for automatically calling customers and leaving a pre-recorded message without agents;","4) a mechanism for combining robo-calls (auto dialer), and the CRM system into one robust call center dialing system that utilizes an adjustable algorithm;","5) a mechanism for utilizing dialing technologies to reduce wasted off-phone time and improve customer contact;","6) a mechanism for predictively dialing customers that complies with federal regulations;","7) a mechanism for predictively dialing customers with adjustability to comply with various state regulations;","8) a predictive dialing system that is adaptable to existing computer hardware and does not require, dedicated, proprietary hardware systems;","9) a predictive dialing system that may be accessed via an internet connection;","10) a predictive dialing system that has digital recording for voicemail;","11) a predictive dialing system that is easy to use and does not require highly trained technicians; and","12) a mechanism for training agents by using a customizable computer based training module for agents.","Furthermore, it is an object of this present disclosure to illustrate the preferred embodiments and broadly state the methodologies that may be used in order to utilize a call center dialing system.","The present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred embodiment of the disclosure is shown.

Rather, this embodiment is provided so that this application will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the true scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art.","The call center dialing system of this disclosure is referred to generally in . It should be understood that the present disclosure also discloses a method and programmable computer program product that may be used to achieve the desired functions of a variety of call center dialing systems, and should not be limited to any particular call center dialing system disclosed herein.","In one embodiment, the invention is directed toward one or more computer systems capable of carrying out the functionality described herein. An example of a computer system  is shown in .","Computer system  includes one or more processors, such as processor . The processor  is connected to a communication infrastructure  (e.g., a communications bus or network). Various software aspects are described in terms of this exemplary computer system.

The secondary memory  may include, for example, a hard disk drive  and\/or a removable storage drive , representing a floppy disk drive, a magnetic tape drive, an optical disk drive, etc. The removable storage drive  reads from and\/or writes to a removable storage unit  in a well known manner. Removable storage unit  represents a floppy disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, etc. which is read by and written to by removable storage drive . As will be appreciated, the removable storage unit  includes a computer usable storage medium having stored therein computer software and\/or data.","In alternative aspects, secondary memory  may include other similar devices for allowing computer programs or other code or instructions to be loaded into computer system . Such devices may include, for example, a removable storage unit  and an interface . Examples of such may include a program cartridge and cartridge interface (such as that found in video game devices), a removable memory chip (such as an erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM), or programmable read only memory (PROM)) and associated socket and other removable storage units  and interfaces , which allow software and data to be transferred from the removable storage unit  to computer system .","Computer system  may also include a communications interface .

These signals  are provided to communications interface  via a communications path (e.g., channel) . This channel  carries signals  and may be implemented using wire or cable, fiber optics, a telephone line, a cellular link, an radio frequency (RF) link and other communications channels.","In this document, the terms \u201ccomputer program medium\u201d and \u201ccomputer usable medium\u201d are used to generally refer to media such as removable storage drive , a hard disk installed in hard disk drive  and signals . These computer program products provide software to computer system . The invention is directed to such computer program products.","Computer programs (also referred to as computer control logic) are stored in main memory  and\/or secondary memory . Computer programs may also be received via communications interface . Such computer programs, when executed, enable the computer system  to perform the features of the present invention, as discussed herein. In particular, the computer programs, when executed, enable the processor  to perform the features of the present invention. Accordingly, such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system .","In an embodiment where the invention is implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer system  using removable storage drive , hard drive  or communications interface . The control logic (software), when executed by the processor , causes the processor  to perform the functions of the invention as described herein.","In another embodiment, the invention is implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, hardware components such as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Implementation of the hardware state machine so as to perform the functions described herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art(s).","As will be apparent to one skilled in the relevant art(s) after reading the description herein, the computer architecture shown in  may be configured as any number of computing devices such as a game console, a portable media player, a desktop, a laptop, a server, a tablet computer, a PDA, a mobile computer, a smart telephone, a mobile telephone, an intelligent communications device or the like.","In yet another embodiment, the invention is implemented using a combination of both hardware and software.","Referring now to , a non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure preferably includes a user interface (UI) , such as a display screen showing a webpage that is an intuitive interface for users to interact with the application and navigate through the system of the present disclosure to configure dialing parameters and campaign system settings. The UI  may be in any number of suitable forms, for example web based, application based, or even PLC or hardware based, and so on.","As a non-limiting example, user interface  may include a variety of stand-alone or shared devices that are capable of generating and transmitting a control signal upon receiving a user input. For example, exemplary user interface devices may include a handheld computer, a PDA, a cell phone, a keyboard, a mouse, etc. that may be comprised of commercially available hardware and software operating systems, for example.","The aforementioned user interfaces are intended to represent a broad category of exemplary user interfaces capable of functioning in accordance with the present disclosure. Of course, the user interfaces may include other components, peripherals and software applications provided they are compatible and capable of cooperating with remaining devices of the present disclosure. In addition, the user interfaces may include information, documents, data and files needed to provide functionality and enable performance of methodologies in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.","Referring now to , the administration interface  may include a display screen configured for displaying various amounts of textual and\/or graphical information. The display screen may be monochrome or color, of various physical dimensions, of various types. In one embodiment, the display may be suitable for displaying full motion video in color. By way of example and not limitation, the display may be comprised of a liquid crystal display (LCD); a field emission display FED; so called \u201cE-ink\u201d technologies, which employ microspheres having at least two reflectance states; a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display; a gas plasma display; an LED readout configured to display alpha-numeric and graphical information; or any other compatible visual display device. In a preferred implementation, the display is large enough to display, with clarity, one or more lines of information. Optionally, the display screen may be configured with a touch-screen interface, to present a user with a graphical user interface.","Referring back to , system configurations and settings are sent to a service-oriented architecture protocol (SOAP)  for distributed systems. SOAP relies on Extensible Markup Language (XML) for its message format, and usually relies on other Application Layer protocols, most notably Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), for message negotiation and transmission. As an example, at least one business object may be employed. An object may be an abstract representation of entities or concepts that encapsulate both data and its related logic. The business object not only contains the data, but also includes the business logic that accompanies the data. Business objects  may include a data interchange specification (hereafter referred to as DIS), which is a robust and scalable resource for encapsulating business logic and data-processing.","The data from the DIS is sent to a business processor , such as an application server. This application server (processor) contains the business logic and is responsible to initiate campaigns using the dialer engine  which in-turn uses a telephony application programming interface  (API), \u2014which is an interface implemented by a software program enabling it to interact with other software\u2014to interface with the telephony hardware. Application server  will maintain the state of agents along with their availability status to initiate campaigns using the data store  that stores the saved settings from UI , which are stored in data store . Business logic processor  is a non-limiting exemplary connection to both the data store  and dialing engine .","The processor  may include a microprocessor or other devices capable of being programmed or configured to perform computations and instruction processing in accordance with the disclosure. Such other devices may include microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSP), Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), discrete gate logic, and\/or other integrated circuits, hardware or firmware in lieu of or in addition to a microprocessor.","Functions and process steps described herein may be performed using programmed computer devices and related hardware, peripherals, equipment and networks. When programmed, the computing devices are configured to perform functions and carry out steps in accordance with principles of the disclosure. Such programming may comprise operating systems, software applications, software modules, scripts, files, data, digital signal processors (DSP), application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), discrete gate logic, or other hardware, firmware, or any conventional programmable software, collectively referred to herein as a module.","Exception management  software process is computer software code that monitors the application for any illegal errors and plays an important role in preventing any unpleasant experience with the application to its users. Exception management  software process may include the functions of catching and throwing exceptions and designing the flow of exceptions till they are gracefully (in other words, \u201cin a nice way\u201d) communicated to the application users. Exceptions are unforeseen errors in software, and may be handled by another software process that labels the error, and gives the agent or manager a notification of the type of error and exactly how to proceed. The exception management  software process may handle: A. Catching and throwing exception information; B. Flowing exception information, and\/or; C. Publishing exception information. The exception management  software process may be one or more of the following based on the exception: A. Retry operation; B. Expose issue to the user, and; C. Stop, restart, or continue with the user interface flow of the application.","In , the present disclosure is shown in an exemplary setup for the call center dialing system. For example, administrator A has logged into UI  and has defined dialing variables and setting, result codes, data fields, dialing parameters, and the importing of phone numbers, which are stored in campaign database . Also accessible from UI  is script editor , where administrator A sets up the agent script, which will be used with each phone contact. This script editor  contains customer data fields as well as the script an agent will use with any one campaign. Administrator A may also access, through UI , the reporting module  to view statistics stored in monitoring and logging module . The statistics to be monitored and logged may include preset report parameters or may be dynamically created. For example, the administrator may access reporting module  to view the reports on the status and history of the dialing system as well as statistics measuring each campaign, agent, and the station's transactions, as required to measure compliance to FTC regulations.","In addition, the administrator has the ability to create a campaign and not use, or bypass, the script editor and use a paper, written script, or no script at all. Further, the administrator may also skip any set up process for the reporting module and thereby not use the reporting module; i.e. keep no records, only written records or otherwise.","The present disclosure is not limited to the use of any particular module. Likewise, the administrator may set up any one or more dialing parameters for a campaign as needed. Utilizing such parameters is only subject to the desired outcome. Furthermore, the various campaign databases, , , , , and , may be used as one single database (or referenced as such), to accomplish the objective of the present disclosure. Such campaign databases are separately shown merely for clarification. The hardware \/ shown in  may also be in any form such as a PCB, a router, and any other third party hardware or even a software device that delivers telephony services. The ability of switching over from one type of communication interface to another makes the present disclosure exceptionally versatile.","In , creation of campaigns by administrator A with UI  results in creation of a campaign database . Such a campaign database  stores customer contact information, such as phone numbers and may include one or more pre-defined schemes and pre-requisite data such as dialing rules and settings , agent database , specific campaign settings , and activity database , for example. This is the interface the administrator will use to setup all the parameters business logic, and dialing variables. In this manner, the present disclosure allows for the creation and storage of multiple campaigns, with multiple variations, mutually exclusive to one another. The number of campaigns could be in the hundreds and potentially in the thousands or more depending on the storage medium and hardware limitations.","As illustrated in , settings are written to the campaign database , which may be a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) . The parameters stored in campaign database  determine one or more dialing behaviors and rules that the engine reads from the database. Thus, administrator A has direct access  to engine  to command it to start, stop, or idle a campaign, thereby allowing an agent to sign in or sign out of a campaign.","As a non-limiting example, administrator A may use script editor  to create the script to be used in a campaign by an agent. The script editor  may be, but not limited to, a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor\u2014a software component that allows for a laymen to use a click and drag method for creating web based pages or forms without any programming or any code\u2014used for creating graphic and text based telemarketing scripts for agents, and also stores customer information. It is important to note that setting up a campaign with the present disclosure takes about one-half the time as exemplary prior art systems. For example, setting up a traditional prior art campaign taking about three hours, may take about only ninety minutes, or less, with the present disclosure. Another advantage is the ability to save various options such as, but not limited to: a) queries, b) data, c) fields, d) options, e) result codes, and f) scripts, for example. With this feature, an administrator can save even more time thereby cutting a three hour set up time on a future campaign down to a fraction of conventional methods employed today.","As a non-limiting example, when agent B logs into user interface, UI , there may be a selection of campaigns available for agent B to access and run. When the agent accesses a campaign, the campaign script automatically pops up on UI , which is agent B's entry point to begin the campaign. The campaign script on UI  may be the same script previously prepared by administrator A in the script editor . This campaign script is what agent B uses to read to the customer, and also provides the agent with stored customer information, which the agent can update, edit, add to, or delete, depending on the needs of the campaign. The use of customer information is optional and its use is not required. When an agent has ended a call, the agent dispositions the call as \u201cended\u201d (for example, it was a hang up, a sale was made, a redial, etc.), which notifies dialer engine  that the agent is now available for the next routed call, or the next outgoing call.","In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, as illustrated in , the present disclosure may also be used with no agents, referred to as \u201cunmanned mode\u201d, also referred to as \u201cvirtual agent\u201d. To create a campaign in an unmanned mode, it is similar to using an agent, except there is no written script and instead, the administrator sets up a pre-recorded message or messages depending on whether the call is answered by a live contact or an answer machine, or otherwise. To activate the unmanned mode, the administrator sends a run command to the engine and dialing is initiated according to parameters of that campaign.","During any given phone call, additional voice options may be played based on the response of the contacted party. All of these parameters are established by the administrator when creating or modifying campaign parameters. This type of unmanned campaign falls under FTC federal guidelines, for example, use with political and non-profit organizations, and so on. It is also easy for the administrator to create a blended campaign that utilizes both an agent and also utilizes the unmanned function. For example, the unmanned mode may initiate a call and then be transferred to an agent to complete the calling objective.","The available campaigns are determined by administrator A commanding it to start, stop or idle. Starting gives the agent's UI  access to the campaign, stopping removes it from the agent's UI , and the administrator may elect to idle the campaign, for example, during a lunch break. Once agent B selects a campaign from his\/her UI , the dialing engine  polls dialing variables from campaign database  and dials accordingly. In this case, dialing engine telephony API  to control telephony hardware , not limited to POTS, VoIP, Digital circuits, or the telephony hardware can be another device such as Asterisk PBX, VOIP, or another software or device that can do voice transmissions. The dialer engine  records all dialing transactions to campaign database  to be used for reporting module . The campaign created with its configured parameters is now underway and will continue to run indefinitely until it either runs out of phone numbers to dial or the administrator initiates a stop command or all agents are unavailable (for example, agents have logged out, paused the use while on break, etc.). The administrator also has the option of setting a start and stop time in the campaign database .","In , the schematic block diagram illustrates an exemplary campaign running on the call center dialing system with campaign database  preferably having pre-defined schemes and pre-requisite data such as: dialing rules and settings , agent database , specific campaign settings , and activity database  read by engine , for example. Phone numbers and customer data in campaign database  are loaded as the dialer engine  progresses through the campaign, as dictated by the specific campaign settings .","The dialer engine  calls and attempts to quickly detect when a call has been answered by a live person L. Immediately upon determining that a live person is on the line, the dialer searches for the next available agent B based on search or routing rules as predetermined in specific campaign settings . Note that agents log in and out of the system using agent UI  throughout their shift, and the available pool of agents is constantly changing on a first come, first serve, basis to route calls. If all agents are available, the system will use a round-robin technique of sequentially routing calls based on predicted availability. For example, the next call waiting will be ready for the agent who has been idle the longest, or who is predicted to be the next agent available for a call. These dialing parameters are established and applied using a unique dialing algorithm illustrated in , and conform to federal guidelines (as required).","The dialing algorithm may be embodied on a computer readable medium, such as a memory. Thus, as a non-limiting example, the memory may include programmable software instructions that are executed by the processor . In particular, the programmable software instructions include a plurality of chronological operating steps that define a control logic algorithm for performing the intended functions of the present disclosure. Such software instructions may be written in a variety of computer program languages such as C++, Fortran and Pascal, for example. One skilled in the art understands that such software instructions may contain various Boolean logic processes that perform the intended function of the present disclosure. Therefore, the specific source or object code of the software program is not intended to be a limiting factor in executing the present disclosure's intended function.","The memory, which enables storage of data and programs, may include RAM, ROM, flash memory and any other form of readable and writable storage medium known in the art or hereafter developed. The memory may be a separate component or an integral part of another component such as processor .","In accordance with various embodiments, the methods described herein may be implemented as one or more software programs running on a computer processor. Dedicated hardware implementations including, but not limited to, application specific integrated circuits, programmable logic arrays and other hardware devices can likewise be constructed to implement the methods described herein. Further, alternative software implementations including, but not limited to, distributed processing or component\/object distributed processing, parallel processing, or virtual machine processing can also be constructed to implement methods described herein.","It should also be noted that software that implements the disclosed methods may optionally be stored on a tangible storage medium, such as a magnetic medium, such as a disk or tape; a magneto-optical or optical medium, such as a disk; or a solid state medium, such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more read-only (non-volatile) memories, random access memories, or other re-writable (volatile) memories. The software may also utilize a non-transitive signal containing computer instructions. A digital file attachment to e-mail or other self-contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. Accordingly, the disclosure is considered to include a tangible storage medium or distribution medium as listed herein, and other equivalents and successor media, in which the software implementations herein may be stored.","Although the present specification describes components and functions that may be implemented in particular embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols, the disclosure is not limited to such standards and protocols. For example, standards for Internet and other packet switched network transmission (e.g., TCP\/IP, UDP\/IP, HTML, HTTP) represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly, replacement standards and protocols having the same or similar functions as those disclosed herein are considered equivalents thereof.","The algorithm in  illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the dialing process, preferably including two parts. When a campaign first starts dialing, it is preferably based on the dialing parameters configured by the administrator, and may not use the algorithm until a predetermined number of calls are made. For example, after twenty calls are made, sufficient call statistics are available for use by the algorithm to predictively determine when to place the next call. Based upon the algorithm and the dialing parameters set up by the administrator, the desired dialing outcome can be accomplished. The predictive dialing algorithm allows a system to automatically place calls for live agents in such a way as to cause a new call to begin close to the time when the agent finishes the previous call.","A non-limiting exemplary process in the dialing algorithm of the present disclosure may function in the sequential order described below.","Campaign  is configured and parameters are set according to the business rules, with desired dialing parameters set for that campaign as shown in . Once all the campaign variables have been set, a dialing query  is created to determine which numbers to call out of the campaign. This dialing query  targets specific data in a campaign to be dialed, while not dialing the other data in the campaign. For example, it may be desirable to target only calls in a specific area code, or any other parameter, such as contact only new numbers, redial existing customers, or call only numbers with certain demographics, such as Spanish speaking contacts.","Once the dialing query  is set, the dialing process reads a variable setting called \u201cdial through all numbers before redial in days,\u201d which will be either yes , or no . When this option is set to yes , the dialer will only dial new numbers  that are phone numbers that have not been called by the system. Once all numbers have been called in the query, the dialer stops dialing.","When the dialing query option  is set to no , the dialer will dial all numbers  that are available according to the dialing parameters (rules) . Once the rules are read from the dialing parameters , the initial dialing begins . This initial dialing process  will typically be the same regardless of the redial options that are selected in the dialing parameters (rules) . If no calls have been made at this point, the dialing engine uses preset dialing parameters , configured by the administrator, to dictate when, and how to dial. Then after the predetermined number of calls is completed, and sufficient data is created for the algorithm to use, it will automatically switch over to the algorithm.","As perhaps best shown in , after the algorithm  controls the dialing sequence, it takes into consideration several parameters setup by the administrator, which include but are not limited to: 1. Number of lines maximum to dial; 2) drop rate percentage; 3) ring count; 4) lines to dial per agent; 5) default call lapse time; 6) delay, and; 7) number of attempts allowed for each phone number. Thus, once a predetermined number of calls have been made, the dialing engine's algorithm  is effectively used to predictively determine when to place the next call, saving agent hold time, customer hold time, thus saving money and increasing profits.","The dialing algorithm  monitors the drop rate, as long as the drop rate is within the set range the administrator specified (or no more than 3% as established by federal and state laws). If the drop rate is equal to or greater than the specified setting, then the slow down dialing logic  is used to keep the dialing within the range specified in algorithm . When the slow down process gets the drop rate back within range, the dialing is handed back over to the dialing algorithm . This dialing process will go on until the dialing query runs out of data and stops  and a prompt will alert the administrator that the campaign has stopped. It may also be stopped at any time by the administrator.","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the dialing algorithm may include, at least in part, an arithmetic formula using a combination of Erlang C traffic calculations, and administrator settings that can be used in collaboration to tweak the call center system to be used in a variety of business environments, with a variety of campaigns based on the desired outcome. By measuring how many calls were made in any specified time period, the average duration of those calls (including wrap up times), the average time to answer, and the average delay tolerated in answering all of the calls, the dialing engine can predictively determine when to dial the next number.","The aforementioned dialing algorithm is a particularly valuable asset in that it can be used by small businesses and relatively inexperienced operators to perform functions that would otherwise have to be conducted by an outsourced call center. Otherwise, a business must hire trained technicians and comparatively expensive call center hardware. Likewise, dedication of space would be required whereas with the present disclosure, the software may be incorporated into an existing computer network.","In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, the dialing algorithm may use a call drop rate, and by using a line multiplier to determine the lines to use per agent, the dialing speed is automatically adjusted and the efficiency of the dialing engine increases. Another advantage in the present disclosure is the ability to adjust the default call time (DCT); this is the time after a call completes before the algorithm initiates next call time (NCT). Using this feature can immediately speed up the number of dials in a given time period, thus greatly increases the number of live contacts and more sales.","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the dialing algorithm, the following process steps may be executed:","1. Get all active dialing queries and iterate (Iteration in computing is the repetition of a process within a computer program) over the dialing queries sequentially.","2. Get all phone numbers associated with the dialing queries, iterate over the numbers associated with the dialing queries.","3. Get the phone number from dialing queries and validate whether it is dialable (valid) or not according to dialing parameters set by the administrator.","4. If phone number is valid then, count the number of logged-in agent(s), multiple by the number of lines per agent(s).","5. If lines and agent(s) are available, then dialing process starts based on lines per agent(s) setting.","6. If initial dialing is done, then wait for pre-established time period set for the campaign, this is the default call time (DCT) setting.","7. If drop rate percent is less than what is set in algorithm's dialing parameters, then it evaluates the next call time (NCT) using predictive algorithm  and continues to dial.","In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, a portion of the algorithm logic may function as:","If (SPC-IUT=0) then NCT=DCT","If (SPC-IUT>SPC-TA) then NCT=(SPC-IUT\u2212SPC-TA+Delay)\/N","If (SPC-IUT<SPC-TA) then NCT=Max of (SPC-TA, Delay)","*If drop rate percent is more than setting, then the following is the logic to slow down dialing process within acceptable parameters.","*If (FC<=DC) then wait (no calling) else continue","Until the drop rate reaches desired point, this process will continue. Here no settings work. If you want to speed up process, just increase drop rate percentage setting.","DCT=Default Call Time","NCT=Next Call Time","SPC-IUT=Statistical Process Control In Use Time","SPC-TTA=Average Time To Answer","Delay=Delay Analyze","N=Number of agents logged in","FC=Free Agent Count","DC=Current Dial Count","A non-limiting exemplary embodiment of the algorithm of the present disclosure may or may not include a specific number of telephone lines per agent, total lines for the whole campaign, the drop rate percentage (the number of live contacts the system hangs up on), the delay analysis, the default call time, and other settings. Its versatility makes it adaptable to almost any business environment and almost any business need.","The call center dialing system may be used for a company that wishes to contact or receive a plurality of calls, newspaper circulation center, tech support centers, and customer support center. Sales organizations, political campaigns, and other applications not designated may use the present disclosure in creative ways. It may even be used with iPhone\u00ae and with other types of cell phone applications.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the disclosure in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.","As a non-limiting example, the application server (processor) , may be communicatively coupled to the web service\/SOAP  and dialer engine , hosts information, documents, scripts and software needed to provide user interfaces and enable performance of methodologies in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure. By way of example and not limitation, the web application server may include web page information, documents and scripts (e.g., HTML and XML code), applets and application software, which enable users to submit valuation requests and display valuation data in response to valuation requests from users.","A plurality of users (e.g., agents, administrator, etc.) may access the web application server using compatible computing devices with network connectivity. By way of example, such devices may include personal computers, laptop computers, handheld computers a\/k\/a personal digital assistants, kiosks, mobile phones or any compatibly equipped electronic computing devices. User computing systems may include an operating system and a browser or similar application software configured to properly process and display information, documents, software, applications, applets and scripts provided by the web application server.","The present disclosure is not limited to any particular network connectivity or communication protocol. Various forms of communication networks may be used by the user computers to access the web application server. By way of example and not limitation, a proprietary Wide Area Network (WAN) or a public WAN, such as the Internet, may be used. These networks typically employ various protocols such as the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Extensible Markup Language (XML), and Transfer Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) to facilitate communication of information between communicatively coupled computers. An exemplary call dialing system according to the present disclosure may also utilize wireless networks, including those utilizing Global System for Mobile (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or Time Division Multiple Access technology, and the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). Furthermore, a system according to the disclosure may utilize any, all, and any combination of such communications networks, as well as communications networks hereafter developed.","The computing devices described herein (e.g., personal computers, handheld computers [e.g., PDAs and servers) may be comprised of commercially available computers, hardware and operating systems. The aforementioned computing devices are intended to represent a broad category of computer systems capable of functioning in accordance with the present disclosure. Of course, the computing devices may include various components, peripherals and software applications provided they are compatible and capable of performing functions in accordance with the present disclosure. The computing devices also include information, documents, data and files needed to provide functionality and enable performance of methodologies in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.","In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, a firewall may be located between application server  and the administrator interface  as well as the agent interface , to protect against corruption, loss, or misuse of data. The firewall limits access by the interfaces , ,  to the application server  and prevents corruption of point-of-sale (POS) data. Thus, the application server  may be configured to update and receive data only to the extent necessary. The firewalls may be comprised of any hardware and\/or software suitably configured to provide limited or restricted access to the database server. The firewalls may be integrated within the application server  or another system component, or may reside as a standalone component.","In , the dialer engine  is started, and the algorithm starts reading dialing parameters  from the database . Once these settings are read, the dialing queries  are read to determine which numbers are dialed from the database. At this point and time the engine cannot initiate dialing until there becomes an agent available to receive the call. Once an agent logs into the system, the dialing algorithm finishes reading the dialing parameters , agent count, and drop rate specification and starts the dialing sequence. The algorithm's job is to measure statistics of each call, as well as read the parameters for that campaign to maintain a constant dialing pattern, where customers are called and handed off to agents while maintaining the parameters set for that campaign.","In a non-limiting example, say there are 4 agents logged into the system, and the dialing parameters are 2 lines per agent, drop rate of 3%. The initial dialing begins with 8 lines dialing in this situation, then those call statistics are measured and the algorithms adjusts to stay within parameters. The dialing algorithm maintains a delicate balance of sending customers to agents at a fast enough pace that the agents always have a call waiting, preferably as soon as they become available. In addition, the algorithm maintains a good customer contact percentage without having the engine \u201cdrop\u201d a call because of no availability of an agent. This balancing act is always being adjusted by the measured statistics of the engines previous calls, and the parameters setup for that campaign by the manager, which sometimes may be changed during the middle of dialing a campaign. Sometimes the dialing algorithm can dial at too fast a pace , causing an extraordinarily large amount of \u201cdropped\u201d calls. To control this dropped calls to within FTC federal guidelines, a portion of the software monitors the specifications, and if needed can slow the dialing , or speed the dialing to maintain specified range of contacts. Once back within range, the dialing is handed back over to the dialing algorithm  to continue.","In , an exemplary U , ,  login screen is displayed. This login is for administrators and agents. Depending on the credentials, he\/she may have a different UI , , . The login name  and password  must be entered. The password is case sensitive and is setup by the administrator of the dialing system. Once login and password are typed in, the user can either click on login  to log into the system and begin work, or he\/she can click on the reset button to reset the login credentials, which clears the login information from the page.","In , when logged as an agent, you will receive a list of all currently available campaigns. A campaign is \u201cavailable\u201d when it is in \u201crun\u201d mode only. When in idle or pause, the campaign will not appear in the list. The computer name that the agent is logging in from is mapped  computer name, so the system can send the data to the proper system. Section  illustrates a login from a computer not physically attached to the system. This may be a \u201cRemote Agent\u201d and the system knows by this login, that a call will have to be made to the agent to establish voice resource. Any valid phone number will work, either POTS, cell phone, VoIP etc. The agent selects from available campaigns in the list , then either selects OK  or Logoff  to exit the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","810","820","830","840","850","860"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","910","920"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0099","num":"0098"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1010","1070","1070","1040","1020","1030","1050","1060"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0099"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1200","1250","1000","1210","1220","1230","1240"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":["1200","1210","1220","1230","1240","1291","1250","1260","1292","1293","1294","1270","1280","1297","1298","1299"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"1500"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 15","b":["1510","1520","1530","1540","1550","1560","1570","1580","1590","1560","1570","1580","1590","1600","1610","180"]},"It is noted the purpose of the foregoing abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, especially the scientists, engineers and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application.
