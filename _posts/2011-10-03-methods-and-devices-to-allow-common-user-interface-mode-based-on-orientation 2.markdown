{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates to electronic devices and, more particularly, to methods and electronic devices to allow a common user interface mode on a plurality of electronic devices.","Electronic devices such as smartphones, tablet computers, laptop and personal computers have become ubiquitous.","Such devices are typically each associated with a defined set of input and output devices. For example, electronic devices are often equipped with a display which is configured to provide a user interface on such electronic devices. Such electronic devices are also often equipped with one or more input mechanisms such as, for example, a keyboard, and one or more navigational input mechanism such as a mouse, track pad, or trackball. Recently, touchscreen displays which provide both input and output functionality have become common in electronic devices. Such touchscreen displays may provide navigational input and, in some devices, alphanumeric input through the use of virtual keyboards.","Some electronic devices may be connected to additional peripherals in order to provide further input or output capabilities. For example, a user may connect a further display to a computer to provide additional display capabilities.","Expanding an electronic device's resources by connecting that electronic device to additional peripherals may, however, require a user to purchase such additional peripherals such as, for example, an additional display and\/or an additional input mechanism.","Like reference numerals are used in the drawings to denote like elements and features.","In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a method of allowing a common user interface mode on a first electronic device and a second electronic device. The method includes: receiving first orientation data from an orientation sensor associated with the first electronic device; receiving, at the first electronic device, second orientation data from the second electronic device; determining, from the first orientation data and the second orientation data, if the orientation of the first electronic device and the second electronic device satisfy one or more predetermined orientation criterion; and if the orientation of the first electronic device and the second electronic device satisfy the one or more predetermined orientation criterion, allowing the first electronic device and the second electronic device to enter a common user interface mode.","In another aspect, the present disclosure describes a first electronic device. The first electronic device includes an orientation sensor and a communication subsystem for establishing wireless communications with a second electronic device. The first electronic device also includes a display and a processor. The processor is configured for: receiving first orientation data from an orientation sensor associated with the first electronic device; receiving, at the first electronic device, second orientation data from the second electronic device; determining, from the first orientation data and the second orientation data, if the orientation of the first electronic device and the second electronic device satisfy one or more predetermined orientation criterion; and if the orientation of the first electronic device and the second electronic device satisfy the one or more predetermined orientation criterion, allowing the first electronic device and the second electronic device to enter a common user interface mode.","In another aspect, the present disclosure describes a second electronic device. The second electronic device includes an orientation sensor for obtaining second orientation data. The second electronic device also includes a communication subsystem for establishing wireless communications with the first electronic device described above. The second electronic device also includes a display and a processor which is configured to provide second orientation data to the first electronic device.","Other example embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.","As will be described in greater detail below, at least some example embodiments of the present disclosure describe electronic devices (such as a mobile communication devices including smartphones, tablet computers and wearable computers, such as watches including electronic or digital watches), methods, communication systems, and computer-readable mediums which allow such electronic devices to interact with other electronic devices. More particularly, as will be described in greater detail below, electronic devices may be configured to enter a common user interface mode with other electronic devices. When in the common interface mode, one or more resources associated with the electronic devices may be shared. For example, a first electronic device may be permitted to use one or more resources associated with a second electronic device when the first electronic device and the second electronic device are in the common user interface mode.","In the common user interface mode, two or more electronic devices operate cooperatively. In some example embodiments, display resources associated with the electronic devices are shared. For example, an electronic device (such as a first electronic device) may be permitted to control a display which is provided on another electronic device (such as a second electronic device) when those two electronic devices are in the common interface mode. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the common user interface mode may be an extended desktop mode in which a user interface generated by one of a first electronic device or a second electronic device is spanned to include the displays of both the first electronic device and the second electronic device. Example common user interface modes will be discussed in greater detail below.","The two or more electronic devices which are configured to enter a common user interface mode with one another may, for example, be any combination of: smartphones, tablet computers, wearable computers (such as watches), mobile telephones or PDAs (personal digital assistants) enabled for local wireless communication, or computer systems. That is, a first electronic device which enters a common user interface mode with a second electronic device may, in various example embodiments, be any one of the electronic devices listed above and the second electronic device may also be any one of the electronic devices listed above. Other types of electronic devices, apart from those specifically listed above, are also possible.","In some example embodiments two or more of the same type of electronic device may enter a common user interface mode. For example, a smartphone may be configured to enter a common user interface mode with another smartphone. By way of further example, a tablet computer may be configured to enter a common user interface mode with another tablet computer.","In some example embodiments, the two or more electronic devices which are configured to enter a common user interface mode with one another may not be of the same type. For example, a smartphone may be configured to enter a common user interface mode with a tablet computer.","A tablet computer (which may also be referred to as a tablet) is a mobile computer which is generally larger than a mobile phone (such as a smartphone) or personal digital assistant. Many mobile phones or personal digital assistants are designed to be pocket sized. That is, mobile phones or personal digital assistants are generally small enough to be carried by a person easily, often in a shirt or pant pocket while tablet computers are larger and may not fit within pant pockets. For example, many tablet computers have a height with is seven inches (7\u2033) or more.","In at least some example embodiments, at least one of the electronic devices which are configured to enter a common user interface mode with another electronic device may be a slate computer. A slate computer is a tablet computer which does not include a dedicated keyboard. A slate computer may allow for text input through the use of a virtual keyboard or an external keyboard which connects to the slate computer via a wired or wireless connection.","Accordingly, electronic devices which are configured to enter a common user interface mode may take a variety of forms. An example of one such electronic device  will now be discussed.","Example Electronic Device","Reference will now be made to  which illustrates an example electronic device  in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. An electronic device  such as the electronic device  of  may be configured to enter a common user interface mode with another electronic device , which may also be of the type illustrated in . It will be appreciated that one or more of the electronic devices  which are configured to enter the common UI mode may be of a type which differs from the electronic device  of  and that some of the features, systems or subsystems of the electronic device  discussed below with reference to  may be omitted from electronic devices  which are configured to enter a common user interface mode with other electronic devices .","In the illustrated example embodiment, the electronic device  is a communication device and, more particularly, is a mobile communication device having data and voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems; for example, via the Internet. It will, however, be appreciated that the electronic device  may take other forms, including any one of the forms listed above.","Depending on the functionality provided by the electronic device , in various example embodiments the electronic device  may be a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a mobile telephone, such as a smartphone, a wearable computers such as a watch, a tablet computer such as a slate computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or a computer system. The electronic device  may take other forms apart from those specifically listed above. The electronic device may also be referred to as a mobile communications device, a communication device, a mobile device and, in some cases, as a device.","The electronic device  includes a controller including one or more processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the electronic device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem  for exchanging radio frequency signals with a wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  is communicably coupled with additional device subsystems including one or more output interfaces  (such as a display  and\/or a speaker  and\/or electromagnetic (EM) radiation source ), one or more input interfaces  (such as a camera , microphone , keyboard (not shown), control buttons (not shown), a navigational input device (not shown), and\/or a touch-sensitive overlay (not shown)) associated with a touchscreen display , an orientation subsystem , memory (such as flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , etc.), auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , a data port  (which may be a serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port), a near field communications (NFC) subsystem , a short-range communication subsystem  and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may include a touchscreen display which acts as both an input interface  (i.e. touch-sensitive overlay) and an output interface  (i.e. display). The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface which is connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input interface  and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller. In at least some example embodiments, the touch-sensitive overlay may have a touch-sensitive input surface which is larger than the display . For example, in at least some example embodiments, the touch-sensitive overlay may extend overtop of a frame  () which surrounds the display . In such example embodiments, the frame  () may be referred to as an active frame since it is capable of acting as an input interface . In at least some example embodiments, the touch-sensitive overlay may extend to the sides of the electronic device .","As noted above, in some example embodiments, the electronic device  may include a communication subsystem  which allows the electronic device  to communicate over a wireless network . The communication subsystem  includes a receiver , a transmitter , and associated components, such as one or more antenna elements  and , local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The antenna elements  and  may be embedded or internal to the electronic device  and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter. The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which electronic device  is intended to operate.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The electronic device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver , which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver  and the transmitter  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","In some example embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may include an external communication link or interface; for example, an Ethernet connection. The electronic device  may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks; for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network. The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the electronic device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  also includes a removable memory module  (typically including flash memory, such as a removable memory card) and a memory interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the electronic device  via the memory module , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the electronic device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (not shown). The data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the electronic device  by providing for information or software downloads to the electronic device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the electronic device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  also includes a device orientation subsystem  including at least one orientation sensor  which is connected to the processor  and which is controlled by one or a combination of a monitoring circuit and operating software. The orientation sensor  detects the orientation of the device  or information from which the orientation of the device  can be determined, such as acceleration. In some example embodiments, the orientation sensor  is an accelerometer, such as a three-axis accelerometer. An accelerometer is a sensor which converts acceleration from motion (e.g. movement of the device  or a portion thereof due to the strike force) and gravity which are detected by a sensing element into an electrical signal (producing a corresponding change in output). Accelerometers may be available in one, two or three axis configurations. Higher order axis configurations are also possible. Accelerometers may produce digital or analog output signals depending on the type of accelerometer.","An orientation sensor  may generate orientation data which specifies the orientation of the electronic device . The orientation data, in at least some example embodiments, specifies the orientation of the device  relative to the gravitational field of the earth.","In some example embodiments, the orientation subsystem  may include other orientation sensors , instead of or in addition to accelerometers. For example, in various example embodiments, the orientation subsystem  may include a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a tilt sensor, an electronic compass or other suitable sensor, or combinations thereof. In some example embodiments, the device orientation subsystem  may include two or more orientation sensors  such as an accelerometer and an electronic compass.","The electronic device  may, in at least some example embodiments, include a near field communications (NFC) subsystem . The NFC subsystem  is configured to communicate with other electronic devices  and\/or tags, using an NFC communications protocol. NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies which typically require a distance of 4 cm or less for communications. The NFC subsystem  may include an NFC chip and an NFC antenna.","The electronic device  may include a microphone and\/or one or more speakers. In at least some example embodiments, an electronic device  may include a plurality of speakers . For example, in some example embodiments, the electronic device  may include two or more speakers . The two or more speakers  may, for example, be disposed in spaced relation to one another. That is, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  may include a first speaker and a second speaker and the first speaker and the second speaker may be spatially separated from one another within the electronic device . In at least some example embodiments, the display  may be disposed between the first speaker and the second speaker of the electronic device. In such example embodiments, the first speaker may be located at one side of the display  and the second speaker may be located at another side of the display which is opposite the side of the display where the first speaker is located. For example, the first speaker may be disposed at a left side of the display and the second speaker may be disposed at a right side of the display.","In at least some example embodiments, each speaker  may be associated with a separate audio channel. The multiple speakers may, for example, be used to provide stereophonic sound (which may also be referred to as stereo).","The electronic device  may also include one or more cameras . The one or more cameras  may be capable of capturing images in the form of still photographs or motion video.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  includes a front facing camera . A front facing camera is a camera which is generally located on a front face of the electronic device . The front face is typically the face on which a display  is mounted. That is, the display  is configured to display content which may be viewed from a side of the electronic device  where the camera  is directed. The front facing camera  may be located anywhere on the front surface of the electronic device; for example, the camera  may be located above or below the display . The camera  may be a fixed position camera which is not movable relative to the display  of the electronic device  and\/or the housing of the electronic device . In such example embodiments, the direction of capture of the camera is always predictable relative to the display  and\/or the housing. In at least some example embodiments, the camera may be provided in a central location relative to the display  to facilitate image acquisition of a face.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic device  includes an electromagnetic (EM) radiation source . In at least some example embodiments, the EM radiation source  is configured to emit electromagnetic radiation from the side of the electronic device which is associated with a camera  of that electronic device . For example, where the camera is a front facing camera , the electronic device  may be configured to emit electromagnetic radiation from the front face of the electronic device . That is, in at least some example embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation source  is configured to emit radiation in a direction which may visible by the camera. That is, the camera  and the electromagnetic radiation source  may be disposed on the electronic device  so that electromagnetic radiation emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source  is visible in images obtained by the camera.","In some example embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation source  may be an infrared (IR) radiation source which is configured to emit infrared radiation. In at least some example embodiments, the electromagnetic radiation source  may be configured to emit radiation which is not part of the visible spectrum. The camera  may be a camera which is configured to capture radiation of the type emitted by the electromagnetic radiation source . Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, the camera  is configured to capture at least some electromagnetic radiation which is not in the visible spectrum.","In some example embodiments, the electronic device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to a host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their electronic device  to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the electronic device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system for processing.","The electronic device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface  such as the data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the electronic device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+to the circuitry of the electronic device .","The electronic device  includes a short-range communication subsystem  which provides for wireless communication between the electronic device  and other electronic devices . The short-range communication subsystem  may be used to provide a common user interface (UI) mode between the electronic device  and another electronic device  which may, in at least some example embodiments, be an electronic device  which is the same or similar to the electronic device  discussed with reference to . In at least some example embodiments, the short-range communication subsystem  is a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","The electronic device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments, the data  includes service data including information required by the electronic device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the electronic device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the electronic device  may be organized, at least partially, into one or more databases or data stores. The databases or data stores may contain data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","The electronic device  may, in some example embodiments, be a mobile communication device which may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the electronic device  may also compose data items, such as email messages; for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the electronic device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., a voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input interfaces ). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the electronic device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory; for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software  and other software applications  such a common user interface (UI) mode module . In the example embodiment of , the common UI mode module  is implemented as a stand-alone application . However, in other example embodiments, the common UI mode module  could be implemented as part of the operating system  or another application .","The common UI mode module  may be configured to allow the electronic device  to enter a common user interface mode with another electronic device  which is within the range of the short-range wireless communication subsystem . As will be described below with respect to , in at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode module  may be configured to interact with a corresponding common UI mode module  on the other electronic device in order to provide a common user interface mode on both devices if one or more predetermined conditions are satisfied.","When in the common interface mode, one or more resources associated with the electronic devices  may be shared. For example, a first electronic device may be permitted to use one or more resources associated with a second electronic device when the first electronic device and the second electronic device are in the common user interface mode.","The common UI mode modules  on the first electronic device and the second electronic device are configured so that, when two or more electronic devices are placed in a common user interface mode, those electronic devices operate cooperatively. That is, when in the common user interface mode, the electronic devices interact to a greater degree than when the electronic devices are not in the common user interface mode. In some example embodiments, display resources associated with the electronic devices are shared when those electronic devices  are in the common user interface mode. For example, an electronic device (such as a first electronic device) may be permitted to control a display  which is provided on another electronic device (such as a second electronic device) when the common UI mode modules  of those electronic devices has placed those two electronic devices in the common user interface mode. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the common user interface mode may be an extended desktop mode in which a user interface generated by one of a first electronic device or a second electronic device is spanned to include the displays of both the first electronic device and the second electronic device.","In at least some example embodiments (which will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to ), the common UI mode modules  associated with two or more electronic devices  may be configured to allow the electronic devices  to enter the common user interface mode if orientation data from orientation sensors  associated with the electronic devices satisfies one or more predetermined orientation criterion. For example, in at least some example embodiments, in order to enter the common UI mode, two or more electronic devices must have a common orientation. In some example embodiments, in order to enter the common UI mode, the two or more electronic devise must be oriented along a common plane. In some example embodiments, the two or more electronic devices may be allowed to enter a common user interface mode if they are both orientated in a table-top orientation. The table-top orientation is an orientation where the electronic devices  are horizontal or substantially horizontal. In some example embodiments, the table-top orientation occurs when a back face of the electronic device  rests on a horizontal structure, such as a table. In at least some example embodiments, if two or more electronic devices  are oriented in the table-top orientation, then they may be permitted to enter the common UI mode with one another.","Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, the two or more electronic devices may be allowed to enter a common user interface mode if they are both oriented in an orientation associated with a docking or support accessory for the electronic devices . The docking or support accessory may be an accessory which is configured to rest upon a table-top (or other horizontal support structure). In some example embodiments, the docking or support accessory may be configured to receive two or more electronic devices . The docking accessory or support may have supports which receive the electronic devices  in predetermined orientations. In such example embodiments, if two or more electronic devices  are in the orientations associated with the docking or support accessory, then the common UI mode modules  associated with the electronic devices  may place the electronic devices in a common UI mode. In at least some example embodiments, the docking or support accessory may be a desktop phone support station such as the type described below with reference to .","In some example embodiments, in order to determine whether the predetermined orientation criteria which acts as a precondition to the common UI mode is satisfied, one or more of the electronic devices may share orientation data with another of the electronic devices. In some example embodiments, such sharing may occur as a result of a pairing of the electronic devices. That is, when the electronic devices  are paired using Bluetooth\u2122 or another wireless protocol, at least one of those electronic devices  may share orientation data regarding that electronic device's orientation with a paired electronic device  when the electronic devices are within the coverage area of one another's short range wireless subsystem .","In some example embodiments, in order to customize the common UI mode to the specific orientation of the electronic devices relative to one another, the common UI mode modules  of the electronic devices may be configured to determine a relative orientation of the electronic devices and to use the relative orientation to provide a common user interface mode in which the orientation of a common user interface displayed on a display associated with one of the electronic devices and a display associated with another of the electronic devises is determined in accordance with the determined relative orientation of those electronic devices. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode modules  of the electronic devices  may be configured to select a side of each of the electronic devices as a shared side and to orient the common user interface based on the shared side. In some example embodiments, the shared side is the nearest edge of the displays of the electronic devices. In such example embodiments, in the common UI mode, a user interface may be displayed so that it spans the shared side.","In at least some example embodiments, cameras  associated with the electronic devices may be used in order to determine the relative orientation of two or more electronic devices . Such example embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to . As will be described in greater detail below, in at least some example embodiments, images may be captured by two or more cameras  associated with two or more electronic devices which are wirelessly connected (e.g. electronic device which have been \u201cpaired\u201d). The images may be captured at a common time and may be shared between the electronic devices . One or more of the electronic devices  may analyze the images to determine a relative orientation of the electronic devices . More particularly, in at least some example embodiments, one or more of the common UI mode modules  associated with one or more of the electronic devices  may identify one or more common features in images which were captured at approximately the same time and which were captured on different electronic devices . That is, the common UI mode module(s)  may identify common features in a first image captured on a first electronic device  and a second image captured on a second electronic device  in order to determine the relative orientation of the first electronic device  to the second electronic device .","In at least some example embodiments, audio location and\/or orientation methods may be employed in order to determine the relative orientation of a first electronic device  and a second electronic device . In some example embodiments, the electronic devices  may participate in audio based communications with one another and such audio based communication may be used in order to determine the relative orientation of the electronic devices.","Methods and systems for using audio signals to determine the relative orientations of two or more electronic devices  will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","The software applications  on the electronic device  may also include a range of additional applications, including for example, a notepad application, Internet browser application, voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, mapping application, or a media player application, or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (e.g. the display ) according to the application.","The software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the electronic device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the electronic device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the data port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed; for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime.","Example Smartphone Electronic Device","As discussed above, electronic devices  which may collectively enter a common user interface mode may take a variety of forms. For example, in at least some example embodiments, one or more of the electronic devices which are configured to enter a common user interface mode with another electronic device may be a smartphone.","Referring now to , a front view of an example electronic device  which is a smartphone  is illustrated. The smartphone  is a mobile phone which offers more advanced computing capability than a basic non-smartphone cellular phone. For example, the smartphone  may have the ability to run third party applications which are stored on the smartphone.","The smartphone  may include the components discussed above with reference to  or a subset of those components. The smartphone  includes a housing  which houses at least some of the components discussed above with reference to .","In the example embodiment illustrated, the smartphone includes a display , which may be a touchscreen display which acts as an input interface . The display  is disposed within the smartphone  so that it is viewable at a front side  of the smartphone . That is, a viewable side of the display  is disposed on the front side  of the smartphone. In the example embodiment illustrated, the display  is framed by the housing .","The example smartphone  also includes other input interfaces  such as one or more buttons, keys or navigational input mechanisms. In the example illustrated, at least some of these additional input interfaces  are disposed for actuation at a front side  of the smartphone.","The example smartphone also includes a speaker .

These electronic devices  may include a first electronic device  and a second electronic device . The two or more electronic devices  may establish wireless communications with one another using short range wireless communication subsystems  associated with each of the electronic devices . In such example embodiments, the two or more electronic devices  may establish wireless communications with one another when they are each physically located within a coverage area provided by the short-range wireless communication subsystem  of the other of the electronic devices.","In at least some example embodiments, at , the two or more electronic devices  may connect via a Bluetooth\u2122 connection.

In some example embodiments, the electronic devices  may connect together directly. In other example embodiments, the electronic devices  may connect together through one or more server or network. In at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  may connect together via a Wi-Fi\u2122 connection.","In at least some example embodiments, in order to connect, the electronic devices  may undergo a pairing process. A pairing process allows a user to control which electronic devices  are permitted to connect with one another. In at least some example embodiments, the pairing process may be completed once in order to establish a relationship between two electronic devices . After the pairing process is completed, the paired electronic devices  have a relationship in which those electronic devices  are able to perform more advanced communications with one another. For example, as will be explained below, after those electronic devices  are paired, they may be permitted to enter a common user interface mode in response to one or more predetermined trigger conditions.","The pairing process is an additional level of security which ensures that the users associated with a pair of electronic devices  would like those electronic devices  to be able to communicate with one another.

A synchronous action is an action which occurs at approximately the same time on two or more of the connected electronic devices . In at least some example embodiments, the synchronous action is a bumping of the electronic devices  together. That is, if the electronic devices  are bumped together at approximately the same time, then the electronic devices  may be permitted to enter a common user interface mode. Such example embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, one of the predetermined trigger conditions which may cause the electronic devices  to enter a common UI mode is a near field communication action associated with NFC subsystems  of the electronic devices . For example, in at least some embodiments, when the NFC subsystems  detect that a pair of electronic devices  are tapped together, those electronic devices  may enter the common UI mode. Such example embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, one of the predetermined trigger conditions which may cause the electronic devices  to enter a common UI mode is a swiping gesture which is applied across both electronic devices . A swiping gesture may be characterized by a touch based gesture which spans two or more electronic devices . For example, a swiping gesture may occur when a user runs their finger along the touch sensitive overlay of a first electronic device  until they reach an edge of that touch sensitive overlay and then continue running their finger across the touch sensitive overlay of a second electronic device , beginning at the edge of the touch sensitive overlay of the second electronic device . The common UI mode modules  of two or more electronic devices  may share touch information with each other and, at least some of those electronic devices  may be configured to identify such a swiping gesture. For example, one or more of the common UI mode modules  may determine if a first swiping gesture on one of the electronic devices  has ended at or near the edge of a touch sensitive overlay of that electronic device and if a second swiping gesture on another of the electronic devices  has begun at or near the edge of the touch sensitive overlay of another of the electronic devices within a predetermined period of time after the first swiping gesture. If this criterion is satisfied, then the electronic devices  may interpret the gesture as a command to enter the common UI mode. Such example embodiments are discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In some example embodiments, one of the predetermined trigger conditions which may cause the electronic devices  to enter a common UI mode is the activation of one or more interface elements associated with one or more of the electronic devices .

For example, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  may be allowed to enter the common UI mode when they are oriented along a common plane. Such example embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, if a common UI mode module  determines that the one or more predetermined trigger conditions are satisfied (as determined at  of ), then the common UI mode modules  of the electronic devices  may, at , attempt to detect the relative orientation of the electronic devices  (i.e. the electronic devices which were connected at  and which satisfied the predetermined trigger condition(s) at ). The common UI mode which is provided on the electronic devices  may depend on the orientation of the electronic devices . That is, in the common UI mode, a common user interface displayed on the displays  associated with a first electronic device  and a second electronic device  may be oriented based on the relative orientation of the electronic devices . For example, in at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode modules may identify a side of the display  of the first electronic device  and a side of the display  of the second electronic device  which are closer together than any other sides of the display  of the first electronic device  are to any other sides of the display  of the second electronic device . That is, the closest sides of the display  of the first electronic device  and the display  of the second electronic device  are identified. In at least some example embodiments, the common user interface is displayed to span these closest sides.","The specific method of determining the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may depend on the trigger conditions used in . For example, in at least some example embodiments in which the trigger condition is a bumping together of the electronic devices , the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined based on the data obtained from orientation sensors  associated with the first electronic device and\/or the second electronic device. For example, where the orientation sensors  are accelerometers, the accelerometer data may be examined to determine the sides of the electronic devices  which were bumped together. The common UI mode module  may identify such sides, for example, since a bump is characterized by acceleration of an electronic device in the direction of the other electronic device. By examining the direction of the acceleration prior to (and during) the impact of the electronic devices , the common UI mode module  may determine the location of the bump.","In at least some example embodiments in which the trigger condition which permits the common UI mode is a swiping gesture the relative orientation of the electronic device may be determined based on the direction of the swiping gesture on each of the electronic devices. For example, as noted above, in at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode modules  on the electronic devices  may determine if a first swiping gesture on one of the electronic devices  has ended at or near the edge of a touch sensitive overlay of that electronic device and if a second swiping gesture on another of the electronic devices  has begun at or near the edge of the touch sensitive overlay of another of the electronic devices within a predetermined period of time after the first swiping gesture. In such example embodiments, the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined based on the direction of the swiping gestures on each of the electronic devices . For example, the common UI mode modules  may determine that the closest sides of the displays of the electronic devices are the sides where the first swiping gesture ended and where the second swiping gesture began.","As will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to , in at least some example embodiments, cameras  associated with the electronic devices  may be used in order to determine the relative orientation of those electronic devices .","In at least some example embodiments, an image may be captured on a first electronic device  and a second electronic device  at approximately the same time and the images may be analyzed by the common UI mode module  of one of more of the electronic devices  to determine the relative orientation of the first electronic device  and the second electronic device . For example, one or more common features in the images may be identified and the relative orientation of the first electronic device  and the second electronic device  may be determined based on those common features.","In at least some example embodiments, an audio based method may be used in order to determine the relative orientation of the electronic devices . Such example embodiments will be discussed in greater detail below with reference to . More particularly, in at least some example embodiments, a sound may be sequentially emitted from a first speaker  of an electronic device followed by a second speaker  of the same electronic device . Each of the sounds may be received at a microphone  of another electronic device . The relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined based on these sounds. More particularly, information related to the sounds may be used in order to approximate the distance of the first speaker  relative to the microphone  and the distance of the second speaker  relative to the microphone. From this information, the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined.","At , the electronic devices  may enter a common UI mode. In the common UI mode, resources associated with the first electronic device  are shared with resources associated with a second electronic device . More particularly, in at least some example embodiments, in the common UI mode, display resources associated with the electronic devices  may be pooled. In at least some example embodiments, in the common UI mode, a display  associated with a first electronic device  and a display  associated with a second electronic device  operate cooperatively. In at least some example embodiments, when in the common UI mode, the orientation of a common user interface displayed on the displays is determined in accordance with the relative orientation of the electronic devices (i.e. as determined at ).","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  are configured to permit one of the first electronic device or the second electronic device to act as a primary device to control the display  of the other of the first electronic device or the second electronic device when the electronic devices are in the common UI mode. That is, in the common UI mode, one of the electronic devices  may operate as a master device (which may also be referred to as a primary device) and one of the electronic devices  may operate as a slave-like device (which may also be referred to as a secondary device). The master device may control the overall display on both the master device and the slave-like device. In at least some example embodiments, electronic devices operate autonomously (i.e. they both control their own operation using their own processor) when they are not in the common UI mode and, when in the common UI mode, at least one of the electronic devices surrenders its autonomy and allows its resources to be used by another of the electronic devices .","In at least some example embodiments, when in the common UI mode, the electronic devices  may be permitted to share input resources. That is, one or more input interface  associated with one of the electronic devices  may be used to provide input to another one of the electronic devices . For example, input may be received via a touch sensitive overlay associated with one of the electronic devices and may be transmitted to another of the electronic devices .","Common UI modes may allow for the sharing of other resources instead of or in addition to input and display resources. For example, in at least some example embodiments, software resources, such as one or more applications, may be shared on the electronic devices  when those devices are in the common UI mode. Similarly, in at least some example embodiments, speaker resources (such as the speakers  of the electronic devices ) may be shared in the common UI mode. Such example embodiments may permit the electronic devices to collectively provide audio through a greater number of speakers than any one of the electronic devices could individually provide. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the speaker resources of the electronic devices  may be pooled so that the electronic devices  are capable of playing audio with a greater number of channels than any one of the electronic devices could individually provide.","In at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  may be configured to provide a plurality of common UI modes. In such example embodiments, the specific common UI mode which is provided may depend, at least in part, upon the orientation of the electronic devices . For example, in at least some example embodiments, if both electronic devices  are oriented in an orientation which is associated with a docking or support accessory (see, for example, ), then the common UI mode which is provided may be different than the common UI mode which will be provided if both electronic devices  are oriented in a tabletop orientation (see, for example, ). In such example embodiments, the common UI mode module  of one or more of the electronic devices  may be configured to determine the absolute orientations of the electronic devices (i.e. the orientation of the electronic devices  relative to gravity) and to select the common UI mode based on these orientations. In at least some example embodiments, if the electronic devices  are oriented in an orientation associated with a docking or support accessory, the electronic devices  may enter a common user interface mode which is a desktop phone mode in which one of the electronic devices acts as a handset (which may display numbers) and the other of the electronic devices acts as a display (which may display other information, such as weather, applications, appointments, emails, etc).","In at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode which is provided may be an extended desktop mode in which a user interface generated by one of the first electronic device or the second electronic device is spanned to include the display of both the first electronic device and the second electronic device.","In at least some of the common UI modes, it may be useful to select one of the electronic devices  as a primary or master device and another of the electronic devices  as a slave-like or secondary device. In such example embodiments, the common UI mode module  of one or more of the electronic devices  may be configured to make this selection based on one or more predetermined rules. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the common UI mode module(s)  may determine which of the electronic devices  has better processing capabilities and may select that electronic device  as the primary\/master device and may select the other of the electronic devices  as the secondary\/slave-like device.","In at least some example embodiments, the primary\/master device may be selected based on user input received through one or more of the electronic devices .

In the example embodiment illustrated, both of the electronic devices  are bumped together. The bumping of the electronic devices  is characterized by movement of one or more of the electronic devices  towards another of the electronic devices, followed by a period of abrupt deceleration of the electronic devices at the point when the electronic devices impact one another.

That is, the second electronic device  may determine the time at which the sound emitted from the first speaker  was received at the microphone  of the second electronic device  and the time at which the sound emitted from the second speaker  was received at the microphone  of the second electronic device .","Based on these times, one of the electronic devices  (such as the second electronic device ) may determine the elapsed times. That is, an electronic device  may determine the elapsed time between when the sound was emitted by the first speaker  of the first electronic device  and when that sound was received at the microphone  of the second electronic device  based on the first timing information and the time at which the sound emitted from the first speaker was received at the microphone of the second electronic device. An electronic device may also determine the elapsed time between when the sound was emitted by the second speaker of the first electronic device and when that sound was received at the microphone of the second electronic device based on the second timing information and the time at which the sound emitted from the second speaker was received at the microphone of the second electronic device.","In at least some example embodiments, in order to ensure the accuracy of the elapsed times, the electronic devices  may share clock synchronization information with one another. The clock synchronization information specifies the degree to which the internal clocks on each of the electronic devices represent the same time.","In at least some example embodiments, at , the second electronic device  may calculate transformation information, such as a translation vector or matrix and\/or a rotation matrix, specifying the relative orientation of the first electronic device  and the second electronic device .","In at least some example embodiments, at , the second electronic device  may identify the nearest edges (i.e. sides) of the display of the first electronic device  and the display of the second electronic device .","After the relative orientation of the electronic devices is determined, at , the second electronic device  may enter a common UI mode with the first electronic device . In the common UI mode, the display  associated with the first electronic device  and the display  associated with the second electronic device  may operate cooperatively. In the common UI mode, the orientation of a user interface displayed on the displays is determined in accordance with the relative orientation determined at .","For example, in at least some example embodiments, at  a side of each of the first electronic device  and the second electronic device  may be selected as a shared side based on the first image and the second image. The user interface displayed on the displays of the first electronic device  and the second electronic device  may be oriented based on the shared side.  is discussed in greater detail above with reference to .","In at least some example embodiments, the method  of  may only be performed if the electronic devices are oriented along a common plane. That is, one or more of the electronic devices may be configured to determine, from first orientation data from an orientation sensor associated with the first electronic device and second orientation data from an orientation sensor associated with the second electronic device, if the first electronic device and the second electronic device are oriented along a common plane. If the first electronic device and the second electronic device are oriented along a common plane, the electronic devices may be configured to cause the first electronic device to emit the sounds from the first speaker and the second speaker. That is, the method  may be executed if it is determined that the electronic devices are oriented along a common plane.","Where both of the electronic devices  include two or more speakers  and a microphone , one of the electronic devices  may be selected to act as the first electronic device (i.e. the device playing the sound) and another of the electronic devices may be selected to act as the second electronic device (i.e. the device receiving the sound). In some example embodiments, the electronic devices may determine which electronic device will emit the sounds and which will receive the sounds based on one or more predetermined rules. For example, in at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  are configured to determine which of the electronic devices has a larger speaker  separation and to select that electronic device  to act as the first electronic device (i.e. to emit sounds) and to select the other electronic device to act as the second electronic device (i.e. to receive sounds). Emitting the sounds through the speakers  of the electronic device  having the largest speaker  separation may facilitate the relative orientation analysis.","Furthermore, in at least some example embodiments, in order to ensure the reliability of the relative orientation analysis, the sounds emitted by the first speaker  and the second speaker  may have predetermined sound signatures. In such example embodiments, the second electronic device  may be configured to analyze received sounds to authenticate the sound signatures of received sounds. That is, the second electronic device may be configured to analyze the sounds to ensure that the sounds are of the type which are used to determine relative orientation of the electronic devices. Such an analysis may reduce the likelihood that ambient sounds may affect the analysis. The second electronic device may be configured to ignore sounds which are not authenticated (i.e. sounds which do not have the predetermined sound signature).","To further increase the accuracy of the method , in at least some example embodiments, the electronic devices  are configured to ensure that the electronic devices  were not re-oriented between the time when the sound was emitted from the first speaker  of the first electronic device  and the time when the sound was emitted from the second speaker  of the first electronic device . Reorientations of the electronic devices during this time may affect the accuracy of the analysis. In at least some example embodiments, orientation sensors  associated with the electronic devices  may be monitored by the electronic devices  to ensure that no reorientation of the electronic devices  occurred during this time.","Determining the relative orientation using two speakers on one electronic device and a microphone on another electronic device  may result in some ambiguity in the determined relative orientation. That is, in some cases, the electronic devices  may be able to determine two or more possible relative orientations which the electronic devices  may be in, but may be unable to determine which of the two or more relative orientations the electronic devices are actually in. In at least some such example embodiments, the ambiguity may be resolved, in whole or in part, using one or more orientation sensors  associated with one or more of the electronic devices .","In other example embodiments, in order to resolve the ambiguity, a greater number of speakers and\/or a greater number of microphones may be used. Accordingly, while the example embodiment described above discussed an example in which two speakers  on one electronic device  and a microphone  on another electronic device  are used in order to find the relative orientation of the electronic devices , in other example embodiments a different arrangement of speakers and\/or microphones may be used in order to determine the relative orientation of the electronic devices . For example, in at least some example embodiments, the second electronic device may include two or more microphones . In such example embodiments, a sound emitted by a speaker on the first electronic device  may be received at each of the microphones  of the second electronic device . The use of two microphones on one electronic device  allows the distance from each of those microphones to the speaker on the first electronic device  to be determined (e.g. based on the elapsed time for the sound to reach each microphone or the loss in amplitudes in the sound at each microphone). Based on those distances, the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined.","Similarly, in some example embodiments, the second electronic device may include three microphones. In such example embodiments, a sound emitted by a speaker of the first electronic device  may be received at each of the three microphones  of the second electronic device . This permits the distance from each of the microphones to the speaker of the first electronic device  to be determined (e.g. based on the elapsed time for the sound to reach each microphone or the loss in amplitudes in the sound at each microphone). Based on those distances, the relative orientation of the electronic devices  may be determined. In some example embodiments, three microphones and two speakers may be used in order to provide the orientation of the electronic devices  in a three dimensional space. For example, in some example embodiments, three microphones on one of the electronic devices receive sounds transmitted from two speakers on another one of the electronic devices. The relative orientation of the electronic devices in a three dimensional space may be determined based on the sounds received at each of the three microphones.","In some example embodiments in which the second electronic device  has two or more microphones , the first electronic device  may have two or more speakers . In such example embodiments, two or more of the speakers of the first electronic device may sequentially emit a sound (i.e. a first speaker may emit a first sound and, when finished, a second speaker may emit a second sound). The sounds may be received at each of the microphones  of the second electronic device  and distances between each speaker and microphone pair may be calculated and used to determine the relative orientation between the electronic devices.","Furthermore, in at least some example embodiments, each of the electronic devices  may be equipped with one or more speaker and one or more microphone. In such example embodiments, the electronic devices  may take turns emitting sounds. Each sound, once emitted, may be received at the other device's microphone. Distances between the speaker and microphone may be calculated and used to determine the relative orientation between the electronic devices. Accordingly, in at least some example embodiments, a second electronic device  may be configured to both receive a sound emitted from another electronic device and to emit a sound which is received at another electronic device.","In at least some of the example embodiments described above, sounds may be emitted on only one speaker at a time. That is, in order to determine the relative orientation of electronic devices , when sounds are emitted for the purpose of determining the relative orientation, they are emitted on only one speaker at a time. While one speaker is emitting a sound, any other speakers on that electronic device  and\/or on another connected electronic device  are silent.","In at least some of the example embodiments described above, more than one speaker may emit a sound at a given time. In at least some such example embodiments, the sounds may be emitted with differing pitches or properties which permit speakers to separate the sounds from one another in order to associate a received sound with its source.","In at least some embodiments, at least some of the sounds which are emitted in the example embodiments described above may be sounds which are audible to the human ear. In at least some embodiments, at least some of the sounds which are emitted in the example embodiments described above may be sounds which are inaudible to the human ear. For example, in some example embodiments, the sounds may be ultrasonic sounds, which are sound having sound waves with a frequency above the upper limit of human hearing.","While the present disclosure is primarily described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the present disclosure is also directed to various apparatus such as a handheld electronic device including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner.
