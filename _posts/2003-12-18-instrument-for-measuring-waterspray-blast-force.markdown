abstract: A system measures dynamic force of an impacting spray of air and water. A pitot-tube section is aligned to receive a longitudinal flow of impacting air/water spray in a laterally extending orifice. A first differential pressure transducer is coupled to the pitot-tube section for producing signals representative of velocity of the air/water spray at the orifice. A rain gage section adjacent to the pitot-tube section receives and collects volumes of water of the longitudinal flow of air/water spray through a laterally extending opening. A second pressure differential transducer is coupled to the rain gage section to produce signals representative of the volumes of water collected in the rain gage section. A computer-based control/readout module receives the velocity representative signals and water volume representative signals for indicating the magnitude of dynamic force attributed to impacting air/water spray in the opening.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to devices providing indications of dynamic force. More particularly, this invention relates to instrumentation for measuring the dynamic force imparted by water\/air spray on a landing craft air cushion (LCAC) during high-speed transit over the water.","High speed transit over water by LCACs exposes superstructure and equipment on deck to high-velocity sprays of water in the relatively fast moving air-stream. The forces created by the impacting air and water-spray acting on materials and equipment on deck can tear lines and other securing mechanisms apart, and the unsecured or loose materials and equipment can be swept over the side, can injure crewmembers, and cause significant damage to the LCAC.","If the forces created by the water\/air spray could be determined or predicted under a variety of conditions, then sufficient means for securing the equipment stored on-deck could be installed and design criteria would be available for further equipment or modifications to existing equipment. However, there are no prior known methods to measure the dynamic impact of a water\/air spray because there has been no way to determine the relative percentages of the two densities. Prior studies regarding loading on an underway LCAC assumed the loading created by wind only, and the studies did not take into account the fact that a significant majority of the dynamically impacting flow was comprised of water which has a density around 1,000 times that of air. When a soft-topped vehicle such as an LCAC is hit with 50 to 100 mph spray, the percentage of water content plays a significant part in the loading experienced by the structure and is too great to be ignored.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for instrumentation for measuring the dynamic force imparted by water\/air spray on an LCAC during high-speed transit over the water.","An object of the invention is to provide a system to determine dynamic loading on a high speed marine vessel such as an LCAC.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system for determining dynamic loading attributed to air\/water spray on a high speed marine craft.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system to determine dynamic loading attributed to air\/water spray for predicting fuel consumption and range of a high speed marine craft.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system to determine dynamic loading including destabilizing levels of dynamic loading attributed to air\/water spray on equipment and superstructure extending above the deck on a high speed marine craft.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system to determine dynamic loading attributed to air\/water spray on equipment and superstructure in virtually real-time to apprise personnel of dangerous conditions of exposure on deck of a high speed marine craft.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system to determine dynamic loading attributed to air\/water spray in virtually real-time on a high speed marine craft during changing ambient conditions.","Another object of the invention is to provide a system to determine the loading imparted by heavy weather, such as hurricanes and thunderstorms, on buildings, tents, windows, piers, marine vessels, and other structures and vehicles.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Accordingly, the present invention is to create a system for measuring dynamic force created by a combination of impacting flowing air and water spray. A pitot-tube section is aligned to receive a longitudinal flow of impacting air\/water spray in a laterally extending orifice. A first differential pressure transducer is coupled to the pitot-tube section for producing signals representative of velocity of the air\/water spray at the orifice. A rain gage section adjacent to the pitot-tube section receives and collects volumes of water of the longitudinal flow of air\/water spray through a laterally extending opening. A second pressure differential transducer is coupled to the rain gage section to produce signals representative of the volumes of water collected in the rain gage section. A computer-based control\/readout module receives the velocity representative signals and water volume representative signals for indicating the magnitude of dynamic force attributed to impacting air\/water spray in the opening. The pitot-tube section has orthogonally interconnected first and second lengths of rigid tubing, and the rain gage section has orthogonally interconnected horizontal and vertical capture tubes. The first rigid tubing is aligned with the longitudinal flow of the air\/water spray to face the orifice laterally extending across the longitudinal flow of the air\/water spray. The first differential pressure transducer is coupled to the second rigid tubing for producing the velocity representative signals. The horizontal capture tube is aligned with the longitudinal flow of the air\/water spray to face the opening laterally extending across the longitudinal flow of the air\/water spray to receive and collect water of the air\/water spray. The second pressure differential transducer is coupled to the vertical capture tube for producing the water volume representative signals. The first pressure differential transducer produces the velocity representative signals corresponding to pressure at the orifice, and the second pressure differential transducer produces the water volume representative signals corresponding to pressure in the vertical pressure tube.","Referring to the FIGURE, measuring system  of the invention provides an indication of the dynamic impacting forces created by a combination of flowing air and water spray. This information is useful in the design and operation of high speed marine craft, such as landing craft air-cushion (LCAC) since they create dynamic loading that must be considered when determining fuel consumption, dynamic stability, and reliable securing of equipment on the LCAC deck.","Measuring system  has a pitot-tube section  in combination with a rain-gage section  to measure velocity of and percentage or amount of water  in impacting spray (shown as arrows ), respectively. Air\/water spray  can be attributed to any number of factors associated with high speed propulsion of watercraft such as LCACs in different sea states and wind conditions or other sources of spray such as wind-driven rain. Air\/water spray  can be regarded as an essentially horizontally directed dynamic flow over the deck that can impact superstructure and equipment to create unwanted dynamic loadings and significantly decrease efficiency.","Pitot-tube section  is made in accordance with well known designs of such instrumentation that measure the total static and dynamic pressures in an air stream to indicate the velocity of the stream of air\/water spray . Pitot-tube section  has a first length of rigid tubing  aligned with flowing air\/water spray  and receives air\/water spray  through an orifice  that laterally extends across and faces into the path of incoming air\/water spray  to receive air\/water spray . First rigid tubing  is connected to a second length of rigid tubing  that orthogonally extends in a right angle from first tubing  to an open end .","First and second tubing  and  can be made in different lengths from any one of a number of rigid metal or plastic-like materials that are rugged and non-corrosive to bear up in the harsh marine environment. First and second tubing  and  can have outer diameters in the neighborhood of about five sixteenth inches and inner diameters of about one eighth inches. A typical commercially available stainless steel pitot tube structure that could be used for pitot-tube section  could be one of the 160 Series manufactured by Dwyer Instruments Inc., 102 Indiana Highway 212, Michigan City, Ind. 46361-0373.","A length of flexible tubing  is fitted over open end  of second tubing  and extends to a first part  of a T-shaped hollow fitting  having another length of flexible tubing  connected to an air differential pressure transducer  at one inlet . Air differential pressure transducer  has another inlet  connected to another length of flexible tubing  joined to a static port tube that extends to receive static or ambient pressure  at a static port  in static port portion  adjacent to second tubing  of pitot-tube section . T-shaped hollow fitting  has a third part  connected to another length of flexible tubing  that is connected to a tube-like coupling  of a water differential pressure transducer .","Rain gage section  has a vertical spray capture tube  closed at its lower end and orthogonally extending at its opposite end through a right angle transition into a horizontal portion to receive and collect water of spray . The horizontal portion of spray capture tube  of rain gage section  extends along side of and is parallel to second rigid tubing  of pitot-tube section . Water differential pressure transducer  is mounted on spray capture tube  and has a tube-like coupling inlet  extending into a reservoir  in spray capture tube . The horizontal portion of spray capture tube  can have an inner radius of about 0.975 inches, for example, and has a coextensive opening  at its end that laterally extends across and faces the path of longitudinal flow of impacting air\/water spray . Second length of rigid tubing  of pitot-tube section  can be connected to vertical spray capture tube  of rain gage section  to assure that opening  is positioned to be essentially next to and along side of orifice  and laterally extends across and faces the longitudinal path of incoming air\/water spray  to receive and collect water spray  through it.","Air differential pressure transducer  could be a precision manometer and air pressure gage that are also manufactured by Dwyer Instruments Inc. and appropriately connected to pitot-tube section . Another commercially available manometer or differential pressure sensor for air differential pressure transducer  could be one of the PX-26 series of wet\/wet differential pressure sensors manufactured by Omega Engineering Inc., One Omega Drive, Stamford, Conn. 06907-1660. Transducer  generates a signal (shown as arrow ) that is representative of (or corresponds to) the velocity of spray  and is based on the pressure differential between the pressure of spray  at orifice  of rigid tubing  and ambient or static pressure  at static port . The pressure of spray  at orifice  is virtually the same as the pressure sensed at open end  of rigid tubing . Transducer  couples representative signal  to a computer-based control\/readout module  having a general purpose computer A for further processing and\/or visual indication of velocity of spray  on a visual readout , such as a monitor screen.","Water differential pressure transducer  could be one of the PX-26 series of wet\/wet differential pressure sensors manufactured by Omega Engineering Inc. Water differential pressure transducer  generates a signal (shown as arrow ) that is representative of (or corresponds to) the amount or volume of water  in reservoir  in spray capture tube . Signal  is based on the pressure differential between the pressure of water  at tube-like coupling  of transducer  and the pressure of spray  at open end  of rigid tubing . Transducer  couples signal  to computer A of computer-based control\/readout module  for further processing and\/or a visual indication on readout  that shows the amount of water  captured during a predetermined period in capture tube .","A first purge valve mechanism  is mounted on vertical spray capture tube  to selectively purge the amount of water  that has been accumulated in reservoir . Purge valve mechanism  is connected to computer-based control\/readout module  to be actuated by a control signal (shown as arrow ) from module  to initiate purging of water  to ambient and can include a small pump  if desired to speed up the purging process. Control signal  can be produced periodically by module  after one or more predetermined sampling periods have elapsed or at the beginning of a new sampling sequence.","A second purge valve mechanism  can be mounted on a sump  at the bottom of second length of rigid tubing  to selectively purge any water of spray  that may have accumulated in tubing  and\/or second tubing  during a sampling period. Second purge valve mechanism  is connected to module  for actuation by a control signal (shown as arrow ) to initiate purging into the ambient and can include a small pump  to speed up purging of sump . Control signal  can be produced periodically by module  to clear sump  after each or a number of sampling periods for determining velocities have elapsed, or to clear sump  at the beginning of a new sampling sequence.","From the measurements of velocity in pitot-tube section  and of volume of water in rain gage section , system  of the invention can provide readings representative of dynamic loadings of the high speed craft such as an LCAC at different speeds in different ambient conditions. System  can be securely mounted on the exposed deck of an LCAC where dynamic loadings attributed to fast moving air\/water spray  are likely to be problematical, i.e., where the fast moving spray  would impact superstructure and equipment above deck level. First rigid tube  of pitot-tube section  and the horizontal section of spray capture tube  of rain gage section  are aligned with the direction of impacting air\/water spray  to respectively orient orifice  and opening  to laterally extend to face across the path or flow of impacting air\/water spray .","Pitot-tube section  allows transducer  to measure the differential air pressure between the dynamic pressure at orifice  at open end  of second tube  and static, ambient pressure  at static port . Transducer  provides a signal  representative of the velocity V of the medium (impacting air\/water spray ) and connects this signal to module . An assumption will be made that the water component of air\/water spray  is traveling at the same velocity as the air component. In time, water collected in pitot-tube section  may clog second rigid tubing  and\/or flexible tubing , but this possibility will be evident from the readings at module ; however, before this happens, the interconnected sump  can be drained via an appropriate control signal  to second pump valve mechanism . The velocity V of impacting air\/water spray  can be determined for each second or periodically as often as desired and averaged if desired in computer-based control\/readout module .","When the velocity V of impacting air\/water spray  is determined, rain gage section  can help provide other information needed to determine the amount of the dynamic impacting force attributed to air\/water spray . The dynamic force experienced by an object in the flow field is:\n\nF=\u00bd\u03c1V\n\nHowever, the density \u03c1 in the equation is the density of the medium of air\/water spray  which the above-deck structure and equipment of the LCAC is exposed to. The densities of the constituents are: \u03c1=0.002377 slugs\/ft, \u03c1=2 slugs\/ft, and \u03c1=1.94 slugs\/ft.\n","The dynamic force experienced would be:\n\n\u00bd=\u00bd (%*\u03c1+%*\u03c1), \n\nwhere \u03c1=the density of sea water (2 slugs\/ft) and \u03c1=the density of air (0.002377 slugs\/ft) in a salt water environment.\n","Determination of the relative percentages can be provided in computer-based control\/readout  coupled to receive signals  representative of the volume of water  that has accumulated in rain gage section . Since opening  of spray capture tube  can have a known diameter of about 0.975 inches, for example, the area of opening =\u03c0r=\u03c0(0.975)=2.9865 in. So, if the velocity of the flow is V and is known, the data representative of successive accumulated amounts of water  of air\/water spray  in reservoir  can be recorded every second. Accordingly, for each second, rain gage section  will have \u201ccaptured\u201d a volume of water spray V:\n\n(in inches\/sec)*1sec*2.9865 in=2.9865V in. \n\nDuring each second that Vis captured, water differential pressure gage  at the bottom of vertical spray capture tube  would have seen or indicated (via representative signals ) a change \u0394 in the height h of water  inside of vertical spray capture tube . The quantity \u0394h would have been indicated as a change \u0394 of pressure P, (\u0394P) from water differential pressure gage . The \u201ccapturing intervals\u201d can vary from the exemplary one second to other durations as needed for determinations of acceptable reliability of relative air\/water determinations for air\/water spray .\n","If, for example, the inside radius of the PVC tube of vertical spray capture tube  is 0.796 inches, the cross sectional area is 1.9906 in. During the one second capture period, then, the volume of water actually collected Vwould be 1.9906*\u25a1h in.","The percentage of water in the flow would then be:\n\n%=V\/V, or \n\n%=1.9906 \u0394h in\/2.9865 V in\n\nwhere \u0394h is provided by water differential pressure transducer  at the bottom of vertical spray capture tube  of rain gage section , and V (velocity of air\/water spray ) is provided by the air differential pressure transducer  connected to second rigid tubing  of pitot-tube section .\n","The percentage of air in air\/water spray  would simply be that portion of spray  that isn't water, i.e.:\n\n100%\u2212%water=%. \n","Therefore, the dynamic force Facross the area of opening  of rain gage section  would be given by:\n\nF=\u00bd\u03c1V={fraction (\/)}(%*\u03c1+%*\u03c1)V\n\nand inserting the values for \u03c1 gives:\n\nF\u00bd (%*2slugs\/ft+%*0.002377 slugs\/ft )V. \n\nFilling in the values for the two percentages will provide complete information for solution of the equation for the area of opening . Next, by simply multiplying the value obtained for Ftimes the total area of the LCAC that is exposed above-deck to impacting air\/water spray  (including superstructure and on deck equipment), a realistic value for the total dynamic loading for the LCAC can be arrived at.\n","The capability for computing this total dynamic loading could be provided by computer-based control\/readout module  to give accurate real-time predictions regarding deck loading conditions of equipment on the LCAC during changing ambient conditions, for example, to a real-time loading solution. In accordance with well known programming skills by one of ordinary skill in the art, a general purpose computer A of module  can be programmed to receive and appropriately process data representative of the dimensions of orifice  of pitot-tube section  and the inside radius of the PVC tube of vertical spray capture tube  of rain gage section . In accordance with well known programming skills by one of ordinary skill in the art, computer A of module  can be programmed to receive and appropriately process data representative of the magnitudes of signals  representative of velocity V of impacting air\/water spray  in pitot-tube section  and signals  representative of volume and\/or height (\u25a1h) of water  in rain gage section . In accordance with well known programming skills by one of ordinary skill in the art, computer A of module  can be programmed to compute the quantities of F, V, V, %, %, and Fof the equations, supra.","Another useful application of dynamic force measuring system  would be to predict potentially destabilizing effects of carrying some bulky items of equipment such as a radar dome and its associated support modules, for example, on the LCAC. Since these items can create a large area high above the deck that would be reactive to air\/water spray , system  can be mounted on a framework at a location above the deck that corresponds to where the dome and modules might be secured. After simulating the potential dynamic loading by system , operators of the LCAC are more realistically apprised of the potential dangers involved to enable a more informed decision re the transport of such bulky items. Having the teachings of this invention in mind, modifications and alternate embodiments of dynamic force measuring system  may be adapted without departing from the scope of the invention. Its uncomplicated, compact design that incorporates structures long proven to operate successfully lends itself to numerous modifications to permit its reliable use in hostile and demanding marine environments. Dynamic force measuring system  can be made larger or smaller in different shapes and fabricated from a wide variety of materials to assure resistance to corrosion and long term reliable operation under a multitude of different operational conditions and requirements.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Dynamic force measuring system  provides a multipurpose and capable means of rapidly determining dynamic loading of structures above deck and exposed to air\/water spray  on high speed marine craft. Therefore, dynamic force measuring system , as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":"The FIGURE is a schematic diagram of measuring system of the invention for determining dynamic forces attributed to air\/water spray on equipment and superstructure on high speed marine craft like LCACs."},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
