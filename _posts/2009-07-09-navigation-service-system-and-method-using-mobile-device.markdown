Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to mobile device technology. More particularly, the present invention relates to a navigation service system and method using a mobile device equipped with a navigation widget.","2. Description of the Related Art","A mobile device, also known as a portable device, a handheld device and the like, is a pocket-sized computing device typically having a display screen with touch input or a miniature keyboard (often referred to as a keypad). Many different types of mobile devices, such as a mobile communication device, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and a smart phone, are widely used today. Such mobile devices not only provide a voice call, a video call, and a Short Message Service (SMS), but also offer a variety of useful applications (e.g., a schedule manager, games and the like). More particularly, some recently launched portable devices have a navigation function that provides travel or traffic guide path based on location information.","A conventional navigation service system using a mobile device has an embedded map that has already been stored in the device. Therefore, when a navigation service is activated, the mobile device retrieves map data in connection with current location information from its own storage and displays retrieved map data on a screen.","The quantity of such map data is large, so the mobile device needs a large storage capacity to store the map data. Also, since map data should be updated frequently to reflect the newest data, a user often suffers great inconvenience in use. In addition, in order to use a navigation service system in foreign countries, a user has to additionally download map data related to those countries.","Furthermore, a conventional navigation service system uses limited map data provided by a navigation service provider or a mobile device manufacturer. Therefore, a user is restricted in selection of map data and has difficulty in reflecting desired map data to a navigation service system.","Moreover, a navigation program used in a conventional navigation service system has a slower loading time because of its large size and requires a large amount of resource for running.","Therefore, a need exists for an improved navigation service technology that requires no embedded map, allows a user to reflect desired map data, and reduces a loading time.","An aspect of the present invention is to address at least the above-mentioned problems and\/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a navigation service system and a navigation service method using a mobile device.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a navigation service system is provided. The system includes a mobile device, and a web server for communicating with the mobile device, the mobile device includes a display unit for displaying at least one navigation widget icon, a wireless communication unit for executing wireless communications with the web server, a Global Positioning System (GPS) module for receiving location information of the mobile device, a memory unit for storing a navigation widget, and a navigation widget controller for controlling the wireless communication unit to transmit the location information of the mobile device to the web server, for controlling the wireless communication unit to receive map data related to the location information from the web server, and for controlling the display unit to display the map data and the location information.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a navigation service method using a mobile device which includes a GPS module, a navigation widget controller, a wireless communication unit and a display unit is provided. The method includes receiving location information of the mobile device through the GPS module controlled by the navigation widget controller, transmitting the location information to a web server through the wireless communication unit controlled by the navigation widget controller, receiving map data related to the location information from the web server through the wireless communication unit controlled by the navigation widget controller, and displaying the map data and the location information on the display unit controlled by the navigation widget controller.","Other aspects, advantages, and salient features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses exemplary embodiments of the invention.","Throughout the drawings, it should be noted that like reference numbers are used to depict the same or similar elements, features and structures.","The following description with reference to the accompanying drawings is provided to assist in a comprehensive understanding of exemplary embodiments of the invention as defined by the claims and their equivalents. It includes various specific details to assist in that understanding but these are to be regarded as merely exemplary. Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness.","The terms and words used in the following description and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but, are merely used by the inventor to enable a clear and consistent understanding of the invention. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","It is to be understood that the singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca component surface\u201d includes reference to one or more of such surfaces.","In exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a widget denotes a customized application that allows a user to edit a standby screen with mainly used contents and to directly activate desired services (e.g., a clock, weather, a search, a calendar, a schedule, stock and the like) without accessing related web sites. Depending on types and features of target services, a widget may be formed in a variety of manners, such as a Java Script, an Extensible Markup Language (XML), or an Open Application Programming Interface (API). Since the widget may be activated in a standby screen, the widget has an advantage of a faster loading time over typical applications.","In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a navigation widget denotes a specific widget configured suitably for a navigation service. A navigation widget may be formed by using the Open API related to map data that a web server provides. Also, a navigation widget may include instructions for a wireless communication unit in a mobile device to receive a list of candidate destinations and related map data from a web server. A navigation widget may further include instructions for a Global Positioning System (GPS) module in a mobile device to receive location information of the device from a GPS satellite. A navigation widget may still further include instructions for a display unit in a mobile device to display a location of the device on a map. A navigation widget may be redesigned to reflect a user's desired map to a navigation service system.","In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a navigation widget controller may be included in a control unit of a mobile device and performs control functions for entire operations, e.g., activation of a navigation widget, of a navigation service system. A navigation widget controller controls a wireless communication unit to transmit location information of a mobile device to a web server and to receive map data in response to location information from a web server. A navigation widget controller then controls a display unit to display a device location on a map. Additionally, a navigation widget controller controls a wireless communication unit to transmit a destination search keyword to a web server, to receive a list of candidate destinations in response to a destination search keyword from a web server, to transmit a selected destination in a list to a web server, and to receive map data in response to a selected destination. Also, a navigation widget controller controls a display unit to display a device location on a map.","In the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a navigation widget icon denotes a graphical object arranged in a standby screen to allow execution of a navigation service system. That is, by touching a navigation widget icon (if a mobile device has a touch screen) or selecting a navigation widget icon through key input (if a mobile device has a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)), a user may execute a navigation service system. If a navigation widget is embedded in a mobile device, a navigation widget icon may appear in a standby screen through a user's menu selection. If a navigation widget is downloaded from a web server, a navigation widget icon may appear in a standby screen automatically or through a user's menu selection.","The GPS, also known as a global navigation satellite system, is often used for navigation purposes. The GPS uses a constellation of satellites that transmit precise microwave signals, which allow GPS receivers to determine their current location. In an exemplary implementation, a GPS module in a mobile device has a GPS receiver communicating with GPS satellites to track the current location of the device.","The Open API denotes a user-friendly open interface that web service providers open access ways to the public for specific functions or content services. While a traditional API denotes languages or messages used for communication between an Operating System (OS) and applications, the Open API denotes languages or messages used for communication between web servers. As new programs are developed by using API, it is also possible to develop new services by using the Open API. A number of web servers (e.g., GOOGLE, EBAY, YAHOO, NAVER and the like) currently provide a variety of the Open APIs, and also some web servers offer the Open API related to map data. In an exemplary implementation, a mobile device may utilize destination data and map data, stored in a web server, by using the Open API that a web server provides. Additionally, a user may redesign a navigation widget by using suitable Open APIs various web servers provide.","A web server is a server that provides web pages (i.e., HyperText Markup Language (HTML) files). A web server has a specific domain name and may be equipped with a web server program capable of serving web pages using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In an exemplary implementation, a web server provides map data and a list of candidate destinations to a mobile device.
