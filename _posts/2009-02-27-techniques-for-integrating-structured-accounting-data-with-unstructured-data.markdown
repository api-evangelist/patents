title: Techniques for integrating structured accounting data with unstructured data
abstract: Various technologies and techniques are disclosed for integrating structured accounting data with unstructured data. From an application that manages structured accounting data related to an entity, a user selection is received to create a document container for a collaboration tool. The document container is used for storing unstructured data related to the entity. In response to the selection of the create option, a site creation service is launched for automatically creating the document container using settings previously specified by an administrator on a configuration screen of the application. Once the document container is created, unstructured data related to the entity is stored in the document container. The user can view and navigate between the structured accounting data and unstructured data without having to leave the application. Unstructured data is automatically published to the document container for the entity as users interact with the application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Companies or individuals often use an accounting or similar type of application for tracking financial and related data for an entity, such as for projects, customers, vendors, etc. Such accounting applications typically store entity information in a structured format, such as in one or more relational databases. By storing the data in a structured format, the data can be organized and analyzed in additional ways that are typically not available with unstructured data.","In some instances, a large amount of unstructured data also gets created for a particular entity in documents that reside on web sites, file servers, or other locations. Examples of such unstructured documents include detailed project specifications, web pages related to a project, a letter that was sent to a customer, and so on. Since the accounting applications do not handle this unstructured data, users have to separately track the unstructured data on their own so they can find it when they need to. In doing so, the user may have to switch between different types of applications to review the various data related to an entity, if the user is fortunate enough to even know where to find the data that exists outside of the accounting application.","Various technologies and techniques are disclosed for integrating structured accounting data with unstructured data. From an application that manages structured accounting data related to an entity, a user selection is received to create a document container for a collaboration tool. The document container is used for storing unstructured data related to the entity. In response to the selection of a create option, a site creation service is launched for automatically creating the document container using settings previously specified by an administrator on a configuration screen of the application. Once the document container is created, unstructured data related to the entity is stored in the document container. The user can view and navigate among the structured accounting data and unstructured data without having to leave the application. Unstructured data is automatically published to the document container for the entity as users interact with the application.","In one implementation, a method for enabling a user to navigate between structured accounting data and unstructured data is described. A data record is displayed for a selected entity within an application for managing structured accounting data. A related documents option is displayed, that when selected, enables a user to view one or more unstructured documents for the selected entity that are stored in a document container of a collaboration tool that has been integrated with the application.","In another implementation, a method for automatically publishing unstructured data to a document container for an entity is described. As one or more users interact with an application that manages structured accounting data for an entity, unstructured data is automatically published to a document container that is contained in a collaboration tool that has been integrated with the application. The unstructured data is automatically published based upon one or more rules that were specified for the document container. One or more of the users can access the unstructured data in the document container from within the application.","This Summary was provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.","The technologies and techniques herein may be described in the general context as an application that integrates structured accounting data with unstructured data, but the technologies and techniques also serve other purposes in addition to these. In one implementation, one or more of the techniques described herein can be implemented as features within accounting program such as MICROSOFT\u00ae Dynamics SL, MICROSOFT\u00ae Office Small Business Accounting, or from any other type of program or service that manages accounting and\/or related data of one or more entities.","In one implementation, techniques are described for integrating an accounting application having structured data with unstructured data that is related to the entities being managed in the accounting application. The term \u201caccounting application\u201d as used herein is meant to include an application that manages financial accounting, project accounting, tasks, and\/or other data for one or more entities. The term \u201centity\u201d as used herein is meant to include a customer, vendor, account, project, or other company, individual, or concept whose data is being tracked. A collaboration tool with one or more document libraries is used to store unstructured data related to the entities in the accounting application.","In one implementation, the collaboration tool and\/or document libraries can easily be created from the accounting application, such as by a single mouse click. Unstructured data that is created within the accounting application can be automatically or manually stored in the document container of the collaboration tool. Alternatively or additionally, users can view the unstructured data from within the accounting application without having to open various other applications.","As shown in , a system  for integrating an accounting application with unstructured data in a collaboration tool is described. System  includes an accounting application , a portal layer , a service host , an accounting database , a collaboration tool , and a security catalog . The accounting application  has a customer maintenance module  and a project maintenance module . The customer maintenance module  is responsible for managing details about entities that are customers. The project maintenance module  is responsible for managing project-related data. The accounting application  communicates with the service host  whenever data needs created, managed, or viewed from the accounting database , collaboration tool , and\/or security catalog .","As described in further detail in , whenever a new collaboration tool and\/or document container on the collaboration tool need created, the site creation service  is called from accounting software  through web service proxy  or . The term \u201ccollaboration tool\u201d as used herein is meant to include an application that manages a data store for storing unstructured data. A non-limiting example of a collaboration tool includes a web-based document management application such as MICROSOFT\u00ae Office Sharepoint Server. The term \u201cdocument container\u201d as used herein is meant to include a segment of a collaboration tool that has been grouped together for a specific purpose, such as storing data related to a certain entity.","The site creation service  is responsible for creating new collaboration tools and\/or document libraries that can store unstructured data for the entities being tracked in the accounting application . Site creation service  utilizes a site creation business object  that interfaces with a data access API to read and write data from a database, such as collaboration tool . Site creation service  also interfaces with a collaboration tool API  to in order to create collaboration tools and document libraries (that are then stored as part of collaboration tool ).","In one implementation, site creation service  is operable to receive security settings from the accounting application  and use the security settings to automatically create the proper security roles and\/or permissions in the collaboration tool . In other words, to enable the accounting application  to easily integrate with the collaboration tool , security roles for users can be setup upon site creation (or a later time) so that interactions with the one or more document libraries of the collaboration tool  can be handled directly from the accounting application . This further facilitates the integration between the accounting application  and the collaboration tool  so users of the accounting application can view unstructured data directly from within the accounting application .","The file upload service  is responsible for uploading documents from the accounting application  to the collaboration tool , such as automatically when certain reports are generated from the accounting application . Upon receiving a file upload request from the accounting application , the file upload service  utilizes the file upload business object  to perform the upload, and uses the data access API  to then communicate with the collaboration tool  to store the uploaded data. This is described in more detail in .","In one implementation, a portal user interface  allows the collaboration portal\/database  to be accessed from a thin client application, such as a web browser.","Turning now to , the stages for implementing one or more implementations of system  are described in further detail. In some implementations, the processes of  are at least partially implemented in the operating logic of computing device  (of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["160","162","164"]},"In one implementation, information is transmitted to the site creation service about the users who have access to data for the entity in the application so that the site creation service can create access rights for the users in the document container on the collaboration tool to enable the users to also access data for the entity in the document container.","Once the document container is created, at least some unstructured data related to the entity is stored in the document container (stage ). In one implementation, a file upload service is initiated from the accounting application to store the unstructured data in the document container. In one implementation, the file upload service is initiated whenever one or more reports containing unstructured data are generated for the entity from the application and need stored in the document container. For example, the file upload service can be launched automatically whenever one or more reports are created (such as those that are setup for automatic publication to the document container in the configuration settings for the site). One or more users are able to access the document container from within the accounting application (stage ), and optionally from external applications as well. In one implementation, the user is able to access the document container with a single mouse click from the accounting application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["180","182","184"]},"Upon receiving a selection from the user to select the related documents option (stage ), the one or more unstructured documents are displayed (stage ). In one implementation, the unstructured documents are displayed within a screen of the accounting application. In another implementation, the unstructured documents are displayed by launching a screen associated with the collaboration tool. In such a scenario, the accounting application causes a separate screen from the collaboration tool to be displayed. Login credentials of the user can be provided to the collaboration tool so that the user does not have to separately log in to the collaboration tool before the screen with the unstructured documents for the selected entity is displayed.","In one implementation, a user can initially create the document container from within the accounting application, such as with a single click of a create option. Then, as users interact with the application, the unstructured documents are stored in the document container for the selected entity and enabled for display as discussed herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 6"],"b":["200","202"]},"The unstructured data is automatically published based upon one or more rules that were specified for the document container (stage ). One or more of the users are provided with access the unstructured data in the document container from within the application (stage ). One or more of the users can also be provided with access to the unstructured data in the document container from the collaboration tool or another application (stage ). In other words, while the user(s) can certainly manage the unstructured data from within the accounting application, in some implementations, the user can also add, edit, view, and\/or delete unstructured data in the document container from other applications, such as an interface associated with the document container itself or a separate application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["260","262","264"]},"When document publishing is enabled on a configuration screen for the given entity type (decision point ), but the publish document to the collaboration tool option is not enabled at the instance-level on the maintenance screen (decision point ), then the publish to collaboration tool button\/option is disabled on all quick-send-enabled screens related to the type in question (stage ). When the document publishing is enabled on a configuration screen for the given entity type (decision point ), when the publish document to the collaboration tool option is enabled at the instance-level on the maintenance screen (decision point ), when the particular document type is enabled at the global level (decision point ), and when the particular document type is enabled at the instance level (decision point ), then the publish to collaboration tool button\/option is enabled on screens that are related to this type (stage ).","Turning now to , simulated screens are shown to illustrate a user interface that shows techniques for creating and managing document libraries from accounting application . These screens can be displayed to users on output device(s)  (of ). Furthermore, these screens can receive input from users from input device(s)  (of ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["300","304","306","302","302","308","310","312","314"]},"Screen  also contains various options for specifying how the collaboration tool and\/or document container should function from the accounting application. For example, default site and library creation options  can be set to specify whether or not end users will be able to create new sites and\/or document libraries. Options can also be specified to indicate which types of documents  should be published automatically from the accounting application to the document container on the collaboration tool. In this example, accounts receivable invoices , order confirmations , and shipment confirmations  have been enabled for automatic publication to the document container. With these options enabled, any time a user creates one of these documents from the accounting application, then a copy of that document gets stored in the associated document container so that it can be retrieved and viewed later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["400","402","404","406","408","410","404"]},"As shown in , an exemplary computer system to use for implementing one or more parts of the system includes a computing device, such as computing device . In its most basic configuration, computing device  typically includes at least one processing unit  and memory . Depending on the exact configuration and type of computing device, memory  may be volatile (such as RAM), non-volatile (such as ROM, flash memory, etc.) or some combination of the two. This most basic configuration is illustrated in  by dashed line .","Additionally, device  may also have additional features\/functionality. For example, device  may also include additional storage (removable and\/or non-removable) including, but not limited to, magnetic or optical disks or tape. Such additional storage is illustrated in  by removable storage  and non-removable storage . Computer storage media includes volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.
