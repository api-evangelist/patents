{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The subject matter disclosed herein relates to medical systems. More specifically, the subject matter disclosed herein relates to methods and systems that may be employed to check the multimedia quality of a medical diagnostic system.","Medical diagnostic systems may include remote viewing systems whose displays are capable of rendering and manipulating a variety of multimedia for diagnostic display purposes. That is, the remote viewing systems are used to review images, video, waveforms (e.g., ECG, EKG), and audio that may be used for medical diagnosis. Typically, remote viewing systems include custom-built hardware. The custom-built hardware is capable of displaying and manipulating images or other media in sufficient detail that a diagnosis may be determined. However, providing custom-built hardware in order to enable remote diagnostics is very costly. An alternative, more economical approach, would use off-the-shelf hardware. However, off-the-shelf hardware such as monitors and computing devices (e.g., desktop computers, workstations, laptops, tablets, personal digital assistants, cell phones) is not standardized and may or may not have the display properties and the processing power capable of enabling remote diagnosis.","Certain embodiments commensurate in scope with the originally claimed invention are summarized below. These embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention, but rather these embodiments are intended only to provide a brief summary of possible forms of the invention. Indeed, the invention may encompass a variety of forms that may be similar to or different from the embodiments set forth below.","In a first embodiment, a method for investigating the diagnostic properties of clients includes using a client to present an image indicative of diagnostic image quality. A set of user inputs may then be collected that may be based on the presented image. The collected user inputs may then be used to determine the diagnostic suitability of the client.","In a second embodiment, a method may include using a remote client that may be communicatively connected to a remote medical server to download an image. The image may then be used to determine the suitability of the remote client for use in medical diagnosis.","In a third embodiment, a computer-readable medium including computer code may be adapted to download an image from the server and present the image to the user. The user may then give responses indicative of the image quality. The user responses may be collected and utilized by the computer code to determine the diagnostic capabilities of the client.","One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.","In the medical field, many different sources producing different types of multimedia information are available for diagnosing and treating patient conditions. X-ray radiography, computer tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, electrocardiograms (EKG), electroencephalograms (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and so forth, may be used to produce multimedia such as images, video, waveforms, audio, and others that may be used in the diagnostic process. The multimedia may be stored in electronic databases and may be accessed by remote clients. A diagnostician may use the remote clients to display and manipulate (e.g., zoom, rotate, pan, pause) the multimedia as appropriate. Off-the-shelf (OTS) clients may be used to replace custom-built remote clients, however, OTS hardware varies in its performance capabilities, and, therefore, only some OTS hardware components may be useful for diagnostic purposes. More specifically, OTS hardware that is be capable of supporting certain image resolutions, aspect ratios, live pixel counts, pixel pitch, frame rates, volume levels, grayscale differences, fine grayscale detail, varying grayscale, aspect ratios, continuity, monitor types, display response times, contrast ratios, brightness, color depths, color gamut, and\/or refresh rates may be useful for diagnosis purposes while other OTS hardware that cannot provide the desired properties may be unsuitable. Accordingly, the disclosed embodiments include systems and methods for detecting and analyzing a plurality of diagnostic properties, including the display properties and multimedia manipulation properties, of OTS clients.","OTS clients may include, for example, computer desktops, computer workstations, computer desktops, laptops, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, and so forth. Monitors may include, for example, single or multiple computer monitors, televisions, projectors, cell phone screens, PDA screens, and so forth. In one embodiment, OTS clients may be communicatively connected to a server as described in more detail with respect to  below. Software may be distributed to a remote client and used to run a plurality of component checks and question-answer sessions. The component checks may automatically test the properties of certain components such as the central processing unit (CPU), the graphics card, the graphics driver (e.g., Open GL\u00ae, Linux\u00ae framebuffer, DirectX\u00ae, ATI Radeon\u00ae), the hard drive, the monitors, and so forth.","The question-answer sessions may include the presentation of different types of multimedia, including calibration images, followed by questions designed to obtain responses that detail the level of performance of the OTS hardware (e.g., choppiness of video playback, display quality, audio fidelity, and waveform fidelity) in playing or displaying the multimedia. New questions may be derived based on the answers to previous questions. The software may then analyze the results of the various component checks and question-answer sessions by using a knowledge base. The software may then provide a summary of findings, which may include the suitability or unsuitability of the OTS client for use in medical diagnostics. In one embodiment, the analysis of the results may include the creation of performance baselines based on the component checks and\/or the question-answer sessions. In this embodiment, the performance baselines may then be compared against minimum performance baselines to determine the suitability or unsuitability of the OTS client for use in medical diagnostics.","Turning to , the figure depicts an embodiment of a medical information system  including a hospital\/scan center  and a plurality of clients . The clients  may include a combination of remote clients, i.e., clients  located outside of the hospital\/scan center , and local clients, i.e., clients  located inside of the hospital\/scan center . The clients  may include a variety of OTS hardware and operating systems from an assortment of vendors. For example, a client  may include an Apple\u00ae laptop running the Snow Leopard\u00ae operating system (OS), a Dell\u00ae workstation running the Windows Vista\u00ae OS, a Toshiba\u00ae tablet running the Windows XP Tablet PC Edition\u00ae OS, or a Hewlett-Packard\u00ae desktop running the Linux\u00ae OS. As can be appreciated, clients  may include computing platforms from any number of vendors running any number of different OSes.","In certain embodiments, the hospital\/scan center  may be communicatively connected to the clients , such as through a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless network, the internet, a dedicated line (e.g., T1, T2, T3), or a modem. Other clients  may not be communicatively connected to the hospital\/scan center  but may have software and medical images distributed to the client  through computer storage media, such as a DVDs, CDs, flash drives, USB drives, and so forth.","The hospital scan\/center  may include a scanner , which may be used to scan and store medical multimedia in a data repository . In certain embodiments, the scanner  may include an MRI, a CT scanner, an X-ray radiography system, a PET scanner, an ultrasound scanner, a tomosynthesis system, and others. Medical multimedia may be generated by the scanner  and\/or by other devices such as a camera, a video recorder, an audio recorder, and\/or a waveform recorder (e.g., electrocardiogram monitor, blood pressure monitor, electroencephalogram monitor), and stored in the data repository . The data repository  may include a database  and a server . The database  may store a plurality of files having a variety of multimedia file formats including images (e.g., \u201cDICOM\u201d, \u201cHL7\u201d, \u201cIEEE 1073\u201d, \u201cJPEG\u201d, \u201cGIF\u201d, \u201cPNG\u201d, \u201cXCF\u201d, \u201cSVG\u201d, \u201cPDF\u201d), video (\u201cDICOM\u201d, \u201cHL7\u201d, \u201cIEEE 1073\u201d, \u201cMPEG\u201d, \u201cAVI\u201d, \u201cMP4\u201d, \u201cQUICKTIME\u201d), waveform (\u201cMFER\u201d), audio (\u201cDICOM\u201d, \u201cHL7\u201d, \u201cIEEE 1073\u201d, \u201cMP3\u201d, \u201cWAV\u201d, \u201cFLAC\u201d), and so forth. It is to be understood that the file formats listed above are only examples of a wide variety of electronic formats that may be used.","The database  may be a relational database, a network model database, a hierarchical model database, a flat-file database, or a combination thereof. Indeed, any type of database that is able to store and retrieve electronic data may be used. The server  may serve as a front-end to the database  and may provide access to the data residing in the database . Additionally, the server  may also store some of the same data stored in the database , for example, for caching purposes. Clients  may communicate with the server  in order to access the multimedia files, software, patient information, billing records, and so forth. The server  may also store, for example, software that may be distributed to the clients  and used to analyze the clients  for suitability for use in diagnosis as discussed in more detail with respect to  below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["24","14","24","26","14","24","28","28","14","22","14","14","28","28","14","22","28","22","28"]},"The client checker application  may include a set of scripts  and a knowledge base . In certain embodiments, the scripts  may include component check scripts that may be used, for example, to detect and analyze the underlying hardware of the client . The scripts  may also include computer instructions to execute a series of question-answer sessions which may result in the creation of a performance baseline as described in more detail with respect to  below. The knowledge base  may, for example, include data describing a minimum recommended performance baseline and data related to the component checks (e.g., list of component types, list of manufacturers, list of performance measures). The knowledge base  may also include the questions-answer sessions and the decision criteria that may be used to compare a performance baseline of the client  against a minimum recommended baseline.","Turning to , a flowchart depicts an embodiment of a workflow logic  that may be used, for example, by the client checker application  (shown in ), to give an indication of the suitability of the client  for use in medical diagnosis. The logic  may first determine (decision ) if the OS of the current client  is compatible with the latest embodiments of the client checker application . In one embodiment, the check for OS compatibility may be automated. That is, an installer program may use application programming interface (API) calls to check for OS compatibility. The installation program may then determine from the result of the API calls if the OS is compatible. In another embodiment, the user may be asked to select from a list of OSes and the selection may be used to determine if the OS is compatible.","If the OS is determined to be incompatible with embodiments of the client checker application  then the workflow logic  may end (block ). If the OS is determined to be compatible with embodiments of the client checker tool  then workflow logic  may install (block ) the client checker application  onto a client . In one embodiment, the installation of the client checker application  may include connecting to the server  (shown in ) and downloading a set of scripts  and a knowledge base . In another embodiment, the installation of the client checker application  may be performed by executing an installation program which may access the scripts  and the knowledge base  from a storage medium such as a DVD, CD, flash card, or floppy drive. It is to be understood that as in most software installation processes, other actions may take place such as copying files to a hard drive, updating a system registry, creating links to software libraries, and so forth.","The workflow logic  may then initialize the client checker application  (block ) by, for example, executing the client checker application  in the client 's processor. In certain embodiments where the client  is communicatively connected to the server , the initializing may include connecting to the server , for example, to establish that the connection is working, to exchange files (e.g., to upgrade to a newer version of the client checker software ), and so forth. In one embodiment, after the initialization process is completed, the workflow logic  then may split into two logic branches which may be executed concurrently or sequentially.","A first logic branch (i.e., left branch after block ) may be capable of executing automated component checks and a second logic branch (i.e., right branch after block  depicted in ) may be capable of executing question-answer sessions. At the first logic branch, an OS check may be performed (block ) that may be able to determine the specific type and software version of the OS (e.g., Windows\u00ae 7, Windows Vista\u00ae Service Pack 2, Apple\u00ae Snow Leopard\u00ae, Linux\u00ae Ubuntu\u00ae 9.04) being used by the client . The workflow logic  may then execute OS-specific scripts, each script capable of performing a check on one or more hardware or software components of the client . Some example components that may be tested include the CPU, the random access memory (RAM), the basic input output system (BIOS), the hard drive, the graphics card (e.g., external graphics card, on-chip graphics card), the graphic drivers (e.g., Open GL\u00ae, Linux\u00ae framebuffer, DirectX\u00ae, ATI Radeon\u00ae), the audio drivers (e.g., Windows\u00ae Soundblaster\u00ae driver, Linux\u00ae ALSA driver, Apple\u00ae M-Audio\u00ae driver), and so forth. A component check may consist of, for example, a set of tests or API queries designed to obtain the manufacturer, model name, and version, of the component.","The workflow logic  may then collect data (block ) related to the component check. It is to be understood that different types of data may be collected depending on the type of component that is being checked. For example, if the component is the CPU, the data collected may include the number of cores present, the manufacturer (e.g., Intel\u00ae, AMD\u00ae), the clock speed, the types and sizes of the on-chip buffers, and so forth. In another example, if the component is the graphics card component, the data may include the manufacturer and the model of the graphics card (e.g., ATI Radeon\u00ae, Nvidia\u00ae GeForce\u00ae), the manufacturer and the type of graphics driver, and so forth. Similarly, if the component is the audio component, the data may include the manufacturer and the type of audio driver used, and so forth.","In certain embodiments, the component check may also include a check of the current OS display settings being used by a monitor to display the medical information. The component check of the display settings may be used to determine the screen refresh rate, dots per inch (DPI), color quality (e.g., 16 bit, 32 bit), and so forth. It is to be understood that in some embodiments, multiple monitors may be used by the same client . In such embodiments, the display settings component check may check the display settings for each one of the multiple monitors. The logic  then determines (decision ) if all of the component check tests have being completed. If there are still components that have not undergone a component check then the logic  repeats the collection of data related to the component check (block ) until all components have been checked.","Once all the component checks have been completed, logic  may then compare (block ) the results of the component check to data present in the knowledge base . The comparison may involve determining if any components failed to meet certain baseline specifications. For example, the CPU component of client  may run at a clock speed of 500 MHz yet the baseline specification may call for a CPU running at a clock speed of at least 1 GHz. Similarly, the current graphics driver may have a version 9.0a of DirectX\u00ae yet the baseline specification may call for using DirectX\u00ae 10.0 or better. Other example baseline specifications may include minimum baselines for the hard drive, BIOS, audio driver, monitor, and so forth.","Returning to the second logic branch (i.e., right branch after block ) depicted in , the second logic branch may present to the user a series of questions that may contain textual, graphical, video, and\/or audio content, or a combination thereof (block ). The questions may include presenting multimedia content for the user to evaluate. Questions may then be asked relating to how well the user perceives the performance (e.g., display quality, video performance, audio quality) of the client  hardware when observing and\/or listening to the multimedia content. In certain embodiments, the multimedia content being presented may include a set of grayscale images (i.e., images composed of shades of gray) such as the image described in more detail with respect to  below.","In other embodiments, the set of questions may include questions related to the video performance capabilities of the client . A video may be displayed and questions may be asked regarding, for example, the level of choppiness (i.e., lost frames) of the video, the ability of the video to stay in synch with an audio track, the ability of the video to be viewed at full screen, and so forth. Another set of questions may include questions related to the graphics rendering capabilities of the client . A 3-dimensional (3D) object may be rendered on the client's  display and the questions may relate to the time it takes to render the object, the time it takes to resize the object, the time it takes to rotate the object, and so forth. Yet another set of questions may include questions related to the audio performance of the client . The questions may include questions on the capability to hear sounds at a certain volume level, the capability to hear certain sounds (e.g., tones, frequencies, left speaker only sounds, right speaker only sounds), the ability to hear sounds without skipping or distortions (i.e., alterations of the original recording), and so forth.","Returning to block  of the workflow logic , if the question being asked (decision ) relates to system configuration settings (e.g., display settings, sound system settings, graphics acceleration settings) then more questions may be asked (block ) in order to narrow down the issue of interest. For example, the user may be presented with an image consisting of grayscale differences and asked to answer (e.g., yes, no) if the user can detect the differences in gray. If the user can see the grayscale differences then the user may be presented a different image or directed to a different portion of the same image and asked a set of questions related to fine grayscale detail as described in more detail in  below. The logic  may iterate through decision  and block , asking a plurality of questions so as to narrow down the issue of interest.","If all of the questions have not been presented (decision ), then the logic  may continue asking questions (block ) until all the questions are presented. The logic  may gather the answers to each question (block ). In certain embodiments, some of the answers to the questions may include instructions that help the user, for example, in reconfiguring certain properties of the client's  components. For example, if the user answers that the display does not seem to show grayscale variations then the logic  may instruct the user to adjust the client  monitor's contrast and\/or brightness in order to properly view the grayscale variations. Instructions may also be given by the logic  as part of the preparation for the next round of questions, for example, by instructing the viewer to set the client  volume controls to a certain level (e.g., 50% volume, 75% volume, 100% volume), to set the monitor at a certain contrast and\/or brightness, resolution, bit depth, and so forth.","Once the question-answer session has been finalized, the logic  may analyze both the answers and the component checks in order to decide if any components failed to meet the specifications (block ). As mentioned above, a knowledge base may be used to compare a minimum performance baseline to a performance baseline created by using the answers and the component checks. If it is determined (decision ) that there are any failures (e.g., a component is below the baseline), then a set of warnings, a set of detailed messages regarding the failed components, and\/or a set of recommendations on how to fix any failures may be displayed (block ). The recommendations may include instructions to the user, for example, to upgrade a software component (e.g., graphics driver, graphics library, audio driver, audio library) and\/or a hardware component (e.g., monitor, graphics card, CPU, hard drive, CD drive, DVD drive, network card, speakers). If there are no failures then a success message (block ) may be displayed, including a summary of the component checks and the question-answer sessions.","Turning to , the figure depicts an embodiment of an example screen  of the client checker application  (shown in ) that may be used in detecting the suitability of a client  for use in medical diagnosis. As mentioned above, the screen  may include an area  that may be used to display multimedia content. In the area  depicted in , a grayscale image is displayed consisting of a plurality of gray, white, and black squares. It is to be understood that other types of multimedia content, for example, color images, video, audio signals, and\/or waveforms, may be presented. A set of questions related to the multimedia content being presented may then be displayed.","Some questions related to the grayscale image shown in area  of  include questions on grayscale differences (i.e., Step ), fine grayscale detail (i.e., Step ), varying grayscale (i.e., Step ), aspect ratio (i.e., Step ), and resolution (i.e., Step ). Other images may be used for questions on continuity (i.e., Step ) and monitor type (i.e., Step ). Grayscale difference questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display different levels of gray, for example, by displaying squares ranging from 0% (white) squares to 100% (black) squares. Fine grayscale detail questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display finer gray colors, for example, by displaying a first box having a smaller second box inside the first box where the second box has a slightly different gray color. Varying grayscale questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display striped squares where each striped square has stripes of different thicknesses, contrasts, and\/or gray variations.","Aspect ratio questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display boxes of the same or different width and height. Resolution questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display striped boxes having alternating stripe pairs of white and black stripes where the stripes have even thicknesses and where the box does not show any gray colors. Continuity questions may be designed to elicit responses based on the ability of the monitor to display a gray image having a spectrum of gray without also showing banding (e.g., concentric rings), or bleeding (i.e., unwanted grayness or color). Monitor type (i.e., monitor issues) questions may be designed to elicit responses based on type of monitor being used (e.g., liquid crystal display, cathode ray tube) and the ability of the monitor to display white or colored dots against, for example, a black background image. It is to be understood that a variety of multimedia that may provide an indication of the quality of the display may be presented. For example, color images may be displayed in addition to or instead of grayscale images. Questions may then be presented based on the quality of the color, such as color depth, continuity, resolution, aspect ratio, and so forth. Indeed, any type of multimedia that may allow for testing the capabilities of the hardware and software to properly present the multimedia may be used.","Continuing with , the screen  may include an area  that may be used to display the current status of the client checker software . For example, the area  displayed in  shows that the client checker program's current status is that of executing a quality test and having completed two steps, i.e., \u201cStep \u2014Grayscale Difference\u201d and \u201cStep \u2014Fine Grayscale Detail.\u201d A status indicator icon, such as a checkmark or a stop sign, may be displayed to the right of the textual label of the steps and used to denote that the steps that have been completed successfully (e.g., a checkmark is shown) or unsuccessfully (e.g., a stop sign is shown).","An area  of the screen  may be used to present the user with certain questions related to multimedia shown in area  as described above. A plurality of user controls, for example, text boxes, radio buttons, list boxes, command buttons, dropdowns, and so forth may be provided as part of the area  in order to allow the user to enter any number of responses to the questions presented. The area  may also display multimedia, for example, when asking questions comparing the multimedia displayed in area  with the multimedia displayed in area . The area  may also include a set of command buttons ,  which may be used to navigate through the question-answer session. A \u201cBack\u201d command button , for example, may allow the user to go navigate backwards one question. A \u201cNext\u201d command button , for example, may allow the user to navigate forward to the next question. In one embodiment, the \u201cNext\u201d command button  may not be enabled (i.e., grayed out and deactivated) until the user answers the current question.","An area  of the screen  may include a display of the set of questions that have not yet been completed. In the example area  of screen  depicted in , the area  shows that steps - and a final summary step have not yet been completed. A status icon (e.g., stop sign) may be used to visually denote the lack of completion of these steps. After the completion of all the steps, a summary may be provided such as the example summary described in more detail with respect to  below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["84","14","84","86","88","90","86","28","86","86","1","2","3","6","7","4","5"]},"An area  of the screen  may include a series of command buttons that may be used, for example, to execute other functionality. For example, a \u201cNetwork Summary\u201d command button may execute software instructions that may result in the creation of a summary of the networking capabilities (e.g., network bandwidth, server latency) and networking topology (e.g., internet protocol address, gateway address, domain name server address, subnet mask) of the client . A \u201cClient Information\u201d command button may, for example, execute software instructions that may result in the creation of a summary of the client's hardware and software capabilities such as OS used, hard drive usage, software drivers installed, and so forth. The \u201cClient Information\u201d command button may also collect, present, and\/or transmit (e.g., email) the data retrieved by the client component checker application  (shown in ) and the responses to the question-answer sessions as mentioned above.","An area  of the screen  may include a summary indicative of the capabilities of the client  to operate as a medical diagnosis client. The summary may include, for example, a list of issues that would prevent the client  from being used as a medical diagnosis client, a list of possible remedial actions that may be taken to upgrade the client , and a summary of the ability of the client  to function as a medical diagnostic client. The area  may also include other user controls, for example, an \u201cEmail\u201d command button, that may be used to email and\/or save a report of the current analysis to another entity, such as a vendor, for review.","Technical effects of the invention include the capability to discern if an OTS client may be capable of being utilized in medical diagnosis, the capability to automatically check hardware and\/or software components of an OTS client against a baseline, and the capability to interact with a user in order to elicit information indicative of the current diagnostic suitability of the OTS client. A computer network may be used to deliver computer code capable of testing the diagnostic suitability of an OTS client. The computer network may also be used to transmit the results of the diagnostic suitability analysis to vendors and to other entities. A wide variety of previously unused OTS hardware may be tested and used to replace expensive custom-built hardware.","This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods.
