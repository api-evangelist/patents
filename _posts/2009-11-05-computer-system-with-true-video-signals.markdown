Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to networked computer systems, including computer systems implemented over a local area network (wireless and\/or wired) and computer systems implemented over a wide area network (wireless and\/or wired).","2. Description of the Related Art","In some conventional computer systems, multiple operating systems run on a single set of processing hardware of a single computer. For example, in some conventional computer systems, a piece of software called a \u201chypervisor\u201d controls the running of multiple operating systems, which operating systems are sometimes called \u201cvirtual machines.\u201d In some conventional hypervisor-and-virtual-machine computer systems, the virtual machines are \u201ccontainerized\u201d in that each virtual machine runs substantially independently of the other virtual machine(s) that are run by the common hypervisor. The hypervisor effects its control of the virtual machines by \u201cvirtualizing,\u201d or, in other words, emulating the actual, physical resources of the hardware upon which the hypervisor runs. By virtualizing the actual resources, the hypervisor can actually communicate with various resources of the computer (see DEFINITIONS section), on behalf of each containerized virtual machine, in series, which is to say, in some sort of time division multiplexed manner At the same time, because the hypervisor communicates with the various, containerized virtual machines through code emulating virtualized hardware, each virtualized machines has no way of detecting the sharing of computer resources. Because of this, the virtualized machine operating systems do not need to be equipped to deal with the fact that they are sharing computer resources. This means that standard, pre-existing operating systems, such as WINDOWS operating systems or LINUX operating systems, may be used for each virtual machine operating system. (\u201cWINDOWS\u201d is used as a trademark of the Microsoft Corporation and may be subject to commonlaw and\/or trademark-registration-based trademark rights in various jurisdictions throughout the world.)","Because hypervisors virtualize computer resources, they tend to require a lot of code and processing power in order to fully and accurately emulate the specific resources that they emulate. Furthermore, a given piece of hypervisor software must include code to emulate all of the resources of the computer system upon which it runs. If the hypervisor includes virtualization code for resources that its computer system does not have, then that is an inefficiency because those code portions cannot be allowed to be used by the virtual machines running on the hypervisor. Of more concern is the fact that the hypervisor might be missing code to run certain resources. In fact, if there is too bad of a mismatch between the resources that the hypervisor has code portions to emulate, and the actual resources of the computer system upon which it runs, then the computer system will be inoperable. In this sense, hypervisors tend to be either inefficient (that is, lots of extra code portions), or else inflexible and unrobust (that is, unable to accommodate a wide variety of computer systems having different combinations of resources).","The named inventor of the present application has developed a different kind of computer system for running multiple operating systems and\/or multiple, containerized operating systems on a single computer. According to this system, the multiple operating systems communicate more directly with the actual resources of the computer system under the control of a module (for example, a piece of software) called a \u201ccontroller kernel.\u201d The concept of the controller kernel and various preferred embodiments of the computer systems utilizing such a controller kernel are more fully described in the following patent application documents: (i) Ser. No. 12\/234,131 (filed Sep. 19, 2008 and published as publication number 2009-0083829 A1 on Mar. 26, 2009); (ii) Ser.

No. 12\/234,223 (filed Sep. 19, 2008 and published as publication number 2009-0083450 A1 on Mar. 26, 2009); and (iv) U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/973,923, filed on Sep. 20, 2007 (collectively, \u201cController Kernel Background Documents\u201d). The Controller Kernel Background Documents are hereby incorporated by reference in their respective entireties to the fullest extent allowed by law.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","110","120","128","102","104","106","103","112","116","118"]},"In the prior art system of , part of the data that is communicated from the server computer to each thin client is a video signal. The video signals are generated by processing hardware set  to be in a format such as jpg, bmp, gif, tiff, pcx or other formats that are not suitable for direct display on a standard monitor. Rather, these formats require processing by computer processing hardware before there is a video signal in a \u201ctrue video\u201d format which is in condition for direct display on a standard monitor. These non-true-video format video signals are sent to network protocol encapsulation software , which encapsulates them into a suitable network protocol (for example, TCP\/IP, HTTP). The encapsulated video signals are then sent in a tunneling manner out through processing hardware set  to wireless transmitter . The encapsulated video signals are respectively received by wireless receivers  and  and sent to respective processing hardware sets  and . The processing hardware sets have the video signals de-encapsulated by respective network protocol de-encapsulation software  and  so that they go back to being non-true-video signals not wrapped in a network protocol. The respective processing hardware sets  and  then convert the non-true-video signals into true video signals (sometimes with the help of appropriate conversion software, not shown). After the video signals are converted into true video signals, they are sent to the respective display devices  and  where they are displayed to the respective users (not shown) of the thin client terminals. U.S. patent application 2008\/0055191 (\u201cCraig\u201d) is an example of such a prior art system (see Craig at paragraph 0020).","Description Of the Related Art Section Disclaimer: To the extent that specific publications are discussed above in this Description of the Related Art Section, these discussions should not be taken as an admission that the discussed publications (for example, published patents) are prior art for patent law purposes. For example, some or all of the discussed publications may not be sufficiently early in time, may not reflect subject matter developed early enough in time and\/or may not be sufficiently enabling so as to amount to prior art for patent law purposes. To the extent that specific publications are discussed above in this Description of the Related Art Section, they are all hereby incorporated by reference into this document in their respective entirety(ies).","The present invention is directed to a computer system where a computer sends out video signal signals in true video format directly to a standard monitor type display device (see DEFINITIONS section) through either a network (wired or wireless or both), or over a wireless connection. In network embodiments, the network may be a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d) a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d) or a combination of these types. Preferably, the true video signal is in one of the following formats: conventional television type broadcast signal, VGA, xVGA, D-sub 15, RGBHV video signal with DDC2 digital clock and data. Preferably, the true signal sent from the computer to the standard monitor type display device is in analog form.","Various embodiments of the present invention may exhibit one or more of the following objects, features and\/or advantages:","(1) little or no processing power is required at the terminal(s) controlled by the computer because no processing power is required to either de-encapsulate the video signal and\/or convert it from non-true-video format into true video format;","(2) because the terminals require little or no processing power, they can be mad in inexpensive forms such as dummy terminal notebooks or dummy netbooks; and","(3) inexpensive terminals operating according to the present invention can be used in environments where damage to the terminal hardware is relatively likely, such as a school for educating children.","According to an aspect of the present invention, a computer system includes a computer, a communication network and a first standard monitor type display device. The computer comprises true video transmission software and a network output module. The true video transmission software is programmed to receive a first true video signal, corresponding to a first computer display used in working on a computer and generated by the computer, and output the first true video signal to the network output module in true video form and without encapsulation in a network protocol. The network module is structured, connected and\/or programmed to send the first true video signal through the communication network to the first standard monitor type display device. The first standard monitor type display device receives the first true video signal from the communication network and displays it on a display of the first standard monitor type display device.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, a computer system includes a computer and a first standard monitor type display device. The computer comprises true video transmission software and a wireless transmitter. The true video transmission software is programmed to receive a first true video signal, corresponding to a computer display used in working on a computer and generated by the computer, and output the first true video signal to the wireless transmitter in true video form and without encapsulation in a network protocol. The first standard display device comprises a display and a wireless receiver. The wireless receiver of the first standard monitor type display device receives the first true video signal from the wireless transmitter of the computer and displays it on the display of the standard monitor type display device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3","b":["150","151","152","154","155","161","162","163","170","180","190","156","401","402","411","420","406","407","171","172","181","182","191","192"]},"In operation, the three GOSs , ,  of the server computer run in a \u201ccontainerized\u201d (that is, at least substantially independent of each other) manner on and under the control of the controller kernel, which controls communications between the controller kernel and the respective GOSs. these containerized GOSs are respectively allocated to the remote terminals , , . In this embodiment the remote terminals are in the form of dumb terminals (see DEFINITIONS section), but, alternatively, they could be thin client terminals or even full-blown personal computer workstations. For the purposes of the present invention, the important part to focus upon is the form in which the terminals get their respective video signals, which are displayed upon their respective standard monitor type display devices , , . More specifically, they get true video signals, which correspond to a computer type display of the type that a user sees when working directly at a personal computer. Now, in system , these true video displays come from the server computer which is located at a nearby remote location (LAN embodiments) or a faraway remote location (WAN embodiments). In this embodiment, the network  is a wired network, but it could alternatively be a wireless network, or even a wireless broadcast of video signals on different channels corresponding to the respective true video signals, similar to a conventional, old fashioned television broadcast.","The operation of the controller kernel, shown in detail in , will now be discussed. The controller kernel effects communications between the processing hardware set and the GOSs in (at least) two ways: (i) through hypervisor software ; and (ii) through native form communication software. The operation of the native form communication software is discussed in some detail in the Controller Kernel Background Documents, but summarize this portion of the communication, native form (see DEFINITIONS section) instructions are passed back and forth between the operating system and the containerized GOSs in a controlled fashion by the native form communication software, which preferably: (i) is written in LINUX (even if the GOSs are Windows); and (ii) utilizes an idle loop and interrupt signals so that multiple GOSs can share a single set of processing hardware using native form instructions, but without conflicts.","In controller kernel , however, some GOS\/processing hardware set communications are handled (in whole or in part) by hypervisor software . For example, video related instructions are handled by virtual video card module  which virtualizes and emulates a audio card hardware, but at the software level. As a further example, audio related instructions are handled by virtual audio card module  which virtualizes and emulates audio card hardware, but at the software level. These virtualized interfaces of the hypervisor software tend to be less efficient than the native form transfer of instructions through the native form communication software, but, for various reasons, there are some instruction transfers that are preferably performed in this virtualized manner.","Within hypervisor software , frame buffers having audio and\/or video data are generated. It is these frame buffers which are taken by (or copied to) true video frame buffer sub-module  of the true video transmission module portion of the controller kernel. The true video frame buffer sub-module uses these frame buffers to make a true video signal (in digital form) corresponding to the video signal that a computer user using the GOS and its associated applications would see. This true video signal (in digital form) is then sent to digital-to-analog converter  and converted to a corresponding true video signal in analog form. The true video signal in analog form is sent out to the processing hardware set and thence to WAN\/LAN  (generally with the help of a network module, that may include hardware and\/or software, not separately shown). In some controller kernel embodiments of the present invention (not all embodiments of the present invention necessarily have controller kernels), the true video signal may be sent directly from the computer to the A\/V output device. It is noted that the true video signal is not encapsulated in a network protocol, or otherwise put into any form that would require processing so that it could be displayed on a standard monitor type display device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["200","202","203","204","205","206","210","211","212","220","230","240","221","222","231","232","241","242","150"]},"However, in system , the three true video signals are broadcast on three different channels of wireless transmission, in the manner of a television broadcast. Instead of being sent to a network, the true video signals are sent from true video transmission module  to wireless transmitter  (which may be built integrally into the body of the server computer, or may be a separate component). Wireless transmitter may be constructed as, for example, wireless transmitter VideoComm TC5800 (made by VideoComm Technologies of Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Preferably, each true video signal is sent on a separate channel, but other ways of multiplexing multiple true video signals may be possible. The true video signals of system  are preferably analog, but digital true video signals may also be and\/or become susceptible of wireless broadcast.","The preferred bandwidth related allocations (assuming current equipment types and current performance standards) are believed to be: (i) 6 MBPS; and (ii) 20 MHZ per channel (that is, per user). These preferred allocations may change over time as equipment and expected performance standards improve.","The true video signal channels are respectively broadcast to wireless receivers , , , respectively of terminals I, II and III and displayed on A\/V output devices ,  and . Once again, these A\/V output devices are standard monitor type display devices (see DEFINITIONS section) and therefore do not require processing power for processing the video signal before display becomes possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["300","300","302","304","305","307","306","303","320","321","322","323","325","300","306","322","322","321"]},"Any and all published documents mentioned herein shall be considered to be incorporated by reference, in their respective entireties, herein to the fullest extent of the patent law.
