title: Providing an electronic marketplace to facilitate human performance of programmatically submitted tasks
abstract: A method, system, and computer-readable medium is described for facilitating interactions between task requesters who have tasks that are available to be performed and task performers who are available to perform tasks. In some situations, the tasks to be performed are human performance tasks that use cognitive and other mental skills of human task performers, such as to employ judgment, perception and/or reasoning skills of the human task performers. In addition, in some situations the available tasks are submitted by human task requesters via application programs that programmatically invoke one or more application program interfaces of an electronic marketplace in order to request that the tasks be performed and to receive corresponding results of task performance in a programmatic manner, so that an ensemble of unrelated human agents can interact with the electronic marketplace to collectively perform a wide variety and large number of tasks.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The following disclosure relates generally to facilitating interactions between computing systems, and more particularly to facilitating such interactions to enable performance by humans of tasks whose performance is programmatically requested, such as for tasks that are supplied by application programs via programmatic invocations to an electronic marketplace in order to receive results from the performance of the tasks.","Distributed computing systems are known in which multiple computer systems interact in order to achieve a goal. It is often desirable for an application program on a computer system to interact with remote systems and applications in order to obtain various types of information and functionality that are not part of the application program. By performing such interactions, an application program may be able to leverage information and functionality from vast numbers of other computer systems over the Internet or other networks.","In order to enable such interactions between remote computer systems and application programs, various programmatic interaction mechanisms have been developed. For example, remote procedure call (\u201cRPC\u201d) protocols have long existed that allow a program on one computer to cause a program on another computer to be executed, and various object-oriented architectures such as CORBA (\u201cCommon Object Request Broker Architecture\u201d) and DCOM (\u201cDistributed Component Object Model\u201d) provide similar capabilities. In addition, a variety of middleware programs have been implemented to connect separate applications (often of distinct types and from unrelated sources) to allow communication. For example, various EDI (\u201cElectronic Data Interchange\u201d) networks exist that provide standard mechanisms to allow a computer system of one user of the network to send data to a computer system of another user of the network.","The widespread popularity of the World Wide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d) has provided additional opportunities for computers to inter-communicate. For example, much current Web use involves users interactively requesting Web pages from Web servers (e.g., via executing Web browser applications of the users) and receiving the requested information in response. In addition to such interactive user specification of requested information, there is also growing use of the Web to provide so-called \u201cWeb services,\u201d which typically involve the programmatic interaction of remote applications to exchange information via defined APIs (\u201capplication program interfaces\u201d), or the like. Web services may allow heterogeneous applications and computers to interact, and can be defined and implemented using a variety of underlying protocols and techniques. For example, some Web service implementations return data in XML (\u201cextensible Markup Language\u201d) format using HTTP (\u201cHyperText Transport Protocol\u201d) in response to a Web service invocation request specified as a URI (\u201cUniform Resource Identifier\u201d), such as a URL (\u201cUniform Resource Locator\u201d) that includes a specified operation and one or more query parameters. In other implementations, additional underlying protocols are used for various purposes, such as SOAP (\u201cSimple Object Access Protocol\u201d) for standard message exchange, WSDL (\u201cWeb Services Description Language\u201d) for description of service invocations, and UDDI (\u201cUniversal Description, Discovery, and Integration service\u201d) for discovery of available services.","Unfortunately, while Web services and other programmatic interaction mechanisms allow various application programs and computers to interact, such interactions are typically limited in various ways. For example, the types of information and functionality that are available to be requested using such programmatic interactions are typically restricted to very limited types of requests that the remote computer systems and applications can automatically fulfill (e.g., to provide a specified predefined group of information, such as a Web page or file, or to perform a specified database query on a specified database).","However, while such types of programmatic requests can be useful, there is a very large class of tasks which computers and application programs cannot easily automatically perform, but which humans can typically easily perform, referred to herein as \u201chuman performance tasks.\u201d This is due at least in part to various cognitive and other mental capabilities of humans that are not easily encoded in automated programs, such as the ability to use human judgment to form opinions, to perform abstract or common-sense reasoning, to perform various discernment and perception tasks (e.g., visual and aural pattern recognition, such as based on experience), to use cultural awareness and emotional intelligence, and to perform various other everyday yet highly complex kinds of perception, cognition, reasoning and thinking.","One example of such a human performance task is identifying obscene content\u2014in particular, despite the ability of a human observer to typically identify obscene content very rapidly based on a cursory review, automated techniques are largely unable to accurately identify most such content. In a similar manner, Justice Potter Stewart famously said of pornography that he could not explain exactly what it was, but \u201cI know it when I see it,\u201d and the Supreme Court of Justice Stewart's era went on to establish a legal test for pornography that incorporates subjective community standards. Today, despite much effort into developing automated pornography and other content filters, no one has yet figured out a way to make a computer that really \u201cknows it when it sees it.\u201d","Thus, given the existing limitations regarding automated performance of tasks, it would be beneficial to provide a solution that enables application programs to programmatically request that such tasks be performed and to receive programmatic responses with results of task performance, as well as that addresses other related problems.","A software facility is described that facilitates interactions between task requesters who have tasks that are available to be performed and task performers who are available to perform tasks. In at least some embodiments, the tasks to be performed are cognitive human performance tasks that use cognitive and other mental skills of human task performers, such as to employ judgment, perception and\/or reasoning skills of the human task performers. In addition, in at least some embodiments an intermediary electronic marketplace is provided that allows task requester users and task performer users to programmatically and\/or interactively engage in task-related transactions and to perform various other activities related to performance of tasks.","In particular, in some embodiments one or more computing systems providing the electronic marketplace act as an intermediary to allow task requesters to programmatically request (e.g., via programmatic invocations of one or more APIs of the electronic marketplace by application programs of the task requesters) that tasks be performed by human task performers and to receive corresponding results after the tasks are performed (e.g., as responses to the programmatic invocations). Similarly, human task performers can access the electronic marketplace (e.g., in a programmatic or interactive manner) to obtain information about available tasks that they can perform and to provide the results of task performance after the completion of tasks that they are assigned. By enabling large numbers of unaffiliated or otherwise unrelated task requesters and task performers to interact via the intermediary electronic marketplace in this manner, free-market mechanisms mediated by the Internet or other public computer networks can be used to programmatically harness the collective intelligence of an ensemble of unrelated human task performers.","The electronic marketplace further performs a variety of additional activities to facilitate the performance of tasks. For example, the electronic marketplace may track the progression of the tasks through various states (e.g., an \u201copen\u201d state for tasks that are available to be performed, an \u201cassigned\u201d state for each assignment of a task to one or more task performers, a \u201ccompleted\u201d state for an assignment after the task performer provides the results of performance of the task, etc.), and may further take various actions corresponding to the tasks. In addition, in some embodiments a task requester user may impose various criteria regarding performance of a task (e.g., required and\/or preferred qualifications for task performers, time limits for task completion, etc.) and\/or may specify various actions associated with task performance (e.g., payment of a specified fee under specified conditions), and if so the electronic marketplace may enforce those criteria and initiate those actions as appropriate for the task. Similarly, task performer users may specify various actions related to tasks, such as to request that information about available tasks and\/or about other users be provided in various ways (e.g., to be notified when specified types of tasks become available), and if so the electronic marketplace may similarly initiate those actions as appropriate.","In some embodiments, the electronic marketplace further provides a variety of types of functionality related to obtaining and using information about qualifications and other attributes of task performer users and\/or task requester users, such as to allow users to identify and\/or specify types of users with whom to conduct transactions. For example, the electronic marketplace may track various information about activities by task performer users and\/or task requester users in some embodiments, such as to automatically generate quantitative measurements of actions taken by the users that may be used as qualifications (e.g., activities related to prior task performance). More generally, in some embodiments the electronic marketplace may support user qualifications of various types (e.g., qualifications for a user that are asserted by that user, that are specified by one or more other users, and\/or that are automatically generated by the electronic marketplace). Furthermore, in some embodiments the electronic marketplace provides functionality to authenticate or otherwise corroborate information about users (e.g., users' qualifications, identities, non-qualification attributes, etc.), such as based on obtained evidence that supports that information, and may then use such corroborated information in various ways. Functionality provided by the electronic marketplace related to qualifications and corroboration of user information is discussed in greater detail below.","Interactions between the electronic marketplace and users of the marketplace can occur in a variety of ways. As previously noted, in some embodiments task requesters interact with the electronic marketplace in a programmatic manner, such as by invoking defined APIs of the marketplace (e.g., APIs based on Web services provided by the electronic marketplace) to send messages that request or supply information. The defined APIs may allow the task requesters to not only submit tasks that are available to be performed, but also to perform various other actions with respect to previously submitted tasks (e.g., check on the status of pending tasks, modify information about pending tasks, submit instructions regarding handling of pending tasks, and interactively obtain results for completed tasks). In addition, the defined APIs may allow task requesters to further perform various other types of interactions with the electronic marketplace, such as searching for and\/or browsing for information of interest (e.g., to identify available task performers having specified qualifications or attributes, or to identify information about tasks submitted by other task requesters), supplying qualification information for themselves and\/or for task performers, etc. In addition, while in some embodiments all communications between task requesters and task performers occur via the electronic marketplace, in other embodiments at least some communications may occur directly between a task requester and a task performer (e.g., to allow a task performer to obtain information from a task requester regarding a task to be performed, to allow a task performer to provide task results information to a task requester for a task that has been performed, etc.) or more generally between any two or more users, such as after the electronic marketplace facilitates that direct communication (e.g., by providing appropriate contact or other communication-related information to at least one of the parties to the communication).","In situations in which a final response is not immediately available to a programmatically supplied message (e.g., a final response that includes results from performing a task that is submitted with the message), the electronic marketplace may in some embodiments provide an immediate response that acknowledges receipt of the message (e.g., by providing a unique task identifier for a task being submitted), and may later provide one or more additional related electronic communications (e.g., to provide the results from performing a task to the task requester who submitted the task). Such additional electronic communications can be performed in a variety of ways, such as by initiating a new electronic message (e.g., email, instant messaging, etc.), by using a callback mechanism supplied along with the original message, etc.","In at least some embodiments, the electronic marketplace may also provide an interactive console that allows task requesters to interactively perform some or all of the various types of actions previously noted, whether instead of or in addition to a programmatic interface that is provided for those actions. For example, in some embodiments the interactive console functionality may be accessed by a task requester user via a Web browser that interacts with a Web server for the electronic marketplace (e.g., by supplying appropriate information in a form on a Web page from the electronic marketplace).","In a similar manner, task performer users may interact with the electronic marketplace in a variety of ways in order to identify available tasks of interest and to perform such tasks, whether in a programmatic and\/or interactive manner. More generally, task performer users may similarly perform a variety of types of actions with respect to the electronic marketplace, including searching for and\/or browsing for available tasks for which they are qualified, searching for and\/or browsing for tasks from task requesters who have specified attributes, supplying qualification information, requesting assignments for available tasks of interest, supplying results from performance of tasks to which they have been assigned, requesting notifications of later-submitted tasks for which they are qualified, providing various types of preference information, etc. Additional details regarding specific types of interactions with the electronic marketplace by task requester and task performer users are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["130","135","140"]},"In particular, in this example a variety of human task requester users  are each interacting with one or more application programs to request that tasks be performed by registering or otherwise submitting the tasks to the TFF system, as well as to perform various other interactions with the TFF system. To submit the tasks or perform other interactions, the application programs each programmatically invoke one or more Web services (\u201cWSes\u201d) that are part of TFF system's API in this example embodiment. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, each of the task requests may include a variety of information about the task to be performed, including one or more qualifications needed by any human task performer who performs the tasks, one or more other criteria related to task performance (e.g., deadlines for completion and requirements for the format of results from the task performance), and one or more associated fees to be provided to the human task performers who successfully perform the task.","Similarly, in the illustrated embodiment other task requester users  submit available tasks and perform other interactions with the TFF system in an interactive manner via Web browser programs that communicate information supplied by the users to an interactive console , with the console then interacting with the API of the TFF system in a manner similar to that of the interactions by the application programs. In the illustrated embodiment, the console is provided as part of the TFF system (whether on the same or different computing systems used for other parts of the TFF system), such as based on one or more Web pages provided by a Web server of the TFF system. In other embodiments, however, one or more such consoles or other mechanisms to interact with the TFF system may instead by provided externally to the TFF system, such as by third parties (whether instead of or in addition to any console(s) provided by the TFF system). After receiving the information for the available tasks being submitted via the API , the TFF system stores information  about the available tasks for use by task performers. While not illustrated here, some task requester users may be part of both group  and group  by interacting with the TFF system in both programmatic and interactive manners, such as at different times and\/or for different purposes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["120","185","140","140","140","135","115","135","185","135","140","140","135","135","135","115","120"],"i":["b ","b ","a","b ","b ","b ","a ","b","a ","b ","a ","b "]},"Based on the interactions with the human task performers, the TFF system tracks information about the current status of tasks, such as by updating information  about available tasks, and stores results  from the performance of tasks that are received via interface . After a task is performed and corresponding results are received, the TFF system can notify the task requester that supplied that task of the results in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments the results are provided to task requesters via the interactive console when the task requesters next interact with the console. Alternatively, task performance results may instead be electronically sent to the task requesters via the API as a response to a prior invocation, or may instead be sent to task requesters in any other way that provides the information to the task requesters in a timely manner (e.g., via email, telephone, fax, postal mail, etc.).","In addition, the TFF system in the illustrated embodiment facilitates the exchange of payments between parties to transactions involving tasks, such as between task requesters and task performers (e.g., to provide payments to the task performers from the task requesters for satisfactory performance of submitted tasks). In the illustrated embodiment, the TFF system may include internal payment handling capabilities, such as via a payment handling system , although in other embodiments the TFF system may instead interact with an external payment handling system (whether from the same organization that provides the TFF system or instead from a third party) to provide the payments. In some situations, task performance payments may be made automatically after a task is performed (e.g., after automated verification is performed by the TFF system on received task results to ensure that any criteria for the task have been met), while in other situations the payments may instead be made only after the task requester has reviewed and accepted the results (or failed to reject the results after a specified period of time). In addition, as described in greater detail elsewhere, a variety of other types of payments may be made in other situations, such as payments from task performers, payments to or from the TFF system (e.g., for services provided by the system), and\/or payments to or from one or more third parties.","Moreover, a variety of types of non-monetary compensation (e.g., for performance of tasks) and other non-monetary rewards may also be used in other embodiments, whether provided by task requesters (e.g., for performance of submitted tasks), task performers (e.g., for the opportunity to perform tasks), the TFF system (e.g., for specified types of user activities), and\/or third parties to transactions related to task performance. In particular, in some embodiments compensation to one or more task performers for performance of one or more tasks may include credit and\/or discounts for use at one or more online retailers (e.g., a Web merchant affiliated with the TFF system), such as to allow those task performers to purchase and\/or rent goods and services for themselves and\/or for others as gifts. In addition, in some embodiments such compensation and\/or information about such compensation (e.g., a promise to provide such compensation at a future time when specified conditions are satisfied) may also be provided immediately or substantially immediately to a task performer or other recipient of the compensation, such as to allow the recipient to immediately use the compensation for a retail transaction. In other situations, a reward for performance of a task may include recognition of the task performer (e.g., by display information about specified activities of the task performer and\/or a ranking of the task performer relative to other task performers), such as a task performed for a task requester that is a charity or that otherwise benefits a charitable cause or other beneficial entity or activity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["130","131","135","131","145","146","131","131","150"]},"The module  may also provide a variety of types of functionality other than exchanging task and task result information with users. For example, the module  may receive various types of information about users via the API (e.g., evidence of a user's identity, qualification information for users, payment source and\/or repository information for a user, demographic information, user preferences, etc.), such as when users initially register with the TFF system to act as task performers and\/or task requesters. In the illustrated embodiment, the module  then stores the user qualification information in database  and the other user information in database  (although in other embodiments the information may be stored in other ways), and may then provide such information to users when appropriate via the API, such as in response to search and\/or browse requests. A variety of other types of information may also be available (e.g., information about users' accounts with the TFF system, aggregate information about groups of related users or all users, information about historical activities of specific users and\/or groups of users, summary and overview information about tasks that have been performed, etc.), and if so the module  may similarly provide such information to users when appropriate via the API.","In the illustrated embodiment, the TFF system further includes various additional modules that provide additional types of functionality, such as to assist the module , although in other embodiments some or all of the additional modules and\/or additional types of functionality may not be included, or may be combined together in different manners. As one example, the illustrated embodiment of the TFF system includes an Access Control Manager module  to assist in controlling access to various functionality and stored information, such as based on specific access policies specified by users for specific pieces of information and\/or based on default policies of the TFF system. In particular, after a user's identity and\/or other relevant information is determined (whether by the Access Control Manager module, module , or other entity such as an external system affiliated with the TFF system or provided by a third party), the Access Control Manager module may assist in determining whether the user is allowed to access TFF system information based on that determined user information, with the module  providing information to users only when they are authorized to receive it. Access control information can be specified for various types of information in various ways, such as for information about users (e.g., as specified by those users), tasks (e.g., as specified by the task requesters that submitted the tasks), results of task performance (e.g., as specified by the task requesters that submitted the tasks and\/or task performers that performed the tasks), etc.","The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system also includes a User Interaction Manager module  to assist in managing at least some types of interactions with users. For example, in some embodiments task requesters and\/or task performers may be allowed to specify preferences and\/or requirements for how certain types of task-related interactions are to occur, such as to allow a task requester to specify how a submitted task is to be presented to a task performer and\/or how results from the task performer are to be obtained. In embodiments in which the TFF system includes one or more consoles (not illustrated here) with which users interact during the task performance process, the User Interaction Manager module may further be included with or otherwise affiliated with one or more of the consoles to facilitate those user interactions with the consoles. In addition, while in the illustrated embodiment the User Interaction Manager module operates in conjunction with the module  to control particular types of interactions in a user-configurable manner, in other embodiments the module  may instead directly include some or all of the types of functionality provided by the User Interaction Manager module.","To facilitate the control of user interactions, the User Interaction Manager module in the illustrated embodiment provides various predefined Task Interaction Control (\u201cTIC\u201d) types (not shown) that each include a combination of multiple types of processing related to task performance, and allows task requesters to specify a TIC type for use with each task that is submitted. When a task is later to be performed by a human task performer, the User Interaction Manager module then controls the interactions with the human task performer by performing the types of processing specified by the TIC type associated with the task. The types of user interaction processing may include, for example, manipulating information associated with a task in a specified manner before it is provided to a task performer (e.g., to format the information in a specified manner), providing the manipulated information to the task performer in a specified manner (e.g., by invoking an applet or other functionality on a computing system of the task performer that controls the display or other presentation of the manipulated task information to the task performer), obtaining results of task performance from the task performer in a specified manner (e.g., as input to a CGI (\u201cCommon Gateway Interface\u201d) program), and manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester (e.g., to format the information in a specified manner). Multiple predefined alternatives may be provided for each of the types of user interaction processing, and users may further be allowed to define new TIC types based on specified combinations of predefined alternatives and\/or by using new processing information supplied by the users. Other information regarding management of task-related interactions with users is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system further includes a User Qualification Manager module  to assist in specifying qualifications of users, such as qualifications of task performer users related to performing tasks and\/or qualifications of task requester users related to submitting available tasks and to handling results from performance of tasks. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment the User Qualification Manager module allows users to specify new qualification types, as well as to issue or assert specific qualifications of users of those qualification types (or of predefined qualification types in embodiments in which the TFF system provides them). Information about user-specified qualification types and specified user qualifications is then stored in the illustrated embodiment in database , and may be used by task requesters and\/or task performers who have access to that information (e.g., to search for users having specified qualifications, to identify preferred or required qualifications for task performers who perform tasks, to identify preferred or required qualifications for task requesters who have submitted tasks, etc.). As discussed in greater detail elsewhere, in some embodiments the TFF system may further assist in specifying user qualifications based on numerical assessments of prior task-related activities by tracking information about the occurrences of such activities. Other information regarding qualification types and qualifications is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system also includes a User Information Corroboration Manager module  to assist in authenticating or otherwise corroborating information about users, such as identities of users, specified qualifications of users, and other types of attributes of users. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment the User Corroboration Manager module obtains various information that may serve as evidence for one or more pieces of information about users, such as from users that supply the evidence via the API to corroborate particular pieces of user information, and may then use that information for corroboration purposes in various ways. For example, in some embodiments corroborative information may be provided to users along with the information that it corroborates, such as to allow a recipient to evaluate the corroborative value of that information. Alternatively, in some embodiments and for some types of corroborative information, the Information Corroboration Manager module may automatically make an assessment of a degree and\/or type of corroboration provided by the information. After a piece of user information has been sufficiently corroborated, it can be used in various ways, such as to provide indications to others about the degree or type of corroboration for the information, to limit some types of functionality to users who have sufficiently corroborated information (e.g., to require that task performers for a task have a sufficiently corroborated qualification, or to limit some types of access to information to users' whose identities have been sufficiently corroborated), etc. Other information regarding corroboration of user information is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","A Task and User Matching Manager module  is also illustrated in the example embodiment of the TFF system to assist in matching available tasks to be performed and available task performers who can perform the tasks. The matching of tasks and task performers can be performed at various times and in various ways. For example, in some embodiments the matching may be performed in response to requests from task performer users for tasks that meet specified criteria, with the matching tasks provided to the task performer users as candidates that they can select to perform. Alternatively, in some embodiments the matching may be automatically performed for at least some types of tasks when the tasks are submitted, such as to assist in quickly identifying one or more task performers to perform the tasks. In addition, in some embodiments the matching may be performed by matching information about the tasks and the task performers, such as by identifying task performers having qualifications that meet or exceed any required qualifications specified for a task. In other embodiments the Matching Manager module may use additional information (e.g., information about task requesters that submit tasks, preferences of task performers and\/or task requesters, preferred but not required criteria specified for tasks, etc.) when performing matching and\/or perform various additional activities related to matching. Other information regarding matching of tasks and task performers is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system further includes several other modules that provide additional types of functionality to assist operation of the system. For example, the illustrated embodiment includes an Activity Tracking Manager module  that tracks a variety of types of activities (e.g., each activity taken by a user with respect to a submitted task) and stores the tracked information in an activity log database . The Activity Tracking Manager module or other part of the system can then analyze the logged information to determine various types of aggregate or summary information (e.g., for specific users, groups of users, all users, types of tasks, groups of related tasks, etc.), and make that aggregate or summary information available to users as appropriate. The illustrated embodiment also includes a Notification Manager module  that provides notifications to users as appropriate, such as to notify task performers when new tasks that meet specified criteria become available, to notify task requesters when results of performance of their previously submitted tasks are available, etc. The notifications can be performed in various ways in various embodiments, such as via a console or programmatic interface of the TFF system, or via other electronic communication mechanisms (e.g., cellphone, email, instant messaging, etc.). The illustrated embodiment also includes a Reward Manager module  that tracks information about compensation and other rewards for users based on their activities, such as to maintain a financial repository for each user for use in providing or receiving monetary compensation. In addition, the illustrated embodiment includes an Accounting Manager module  to perform various administrative functions for the system, such as to obtain financial payments or other reward information from users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","350","370","390","300","305","310","320","330","311","312","313","315"]},"An embodiment of the TFF system  is executing in memory, and it interacts with the other computing systems over the network  using the network connection  (e.g., via the Internet and\/or the World Wide Web). In particular, users of task requester computing systems  may interact with the TFF system in order to provide information about available tasks to be performed, such as by using application program  executing in memory  to send stored task information  (e.g., information about the task, any associated criteria, any reward for successful performance, etc.) and related information  (e.g., information to be analyzed by human task performers as part of the tasks) on storage . Human task performer users similarly use task performer computing systems  to interact with the TFF system, such as via a program  (e.g., a Web browser) in memory  to programmatically or interactively obtain information about available tasks and provide results information for performed tasks. When information is received at the computing system  about available tasks, the information is stored in this example embodiment with current task information  in storage  (e.g., temporarily until performance of the task is completed).","The TFF system and its modules (not shown) may also access and use various task-related and user-related information on storage  or elsewhere, such as information stored in one or more databases . In addition, in some embodiments the TFF system may also interact with other optional systems  executing in memory  and\/or other optional computing systems  to perform additional related functionality, such as to perform payment processing in order to provide payments to human task performers on behalf of task requesters and\/or to obtain qualification information from third-party qualification issuing authorities.","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computing systems , ,  and  are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The TFF system may instead be executed by multiple interacting computing systems or devices, and computing system  may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated, including through one or more networks such as the Internet or via the World Wide Web (\u201cWeb\u201d). More generally, a \u201cclient\u201d or \u201cserver\u201d computing system or device may comprise any combination of hardware or software that can interact, including (without limitation) desktop or other computers, network devices, PDAs, cellphones, wireless phones, pagers, electronic organizers, Internet appliances, television-based systems (e.g., using set-top boxes and\/or personal\/digital video recorders), and various other consumer products that include appropriate inter-communication capabilities. In addition, the functionality provided by the discussed TFF system modules may in some embodiments be combined in fewer modules or distributed in additional modules. Similarly, in some embodiments the functionality of some of the modules may not be provided as part of the TFF system and\/or other additional functionality may be available.","Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that, while various items are discussed or illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used, these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively, in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and\/or components may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing system via inter-computer communication. Some or all of the system modules and\/or data structures may also be stored (e.g., as software instructions or structured data) on a computer-readable medium, such as a hard disk, a memory, a network, or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection. The system modules and data structures can also be transmitted via generated data signals (e.g., as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal) on a variety of computer-readable transmission mediums, including wireless-based and wired\/cable-based mediums, and can take a variety of forms (e.g., as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal, or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames). Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly, the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.","As previously noted, in at least some embodiments human task requesters submit tasks to the electronic marketplace that are available to be performed by human task performers. The types of tasks that can be submitted and performed may vary in various embodiments. In particular, in some embodiments the tasks are each cognitive human performance tasks that use cognitive and\/or other mental skills of human task performers, such as to use human judgment capabilities to form an opinion related to one or more subjective bases, to use human discernment and\/or perception skills to select information (e.g., by analyzing audio and\/or video information, such as to perform pattern recognition), to use human reasoning skills (e.g., based on common-sense reasoning), etc. More generally, in at least some embodiments the tasks to be performed are human performance tasks that are selected based on their susceptibility to performance by humans, whether because automated systems are not currently capable of performing the tasks or because human task performers can perform the tasks more cheaply, rapidly, and\/or accurately. For example, while automated text translation tools may translate text between languages at a limited level of proficiency, human translators with appropriate qualifications may be able to perform the translations with a significantly higher proficiency level. In addition, in some embodiments some or all of the tasks include questions to be answered by the task performers, such as to select from an enumerated set of potential answers or to more generally generate an appropriate answer. The results of task performance can also take various forms in various embodiments, including answers to questions, a selection by a task performer of one or more options provided as part of the task, a manipulated form of information provided to the task performer, a categorization or other analysis of information provided to the task performer, etc. Additional information regarding tasks and task results is discussed elsewhere.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which a specific form of electronic marketplace provides various specific types of capabilities and functionalities with respect to various specific types of tasks, and interacts with task requesters and task performers in specific types of ways. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations, including with other types of tasks, with types of programmatic interfaces and\/or access mechanisms that do not use Web services, and in situations other than with an electronic marketplace, and that the invention is not limited to the exemplary details provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2G"},"In particular,  illustrates an example of a task submission message that a task requester can programmatically provide to the electronic marketplace in order to describe a task that is available to be performed. In this example, the task is of a type identified by the task requester as being \u201cImageChoice\u201d (as shown in line ), such as based on a previous specification by the task requester of that task type or instead based on a predefined type of task provided by the electronic marketplace. The task in this example involves answering the question of which one of 4 specified photographs best shows a specified subject (which in this example is a business in Seattle by the name of \u201cWildboar Tavern,\u201d as indicated in lines -), with the answer being the selected photograph. The task may be, for example, one of thousands or millions of related tasks for a task requester who is creating a directory of businesses with associated photographs.

The message also indicates various criteria in lines - regarding task performers who are allowed to perform the task, which in this example does not include any specific qualification criteria (as shown in line ) or any specific task performers who are identified as being allowed to perform the task (as shown in line ), but does specify one task performer in lines - who is excluded from performing the task. Timeout information in lines - indicates that the task will remain open for performance for 172,800 seconds (or 48 hours), but that an assignment of the task to a task performer will be kept open for only 60 seconds before the task becomes available to others. The message further indicates in lines - the supplied photographs to be analyzed, and in lines - indicates an application that will provide functionality for comparing the images (e.g., by displaying all four photographs along with a control for indicating which photograph was selected). In response to submitting this message, the task requester receives a message (not shown) indicating that the task information was received and including a unique task ID of \u201c109234875\u201d that was generated for referencing the task.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 2B","b":["2","3","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["3","5","6","7","10","31"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 2E-2G","FIG. 2E"],"b":["2","5"]},"In response, the electronic marketplace may provide an example message as illustrated in , which indicates two types of available tasks.

When information is to be analyzed as part of a task, that information can be provided to a task performer in a variety of ways, such as from the TFF system along with other task-related information, by providing a link or other indicator to the task performer to allow the task performer to retrieve the information (e.g., from the TFF system, from the task requester for the task, from a location or source external to the TFF system, etc.).","As one specific example, a task requester may submit tasks on behalf of a store (e.g., a Web store) that each request at least two human task performers to submit a specified type of data that is missing for one or more items offered by the store (e.g., performance specifications for a stereo). The first two human task performers that submit the same (or sufficiently similar) data for a task will each receive payment (e.g., $0.25), thus providing information with some degree of reliability in a manner that minimizes overhead for the task performers and the task requester. As another examples, tasks may include analyzing results of task performance from other task performers, such as to corroborate or verify the accuracy or other aspect of interest of the results (e.g., to have a human task performer with a higher level or qualification and\/or additional qualifications review the results from less-qualified task performers), to compare results from multiple task performers for the same or related tasks (e.g., to compare performance of human task performers to automated task performers, such as for research purposes, or to compare performance of different groups of human task performers), to analyze results in an attempt to determine whether the task performer is human or not (e.g., for research purposes, or to verify or corroborate the identity and\/or qualifications of a task performer), etc.","As previously noted, in some embodiments a variety of types of user qualifications can be specified and used, and may further in some embodiments each be associated with a specified qualification type. Such qualification types may include a variety of associated information in various embodiments, including a name (e.g., for later reference purposes), a rating scale to indicate allowed values (e.g., any floating point number, true\/false, an enumerated ranked set of values, etc.), indications of one or more entities or entity types who may issue specific qualifications of the qualification type to users, expiration conditions (e.g., an expiration date\/time) or other indications of how and when qualifications of the type are effective, an indication of the user (e.g., a unique user identifier) who specified the qualification type (e.g., to limit who can modify, delete and\/or view information about the qualification type), etc. In some embodiments, each qualification may be stored in or as part of a qualification data structure that may contain some or all of the indicated types of associated information, whether using a qualification data structure specific to a specified qualification type or independent of any specific qualification type. In addition, for embodiments in which multiple instances or versions of the TFF system are operating, or in which other types of systems with overlapping types of functionality may interact, the specified qualification types may further have an associated indication of the system at which the qualification type is specified. Moreover, in some embodiments users may be allowed to define new qualification types for use within the system.","As previously noted, task performer qualifications can also take various forms in various embodiments, including self-assertions by a user of qualifications that they possess, human-generated ratings of human task performers by other humans based on prior task performances by the task performers (e.g., feedback from task requesters who supplied the tasks and\/or ratings by other reviewers of the past performances), and credentials supplied by third-party authorities (e.g., educational degrees or other accomplishments from specified educational institutions, awards and other recognitions from specified organizations or contests, recognitions of levels of training or knowledge, etc.). One form of credential that may be used in some embodiments is a reputation or other rating of a user that is supplied by a third party as a service, such as for a fee. A discussion of techniques related to generating and providing user rating information that could be used in some embodiments for user qualifications is included in pending commonly-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/646,341, filed Aug. 22, 2003 and entitled \u201cManaging Content Based On Reputation,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Task performer qualifications may also include various quantitative measurements by the electronic marketplace of tracked activities of human task performers, including measurements related to a specific task, average and\/or cumulative measurements over a specified group of multiple tasks and\/or a specified period of time, and information about a rate of change for one or more measurements over one or more specified periods of time. A non-exclusive list of types of measurements that may be used in various embodiments include the number of tasks assigned to a task performer, the number or percentage of tasks assigned to a task performer that are completed, the number or percentage of tasks completed by a task performer that are approved or rejected (e.g., by the task requester), the number or percentage of assigned tasks that are explicitly abandoned (or \u201cdropped\u201d) by a task performer before completion, the number or percentage of assigned tasks that are withdrawn from a human task performer before completion (e.g., by the electronic marketplace for failure to complete the task within a specified time limit), the number or percentage of tasks that are offered to a task performer that are refused (if an embodiment includes offering tasks to task performers), an amount of time taken before performing assigned tasks (e.g., an average or distribution over time), etc. In some embodiments, task requesters may also be given qualifications based on quantitative measurements by the electronic marketplace of tracked activities, such as the number of submitted available tasks from a task requester, the number or percentage of submitted tasks that are removed before assignment by a task requester, the number or percentage of completed tasks that are approved or rejected by a task requester, the number or percentage of submitted tasks that are modified by a task requester, the timeliness of a task requester in providing payment when due, etc. In addition, in some embodiments task performers may be able to provide qualifications for task requesters by rating them, such as for task performers that have been involved in performance of tasks submitted by those task requesters. Such ratings may be based on, for example, the reasonableness of the task requester in categorizing their submitted tasks, in providing appropriate compensation for the level of task difficulty, in providing payment after satisfactory task results are provided, etc.","In some embodiments, the electronic marketplace may also provide rankings of task performers relative to other task performers on the basis of one or more of the various types of qualifications, and a task performer's ranking level could further be used as a qualification (e.g., a performer in the top 10% for a specified quantitative measurement). More generally, a performer qualification can in some embodiments include any information about a performer that can be measured or identified.","Thus, as previously noted, a variety of types of information may serve as qualifications in some embodiments. More generally, in some embodiments any user may specify any qualification for any user (including themselves), with the qualification measuring any dimension or aspect, using any rating scale, and may further include objective and\/or subjective qualifications. The meaning or context of a qualification may in some embodiments be maintained externally to the TFF system (e.g., by the issuers of the qualifications and\/or task requesters that use them as criteria for tasks being submitted), such that the TFF system performs tracking of and matching of qualifications as arbitrary data values without knowledge or use of the meaning of the qualifications. Thus, in such embodiments any user can act as their own issuing authority to issue qualifications, and to later use the qualifications by searching for users that have them and\/or tasks that include them in their task criteria. In addition, in some embodiments qualifications may be issued to and used for entities that are not directly associated with users of the TFF system, such as qualifications for various types of third-party entities (e.g., issuers of qualifications).","In addition, in some embodiments the activities of users with other systems may be used as qualifications or in other manners, such as based on importing data from such other systems. For example, in some embodiments the TFF system may be affiliated with or otherwise receive information related to shopping-related activities of users, such as with a Web retailer or other online merchant. Types of information that may be obtained and used from a retailer's system include the user's browsing history, search history, click-stream history, click-through history, purchase or rental history, payment and\/or credit history, returns history, history of service-related activities (e.g., frequency and number of calls to customer service), use of discounts and purchase incentives, contributions of content and\/or information (including various details about such contributions, such as length, subject matter, frequency of submission, quality as judged by other users, etc.) provided by the user (e.g., reviews of items, lists or groups of items of interest, etc.), participation in various community-based features, reputation within the system (e.g., based on voting or other rating by other users), browser and browsing device used, etc. Similarly, qualification and other information from the TFF system may in some embodiments be able to be exported to other systems for use by those other systems. In addition, when such types of information are available, they can also be used in other ways. For example, if recommendation information is available for a user based on a relationship of the user to other users, such recommendation information may be used as qualification information for the user (e.g., this user is likely to want to do tasks of a certain type) and\/or to recommend tasks to a task performer (e.g., other task performers similar to you perform tasks of this type).","A non-exclusive list of various example qualifications includes the following:","C++ programming Level 2 test certification, issued by Professor Bob Smith of Stanford University, test score 95% (Jan. 13, 2005, 10:03 GMT; expires 5 years from issuance)","C++ programming recommendation certificate, issued by Kernighan & Ritchie, \u201cExpert\u201d rating (Jan. 13, 2005, 10:03 GMT; no expiration date)","Able to distinguish pornography from non-pornography according to community standards prevalent in St. Louis, Mo., issued by myself, \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d (Jun. 27, 2006, 14:18 PDT)","Completes tasks requiring a self-issued \u201cAble to distinguish pornography from non-pornography according to community standards prevalent in St. Louis, Mo.\u201d qualification with over 90% acceptance rate, issued by TFF system, 1000 tasks completed with acceptance rate of 98% (Jun. 27, 2006, 14:18 GMT, based on performance results in TFF system from Jan. 14, 2005, 9:00 GMT through the present)","Dialysis patient unable to eat solid food, issued by the Mayo Clinic, (no value) (Jan. 15, 2005, 22:47 EST)","Scholastic Aptitude Test taken, issued by Educational Testing Service, Princeton, N.J., scores verbal=508, math=518 (Oct. 1, 2004, expiry date 6 years from issuance)","Qualified to practice law in the state of California, issued by the State Bar of California, \u201cactive member\u201d and \u201cmember in good standing\u201d (Oct. 3, 2004; date of bar admission May 15, 1994; continued status contingent on compliance with continuing legal education requirement, with next compliance period ending on or before Jan. 31, 2005).","Has published at least two reviews of popular English-language novels in The New York Times Book Review, issued by The New York Times, total number of such reviews published by the reviewer to date (Jun. 15, 2005, 12:01 EDT).","Is a considerate person, issued by Jeanette Smith of Geneva, Switzerland, \u201c (Feb. 29, 2004, 12:32 CET).","Information about qualification-related activities can also be tracked and stored in various ways. For example, performance-related qualification scores could be tracked for all tasks, regardless of task type and\/or required qualifications. Alternatively, activities could be tracked for particular types of tasks or groups of related tasks (e.g., to determine that a task performer completes tasks with qualification \u2018A\u2019 95% of the time but completes tasks with qualification \u2018B\u2019 only 80% of the time). Similarly, activities could be tracked for categories of tasks, such as to determine that a task performer completes \u2018pornography identification\u2019 tasks correctly 100% of the time, but only completes \u2018czech-english translation\u2019 tasks satisfactorily 80% of the time.","When searching for information related to qualifications and\/or tasks, the TFF system in some embodiments allows a variety of types of searches to be performed. A non-exclusive list of example searches that a user could execute includes the following:","All tasks that I created\/accepted, and status\/progress of same (e.g., by a task requester and\/or task performer)","All tasks currently available for acceptance, including the necessary qualifications for each task and the payment\/reward for each (e.g., by a task performer)","All qualification types in the system that have been added in the last 24 hours (e.g., by any user)","All users to whom new qualifications have been issued in the last week (e.g., by any user with sufficient permissions)","All users having a nickname attribute with a value of \u201cJill\u201d (e.g., by anyone with sufficient permissions to see user nicknames)","Which available tasks have prices <$1?

(e.g., by a task requester)","How many task requesters of available tasks have qualification B? (e.g., by a task performer, such as a task performer who will only do tasks from certain task requesters)","How many users have qualifications X and (Y or Z) but not W? Of these, which ones have qualification X with a value above 90%? (e.g., by anyone)","Which task performers completed tasks requiring qualification X this week? What percent of their total completed tasks were approved by the requesters? (e.g., by anyone)","Of all qualification types containing \u201cC++ \u201d in the name field, what percent were created in the twelve-month period ending Jun. 30, 2004? (e.g., by anyone)","How many qualifications containing the string \u201cSt. Louis\u201d in their name were issued last month by or on behalf of Issuer ABC? (e.g., by anyone)","In some embodiments, the system further provides functionality to assist in authenticating or otherwise corroborating information about users, such as identities of users, specified qualifications of users, and other kinds of attributes of users. In particular, various information may be obtained and used to serve as evidence to corroborate one or more pieces of information about users, such as by obtaining information about a user's past activities (e.g., feedback and\/or rating information related to the activities), \u201ctestimonials\u201d or other assertions from others as to the accuracy of information about a user, information about a user's reputation, information about a user's status within a community or group (e.g., a social networking group), and more generally any observable indicia that can serve to corroborate user information. The corroborative information may be obtained in various ways, including from third-party sources and\/or from a user whose information is being corroborated, and the obtaining of the corroborative information may be initiated in various ways, including as initiated by a user who is supplying corroborative information and\/or initiated in an automated manner (e.g., based on a need for the corroborative information). In addition, in some embodiments corroboration is further enhanced by using additional techniques, such as by monitoring activities of a user and\/or by occasionally challenging a user (e.g., by giving the user a short test) to verify information about the user (e.g., to obtain information to confirm or contradict a user's qualifications and\/or identity).","As one example of corroborating users' identities based on evidence or other information from third parties, the third party may be an issuer of credit cards and\/or debit cards, with such a card providing evidence that the cardholder name on the card is the actual name of the cardholder. A variety of other types of evidence or information associated with third parties may similarly be used to provide information about a user's identity, including information about a bank account or other financial account of a user, government-issued information for a user (e.g., a driver's license, passport, social security number, voting identity card, etc.), other government records (e.g., property records), etc. In such situations, a user may obtain such evidence from the third party and later provide the evidence to the system, or alternatively the system may in some embodiments directly interact with a third party to obtain such evidence for a user. For example, the system may interact with a third-party card issuer or government agency, or instead with a third party that provides a service involving verifying users' actual identities based on appropriate evidence and then providing assurances of the verified actual identity information to others upon request.","As previously noted, various types of evidence or other corroborative information related to users' identities can be obtained in various ways in various embodiments, and can be used in various ways to identify and\/or corroborate a user's identity. For example, in some embodiments information about a user's identity may be obtained by using information stored by a telephone service provider. In some such embodiments, a user may be provided with a toll-free number of a system performing identity corroboration activities, and when the user calls that toll-free number, the entity can gather user identity information provided by the telephone service provider with that call (e.g., a number from which the user is calling and a name associated with that number), such as for use in corroborating an actual name that the user previously provided. Information may be gathered about users in similar manners from other third parties that have similar information, such as by using Caller ID technology with non-toll-free numbers, doing a reverse number lookup on a phone number provided by a user in order to identify the name of the user associated with that phone number, gathering information about a user based on an electronic communication sent by the user (e.g., based on an email address used by the user, a domain name of the user, an instant messaging or other message sender identity, etc.), and\/or gathering information stored by other providers of services to the user (e.g., an Internet Service Provider, utility companies, educational institutions, medical facilities, etc.). More generally, in some embodiments the system may provide a predefined API and\/or one or more Web services via which others can provide corroborative and other information about users.","In some embodiments, information about users' identities may further be obtained and\/or corroborated based on groups to which the users belong and\/or other affiliations of the users. For example, a user may be able to demonstrate membership or other affiliation with a group or organization that provides publicly available information about its members or other affiliated users, thus providing some corroboration that the user's asserted identity is accurate based on the asserted identity being in the publicly available membership or affiliation information. Alternatively, a user may be part of a social networking group or other group of users such that one or more other users of the group will attest to an identity of the user. In such embodiments, a user may provide contact and other information about one or more of such other users (e.g., email addresses), and a system performing identity corroboration activities may then use the provided information to assist in corroborating the user's identity, such as by using the contact information to query those other users to provide corroborative statements or other information about the user's identity. In addition, when information from other users is used to corroborate information about a user (e.g., based on a social networking group), an additional factor that may be considered is whether a group of users is merely acting as a self-corroborating body such that users of the group are corroborated only by each other, or whether other external evidence is available to provide additional corroboration.","After corroborative information is obtained, it may be used in various ways. In some embodiments, one or more pieces of corroborative information for a piece of user information (e.g., a user qualification) may be presented or otherwise provided with the user information, such as to allow the recipient of the user information to evaluate its accuracy, credibility and reliability based on the associated corroborative information. In other embodiments, the system may attempt to automatically assess the corroborative information in order to determine a confidence level or value or other assessment of the user information being corroborated, such as based on a type of the corroborative information, a degree of correspondence between the corroborative information and the information being corroborated, and\/or on the source of the corroborative information (e.g., to affect the weight given the corroborative information, such as based on a reputation of the source). In addition, in some embodiments some of the types of corroboration-related activities may be performed for a fee, such as from the user whose information is being corroborated.","A particular type of performer qualification that is available in some embodiments relates to performance of a human task performer on one or more qualifying examinations. For example, a task requester who plans to submit multiple tasks of a similar type may first create a task with a known or desired performance result. That task may then be made available via the electronic marketplace as a qualifying examination task for performance by human task performers that are interested in performing other later tasks for the task requester. After a human task performer provides results for the qualifying examination task, those results can be graded relative to the known or desired results in order to determine whether and\/or at what level the human task performer can successfully perform the task. A specified level of performance for the qualifying examination task (e.g., having a minimum specified score, or scoring at a minimum percentile relative to other human task performers) can then be used as a performer qualification criteria for later tasks by that task requester. Such qualifying examination tasks can be performed in various ways in various embodiments, including with or without a fee paid to successful performers of the task, with a fee paid by task performers for a task performance attempt and\/or completion, as a task available to any task performers or to only task performers that meet other specified criteria (e.g., a first specified number of human task performers to successfully pass the test, to human task performers who have other specified qualifications, etc.), and as a task that is explicitly identified to task performers as a qualifying examination or that is not identified as such.","In addition to performer qualification criteria, task requesters can also specify a variety of other types of criteria for tasks. For example, in some embodiments task requesters may specify criteria related to when a task is to be performed, such as an expiration time period for initial assignment to a human task performer and\/or an expiration time limit for a human task performer to provide results of task performance after a task has been assigned to them. A task requester may also in some embodiments specify information about a format in which results are to be supplied, including by supplying information to the task performer related to the results format (e.g., a response form to be completed by the human task performer, or an executable results program that the human task performer is to use to provide results and\/or to perform the task). The performer qualification criteria and other types of criteria can also be specified in various forms, including as an exact match and as a minimum or maximum threshold, and for various activities related to a task (e.g., to allow task assignment; to verify performance results as being satisfactory; to determine whether a value of a task performer's qualification is sufficient, such as based on a generated confidence level or value for appropriateness of the qualification value; to determine whether a task performer's qualification is sufficiently corroborated, such as based on a generated confidence level or value based on a degree or amount of corroboration; etc.). Such thresholds may also be specified by other users (e.g., task performers) and\/or automatically by the TFF system in other situations and embodiments.","In addition, in some embodiments task requesters may supply additional task-related information to assist task performers in identifying appropriate or interesting tasks, such as one or more categories for the task (e.g., based on a type of the task) and\/or one or more keywords corresponding to the task. Such category and\/or keyword information can then later be used by task performers when searching for and\/or browsing for tasks of interest. In other embodiments, such category and\/or keyword information may instead be automatically generated by the electronic marketplace based on analysis of information related to the task (e.g., by using a textual description of the task provided by the task requester, by using historical information about tasks supplied by task requesters, by using information that is supplied with the task to be analyzed, by using information about criteria specified for the task, etc.).","As previously noted, in at least some embodiments the task requests may also each specify one or more fees to be paid by the task requester to one or more task performers for successful performance of a task. In such embodiments, the fee can be specified to be paid under any of a variety of circumstances, including in a manner related to a specified state of a task (e.g., to the first task performer whose performance results are explicitly accepted by the task requester, to the first task performer whose performance results are automatically accepted by the electronic marketplace, to the first task performer who supplies performance results to the electronic marketplace, to the first task performer to whom a requested task is assigned, etc.). In other situations, multiple task performers may receive payment for performance of a task, such as the first X task performers that provide results (where X is a specified number by the task requester), multiple task performers whose results are in agreement and form a specified level (e.g., a majority) of performance results from X task performers, etc.","In other embodiments, payment for task requests can be determined in other ways, such as based on bidding by task performers (e.g., as part of a standard or Dutch auction), as a variable rate that is dependent on a degree or amount of success in providing satisfactory performance results, etc. In addition, in some embodiments the task requester may allow the electronic marketplace to specify the associated payment for a task (e.g., for a fee), such as based on a category of the task, on dynamic pricing based on current conditions at the time of task request, as part of a premium service for which the electronic marketplace guarantees some aspects of the results (e.g., a maximum time to receive performance results, a minimum level of performance results, etc.). Moreover, in some embodiments the system provides information to task requesters to assist them in manually pricing tasks, such as by providing historical pricing information for tasks of the same type or for other related tasks, by providing summary information about current pricing and current pricing trends, etc.","After payment is determined to be provided to one or more task performers for a task, the payment can be made in a variety of ways. In some embodiments the electronic marketplace or an associated system may provide accounts to task requester and\/or task performer users, and if so payments may be made from those accounts of task requesters and\/or to those accounts of task performers. In other embodiments, the electronic marketplace may also interact with third-party systems in order to effect payment, such as credit card companies, banks, etc. In addition, in some embodiments a variety of other types of payments could be made, whether in addition to or instead of payments from task requesters to task performers, such as payments to the electronic marketplace from task requesters and\/or task performers for any of the functionality provided by the electronic marketplace, and\/or such as payments to task requesters from task performers for performing tasks of the task requesters. More generally, in some embodiments payments and other rewards can be specified to flow from any one or more parties to any one or more other parties, whether task performers, task requesters, the TFF system, external parties, etc. A discussion of payment-related techniques that could be used to make payments in some embodiments is included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/894,347, filed Jul. 19, 2004 and entitled \u201cAutomatic Authorization Of Programmatic Transactions,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","After a task request has been submitted to the electronic marketplace, task performers can obtain information about available tasks in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, task performers will make requests to the electronic marketplace to identify tasks that are currently available that meet specified indicia, such as all currently available tasks or tasks whose specified qualification criteria are satisfied by the current qualifications of the task performer. While some such task information requests may be made interactively in some embodiments, in other embodiments at least some such requests may instead be made in a programmatic manner, such as by using a specialized program or instructions (e.g., a client-side program, macro, plug-in, etc.) that is designed to retrieve such information for a task performer (e.g., that is obtained from the electronic marketplace or from a task requester for their tasks). In addition to searching for a task based on qualifications of the task performer, the task performers can also specify a variety of other types of information about tasks to identify, such as tasks available from specified task requesters, tasks in specified categories or having specified keywords, tasks having specified associated payments or other associated criteria (e.g., expiration date), tasks from task requesters who satisfy specified requester qualification criteria, etc.","In addition to searching for tasks, task performers can also request that tasks be assigned to them in various ways, such as by identifying one or more specific tasks of interest and\/or by identifying tasks that meet specified conditions (e.g., based on task criteria, an associated reward for a task, information about or an identity of a task requester who submitted the task, etc.). After a task has been assigned to a task performer, the task performer may then interact with the electronic marketplace (whether interactively or programmatically) to provide performance results information based on performance of the task. In addition, in some embodiments a task performer may specify in various ways that they desire to receive a string of assignments of related tasks, such as tasks of a specified task type. By creating such a \u201cpipeline\u201d of incoming tasks, the task performer may be able to perform the tasks more efficiently (e.g., if sufficient tasks are assigned to a task performer to allow them to constantly have a queue of available tasks to be performed), and correspondingly may be charged a fee in some embodiments for receiving such functionality. The creation of such a string of task assignments may be performed in various ways, such as by registering a notification and\/or assignment request with the TFF system for a specified type of task, by repeatedly executing a search or assignment request with the TFF for a specified type of task, by using an application program to automatically perform such repeated searches, etc.","In some embodiments, the determination of whether a task is to be assigned to a task performer is based at least in part on information specified for the task by the task requester. For example, each task may allow a specified number (e.g., one) of simultaneous or sequential assignments of a task to task performers. Moreover, in some embodiments an assignment of a task is made in such a manner as to lock that assignment (e.g., for a specified period of time) so that it is not available to other task performers, while in other embodiments such locking may not be performed. Thus, for example, if a task requester desired results as soon as possible and was willing to pay only the first human task performer who provided satisfactory results, the task requester could specify that the task be made available to any number of human task performers and that it not be locked upon assignment, resulting in a race between task performers to be the first to supply successful results. Alternatively, the task requester may instead desire satisfactory results from only a single task performer but may provide for the task to be locked after it is assigned to a human task performer to allow them a specified amount of time (e.g., a minute or a day) to provide satisfactory results before the task will be made available to other task performers.","As another example, the task requester may desire responses from multiple task performers (e.g., to enable comparison of multiple responses as an automated accuracy check), and if so may allow a specified number of simultaneous assignments (e.g., corresponding to the number of desired responses). When responses from multiple human task performers are obtained, they can be used in various ways, such as to generate an average of the various results, to identify results that are agreed upon by all or by a majority or by a median number, etc. In addition, in such situations the multiple task performers can be paid in various ways, such as to provide the same payment to all task performers who provided results, to provide payment only to task performers whose results were determined to be accurate or otherwise used (e.g., based on them being in a majority of the results), to pay differing amounts to different task performers (e.g., based on determined accuracy of the results, or promptness of providing the results), etc.","After a task performer has completed performance of a task and submitted the results of task performance to the electronic marketplace, the results are handled in a manner specified by the task requester. For example, in some embodiments such task results for a task may be immediately forwarded to the task requester for the task, while in other embodiments the task results may be stored until the task requester retrieves them (e.g., after receiving notification from the electronic marketplace of their availability). In addition, in some embodiments the task requester may have specified one or more criteria related to evaluating whether the performance results are satisfactory, and if so the electronic marketplace system may automatically perform such result verification based on those criteria before providing the results to the task requester. In some embodiments, the task requester will further receive additional information related to performance of the task, such as information about the identity of the task performer, while in other embodiments such additional information may not be available to the task requester.","As previously noted, in some embodiments payment to the human task performers will also be triggered by one or more activities related to the performance results, such as the supplying of the task results by the task performer or the approval of the task results by the task requester and\/or automated task verification activities. In addition, in some embodiments after task performance results are provided by task performers, the task requesters for those tasks may further be queried to provide human-generated ratings for the task performers (e.g., for use in qualification determinations for those task performers), such as related to adequacy and timeliness of the performance results, while in other embodiments the electronic marketplace could instead receive any such feedback information from the task requesters even when not explicitly solicited. Similarly, in some embodiments task performers may provide rating and other feedback information for task requesters that may be used for qualification determinations for those task requesters (whether in response to queries or otherwise), such as related to promptness and adequacy of payment, sufficiency of the description of the task, etc.","In embodiments in which quantitative measurements are made of task performers and\/or task requesters, such as for use as qualifications for those users, the electronic marketplace system further performs a variety of types of tracking activities in order to gather information for those quantitative measurements. In particular, in some embodiments each activity of a task performer and\/or task requester relative to a task is recorded and can be used as a quantitative measurement. In addition, at least some such tracking information can also be used for other purposes in at least some embodiments, such as to determine availability of and load on the electronic marketplace (e.g., to determine whether additional computing resources are needed or whether current computing resources are underutilized).","In addition to providing task information to task performers in response to requests, the electronic marketplace may in some embodiments provide functionality to automatically match task performers and new tasks as they become available, such as for a fee (e.g., a fixed amount, or a percentage of any payment provided to the task performer if they complete a task for which they are notified). For example, if a human task performer has previously supplied qualification information and\/or preference information regarding tasks of interest (e.g., tasks in specified categories, having specified key words, from specified task requesters, from requesters having specified qualifications, etc.), such as during an initial registration process, the electronic marketplace can perform automated matching for new tasks that are submitted in order to determine whether the human task performer satisfies any specified criteria for the task and would desire to be notified of the task. If so, the electronic marketplace can notify the task performer in a variety of ways, such as based on previously provided preference information regarding how and when they are to be notified. In addition, in some embodiments the automated matching may further automatically assign new tasks to appropriate task performers (e.g., in accordance with preference information specified by the performers), including locking the task assignments if appropriate for the task. In other embodiments, task performers may receive similar functionality using third-party functionality, such as an automated program that obtains information about new tasks from the electronic marketplace (e.g., based on polling) and performs the automated matching functionality for those new tasks on behalf of one or more of the task performers.","Matching of tasks and task performers may be provided in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments matching will be performed in a bi-directional manner, such as when tasks have criteria for task performers and task performers have conditions for tasks (e.g., attributes of the task and\/or of the task requester that submitted the task). In addition, a variety of other types of information may similarly be considered when performing matching. For example, in some embodiments a match may be time-sensitive (e.g., based on an urgency of a task) and\/or price-sensitive (e.g., when the price for performing the task varies over time, such as to increase the price over time until a task is performed or to instead decrease the price over time). Similarly, in some embodiments a variety of other types of information may be considered, such as legal constraints (e.g., to enforce a minimum or maximum limit on the number of tasks assigned to a task performer, such as for contractual or tax reasons, or to restrict performance of tasks in some embodiments and situations to task performers in a certain geographical area due to tax or national security reasons). In addition, some types of tasks may be restricted to certain types of task performers, such as only new task performers (e.g., to assist new task performers who may lack extensive qualifications) and\/or only experienced task performers.","In addition, in some embodiments and\/or for some types of tasks (e.g., tasks for which a task requester has requested and\/or purchased an enhanced, or \u201cconcierge,\u201d level of service), the system may facilitate task performance by attempting to locate a task performer to perform the task in various ways. For example, the system may in some embodiments assist task performers to enhance their qualifications, such as by recommending to them to acquire new qualifications (e.g., based on current and\/or projected demand for qualifications, or based on comparisons to other similar task performers with whom they may be competing for tasks), and may further assist the task performers in acquiring the new qualifications in some embodiments (e.g., by offering a qualification test to acquire the qualification, providing information on how to acquire a qualification from a third-party qualification issuer (or \u201cissuing entity\u201d), etc.). When an exact match for a task performer is not available, the system may also provide additional functionality to assist a task requester, such as to identify task performers who are closest to being a match and providing a ranked list based on the closeness of those task performers. The system may similarly rank tasks for task performers (e.g., in response to a search), such as to identify the tasks that are the closest match and\/or that possess other attributes of interest (e.g., having the highest reward) first. In addition, the system may in some embodiments attempt to identify external sources of qualification information and import additional qualification information, such as to identify a match that was not initially known due to a lack of complete qualification information.","In addition, while tasks may in some embodiments have associated categories and\/or keywords that are supplied by task requesters, in other embodiments the electronic marketplace system automatically categorizes tasks and\/or generates keywords for tasks based on analysis of information about the tasks, such as by analyzing similarities in attributes using data mining and other related analyses techniques. In a similar manner, in some embodiments the electronic marketplace may organize related task performers and\/or related task requesters into groups based on similarities in qualifications and other attributes. Such organization and categorization of tasks, task performers and\/or task requesters assists users of the electronic marketplace in identifying tasks and other parties of interest, such as other parties with whom to work or with whom to avoid working.","As previously noted, in some embodiments each task may be a simple stand-alone activity for which a task performer receives a task description (and optionally additional information to analyze) and provides results of task performance. In other embodiments, however, some or all of the tasks may instead have multiple stages and\/or multiple related successive activities by the task performer, including having multiple interactions (e.g., with the task requester, the TFF system and\/or one or more other executing applications) during and\/or between the stages or successive activities. In such embodiments, payment can be provided to a task performer in various ways, such as based on completion of all stages\/activities or instead based on completion of each of one or more intermediate stages\/activities.","In addition, while in some embodiments each of the task performers may be unrelated to (and even unknown to) other task performers, in other embodiments multiple task performers may instead be affiliated or related to each other in various ways, such as by being part of a single organization, by working together (e.g., as a group) when performing some or all tasks (e.g., to coordinate performance of related tasks and\/or to share task-related knowledge), etc. In at least some such embodiments, tasks may be submitted by one or more task requesters for performance by a group of multiple task performers (e.g., by a specified group, by a group that has at least a minimum number of members and\/or that has at most a maximum number of members, by a group that has one or more specified qualifications for the group, etc.), and\/or a group of multiple task performers may accept one or more tasks for performance by one or more members of the group even if the task requesters had not specified that those tasks were for performance by a group. In addition, when multiple users work together as a group, the group may in some embodiments by treated by the TFF system in a manner similar to a single user, such as to allow the group to be issued qualifications and\/or to have various types of associated information, as well as to in some embodiments automatically determined aggregate qualifications for a group based on the individual qualifications of group members.","Similarly, while in some embodiments each of the task requesters may be unrelated to (and even unknown to) other task requesters, in other embodiments multiple task requesters may instead be affiliated or related to each other in various ways, such as by being part of a single organization, by working together (e.g., as a group) for some or all tasks to be performed (e.g., to coordinate performance requests for related tasks, such as by identifying them as being related and\/or specifying criteria related to performance of a group of tasks), etc. In a related manner, in some embodiments groups of tasks may be identified as being related (e.g., based on indications received from the task requesters for the tasks), such as to coordinate performance of the tasks in the group in various ways (e.g., by collecting or aggregating performance results for all of the tasks, by assigning them to one or more task performers in a manner to facilitate the coordination of the performance, etc.). In addition, in some embodiments task requesters and\/or task performers may be recruited for participation in the system in a variety of ways, including on the basis of existing group membership or other affinity information (e.g., to identify people likely to have time to work as task performers, such as based on their status as being potentially retired due to their membership in a seniors-oriented group).","In some embodiments, additional security mechanisms are further employed to restrict access to at least some information for at least some users. For example, some information about tasks may not be made available to at least some task performers, such as to hide information about the existence of tasks or about certain task details from task performers who are not qualified to perform the task, to whom the task is not assigned, or who otherwise meet criteria specified by a task requester. Furthermore, some information about a task may be made available to a potential task performer only when certain conditions are satisfied, such as completion of a non-disclosure agreement or satisfaction of other specified criteria. Similarly, at least some information about the task requesters and\/or task performers may be hidden from at least some other task performers and\/or task requesters, such as to shield identities of users (e.g., to provide partial or total anonymity between a task requester who submits a task and a task performer who performs the task, or to limit information about a task performer or task requester to potential competitors), or to limit access to information about quantitative measurements or other qualifications in order to minimize attempts by participants in the marketplace to artificial manipulate rankings and other qualification information. In particular, in some embodiments at least some qualifications of task performers may be private to the task performers and\/or to task requesters who issued those qualifications to those task performers, such as to allow the task requesters to limit performance of their tasks to task performers in a manner that is not visible to other task performers who do not have those qualifications.","In some embodiments, the system further attempts to provide meta-information about other information in the system (e.g., results of task performance, appropriateness of a user's qualification, appropriateness of corroboration of a user's qualification, etc.), such as to provide a confidence value to a task requester regarding a likely appropriateness (e.g., accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, etc.) of results of task performance, to provide a confidence value to a user regarding a likely appropriateness (e.g., accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, etc.) of a qualification of a user (e.g., of a rating value for the user for the qualification), to provide a confidence value to a user regarding a likely appropriateness (e.g., accuracy, reliability, reproducibility, etc.) of corroboration of a qualification of a user, etc. Such confidence values may be generated or otherwise determined in various ways for task results, such as based on information obtained from other task performers than those who provided the results (e.g., by having multiple task performers perform a task and comparing the results, by having more-qualified task performers review the initially obtained task results, etc.), on comparison of the results to other results received for similar or related tasks, on automatically verifying whether the results satisfy criteria specified for the task, etc. Such confidence values may be generated or otherwise determined in various ways for users' qualifications and for corroboration of users' qualifications, including based on information provided by or otherwise associated with those users and\/or based on information provided by or otherwise associated with other users.","In some embodiments, the system further assists task requesters to obtain useful results in various ways, such as by providing insurance to recoup payments made for results that are not received or that turn out to be unsatisfactory, by providing an escrow service in which payments are held until they can be verified as satisfactory, by providing for appropriate contractual terms (e.g., binding arbitration) or other mechanisms to resolve disputes, etc. Some or all of these functionalities may be provided for a fee in some embodiments, such as a fee charged to the task requesters and\/or to the task performers involved in a transaction benefiting from the functionality provided. In addition, in some embodiments the system attempts to improve its performance over time by learning preferences of task requesters and\/or task performers, such as by monitoring their activities and\/or gathering feedback from them regarding prior activities.","The system and\/or the described techniques can also be used in other manners in some embodiments. As previously noted, the system may export various information in some embodiments for use by other systems, such as user qualification information and other types of user information. In addition, use of qualification information may be used for purposes of dating or other social or business networking in some embodiments, such as by submitting tasks having qualification criteria intended to match users whose qualifications satisfy the qualification criteria\u2014in this example, the task may be performed by identifying the one or more task performers who satisfy the task's associated qualifications or other criteria. In a similar manner, users matching specified criteria could similarly be found for other purposes in other embodiments, such as to identify appropriate users for a research study, polling, opinion taking, surveys, etc.","As previously noted, in some embodiments the TFF system assists in managing at least some types of interactions with users, such as to allow task requesters and\/or task performers to specify how certain types of task-related interactions are to occur. In particular, in some embodiments task requesters are allowed to specify how interactions are to occur with task performers who are performing their tasks, and in particular to specify one or more task interaction control (\u201cTIC\u201d) types for each of their submitted tasks. In at least some such embodiments, each TIC type is associated with a distinct combination of multiple types of processing to be performed when presenting task-related information to a task performer and\/or when obtaining results of the task performance from the task performer. When the TFF system interacts with a task performer to manage the performance of a task having a specified TIC type, the TFF system implements the combination of processing types for the specified TIC type to control those interactions.","In some embodiments, at least four types of user interaction processing may be specified for each TIC type, including a specified manner of manipulating information associated with a task before it is provided to a task performer (e.g., to prepare the information to be presented to the task performer), a specified manner of providing the manipulated information to the task performer (e.g., to control the presentation of the manipulated task information to the task performer), a specified manner of receiving or otherwise obtaining results of task performance from the task performer (e.g., to control how the task results are specified by and sent by the task performer), and a specified manner of manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester (e.g., to prepare the information to be presented or otherwise provided to the task requester). In this manner, each of the types of user interaction processing may be specified independently of the others, such as to transmit task information to a task performer using a first data format and\/or first transmission protocol and to receive task results from the task performer using a distinct second data format and\/or distinct second transmission protocol, and\/or to have task information specified in a first format and to have task results specified in a different format.","In addition, in at least some embodiments each specified manner of performing one of the types of user interaction processing may be implemented by a component containing executable information to implement that specified manner of processing. For example, each specified manner of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task information manipulation component, each specified manner of sending manipulated task information to a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task information provider component, each specified manner of receiving task results from a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task results receiver component, and each specified manner of manipulating received task results may be implemented by an appropriate task results manipulation component.","Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer include the following: using XSLT (\u201cextensible Style Language Transformation\u201d) to transform task data in XML format to HTML (\u201cHyperText Markup Language\u201d) format (e.g., for display to the task performer as a Web page formatted in a specific manner) or to another format (e.g., a different XML format); wrapping task data that is in a format presentable on the task performer's computing device (e.g., in \u201cFlash\u201d format to be presented by a Macromedia player on the task performer's computing device, or included as part of a Java applet executable on the task performer's computing device) in another format (e.g., HTML) for transmission to the task performer; encrypting the task information before it is sent to the task performer (e.g., in a manner so that it can be decrypted by the computing device of the task performer); modifying the form of the task information (e.g., to convert XML-based data to a chart\/graph\/table for presentation); manipulating the content of the task information (e.g., to transform text in one language to another), whether in addition to or instead of manipulating the information format; and acting as a pass-through mechanism that does not modify the task information. The task information to be manipulated can also take a variety of forms, including text, numerical data, one or more images, video data, audio information, etc.","Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer include the following: sending a Web page or other document type to the task performer for display or other presentation by a Web browser or other appropriate application program on a computing device of the task performer (e.g., using HTTP, WAP (or \u201cWireless Application Protocol\u201d), SSL (or \u201cSecure Sockets Layer\u201d), Secure HTTP, etc.); and sending executable code (e.g., a Java applet) to the computing device of the task performer in a manner to invoke an appropriate environment to execute the code (e.g., using JNLP (or \u201cJava Network Launching Protocol\u201d) to execute a Java applet). In some embodiments, the user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer may include selecting a protocol to be used in sending the task information and\/or may include causing a particular type of application on the task performer's computing device to receive and handle the task information (e.g., by causing that program to be invoked).","Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of obtaining results of task performance from the task performer include the following: receiving the task results via a provided Web service-based interface that a program on the task performer's computing device invokes to send the task results; receiving the task results as CGI data (e.g., via HTTP GET and\/or POST commands), such as from a form on a Web page displayed to the task performer; and receiving task results sent from an executing program on the task performer's computing device (e.g., a program invoked using a specified user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer), such as using a variety of communication techniques (e.g., CORBA, RPC, Java RMI (or \u201cRemote Method Invocation\u201d), by using ReST (or \u201cREpresentational State Transfer\u201d) to send XML data over HTTP, etc.).","Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester may include processing similar to that of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer. In addition, the manipulating of obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester may include the following: using XSD (\u201cXML Schema Definition\u201d) or DTD (\u201cDocument Type Definition\u201d) to convert task results data in CGI form to XML form; decrypting task results that were encrypted at the computing device of the task performer; modifying the form of or manipulating the content of the task results in various ways; and acting as a pass-through mechanism that does not modify the task results.","In some embodiments, multiple alternatives are provided by the TFF system for each of the types of user interaction processing, such as by implementing each alternative as a distinct component. Thus, for example, the alternatives for the manipulation of task information processing type may each be implemented by a corresponding task information manipulation component, and may include one or more distinct components that each have XSLT instructions for transforming data in XML format in a specified manner, a component including executable information to wrap task data in Flash format in an HTML wrapper, and a pass-through component that provides as output the same task information that it receives as input. Similar alternatives may be provided by the TFF system for each of the user interaction processing types.","In addition, in some embodiments the TFF system provides one or more predefined TIC types that are each associated with a distinct combination of components that includes at least one component of each of the user interaction processing types. In this manner, a task requester may specify a TIC type for a task being submitted by selecting one of the predefined TIC types. In addition, in some embodiments a task requester may specify multiple TIC types for a task (e.g., with the TIC types using differing types of processing for providing manipulated task information to a task performer), such as to allow task performers with computing devices having a greater variability of capabilities to perform the task. In addition, in some embodiments the TFF system may further facilitate the performance of a task by automatically selecting one of multiple specified TIC types for a task for use by a task performer, such as based on known or identifiable capabilities of the computing device of the task performer.","In addition to selecting predefined TIC types, the TFF system in some embodiments further allows users to define their own TIC types, such as for their own use and\/or the user of other users. In some embodiments the TIC type definition may include the user selecting a predefined component for each of the user interaction processing types, while in other embodiments a user may further be allowed to supply his\/her own components for each of one or more of the user interaction processing types (e.g., components designed to handle data that is formatted in a manner specific to a task type created by the user). In addition, in some embodiments the user-supplied components may perform the user interaction processing in different manners than those of predefined alternatives (e.g., a user-supplied component that combines the processing of two or more of the user interaction processing types, such as to both send task information to a task performer and receive task results information from the task performer) and\/or may perform various additional types of processing. Moreover, while in some embodiments the selected components for a TIC type interoperate in a predefined serial manner (with the task information manipulation component receiving the raw task data and sending the manipulated task information to the task information providing component, and with the task results obtaining component receiving the raw task results and sending them to the task results manipulation component), in other embodiments a user may be allowed to specify additional logic or relationships to define how the components interoperate. In addition, in some embodiments the selection of a component may depend on the components used before and\/or after the component being selected, and thus the types of components made available to a user defining a new TIC type may vary based on selections already made and\/or information specific to the task.","For illustrative purposes, some embodiments are described below in which specific types of user interactions are managed in specific ways, including by using various specific types of task information processing information in specific ways. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations, including with other types of task information processing and to manage other types of user interactions, and that the invention is not limited to the exemplary details provided.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0157","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12J","FIG. 12A","FIG. 2A"],"b":["2","4","6","35"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0158","num":"0157"},"figref":["FIG. 12B","FIG. 12A"],"b":["30","35","23","29"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0159","num":"0158"},"figref":["FIGS. 12C-12G","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12C","FIG. 12C","FIGS. 12D-12G"],"b":["4","7","8","23"]},"After the HTML output file is sent to a computing device of the task performer (e.g., by a manipulated task information provider processing component, not shown, that sends the data using the HTTP protocol, such as based on the manipulated task information provider processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task),  illustrates the display of the HTML output file to the task presenter as a Web page, such as on a Web browser on the computing device of the task performer. In this example, the displayed Web page shows a question  posed to the task performer, with multiple user-selectable image choices -displayed as possible answers to the question. In particular, in this example each of the choices  includes a displayed image and a user-selectable radio button control  that the task performer can select. After the selection is made, which in this example is of Image 4, the task performer clicks on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button  at the bottom of the screen to cause the results of the task performance to be sent back to the TFF system.","After the task results information is received at the TFF system (e.g., by a processing component, not shown, that obtains task results by receiving CGI data from the task performer, such as based on the task results obtainer processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task),  illustrates an example of task results manipulation processing type information for use in preparing the task results to be provided to the task requester that submitted the task, such as based on that task results manipulation processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task. In particular, in this example the processing information is implemented as another XSLT file component that can be used to convert the task results from the task performer to XML format so that they can be programmatically provided to the task requester. For example, line  shows that the output of the XSLT file will be \u201cxmI\u201d data, line  specifies that \u201c\/CGIData\u201d is to be matched in the results information, and lines - specify that the value of the \u201c@value\u201d parameter for the selected image is to be written to the output XML file as the desired data.  then illustrates the output XML file that results from the operation of the task results manipulation processing, with line  showing that the answer selected by the task performer was labeled \u201cImage4\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0162","num":"0161"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 1B","FIG. 1B","FIG. 13","FIG. 13","FIG. 1B","FIG. 13"],"b":["130","134","1343","1344","1346","130","1343","1344","1346"]},"In the illustrated embodiment, the Task Submission Receiver module receives submissions of tasks from task requesters and associates one or more TIC types with each of the submitted tasks, such as based on a specification of the TIC type for a task by the task requester submitting the task. In situations in which the task requester submits one or more tasks in an interactive manner, the Task Submission Receiver module may assist the identification of an appropriate TIC type by providing options for the TIC type to the task requester, such as based on the type of task(s) and\/or information associated with the task requester. The TIC type options may include predefined TIC types and\/or TIC types previously defined by the task requester, and in some embodiments the Task Submission Receiver may further allow a task requester to define a new TIC type for use with a task being submitted, such as based on interactions with the TIC Type Definer module. In other embodiments, the association of one or more TIC types with a task may instead be performed at times other than task submission, such as after the submission. After tasks are submitted and associated with one or more TIC types, information about the associated TIC types is included with the other information about the task in the database . During performance of the task, at least one of the associated TIC types will be used to control the task performance, and the associated TIC types may further be used in some embodiments to assist in initially selecting appropriate task performers for the task (e.g., based on those task performers having capabilities to receive task information and provide task results in a manner consistent with the processing types specified for the associated TIC types).","The Task Interaction Controller module in the illustrated embodiment controls the performance of tasks based on the TIC types associated with the tasks. In particular, when a task is to be performed by a task performer, the Task Interaction Controller module selects one of the TIC types associated with the task, and uses the types of information processing specified for the TIC type to control the task performance. In the illustrated embodiment, definitions of predefined system-provided TIC types (if any) are included in the database , and definitions of user-defined TIC types (if any) are included in the database . Each of the TIC type definitions specify multiple processing types to be used with the TIC type, and in some embodiments may specify logic or parameters to control how the multiple processing types interoperate. In some embodiments, each of the processing types is associated with an associated component or other grouping of processing information, with predefined system-provided components (if any) stored in the illustrated embodiment in database  and user-defined components (if any) stored in the illustrated embodiment in database . Thus, to control performance of a task based on an associated TIC type, the Task Interaction Controller module retrieves the TIC type definition from databases  or , retrieves the components specified in the TIC type definition from databases  and\/or , and executes those components in an appropriate manner to control the task performance. An appropriate TIC type associated with a task can be selected by the Task Interaction Controller module can be selected for use in various ways, such as based on the selected TIC type being the only TIC type associated with the task, on the selected TIC type being specified by the task performer, on the selected TIC type being preferred or needed for use with the computing device of the task performer based on the device's capabilities, etc.","The TIC Type Definer module in the illustrated embodiment allows users (e.g., task requesters) to define new TIC types for use in controlling tasks to be submitted, and may further in some embodiments allow users to supply or otherwise define new components for use with a TIC type being defined (e.g., to process information specified in a format and\/or task type specific to a task requester, or to provide additional capabilities, such as to encrypt and decrypt information sent to and received from a task performer in a specified manner). In other embodiments, users may not be allowed to define their own TIC types, and thus the TIC Type Definer module may not be present in those embodiments. The TIC type definition may be performed in various ways, such as by successively displaying or otherwise providing to a user each of the available alternatives for each of a series of types of information processing, such as based on predefined system-provided components. In embodiments and situations in which dependencies exist between different components or processing types, the module may further limit the provided alternatives based on the prior selections. After a new TIC type is defined, the module stores the definition in the database , and further stores any user-supplied components in the database .","In other embodiments, some of the types of illustrated functionality and\/or information may not be provided, and other types of information and\/or functionality may be available.
