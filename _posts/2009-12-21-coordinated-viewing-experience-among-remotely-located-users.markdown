title: Coordinated viewing experience among remotely located users
abstract: A method of viewing a content item is provided. The method includes receiving an encrypted content item and a network address of a key management system from a primary client device over a communications network. A session key is obtained over the communications network and the primary client device is notified that the session key has been obtained. An encrypted version of a content key is received over the communication network to decrypt the content item and content rights that determine access to the content item. The content rights restrict the content item from being rendered unless it is rendered in coordination with the rendering of the content item by the primary client device. The encrypted version of a content key is decrypted with the session key. The content item is rendered in accordance with the content rights by decrypting the content item with the content key.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Television programming and other video content are increasingly being delivered to consumers in new ways. For example, the digital video recorder is an example of a device that leverages the flexibility of digital media and its storage to provide a new level of convenience relating to television viewing as well as recording. Also, television programming and a myriad of other multimedia are increasingly finding a home on new devices. For example, television programming is no longer found solely on the television. Through computer networks, as well as other delivery mechanisms, television and other media content are increasingly becoming available on other devices, such as personal computers, mobile phones, PDAs, and other portable computing devices. The broader availability of media on these devices, as well as the inherent flexibility of digital media also provides a host of new ways for consumers to share content with friends, family, as well as the community at large.","One problem that arises when content is shared among users is that it becomes difficult for the content owner to enforce restrictions on the content's dissemination. For instance, if a user downloads a video clip to his or her mobile phone that is protected by a digital rights management scheme, it becomes difficult or impossible for the user to share the content with other users. Even if the content owner allows the user to share the content in a limited manner by transferring limited content rights, the process can be cumbersome for both the user sending the video clip and the user receiving the video clip. On the other hand, if the user downloads a video clip to his or her mobile phone that is not protected by any digital rights management scheme, the user can easily share the clip with others, but the content owner loses the ability to further control its dissemination.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a method of viewing a content item is provided. The method includes receiving an encrypted content item and a network address of a key management system from a primary client device over a communications network. A session key is obtained over the communications network and the primary client device is notified that the session key has been obtained. An encrypted version of a content key is received over the communication network to decrypt the content item and content rights that determine access to the content item. The content rights restrict the content item from being rendered unless it is rendered in coordination with the rendering of the content item by the primary client device. The encrypted version of a content key is decrypted with the session key. The content item is rendered in accordance with the content rights by decrypting the content item with the content key.","In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a method of sharing a content item with a secondary client device is provided. The method includes sending an encrypted content item and a network address of a key management system from a primary client device to a secondary client device over a communications network. Notification is received from the secondary client device that a session key has been obtained from a key management system. An encrypted version of the content key used to decrypt the content item and content rights that determine access to the content item is caused to be sent to the secondary client device over the communications network, wherein the session key is configured to decrypt the encrypted copy of the content key and the content rights restrict the content item from being rendered unless it is rendered in coordination with rendering of the content item by the primary client device.","In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a network-enabled client device is provided. The client device includes one or more processors for executing machine-executable instructions and one or more machine-readable storage media for storing the machine-executable instructions. When executed by the one more processors the instructions implement a) a content sharing component for (i) causing an encrypted content item and associated content rights to be communicated over a communications network to other network-enabled client devices so that it can be rendered by the other network-enabled client devices in accordance with the content rights and (ii) causing a decryption key to be provided to the other network-enabled client device that receive the content item. The content rights restrict the content item from being decrypted by the other network-enabled client devices unless it is rendered in coordination with rendering of the content item by the network-enabled client device that causes the content item to be communicated. The instructions also implement a text message component arranged for sending and receiving text-based messages, a user interface arranged to support user interactivity and for presenting the content item to a user, and processing logic. The processing logic is provided to cause the text message component to send a text-based message to one of the other network-enabled client devices that has received the content item indicating that one or more rules specified by the content rights have been satisfied so that the content item can be decrypted by the one other network-enabled client device The rule requires that the content item is being or has been presented at least in part by the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","20","10","50","10","20"]},"The client devices  and  communicate with one another over a communications network . The communications network  may include portions of one or more network types as shown in , including a mobile phone network, mobile data network, public switched telephone network, and the Internet. If the client devices are wireless devices, for instance, they may communicate primarily over mobile phone and data networks. More particularly, if the wireless devices are cellular phones, illustrative mobile networks that may be employed include a 2G radio system such as a GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), which is based on TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) technology. In another example, the cellular network is a 3G radio system which is based on a GSM system which utilizes WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) technology or a UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), 4G, LTE, WiMax, or WiFi. The client devices may also use the mobile networks to communicate with other networks such as packet-switched networks, including for example, a packet-switched network that operates in accordance with the Internet suite of protocols, and which, as shown in , may generally be referred to as the Internet. Accordingly, communications network  may be representative of any number of logically and\/or physically distinct networks, which in any individual case may or may not share infrastructure and other resources in whole or in part.","As previously mentioned, sharing video and other content with communities of people is becoming increasingly popular. Web sites which host content uploaded by others for sharing, such as YouTube, are also becoming quite popular. Individuals are often no longer satisfied with merely watching content, they want to participate in the experience and\/or share their experience with others. In a common video sharing scenario, a first user sees a video clip or other video source that he or she believes would be of interest to a second user, and correspondingly sends some type of electronic message to the second user. Typically, the message includes a link to the video, or includes the video itself, thereby allowing the second user to view the video. In a PC environment, the procedure may involve the first user sending an e-mail to the second user, where the e-mail includes a URL of the video, or includes the video as a file attachment. Similarly, in mobile communication environments, the procedure may involve the first user sending a message linking to or encapsulating the video, e.g., an MMS message. Moreover, users who wish to share content often wish to consume the content in a coordinated or even simultaneous manner so that they can participate in a shared experience, similar to what they experience when sitting in the same room with friends or family, which allows them to exchange commentary and the like.","When users are allowed to easily share content in the manner described above it is no longer under the control of the content owner, distributor, or the like and thus the content may be freely disseminated without the content owner's approval or authorization. Since in some cases the shared content may only represent a small portion of an entire program, it may be thought that the free dissemination of a single clip does not adversely impact the authorized distribution of the complete program. In fact, the content owner may view the dissemination of such a clip as advertising that may increase demand for authorized copies of the complete program. However, as bandwidth and electronic storage increase in availability, it becomes easier for users to share the entirety of a program, which would decrease demand for authorized copies of the program, thereby decreasing the content owner's potential revenue.","The aforementioned problem can be overcome by employing a digital rights management (DRM) scheme in which the content is encrypted so that it can only be decrypted by authorized users or devices. In this way unauthorized use and distribution of the content can be prevented. The DRM scheme may employ encryption and decryption keys, which are parameters used by encryption and decryption algorithms, respectively. Deploying incorrect keys produces different results during both encryption and decryption. While the DRM scheme may employ public (i.e., asymmetric) key cryptography or secret (i.e., symmetric) key cryptography, for purposes of illustration the DRM scheme will be depicted herein as employing public or asymmetric key cryptography.","The DRM scheme that is used may employ any of a variety of different key management protocols. For instance, in some implementations the well-established Kerberos protocol may be employed, in which tickets are exchanged between the key management server  and the secondary client device . In other implementations, instead of a Kerberos protocol, another key management protocol that may be employed and which also uses tickets is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,243,366, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, and which is referred to as the IPRM (Internet Protocol Rights Management) system.","The DRM scheme that is employed may also enforce access and copy protection rules specified by the content owner or service provider, such as (1) view only, no copy, (2) time-limited copy, (3) limited number of copies, (4) single copy with no further redistribution, etc. Moreover, the DRM rules may also only allow content to be viewed in a coordinated manner by the primary user who is sharing the content with a secondary user who is receiving the content. For example, the DRM rules may only allow the content to be viewed by the secondary user while it is also being viewed by the primary user. Similarly, the DRM rules may only allow the content to be viewed by the secondary user for a limited period of time after the primary user has begun viewing it. In addition, the secondary user may only be allowed to view the content a limited number of times, and perhaps even only a single time.","In some implementations coordinated viewing between the primary and secondary users can be achieved by the exchange of messages between the users over the communications network . For instance, when the primary viewer begins viewing the content a message may be automatically generated by the primary client device  and sent to the secondary client device . The message may include a timestamp that indicates the time at which the primary user began viewing the content. This message can be used by the DRM scheme in the secondary client device  as the authorization that allows the secondary user to begin viewing or otherwise rendering the content. Likewise, if the DRM scheme specifies that the content can only be viewed by the secondary user while it is also being viewed by the primary user, a message can be sent from the primary client device  to the secondary client device  when, for instance, the primary viewer pauses the content, thereby causing the content to be paused on the secondary client device  as well.","The messages exchanged between devices to enforce the DRM rules may employ any suitable protocol. Because of its ubiquity, one convenient message format that may be employed is supported by the short message service (SMS), which is a service available on many communication devices that permits the sending of short messages (also known as text messages) between mobile phones, other handheld devices, computers, and even standard landline phones. Wireless networks generally implement SMS with the use of a short message service center (SMSC), which acts as a store-and-forward system for relaying short messages. Messages are stored in the network until the destination communication device becomes available, so an end user can receive or transmit an SMS message at any time, whether a voice call is in progress or not.","In order to automatically send a message without user intervention whenever the user starts, stops, pauses, fast-forwards, etc., the content, the text message that is generated and sent may be an \u201cinvisible\u201d text message. An invisible SMS message, for example, is a short message whose headers are programmed in a particular manner so that the receiving client device acknowledges the receipt of the message and the receiving client device displays no behavior perceptible by the user. One example of a technique for sending an SMS message in an invisible format is shown in U.S. Publication No. 2006\/0209740. When the invisible message is received by the secondary client device  the content sharing application residing on the device uses the message to enforce the DRM rules that are in place for the content currently being shared.","Instead of an SMS message, other text-based messages may be employed. For instance, MMS messages may be employed, which are supported by the multimedia messaging service developed by 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) for sending multimedia communications between mobile telephones and other forms of wireless information device. Other types of text-based messages that may be employed may be based on any intermediary technology (such as EMS (enhanced message service)) and variants, such as premium SMS, and any future enhancements and developments of these services.","Referring again to , the DRM scheme may be implemented using a key management system , which may employ any of a variety of different key management protocols such as those mentioned above. For instance, if a Kerberos protocol is employed, the key management system may co-host a Key Distribution Center (KDC)  that issues tickets to the content recipient's client device. The key management system  may also co-host a key management server (KMS)  that provides the decryption key to the secondary user's client device. Of course, the key management system  may or may not be physically as well as logically, divided into a KDC and KMS. As previously mentioned, in some implementations, instead of a Kerberos protocol, another key management protocol that may be employed is the IPRM system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["60","10","50","10","20"]},"The content server  that distributes the content to the primary client device  operates in cooperation with the key management system  to control subsequent distribution of the content item by the primary client device . For instance, both the content server  and key management system  may be operated by a common service provider who distributes the content. In this case the key management server may be co-hosted or co-located with the content server  in some implementations. In other implementations various contractual relationships may have been previously established between the parties who operate the content server  and the key management system , whereby the key management system  provides DRM services to control and maintain the digital rights to the content residing on the content server . It is assumed that the primary device has been provisioned to the Key Management System and has acquired any appropriate tickets needed to gain access to the content that is to be shared with the secondary user. This can be done using the IPRM system or some other suitable DRM or Conditional Access System (CAS).","The process begins when the primary user sends a message (message 1) to the secondary user's client device . The message may be in any format, including those discussed above. However, since the message is user generated and is intended to be viewed by the recipient, this message is not in an \u201cinvisible\u201d format. The message includes a solicitation asking the secondary user to share a content viewing experience by viewing a content item with the primary user. The secondary user may be, for instance, a social networking contact that is included in the primary user's address book located on the primary client device . This message also includes an encrypted content item (including a content ID) and the network address (e.g., fully qualified domain name) of the key management system . It should be noted that instead of a single message, the content included in message 1 (as well as in the messages discussed below) may be communicated in multiple messages as appropriate for the particular application. For instance, the solicitation and the content item with the network address of the key management system may be sent in separate messages, with the latter message only be sent upon receiving affirmation from the secondary user that he or she does indeed desire to view the content item.","Next, the client device  sends a message (message 2) to the key management system , and in particular to key distribution center , requesting a service ticket for the Key Management Server (KMS) . At this point an optional authentication process may be performed. For instance, the client device may optionally send its digital certificate (e.g., a factory-installed X.509 certificate) to the key management system  so that its credentials can be verified.","The key management system , and in particular the key distribution center , authenticates the secondary user's client device . The key distribution center  sends a service ticket to the secondary user's client device  which includes the secondary device ID and a session key (message 3). The secondary client device  responds to the primary client device  by sending a message (message 4) which contains the ID that has been assigned to the secondary client device . The message serves to notify the primary client device  that the secondary client device  has received a service ticket.","Once the primary client device  is informed that the secondary client device has received a service ticket it sends a message (message 5) to the key management system , and in particular the key management server . This message includes an ID of the primary client device , the secondary device ID , and the content ID which identifies the particular content item and the corresponding encryption key that is be shared with the secondary client device . In addition, this message (or, as noted above, in a separate message) also includes the encrypted content key that is needed to decrypt the content item to be shared. These messages may use the IPRM key management protocol and may include a ticket that the primary device previously obtained from the KDC  for the KMS . Other suitable DRM systems may also be used. As a result, the content key has now been securely delivered to the KMS .","After notifying the primary client device  that it has received a service ticket, the secondary client device  sends a key request message (message 6) to the key management center , and in particular to the key management server , requesting the content key needed to decrypt the content item it received from the primary client device . The message includes the content ID of the content item and the previously received service ticket. It should be noted that in some cases key request message 6 may not be necessary. In particular, in some implementations the receipt of message 5 by the key management system  may automatically trigger the key management system  to send the content key to the secondary client device , thereby making the key request message 6 unnecessary.","Upon receiving key request message 6 (or upon receiving message 5 if it serves as the trigger) the key management system  sends the secondary client device  an encrypted copy of the content key for the specified content item (message 7). In addition, the key management system  also sends the digital rights that specify the manner in which the secondary client device  can access, copy and distribute the content.","The secondary client device  may now decrypt the content key using the session key (or a key derived from the session key) it previously received. The content key is used, in turn, to decrypt the content item so that it may be consumed by the secondary client in accordance with the digital rights it was given. As discussed above, if the DRM rules specify that the content is to be viewed by the secondary user in coordination with the primary user, the secondary user may only begin decrypting and viewing the content when it receives a message (e.g., an invisible SMS message) from the primary user indicating that the primary user has begun rendering the content. In some implementations, however, such a message may be unnecessary. For instance, the receipt of the encrypted content key from the key management system  may serve as an implicit indication that the primary user has begun viewing the content.","It should be noted that steps 2-4, in which the secondary client device  receives a service ticket and notifies its receipt thereof to the primary client device , only needs to be performed a single time for a new secondary client device until the service ticket expires. Upon expiration of the service ticket, the secondary client device  will need to repeat steps 2-4.","As previously mentioned, the digital rights provided to the secondary user only allow the content item to be consumed on the secondary client device  in coordination with its consumption by the primary user on primary client device . Such coordination may restrict the secondary client device  so that it can only decrypt the content item after the primary client device has begun consuming the content. Alternatively, or in addition, the secondary user may only be able to consume the content item a single time or a limited number of times (e.g., three times). Also, another rule used in addition to or instead of the aforementioned rules may require the secondary client device  to decrypt the content within a limited timeframe, which may in some cases depend on the duration of the content item. For example, the secondary client device  may be restricted so that it can only decrypt the content within a timeframe equal to say, the duration of the content item plus an additional 50%. As previously mentioned, consumption of the shared content may be coordinated by the exchange of messages between the primary and secondary client devices.","In the example presented above in connection with  the secondary client device  obtains the content key from the key management system . In other implementations, however, the secondary client device may obtain the content key directly from the primary client device , thereby eliminating the need for the functionally provided by the key management server .  shows a high-level signaling or call flow diagram that describes one example of such an implementation.","Referring to , the process begins when the primary user sends a message with the encrypted content item (including a content ID) and the primary device ID to the secondary user's client device . The message also includes the network address (e.g., fully qualified domain name) of the key management system . As noted in connection with , instead of a single message, the content included in message 1 (as well as in the messages discussed below) may be communicated in multiple messages as appropriate for the particular application. Next, the secondary client device  sends a message (message 2) to the key distribution center , requesting a service ticket for accessing content provided by the primary device. At this point an optional authentication process may be performed. For instance, the client device may optionally send its digital certificate (e.g., a factory-installed X.509 certificate) to the key management system  so that its credentials can be verified.","The key distribution center  sends a service ticket to the secondary user's client device  which includes the secondary device ID and a session key (message 3). This process assumes that the primary device has already been provisioned by the KDC  and is registered there as a content server. The secondary client device  next sends the primary client device  a message (message 4) that includes the ID of the content item that is to be shared, as well as the service ticket, which is necessary to obtain the content key from the primary device . In response, the primary client device  sends a message (message 5) that includes an encrypted copy of the content key for the specified content item. In addition, message 5 (or a subsequent message) also sends the digital rights that specify the manner in which the secondary client device  can access, copy and distribute the content.","The secondary client device  may now decrypt the content key using the session key it previously received from the key distribution center . The content key is used, in turn, to decrypt the content item so that it may be consumed by the secondary client in accordance with the digital rights it was given.","Numerous alternative implementations from those presented above are also possible. For instance, the content item need not be stored on the secondary client device . Rather, the content item may be streamed from the primary client device  to the secondary client device . Moreover, the content item may not even be stored on the primary client device . Rather, the content server  may stream the content item to both the primary and secondary client devices. One benefit of streaming to both devices is that various user-selected actions such as a request to pause the content item, when performed on one device, can be enforced on the other device without the need to exchange additional messages, thereby increasing in a relatively simple manner the coordinated manner in which the content items is consumed by both users.","In the examples presented above the primary client device  shares a content item or items with a single secondary client device . In some implementations the primary client device  shares a content item or items with multiple secondary client devices in a 1-to-n relation, where n is the number of secondary client devices. The key distribution center  can limit the number of secondary client devices with which content items may be shared by issuing a limited number of service tickets, which may be issued, for example, to a group of the primary user's friends. These tickets may be provided with a longer life span in order to maintain the group in a more permanent manner. Alternatively, the tickets may have a short expiration time to create a temporary or ad-hoc sharing relationship. To maintain even more control over the content sharing mechanism, the ticket may have a specific content ID or a list of content IDs in order to control the particular content which may be shared with the secondary devices.","To further enhance the experience of sharing content among users the primary and secondary client devices can both send and receive text-based messages such as SMS or IM messages to one another while the content is being rendering on the client devices. In this way the users can comment on the content in real time while they are experiencing it. If the content being rendered includes images such as video or like, the messages can be displayed as an overlay on the client device display so that both the message and the content can be viewed as the same time.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","250","200","205","250","220","225"]},"Supporting the applications , , and  in the architecture  are an operating system  and a hardware layer . In this illustrative embodiment, the operating system  is particularly adapted to operate on a resource-limited device and may comprise, for example, Google Android\u2122 or Microsoft Windows\u00ae CE. The hardware layer  provides an abstraction of the physical hardware implemented on the device  to the operating system  and applications , , and  above it. For example, such physical hardware may typically include a processor (e.g., a central processor or \u201cCPU\u201d), system memory such as read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d) and random accessory memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), bus structures, peripheral systems, drives, display devices, user controls and interfaces, etc. The hardware may also include storage media for storing computer-executable instructions (i.e., code) including either or both removable media and non-removable media such as magnetic and optical media, solid-state memory, and other conventional media. A user interface (UI)  is also provided by the architecture  to support user interactivity and facilitate an effective user experience, and will typically be embodied as a display with a graphical user interface.","The various functional components operating on the wireless communications device  may implement various interfaces allowing them to communicate among themselves as necessary. For instance, the SMS application  will typically interact with other applications executing on the mobile phone  with the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are respectively exposed by the other applications. For example, an API which is exposed by content sharing application  enables the SMS application  to invoke various functions, pass parameters, and exchange data with the content sharing application  to coordinate viewing of both the content item and SMS messages that the users exchange with one another. Likewise, an API which is exposed by SMS application  enables the content sharing application  to invoke various functions. For instance, the content sharing application  may use these API's to send invisible SMS messages between the wireless communication devices in order to coordinate the rendering of the content item that is being shared.","The processes described above, including but not limited to those presented in connection with  may be implemented in general, multi-purpose or single purpose processors. Such a processor will execute instructions, either at the assembly, compiled or machine-level, to perform that process. Those instructions can be written by one of ordinary skill in the art following the description of presented above and stored or transmitted on a computer readable storage medium. The instructions may also be created using source code or any other known computer-aided design tool. A computer readable storage medium may be any medium capable of carrying those instructions and include a CD-ROM, DVD, magnetic or other optical disc, tape, and silicon memory (e.g., removable, non-removable, volatile or non-volatile."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
