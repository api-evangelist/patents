{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention relate generally to utility meters, and more specifically to utility meters configured to execute multiple collection agents associated with respective utility providers.","Utility meters, such as power meters, are typically utilized to monitor utility consumption or usage. In many cases, a utility meter may be a smart utility meter configured to monitor usage and communicate usage data to a utility provider. In order to facilitate communication with a utility provider, the utility meter typically includes an interface configured to communicate over an Advanced Metering Infrastructure (\u201cAMI\u201d) network. However, conventional utility meters only include a single AMI interface capable of facilitating communication with a single utility provider. With a more competitive utility market, it is possible that multiple utility providers will provide resources to a structure monitored by the utility meter. For example, a consumer may purchase power from separate power companies based upon current market rates. Accordingly, there is an opportunity for improved utility meters capable of executing multiple collection agents or multiple AMI agents that facilitate communication with a plurality of respective utility providers.","Some or all of the above needs and\/or problems may be addressed by certain embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the invention may include utility meters and associated methods that facilitate the execution of a plurality of collection agents. In this regard, communication may be facilitated with a plurality of utility providers. According to one embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a method for executing collection agents by a utility meter. A utility meter that includes one or more computer processors may be configured to execute a first software agent configured to collect utility usage data on behalf of a first utility provider. Additionally, the utility meter may be configured to execute a second software agent concurrently with the first software agent. The second software agent may be configured to collect utility usage data on behalf of a second utility provider.","According to another embodiment of the invention, there is disclosed a utility meter. The utility meter may include at least one memory, and at least one processor. The at least one memory may be configured to store computer-executable instructions associated with a first software agent and a second software agent. The at least one processor may be configured to access the at least one memory and execute the computer-executable instructions to execute the first software agent to collect utility usage data on behalf of a first utility provider; and execute the second software agent to collect utility usage data on behalf of a second utility provider.","Additional systems, methods, apparatus, features, and aspects are realized through the techniques of various embodiments of the invention. Other embodiments and aspects of the invention are described in detail herein and are considered a part of the claimed invention. Other embodiments, features, and aspects can be understood with reference to the description and the drawings.","Illustrative embodiments of the invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. Indeed, the invention may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.","Disclosed are various systems, methods, and apparatus for facilitating the execution of a plurality of data collection agents by utility meters. In certain embodiments of the invention, a utility meter may be configured to concurrently execute a plurality of data collection agents or Advanced Metering Infrastructure (\u201cAMI\u201d) agents. In this regard, communication may be facilitated between the utility meter and any number of external systems, such as AMI head end systems associated with a plurality of different utility providers. Accordingly, the utility meter and its associated customer(s) may be permitted to purchase and monitor the consumption of utilities provided by any number of utility providers. In one example embodiment, a utility meter may be configured to execute a first software agent or data collection agent configured to collect utility usage data on behalf of a first utility provider. Additionally, the utility meter may be configured to concurrently execute a second software agent configured to collect utility usage data on behalf of a second utility provider. Although only two software agents are described as being executed, the utility meter may concurrently execute any number of software agents.","According to an aspect of the invention, the utility meter may additionally manage the operation of the agents and\/or control the allocation of resources to the agents and\/or the security associated with the agents. For example, the various agents may be executed in a \u201csandbox\u201d mode. In this regard, a relatively tightly controlled environment may be provided in order to enhance security within the utility meter and protect utility meter resources. As desired, the utility meter may execute any number of modules or applications that facilitate the monitoring of the agents, the allocation of resources to the agents, and\/or the provision of event notifications to the agents. For example, a resource allocation module, a security module, a watchdog module, and\/or an event module may be executed by the meter in order to manage the operation of the agents. As desired, any number of modules or applications may be utilized, and the operations described for certain modules may be combined into or performed by any number of modules.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the allocation of resources to the various agents may be controlled by the utility meter. For example, a resource allocation module may track a wide variety of metrology resources, such as stored data parameters, measurements, and\/or configuration parameters, and the resource allocation module may control the access of these resources by the agents. In one example embodiment, the resource allocation module may receive and process agent requests for resources. Once a resource request is received, a determination may be made as to whether the agent has permission to access the requested resource. For example, a suitable security module or security component may determine whether the requesting agent has permission to access the requested resource. In the event that the agent has permission to access the requested resource, a determination may be made as to whether the resource has been allocated to another agent. If the resource has been allocated to another agent, then the requesting agent may be placed in a waiting queue for the resource. Otherwise, if the resource is available, then the resource may be allocated or assigned to the requesting agent. Other agents are not permitted to modify the resource while it is allocated to the requesting agent. Additionally, once the resource has been allocated, a suitable watchdog module or component may monitor an amount of time that the agent maintains the resource. In the event that the agent does not release the resource within a predetermined threshold period of time, then the watchdog module may terminate the agent in order to allow other agents an opportunity to access the resource.","Additionally, in certain embodiments of the invention, the watchdog module may monitor the execution of the various agents and terminate unresponsive agents. For example, each agent may be required to periodically announce itself to the watchdog module. In the event that an announcement is not received from an agent within a predetermined period of time, a determination may be made as to whether the agent is waiting for a resource that is locked by or allocated to another agent. In the event that the agent is waiting for a resource, then the agent may be allowed to continue execution. If, however, it is determined that the agent is not waiting for a resource, then the agent may be terminated and optionally restarted.","As desired, certain embodiments of the invention may perform a wide variety of security determinations with respect to the agents. For example, the bytecode signature of an agent may be examined and\/or validated by a suitable security component prior to the execution of the agent. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether the bytecode and\/or agent is permitted to execute on the utility meter. Once an agent has been executed, an initialization routing may configure the agent. For example, the agent may be configured via an application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) associated with the utility meter. During initialization, the agent may access various resources to facilitate the configuration. Additionally, during initialization and\/or at another point in time, the agent may request registration for a wide variety of events and\/or timers. An event module or announcement module may receive and process the registration requests. In the event that an agent is permitted to receive a notification or announcement of a desired event (e.g., a predetermined condition, a timer event, etc.), then the event module may register the agent for the desired event. Upon occurrence of the desired event, the event module may communicate an event announcement to the agent. As desired, the event module may asynchronously communicate announcements to any number of agents.","Various embodiments of the invention may include one or more special purpose computers, systems, and\/or particular machines that facilitate the execution of a plurality of collection agents by a utility meter. A special purpose computer or particular machine may include a wide variety of different software modules as desired in various embodiments. As explained in greater detail below, in certain embodiments, these various software components may be utilized to facilitate the execution and management of a plurality of collection agents. In this regard, a utility meter may collect data on behalf of and\/or communicate with any number of head end systems, such as head end systems associated with a plurality of different utility providers.","Certain embodiments of the invention described herein may have the technical effect of facilitating the execution of multiple collection agents and\/or AMI agents by a utility meter. For example, a plurality of agents may be executed by a utility meter in a sandbox mode. Additionally, embodiments of the invention may have the technical effect of managing the plurality of agents and allocating resources to the plurality of collection agents. As a result of executing a plurality of agents, a utility meter may be configured to communicate with a plurality of head end systems and\/or to collect data on behalf of a plurality of head end systems. For example, the utility meter may be configured to collect usage data on behalf of a plurality of utility providers and to communicate with a plurality of head end systems associated with the utility providers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","105","110","115","105","105","105","110","110"],"i":["a","n","a","n ","a","n. "]},"With reference to , the utility meter  may be any suitable utility meter, such as a suitable electrical meter, water meter, or gas meter. The utility meter  may be configured to measure an amount of utility usage (e.g., electrical usage, etc.) supplied to an associated residence, business, or machine. In certain embodiments, the utility meter  may be a smart meter or an advanced meter configured to identify consumption in relatively greater detail than a conventional meter. For example, a smart power meter may facilitate real-time or near real-time readings, power outage notifications, and\/or power quality monitoring.","The utility meter  may include any number of suitable computer processing components that facilitate the general operation of the utility meter  and\/or the execution of various computer-executable instructions that facilitate the collection of usage data and\/or the communication of usage data. Examples of suitable processing devices that may be incorporated into a utility meter  include, but are not limited to, application-specific circuits, microcontrollers, minicomputers, other computing devices, and the like. As such, the utility meter  may include any number of processors  that facilitate the execution of computer-readable instructions to control the operations of the utility meter . By executing computer-readable instructions, the utility meter  may include or form a special purpose computer that facilitates the collection of utility usage data and\/or communication with any number of head end devices -","In addition to one or more processor(s) , the utility meter  may include one or more memory devices , one or more network interfaces , and\/or one or more sensors . The one or more memory devices  or memories may be any suitable memory devices, for example, caches, read-only memory devices, random access memory devices, magnetic storage devices, etc. The one or more memory devices  may store data, executable instructions, and\/or various program modules utilized by the utility meter , for example, data files , an operating system (\u201cOS\u201d) , one or more sandboxes , a management module , and\/or a metrology module . The data files  may include, for example, information associated with the operation of the utility meter , measurements and\/or readings data collected by the utility meter , information associated with a monitored structure, information associated with one or more head end devices -, bytecode information for one or more collection agents or agents -, and\/or information associated with the execution and\/or monitoring of the agents -","In certain embodiments of the invention, the utility meter  may include any number of software applications, modules, or other computer-executable instructions that are executed to facilitate the operations of the utility meter . The software applications may include computer-readable instructions that are executable by the one or more processors . The execution of the computer-readable instructions may form a special purpose computer that facilitates the operations of the utility meter  as well as the execution and\/or monitoring of the agents -. As an example of a software application, the utility meter  may optionally include an OS  that controls the general operation of the utility meter  and that facilitates the execution of additional software applications.","According to an aspect of the invention, the utility meter  may be configured to execute a plurality of collection agents -that facilitate the collection and\/or communication of utility usage data on behalf of a wide variety of different entities. For example, each agent -may be associated with a respective head end device -which may be, for example, associated with respective utility providers (e.g., electrical power providers, etc.). As illustrated in , the agents -may be executed within the one or more sandboxes  in order to provide secure execution of the agents -and\/or control of resources (e.g., metrology data, etc.) by the agents -. Sandboxing may refer to a mechanism for separating running or executing programs (e.g., the agents -). A sandbox may provide a relatively tightly controlled set of resources for a guest program to run in, such as scratch space. Network access for the executing programs may also be restricted.","According to an aspect of the invention, each of the agents -(individually referred to as an agent ) may be executed within a sandbox . For example, an agent  may be a suitable applet or other program whose execution may be managed by the utility meter . In certain embodiments, each agent  may be associated with a respective head end device , and the agent  may facilitate the collection of data on behalf of the head end device . For example, a programmer associated with a head end device  may utilize a publishable interface associated with the utility meter  to develop an agent  that may be provided to the utility meter  and executed to facilitate data collection and\/or communication with the head end device  via the networks . An agent  may be provided to the utility meter  utilizing a wide variety of suitable techniques, such as network transmission or manual installation from a removable memory device. During execution, an agent  may perform a wide variety of different operations, such as the monitoring and\/or collection of utility usage data, the generation of reports and\/or messages associated with the usage data, the determination of billing information associated with utility usage, the identification of various alert and\/or alarm conditions, and\/or the communication of messages (e.g., usage messages, alert messages, etc.) to a head end device .","According to an aspect of the invention, the utility meter  may execute a plurality of agents -concurrently or simultaneously. Given the concurrent execution, the utility meter may manage the execution of the agents -and\/or the allocation of resources to the agents -. The management module  may include any number of suitable components or modules configured to manage the execution of the agents -. For example, as shown in , the management module  may include an event module , a resource allocation module , a security module , and\/or a watchdog module . The illustrated modules are provided by way of example only. Indeed, any number of modules may be utilized as desired to perform the operations of the management module . Additionally, certain operations of the illustrated modules or components may be combined or further distributed.","The event module  may be a suitable module that facilitates the receipt and\/or processing of agent requests for event notifications and\/or event registrations. In operation, the agents -may request various announcements or notifications from the event module , such as notifications associated with the occurrence of predetermined events (e.g., metrology events, collection of metrology data, etc.) and\/or notifications associated with various timers and\/or time monitoring (e.g., hourly notifications, daily notifications, etc.). An announcement or notification may be requested at a wide variety of different times, such as during the initialization of an agent  or during the agent's execution. The event module  may process the received notifications, identify the desired events, and notify the requesting agents -of the desired events. For example, a suitable announcement or notification message may be communicated to an agent  based upon the detection or identification of an event. In certain embodiments, the event module  may asynchronously communicate announcements to the various agents -that have registered for events.","One example of the operations that may be performed by the event module  is described in greater detail below with reference to .","The resource allocation module  may be a suitable module that facilitates the receipt and processing of agent requests for resources of the utility meter , such as metrology resources and\/or access to various data parameters. In operation, the resource allocation module  may receive a request for a resource from an agent . Following a determination of whether the agent  is permitted to access the requested resource, which may be performed by the resource allocation module  or the security module , the resource allocation module  may determine whether the requested resource has already been allocated to an agent. In the event that the resource has already been allocated, the resource allocation module  may add the requesting agent  to a queue or waiting list for accessing the resource. The resource may then be allocated or assigned to the resource allocation module  when the resource is free. In the event that the resource is free when requested, the resource allocation module  may allocate the resource to the requesting agent . The allocation of a resource to an agent  may \u201clock\u201d the resource and prevent other agents from accessing and\/or modifying the resource. For example, a data variable or parameters may be allocated to an agent , and the data variable may not be modified by a second agent while it is allocated to the first agent.","One example of the operations that may be performed by the resource allocation module  is described in greater detail below with reference to .","The security module  may be a suitable module that facilitates a wide variety of security procedures with respect to the agents -, such as validating bytecode signatures of the agents -and\/or determining whether the agents -are permitted to access various resources and\/or to request certain event notifications. In certain embodiments, the security module  may validate a bytecode signature of an agent  prior to the initiation or execution of the agent  by the utility meter . For example, the security module  may evaluate the bytecode signature of an agent  to ensure that the bytecode has not been tampered with or modified. As desired, the security module  may additionally determine based upon the signature whether the bytecode is allowed or permitted to execute on the utility meter . For example, the security module  may evaluate a wide variety of rules or parameters, such as rules specified by a utility provider or device manufacturer and, based upon the evaluation, the security module  may determine whether an agent  may be executed by the utility meter .","Additionally, in certain embodiments, the security module  may determine whether an agent  is permitted to access a requested resource and\/or to receive a requested announcement or notification. For example, the security module  may evaluate or analyze a wide variety of access parameters and\/or permissions associated with an agent  in order to determine whether access to a requested resource or registration for an announcement is permitted.","A few examples of the operations that may be performed by the security module  are described in greater detail below with reference to , , and .","The watchdog module  may be a suitable module that facilitates the monitoring of agents -in order to identify situations in which the agents -lock up, freeze, and\/or execute improperly. In certain embodiments, the watchdog module  may monitor agents -to which resources have been allocated, and the watchdog module  may determine whether the resources are released or freed up by the agents -within an expected and\/or reasonable period of time. For example, once a resource has been allocated to an agent , the watchdog module  may determine whether the agent  releases the resource within a predetermined period of time. In the event that the agent  does not release the resource within the predetermined period of time, the watchdog module  may terminate the agent . For example, the watchdog module  may determine that the agent  has likely frozen, and the agent  may be terminated. As a result, other agents may be permitted to access the resource.","As desired in certain embodiments, the watchdog module  may also evaluate executing agents -in order to determine whether expected announcements are received from the agents -. For example, an agent  may be required to periodically announce itself to the watchdog module  by communicating a suitable announcement message to the watchdog module . In the event that the watchdog module  does not receive an announcement message from an agent  within a predetermined or expected period of time, the watchdog module  may determine whether the agent  is waiting for a resource that is locked by another agent. In the event that the agent  is waiting for a resource, the watchdog module  may permit the agent  to continue execution. However, in the event that the agent  is not waiting for a resource, the watchdog module  may terminate the agent.","As desired, during the termination of an agent , the watchdog module  may save a wide variety of information associated with the agent , such as a bytecode stack and\/or state relevant information. The saved information may be utilized for diagnostic purposes. Additionally, any resources locked by the terminated agent  may be released or freed. A terminated agent  may optionally be restarted. For example, the agent  may be restarted utilizing the same bytecode after an acceptable period of time. If the agent  is repeatedly restarted and terminated either a certain number of times or within a certain amount of time, the watchdog module  may permanently disable the agent  and prevent the agent from restarting.","A few examples of the operations that may be performed by the watchdog module  are described in greater detail below with reference to .","The metrology module  may be a suitable module configured to collect metrology data for use and\/or storage by the utility meter . In operation, the metrology module  may receive measurements data collected by the sensors , and the metrology module  may store a wide variety of parameters associated with the received measurements data. For example, the metrology module  may store usage data in a memory  associated with the utility meter . As desired, the stored data may then be accessed by the various agents -. Additionally, the data may be utilized to identify a wide variety of different events and\/or to trigger event notifications that are communicated to the various agents -","The one or more network interfaces  may facilitate connection of the utility meter  to any number of suitable networks and\/or transmission means. Examples of suitable network interfaces include, but are not limited to, cellular interfaces, WiMAX interfaces, power line carrier (\u201cPLC\u201d) and\/or broadband over power line (\u201cBPL\u201d) interfaces, cable modem interfaces, digital subscriber line (\u201cDSL\u201d) interfaces, and\/or any other suitable interfaces. In certain embodiments, the network interfaces  may facilitate connection of the meter to one or more suitable AMI networks. As desired, any number of suitable communications cards, transceivers, transducers, adaptors, radios, and\/or other devices may be utilized to interface the utility meter  to any number of suitable transmission networks, such as a network that facilitates Internet-based communications. In certain embodiments, communications devices and\/or communications circuits (e.g., cards, transceivers, transducers, etc.) may be included, incorporated, or integrated into the utility meter . In other embodiments, communications devices and\/or communications circuits may be external to the utility meter  and connected to the utility meter  via any number of suitable plugs, pins, wires, and\/or other connections.","The one or more sensors  may include any suitable sensor devices configured to collect measurements data associated with the operation of the utility meter . For example, the sensors  may include voltage sensors, current sensors, variable ampere reactive sensors, flow sensors, and\/or other suitable devices configured to collect readings and\/or other measurements. In this regard, usage data may be collected by the utility meter  for processing and\/or output.","With continued reference to , any number of head end devices -(individually referred to as a head end device ) may be provided.

In other embodiments, different agents may be identified at different points in time.","At block , a next agent may be selected by the utility meter  for evaluation and\/or execution. At block , a bytecode signature associated with the agent may be identified and validated. For example, a security module, such as the security module  illustrated in , may evaluate the bytecode signature of an agent to ensure that the bytecode has not been tampered with or modified. As desired, an evaluation may also be performed based upon the signature to assess whether the bytecode for the agent is allowed or permitted to execute on the utility meter . For example, the security module  may evaluate a wide variety of rules or parameters, such as rules specified by a utility provider or device manufacturer, and the rules evaluation may be utilized to determine whether the agent may be executed by the utility meter . As one example, rules that define required agent operating parameters and\/or capabilities may be utilized to evaluate an agent.","At block , a determination may be made as to whether the selected agent is permitted to be executed by the utility meter .

In certain embodiments, the request may be received by a suitable resource allocation module associated with the utility meter , such as the resource allocation module  illustrated in .","At block , a determination may be made as to whether the requesting agent  is permitted or allowed to access the requested resource. For example, the resource allocation module  may invoke a security module, such as the security module  illustrated in , to determine whether the agent  has permission to access the requested resource. The security module  may evaluate a wide variety of access parameters associated with the resource and\/or permission levels (and\/or processing capabilities) associated with the agent  in order to determine whether the agent  is allowed to access the requested resource.

As desired, the monitoring may be performed by a suitable watchdog module, such as the watchdog module  illustrated in . As an example of monitoring, a count up or count down timer or counter may be executed when the resource is allocated. As another example, a time stamp may be recorded or saved when the resource is allocated. A determination may then be made at block  as to whether a predetermined time threshold (e.g., expiration of a timer, a timer reaching a threshold value, etc.) for resource allocation has been reached. In other words, a determination may be made as to whether the resource has been locked by the agent  for a maximum allowable time period.

Additionally, in certain embodiments, the monitoring of time periods for different agents may be performed in an asynchronous manner. A wide variety of suitable time periods and\/or timing thresholds may be utilized as desired in various embodiments of the invention. For example, an agent  may be expected to communicate an annunciation message every second.","At block , a determination may be made as to whether an annunciation message has been received from the agent  within the identified or determined time period. If it is determined at block  that an annunciation message has been received, then operations of the method  may end. If, however, it is determined at block  that an annunciation message has not been received, then operations may continue at block .","At block , a determination may be made as to whether the agent  is waiting on a resource that is locked by or allocated to another agent. For example, a determination may be made as to whether identifying information for the agent  is included in any resource queues or wait lists. If it is determined at block  that the agent  is waiting on a resource, then it may be determined that the agent  is likely not locked up, and operations may end. If, however, it is determined at block  that the agent  is not waiting on a resource, then operations may continue at block , and the agent  may be terminated.","The method  may end following either block , block , or block .","As desired in various embodiments of the invention, a utility meter  may provide a wide variety of event notifications (e.g., timing notifications, event occurrence notifications, etc.) to executing agents.  is a flow diagram of an example method  for communicating event notifications to collection agents, according to an illustrative embodiment of the invention. The method  may be utilized in association with one or more utility meter systems, such as the system  illustrated in . In certain embodiments, the operations of the method  may be performed by at least one utility meter, such as the utility meter  illustrated in . The method  may begin at block .","At block , a registration request for an event announcement or event notification may be received from an agent, such as an agent  illustrated in . In certain embodiments of the invention, the registration request may be received by a suitable event module, such as the event module  illustrated in . A wide variety of different types of events may be identified by a registration request including, but not limited to, timer-based events, time management events, and\/or events associated with the occurrence of predetermined conditions. Additionally, a request may be received at a wide variety of different points in time, such as during the initialization of the agent  and\/or during the execution or operation of the agent .","At block , a determination may be made as to whether the agent is permitted to receive notification of the event associated with the received registration request. For example, the event module  may invoke a security module, such as the security module  illustrated in , to determine whether the agent  has permission to receive notification for the event. The security module  may evaluate a wide variety of access parameters associated with the event and\/or permission levels (and\/or processing capabilities) associated with the agent  in order to determine whether the agent  is allowed to receive notification of the event. If it is determined at block  that the agent  is not allowed to receive notification of the event, then operations may end. As desired, a suitable error message may be returned to the agent . If, however, it is determined at block  that the agent  is allowed to receive notification of the event, then operations may continue at block .","At block , the agent  may be registered by the event module  for event notification. In other words, the agent  may be added to a notification list, and the agent  may be notified by the event module  upon each detection of the event. For example, the event module  may detect the occurrence of the event at block , and a notification announcement or notification message for the event may be prepared and communicated to the agent  at block . In this regard, the agent  may take action based upon the occurrence of the event. For example, the agent  may initiate the execution of suitable computer-implemented instructions that facilitate the collection of usage data and\/or the communication of usage data to a head end device.","The method  may end following either block  or block .","The operations described and shown in the methods , , , and  of  may be carried out or performed in any suitable order as desired in various embodiments of the invention.
