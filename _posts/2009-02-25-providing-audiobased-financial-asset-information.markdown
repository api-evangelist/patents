{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The embodiments of the invention relate generally to communication platforms and, more specifically, relate to a mechanism for providing real-time audio-based financial asset information.","With the continued progress of globalization, more corporations than ever before have work groups spread across countries and continents around the world. To support and increase the productivity of remote and telecommuting work groups, communications companies are considering more cost-effective network solutions that combine voice, wireless, data and video functionality. Businesses like these expect that the services they select and eventually implement will have call quality comparable to conventional telephone service, and they expect those services to boost productivity and reduce overall communications costs. Acquiring these desired network services requires connections from the Internet and wireless and wireline networks to Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs) using a flexible, robust, scalable, and cost-effective media gateway. The ability of such media gateways to reduce overall communications costs for dispersed workgroups forms the foundation for media services and servers.","For integrated communication applications, such as those described above, server support needs to be provided. Media gateways provide the ability to switch voice media between a network and its access point. Using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and fast-Internet cable technology, a media gateway converts, compresses, and packetizes voice data for transmission back-and-forth across the Internet backbone for wireline and wireless phones. Media gateways sit at the intersection of the PSTNs and wireless or IP-based networks. One way for service providers to speed up their innovation processes and quickly launch new services is if they use a standards-based component model and container architecture, such as a Java\u2122 based communications platform.","Today, all communications can be routed through computers. Widespread access to broadband Internet and the ubiquity of Internet Protocol (IP) enable the convergence of voice, data and video. This convergence allows many beneficial applications to be deployed via software-based media servers. One area that could benefit from converged voice, data, and video applications on software-based media servers is trading of financial assets.","Currently, there is a need to provide a way to indicate to a user (e.g., a trader) of a financial asset system the real-time price of a financial asset. The price of a financial asset is a curve going up or down over time. On most modern markets these changes are very rapid and the price changes every second or even faster. For example, traders may utilize computers to track current price information. However, they do not have to watch the computer at all times, because the computers are instructed to trigger alerts on important events when they need attention. When such an event occurs the trader has to look at the screen for a few seconds to figure out what's going on before executing a buy or sell.","However, when a user of a financial asset system does not have access to a computer, they need access to another means to obtain the most up-to-date information in order to make effective decisions. Currently, the problem with many financial asset systems that report financial asset information via means other than computers is that they have a time lag in reporting the information or they report the information but cannot keep continuously conveying updated information in an effective way.","Embodiments of the invention provide for real-time audio-based financial asset information. In one embodiment, a method for providing real-time audio-based financial asset information includes receiving a trigger event related to a financial asset from a computer of a user of a financial asset information system while the user is away from the computer, contacting the user via a phone call, and playing an audio signal to the user where a change in sound volume of the audio signal correlates to a deviation of the financial asset from the trigger event.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed descriptions which follow are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201csending\u201d, \u201creceiving\u201d, \u201cattaching\u201d, \u201cforwarding\u201d, \u201ccaching\u201d, or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.","The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions, each coupled to a computer system bus.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear as set forth in the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","The present invention may be provided as a computer program product, or software, that may include a machine-readable medium having stored thereon instructions, which may be used to program a computer system (or other electronic devices) to perform a process according to the present invention. A machine-readable medium includes any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., a computer). For example, a machine-readable (e.g., computer-readable) medium includes a machine (e.g., a computer) readable storage medium (e.g., read only memory (\u201cROM\u201d), random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory devices, etc.), a machine (e.g., computer) readable transmission medium (electrical, optical, acoustical or other form of propagated signals (e.g., carrier waves, infrared signals, digital signals, etc.)), etc.","Embodiments of the invention provide real-time audio-based financial asset information. Embodiments of the invention provide the capability to communicate real-time information regarding a financial asset, such as a current price of a stock, via an audio signal to a user of a financial asset information system. In one embodiment, an application to provide the real-time audio-based financial asset information is deployed as an endpoint in a media server. This real-time financial information endpoint may be integrated with a financial trading platform that acts as the source of the financial information that is conveyed by the endpoint.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","100","250"]},"Method  begins at block , where a trigger event related to a financial asset is received from a computer of a user of a financial asset information system when the user is away from the computer. In one embodiment, the trigger event may be when a stock price was reached a sell point specified by the user of the financial asset information system. In one embodiment, a real-time financial information endpoint in a media server receives and processes the trigger point. The real-time financial information endpoint may be integrated with a financial trading platform that acts as the source of the financial information that is conveyed by the endpoint. However, any computing device with a communications connection may be capable of performing embodiments of the invention, and embodiments are not solely limited to an endpoint in a media server.","Then, at block , the user is contacted via a phone call. In one embodiment, a communications interface may manage the phone call to the user. In one embodiment, the communications interface may be JSR-309, a Media Server Control Application Programming Interface (API) of the JAVA Community Process Program. JSR-309 provides a portable interface to create media rich applications with IVR, Conferencing, Speech Recognition, and similar features. However, it is envisioned that other interfaces for the communications interface are also possible to implement. In turn, the Media Server is connected to the phone of the user via the phone network (PSTN or other).","At block , an announcement is played to the user explaining the trigger event. In one embodiment, an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) endpoint of the Media Server may be responsible for generating the announcement. For example, the announcement may state that the stock price has reached a sell point specified by the user.","Then, an audio signal is played to the user at block . In one embodiment, the audio signal is generated by a signal generator of the Media Server. In embodiments of the invention, a variance in sound volume of the audio signal correlates to any deviation in the financial asset information from the specified trigger event of the financial asset information. An increase in sound volume may indicate a positive deviation from the trigger event, while a decrease in sound volume may indicate a negative deviation from the trigger event. Based on the change in sound volume, the user will perceive a change in the loudness of the signal which provides information to the user regarding the respective deviation from the base point. As a result, the user will have the most recent real-time information about changes in the financial asset while making his or her decision on how to proceed.","In another embodiment, the audio signal may change in frequency to indicate deviations from the trigger event. The change in frequency may be coupled with the change in sound volume to provide additional information about the financial asset. In yet another embodiment, the signal may be either of a continuous tone or a series of intermittent tones. If a series of intermittent tones are utilized, the time interval length between consecutive tones may be used to convey information about the financial asset, and vice versa.","In one embodiment, once the audio sound volume or frequency representing the deviation reaches a level beyond the limit noticeable to the human ear, an announcement may be played by the Media Server stating a new price to serve as the basis for the audio sound volume or frequency. The deviation of the audio signal volume or frequency from this initial reset point then indicates the deviation from the newly announced price. In addition, in some embodiments of the invention, the user may press a button (e.g., \u201c1\u201d) to force the application to announce the price at any given moment and re-adjust the levels.","At block , a command is received from the user via the phone indicating an action to take related to the financial asset. For example, when the user decides to execute an action he or she may press a button on the phone to indicate their action. For example, 1 may mean \u201csell\u201d, 2 may mean \u201cbuy\u201d, 3 may mean \u201cignore\u201d, and so on. Finally, at block , the appropriate action is taken related to the financial asset based on the command received from the user. In embodiments of the invention, the specific commands may vary based on the particular application and may be assigned by the user from his or her computer as part of the program settings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200"]},"JVM  includes an integrated media server and JAVA EE application server  and management interfaces  associated with the integrated application server . The integrated application server  combines a media server  with a JAVA EE application server  to enable the development, deployment and management of applications that integrated of voice, video and data across a range of networks and devices. Media server  facilitates applications in sending media across communications networks to devices.","The integrated media and JAVA EE application server  is a single integrated stack, with the media server  and JAVA EE  running in the same JVM . The integrated application server  further provides scalability via a flexible architecture for multiple topologies, data center scalability with local network protocol load balancing, and geographic scalability via DNS load balancing. The integrated application server  additionally provides development benefits, such as not limiting users to an exclusive choice of JAVA EE  or a media server , a continuous step-through debugging experience, a common microkernel architecture (e.g., JBOssMX\u2122), and shared container building blocks (e.g., Java\u2122 Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), Java\u2122 Management Extensions (JMX), Java\u2122 Transaction API (JTA), Web Services, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), etc).","It should be noted that media server  is not a JAVA EE specification. However, it utilizes many JAVA EE  components, like JMX and JNDI. JAVA EE  is an application building platform that provides many facilities that media server  uses. For example, some useful JAVA EE services and tools may include, but are not limited to, JBOss\u2122 cache, JMX, Java\u2122 Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), JavaAssist\u2122, and JBOss\u2122 clustering.","The use of the modular JAVA EE architecture  with a media server  results in a simple and cleanly separable architecture for the implementation of embodiments of the invention. The JAVA EE microkernel architecture  is a natural fit for building the media server . The media server  may be a service in the JMX microkernel of JAVA EE . JMX is a Java\u2122 technology that supplies tools for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices (e.g., printers), and service-oriented networks. Those resources are represented by objects called MBeans (for Managed Bean). In other embodiments, other similar frameworks may be utilized for the microkernel architecture of JAVA EE including Open Service Gateway initiative (OSGi), for example.","Management interfaces  provide third party application programming interfaces (APIs) , ,  to the integrated media and JAVA EE application server . These third party APIs - simplify integrating with core business systems. For example, some of the management functions provides by management interfaces  may include, but are not limited to, full visibility for monitoring and management via JMX , internal system APIs (media server control API), and application APIs (service usage, service building blocks usage, event traffic control). Third party APIs also provide Operational\/Business Support Systems (OSS\/BSS) connectivity. For example, this may include remote JAVA EE connectivity. Some example APIs shown in  include the JMX API , a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) API , and a Web API .","The media server  may be controlled by applications that are not in same JVM  as the media server  via industry-standard controllers. Such industry-standard controller may include, but are not limited to, MEGACO , Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) , or Media Server Markup Language (MSML) . JSR-309  may be another industry standard used by applications to call the media server .","Typically, the media server  includes one or more endpoints , , ,  and . An endpoint - is a source and\/or sink of data that may be physical or virtual. Examples of physical endpoints are an interface to a gateway that terminates a trunk connected to a Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN) switch, an interface to a gateway that terminates an analog Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) connection to a phone or a PBX, for instance. Examples of virtual endpoints are an Announcement endpoint  that plays an audio file for a user, a Packet Relay endpoint , which is a specific form of a conference bridge that usually supports just two connections, a Conference endpoint , which includes an Audio Mixer and is used for conference applications, and an IVR endpoint  that is used for recording, collecting, and generating dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals and other tones.","In one embodiment, the media server  implements a real-time financial information endpoint . The real-time financial information endpoint  works in tandem with real-time financial information application  to provide the capability to communicate real-time information regarding a financial asset, such as a current price of a stock, via an audio signal to a user of the media server . The real-time financial information application  is deployed on the JAVA EE application server  and receives financial data. Based on the received financial data, the application  instructs the real-time financial information endpoint  to contact the user and play an audio signal corresponding to the deviation from a base trigger point. In one embodiment, the real-time financial endpoint  may also play an announcement to the user to explain a starting basis for the audio signal. In one embodiment, the real-time financial information endpoint  may be integrated with a financial trading platform  that acts as the source of the financial information that is conveyed by the endpoint . In one embodiment, the communication interface utilized between the application  and the Media Server  is JSR-309 . The Media Server  is, in turn, connected to a phone of the user via a phone network (e.g., PSTN or other telecommunications network).","In one embodiment, the real-time financial information endpoint  uses a signal generator (not shown) of the media server  to generate the audio signal played to the user. The endpoint  may be controlled by the real-time financial information application  to generate the audio signal with the required properties via the JSR-309  interface. For voice announcements and detection of key presses, the real-time financial information endpoint  may utilize the IVR endpoint . The media server  allows switching between endpoints while the call is active. In one embodiment, the announcement is made possible by a TextToSpeech module in IVR endpoint .","In one embodiment, the real-time financial information endpoint  varies the sound volume of the audio signal to convey a change in the financial asset information from a specified base point of the financial asset information. An increase in sound volume may indicate a positive deviation from the base point, while a decrease in sound volume may indicate a negative deviation from the base point. Based on the change in sound volume, the user will perceive a change in the loudness of the signal which provides information to the user regarding the respective deviation from the base point.","In another embodiment, the real-time financial information endpoint  may utilize changes in frequency of the signal to indicate deviations from a base point. In some embodiments, the change in frequency may be coupled with the change in sound volume to provide additional information about the financial asset. In yet another embodiment, the audio signal may be a continuous tone or a series of intermittent tones. If the real-time financial information endpoint  utilizes a series of intermittent tones, the length of time interval between consecutive tones may be used to convey information about the financial asset, and vice versa.","When the user makes a decision based on the information conveyed in the audio signal from the real-time financial information endpoint , he or she may communicate this decision to the real-time financial information endpoint  by pressing a button on the phone, for example 1 means \u201csell\u201d, 2 means \u201cbuy\u201d, 3 means \u201cignore\u201d, and so on. This action is detected by the real-time financial information endpoint  which, in turn, takes the corresponding action. The specific commands may vary based on the specific application and may be assigned by the trader from his computer as part of the program settings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","300","210","310","250"]},"The media server architecture  consists of endpoints .
