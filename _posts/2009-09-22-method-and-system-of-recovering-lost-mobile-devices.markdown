{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["Consumer adoption of mobile devices, such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, pagers, personal digital assistants, and the like, is increasing. These devices can be used for a diversity of purposes ranging from basic communications, to conducting business transactions, to managing entertainment media, as well as a host of other tasks. Additional enhancements, such as location-awareness features, e.g., global positioning system (GPS) tracking, also enable mobile device users to monitor their position and present their location via a local display. As such, mobile devices tend to store an abundant amount of personal or otherwise sensitive information. Unfortunately, the portability and size of these devices often leads to device misplacement, loss, and even theft, all of which translate into an inability to safeguard this personal information. In the event that a user's mobile device does go missing (for whatever the cause), the likelihood of locating and retrieving the device or determining the identity of a potential perpetrator is very low.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach that can efficiently and effectively provide remote mobile device control and tracking.","A preferred apparatus, method, and software for providing remote control and tracking services for mobile devices are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to remotely controlling and tracking mobile devices to protect against theft and to enable recovery, it is contemplated that various exemplary embodiments are also applicable to stationary devices as well as other applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","105","107","103","109","111","113","115","101","101","103","101","101","100"]},"It is observed that portable device users who enjoy an increased level of mobility have to be mindful of their location, as well as keep a vigilant eye on their devices to ensure the devices and\/or information stored thereon is not misplaced, lost, or stolen. Traditionally, when a portable device went missing, for whatever the cause, the use of conventional approaches to locate and recover the device or, at least, identify a potential perpetrator, e.g., a thief, has yielded little, if any, success. Moreover, most mobile device owners rely on password and encryption techniques to protect valuable or otherwise sensitive information stored to their devices; however, even encrypted data, once in the hands of another, may be eventually decrypted. As a consequence, a void exists in the marketplace for effective and efficient techniques to remotely control and track mobile devices, such as for the purpose of locating and recovering missing devices or identifying potential perpetrators.","Therefore, the approach of system , according to certain exemplary embodiments, stems from the recognition that consumers can benefit from remote control and tracking services, whereby subscribers (or users) are given access to a management platform for remotely activating at least one application on their devices, such as one or more mobile devices, for locating and\/or controlling these devices. For instance, subscribers may access the management platform for remotely activating an application on a mobile device for controlling an audio interface (e.g., a microphone) and\/or an imaging interface (e.g., a camera) of the mobile device to capture one or more signals from the audio interface or the imaging interface. Captured signals may relate to acoustic and\/or visual indicia of an environment surrounding the mobile device, which may be utilized by a subscriber to locate and retrieve their device or identify a potential perpetrator who may have stolen or inadvertently taken possession of the device. In other instances, remotely activating an application on the mobile device may cause the mobile device to return spatial positioning information (e.g., an address, latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) corresponding to a location of the device. This spatial positioning information may be overlaid on, for instance, a topological depiction of a geographic area surrounding the location of the device, which may also be appended with various cartographic features, such as buildings, landmarks, roadways, signs, and the like, or provided with directions to the location of the device. Subscribers may also be given access to the management platform to remotely activate at least one application on their device to control or configure one or more features of the device. For example, an application may be remotely activated in order to image (or backup) a memory of a mobile device, as well as store the image to, for instance, a networked repository. Subscribers may also be enabled to erase a memory of the mobile device, such as for the purpose of purging the device of personal or otherwise sensitive information. Still further, an application may be remotely activated in order to configure features of or services available to the mobile device, such as to monitor or deactivate an ability of the mobile device to transmit and receive information.","Accordingly, in some embodiments, system  facilitates remote mobile device controlling and tracking by enabling subscribers (or users) to access management platform  via one or more client devices (e.g., computing device , voice station , or another mobile device (not shown)) to register to the remote control and tracking services of system , as well as to create, customize, and manage one or more user profiles stored to, for example, user profiles repository  or any other suitable storage location of (or accessible to) the components or facilities of system . In this manner, subscribers may submit requests to platform  in order to remotely control, configure, monitor, register, and\/or track their mobile devices . In response thereto, platform  may generate one or more control signals to remotely activate one or more applications (or application programming interfaces (API))  on mobile devices  for remotely controlling, configuring, monitoring, and\/or tracking these devices . Control signals may be transmitted to mobile devices  over one or more of networks -, such as transmitted over one or more of networks - as part of one or more API  directed messages (e.g., API  short messaging service (SMS) directed messages). It is noted that management platform  is described in more detail in accordance with .","In certain exemplary embodiments, access to platform  may be obtained via any suitable portal interface (not illustrated), such as a voice portal or a web portal. For example, a networked remote application  for implementing the portal may be deployed via platform ; however, it is contemplated that another facility or component of system , such as a frontend, middleware, or backend server, may deploy remote application  and, consequently, interface with platform . As such, it is contemplated that remote application  may be implemented on one or more of client devices , , and\/or  and, thereby, configured to interface with platform . In certain embodiments, one or more remote applications  may function in conjunction with one another to achieve the features and functionalities of system , such as one or more of the processes described herein for remotely controlling and\/or tracking mobile devices .","The portal may include or provide users with the ability to access, configure, manage, and store user profile information to user profiles repository , as well as the ability to remotely control, configure, monitor, and\/or track their mobile devices . As such, platform  may be configured to receive or retrieve tracking content from mobile devices  and, thereby, store this tracking content to, for example, tracking content repository . It is contemplated that tracking content may be additionally (or alternatively) stored to any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components or facilities of system . Further, tracking content may generally relate to any signals or information retrieved (or received) from mobile devices  that have been (or currently are being) remotely controlled, configured, monitored, tracked, etc. In this manner, the portal may provide subscribers with access to tracking content of tracking content repository .","As seen in , platform  includes remote application  for generating commands, instructions, parameters, and\/or signals (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201ccontrol signals\u201d) that may be executed on (or by) mobile device  via API(s) . These control signals are utilized to remotely activate API(s)  to control, configure, monitor, or track mobile device  in response to, for instance, a request to control, configure, monitor, or track mobile device  by an authorized subscriber of the remote control and tracking services of system . In this manner, the control signals may be utilized to generate, store, or otherwise implement configuration information based on received control signal(s). According to one embodiment, control signals may also be utilized to control an audio interface (e.g., a microphone) or an imaging interface (e.g., a camera) of mobile device  to capture one or more signals from the audio interface or the imaging interface. Captured signals may relate to acoustic and\/or visual indicia of an environment surrounding mobile device , which may be utilized by a subscriber to locate and retrieve their device or identify a potential perpetrator who may have stolen or inadvertently taken possession of the device.","In other instances, remote application  may generate control signals to remotely activating API(s)  on mobile device  to cause mobile device  to return spatial positioning information (e.g., an address, latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) corresponding to a location of mobile device . Accordingly, mobile device  may be configured to determine corresponding spatial positioning information through conventional satellite positioning system (SPS) technology, such as GPS technology; however, any suitable navigational or location determination technology may be utilized, such as advanced forward link trilateration (A-FLT), assisted-GPS (A-GPS), enhanced cellular identification (CELL-ID), wireless area network (WLAN) positioning, etc. As is well known, SPS technology utilizes a constellation  of satellites that transmit signals to receivers (not shown) of, for example, one or more mobile devices , so that the receivers may determine corresponding spatial positions (or locations), speeds, directions, and\/or timing for mobile devices . Mobile devices  may report this information to platform  to facilitate the remote control and\/or tracking services of system . It is also noted that platform  may \u201cpoll\u201d or receive such spatial positioning information from mobile devices  in real-time, so as to provide presence service features related to mobile devices . As such, the location of, for instance, mobile device  may be detected without mobile device  having to initiate a phone call or other like communication session. Thus, platform  may be configured to present received and\/or retrieved spatial positioning information to subscribers, such as via one or more GUI(s). It is also noted that spatial positioning information may be stored to user profiles repository  or any other suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) system .","Accordingly to particular embodiments, spatial positioning information corresponding to a location of mobile device  may be overlaid on, for instance, a topological depiction of a geographic area surrounding the location of mobile device , which may also be appended with various cartographic features, such as buildings, landmarks, roadways, signs, and the like, or provided with directions to the location of mobile device .","Subscribers may also be given access to the management platform to remotely activate API(s)  on mobile devices  to control or configure one or more features of the device. For example, API(s)  may be remotely activated in order to image (or backup) a memory (not shown) of mobile device , as well as store the image to, for instance, a networked repository, such as tracking content repository . Subscribers may also be enabled to erase a memory of mobile device , such as for the purpose of purging mobile device  of personal or otherwise sensitive information. Still further, API(s)  may be remotely activated to configure features of or services available to mobile device , such as to monitor or deactivate an ability of mobile device  to transmit and receive information. For instance, control signals may be transmitted to mobile device  by platform  in order to \u201clock\u201d mobile device  until an appropriate \u201cunlock\u201d code (or signal) is input (or transmitted) to device . As another example, subscribers may be enabled to request platform  to monitor usage of mobile device  and, thereby, provide a \u201clog\u201d of such use, which may also enable subscribers to determine whether or not their devices have been stolen and\/or being utilized for illicit (or otherwise unauthorized) purposes.","Accordingly, platform  via, for example, remote application  may be configured to issue control signals via various bearers to mobile devices , such as in the form of one or more call control setup messages, short messaging service (SMS) messages, enhanced messaging service (EMS) messages, multimedia messaging service (MMS) messages, electronic mail, files, or any other suitable bearer, as well as any suitable combination thereof. In particular implementations, these bearer mediums may include control signals in various forms, including attention (AT) commands, menu traversal paths, function codes, voice data, dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals, scripts, strings, parameters, object variables, and the like. It is noted that these control signals can be used in lieu of \u201csoftware code,\u201d and therefore, may be directly integrated into the control logic of mobile device , thereby requiring less processing and hence, less power. It is contemplated, however, that coded instructions may also be utilized. As such, these control signals may be utilized by API(s)  to facilitate the remote control and\/or tracking services of system .","It is noted that control signals generated by, for example, remote application  of platform  may be transmitted to mobile devices  via one or more of communication networks -. To prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the remote control and\/or tracking services of platform , authentication information may be required. For instance, a username and password procedure may be employed. According to one embodiment, subscribers may be required to enter a code (e.g., personal identification number (PIN), etc.) before accessing the features and functionality of platform . Similarly, to prevent the implementation of unauthorized control signals otherwise received at mobile device , platform  may include an authentication identifier when transmitting control signals to mobile devices . For instance, control signals may be encrypted, either symmetrically or asymmetrically, such that a hash value can be utilized to authenticate received control signals, as well as ensure that those control signals have not been impermissibly alerted in transit. As such, control signals may include various identifiers, keys, random numbers, random handshakes, digital signatures, and the like. Further, these authenticating schemas may themselves be encrypted or otherwise secured.","According to exemplary embodiments, mobile devices  may include one or more application protocol interfaces (API), such as a set of APIs included within, for example, a binary runtime environment for wireless (BREW) platform, for receiving control signals from platform  and, thereby, for being remotely activated, controlled, configured, monitored, tracked, etc., by platform . It is contemplated, however, that one or more other mobile client applications may be utilized, such as one or more applications written in one or more programming languages, such as C, C++, J2ME, Java, etc. As such, API(s)  may be configured to, in response to control signals being received from, for instance, platform , enable one or more signals to be captured from an audio interface (e.g., a microphone) or an imaging interface (e.g., a camera) of mobile device . These signals may relate to acoustic(s) or image(s) of an environment surrounding mobile device . In other instances, API(s)  may determine spatial positioning, backup or erase a memory (not shown), configure (or reconfigure) functions, obtain usage logs, terminate services, etc., of or associated with mobile devices .","In exemplary embodiments, mobile devices  transmit, via one or more of networks -, the one or more signals captured from an audio interface and\/or an imaging interface of mobile devices  to platform . Other information or signals may also be transmitted by mobile devices  to platform , such as spatial positioning information, device usage information, images of memories of mobile devices , etc. These signals and\/or information may be stored to any suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) the components and\/or facilities of system , such as tracking content repository . In other instances, the signals and\/or information may be presented to subscribers, such as via one or more GUI(s). Exemplary GUIs for remotely controlling and tracking a mobile device  and presenting signals and\/or information provided by controlled or tracked mobile devices  to subscribers are described in more detail in accordance with , respectively.","Still further, remote application  may enable subscribers to report a status of their mobile devices  to an administrative agency , such as for reporting a mobile device  as lost, misplaced, stolen, etc. Subscribers may generate user profiles including one or more variables, values, parameters, polices, etc., for specifying one or more particular administrative agencies  that are to receive generated reports, such as one or more police departments within a predetermined vicinity of the environment surrounding a tracked and located mobile device , a manager of an organization responsible for the mobile device , etc. It is noted that generated reports may also include one or more of the captured signals and\/or information received from mobile device . For instance, a report may include information tracking the spatial positioning of mobile device  in real-time, such that the administrative agency  (or other authorized individuals or entities) can \u201cchase after\u201d mobile device . Such a scenario can be useful when mobile device  is stolen and the authorities (e.g., police) are dispatched to retrieve device  from the perpetrator(s).","As seen in , service provider network  enables client devices , , and  to access the features and functionality of platform  via one or more of networks , , and . Networks - may be any suitable wireline and\/or wireless network. For example, telephony network  may include a circuit-switched network, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. Wireless network  may employ various technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), mobile ad hoc network (MANET), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like.

It is further contemplated that networks - may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, networks - may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions. As such, the conjunction of networks - may be adapted to facilitate the remote control and tracking services of system .","According to exemplary embodiments, client devices , , and  may include any customer premise equipment (CPE) capable of sending and\/or receiving information over one or more of networks -.

Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1001","1003","1001","1000","1005","1001","1003","1005","1003","1000","1007","1001","1003","1009","1001"]},"The computer system  may be coupled via the bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display, active matrix display, or plasma display, for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for controlling cursor movement on the display .","According to an exemplary embodiment, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement exemplary embodiments. Thus, exemplary embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an exemplary embodiment through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the exemplary embodiments may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.","While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein, other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description. Accordingly, the invention is not limited to such embodiments, but rather to the broader scope of the presented claims and various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Various exemplary embodiments are illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A and 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
