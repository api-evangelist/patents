title: Undersea vehicle
abstract: An undersea vehicle having both low emitted noise and low reflectivity is provided. The undersea vehicle has a hollow cylindrical hull with all components, sensors, electronics, motors, and other internal components with the exception of the propellers, located within the shell of the cylindrical hull. The hollow center of the hull provides a duct and propeller configuration with the shaping of the inlet tube designed to reduce forward noise transmissions, such as reflected active sonar signals and emitted noise. The internal duct gradually constricts to a throat section and thereafter diverges to an output section where dual counter-rotating propellers are located. The result is that most of the internal turbulent flow and the propeller noise is located behind the throat and is thereby reflected in the aft direction. Steering of the vehicle is accomplished by canting the leading edge intake section and the duct exhaust section.

Present control surfaces and propulsor configurations have unacceptably high acoustic noise levels. A variety of techniques have been used to reduce the amount of noise created by existing electromechanical actuators. In general, these efforts have concentrated on balancing and isolating the moving parts and gears as well as providing fixed hydrodynamic fairings to minimize turbulence-induced noise. Unfortunately, even in the best prior art designs, electromechanical actuator-driven control surfaces suffer from several drawbacks. Actuation of the control surfaces result in gear and motor noise. Further, these control surfaces, typically located ahead of the propellers, create a turbulent wake behind the control surfaces. The ingestion of this wake by the propellers generates significant flow noise levels. The flow noise is created by three mechanisms: (1) the turbulence directly radiating to the near and far field, (2) the induced noise due to the turbulent excitation of the control surface and the surrounding structure, and (3) interaction of the control surface wake with the propulsor. The third item causes fin and structure re-radiation which is the dominant flow noise source.","Additionally, in remotely-operated undersea vehicles, used in surveillance or reconnaissance, a low reflectivity profile is needed to avoid active sonar detection. The conventional structure of fins, control surfaces and propellers creates multiple corner reflectors resulting in very strong return echoes. An undersea vehicle used in covert surveillance must have a minimum of external structure for controls and propulsion.","Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an undersea vehicle having low-emitted noise caused by propulsor-control surface interaction.","It is a further object of the invention to provide an undersea vehicle having reduced turbulence in the propulsor region.","It is another object of the invention to provide an undersea vehicle having reduced turbulence in the control surface region.","It is yet another object of the invention to provide an undersea vehicle with a reduced reflective surface for avoiding active acoustic detection systems.","It is still another object of the invention to provide a reduced acoustic signature of the propulsor in the forward hemisphere.","The foregoing and other objects are realized by providing a hollow undersea vehicle having an internal ducted propulsor system and having internal and external shaping to avoid forward emission of acoustic energy. The external hull is a nearly planar cylinder providing a smooth, low turbulence surface. This surface reduces reflectivity toward the forward hemisphere of any active sonar energy received from the forward hemisphere. Additionally, the internal inlet tube is shaped to trap acoustic energy entering the inlet. The aft portion of the hollow body is shaped to avoid both reflected and emitted noise in the forward direction. The canting of the leading surfaces of the inlet and the trailing surface of the exhaust nozzle provide for maneuver and control, thereby avoiding reflective surfaces and reducing control surface turbulence. The result is a low noise and non-reflective body as viewed from a frontal hemisphere.","Referring now to , the undersea vehicle, designated generally by the reference numeral , is shown with its major components. The vehicle has a hollow cylindrical hull  which encloses an internal duct . Hollow cylindrical hull  has three sections, an intake section , a throat section  and an output section . Intake section  has a sharpened leading edge. The payload and the operating elements of the vehicle are located between the hull  and the wall of the internal duct . The payload in this embodiment is an array of sensors , as used for a surveillance vehicle. Alternatively, a warhead and fusing mechanism can replace the sensor array . A central processor unit  receives information from the sensor array  and generates data to the guidance and control unit . A plurality of batteries located in the battery pack  provides power to operate the onboard electronics (sensors, navigation, control, and computer processor) and to operate a propulsion system located in output section . The propulsion system comprises a motor inverter assembly  having an inverter and controller and the circumferential drive motors  and . The counter-rotating propellers  are mounted to the inside of rotating circumferential shrouds  which are the driven rotors of the circumferential drive motors. The propellers  are fully supported by the circumferential shrouds  and require no center supports. As a result, the center structure at the propeller hub  can be designed for best flow and acoustic performance without interference by structural supports.","The shaping of the internal and external shape of the hollow hull provides a reduction in flow noise by reducing surface turbulence. The external surface of hull  is a nearly flat cylinder. This shape reduces the pressure gradient along the external surface of hull  as compared to the more conventional curving hull form. As a result, the transition of the freestream flow  to turbulent flow is delayed to a point further aft on the hull , depicted in this figure, by turbulent flow arrow . An additional advantage of the flat cylindrical outer surface is that active acoustic energy, such as produced by sonar search arrays, has a single reflective plane without reflective corners. A sonar array, impinging energy on the undersea vehicle from the forward hemisphere, will produce a sonar return first reflected into the rearward hemisphere, and secondarily diffused by the radial surface of the hull. The only location where an array might produce a good return is from the direct beam position, that is, scanning at an angle directly from the side of the vehicle. Any other position results in a return echo directed away from the transmitting sonar array. Even from the beam position, the return echo will be weakened by the lack of corner surfaces and the curvature of the cylindrical hull. Since there are no external propellers or fins, this reduced return echo allows the undersea vehicle to approach very close to a sonar array without detection.","With respect to acoustic energy transmitted into the intake section , the sharpened leading edge provides only a minimal surface for acoustic reflection. Likewise, the gradual converging throat section  of the intake reduces turbulence transition in the interior of the vehicle while providing a swallowing effect on any acoustic energy received in the forward hemisphere. The throat section  biases the echo reflectivity by dissipating the energy in repeated reflection toward the output section . Energy that is reflected by propeller  must reflect repeatedly within the duct. As a result, virtually no return is received on acoustic energy transmitted from the forward hemisphere.","With respect to acoustic energy produced by the vehicle itself, that is, the propeller turbulence noise generated internally in the duct , several features minimize the forward transmission of such noise. First, flow within the duct  is low in turbulence. Second, the turbulent boundary layer along the inner wall of the duct is drawn off just prior to impingement of the propellers  by boundary layer bleed ducts . By these features, the flow reaching the propellers  has greatly reduced turbulence (and noise) as compared to a typical external propeller located behind fins and control surfaces.","Additionally, the propeller hub  is shaped within a converging intake section  and diverging exhaust section . This shaping produces a second throat in the flow field thereby providing an additional bias for reflecting acoustic energy to the rearward hemisphere.","The bias effect can be seen clearly in the aft view of . Vehicle  has an aft control surface  more fully described in . The converging throat section  of the internal duct  can be seen in relation to the propeller  tips. Although propeller tip noise is reduced by the end plate effect of the propeller shrouds , even that reduced noise is blocked from direct forward transmission by the reducing duct cross-section. The effect is similar to speaking into the wrong end of a megaphone.","Referring now to , maneuver control of the vehicle may be understood. The control mechanism of the undersea vehicle (not called out in prior figures for purpose of clarity) comprises two circumferential elastomeric joints, a forward joint  and a rearward joint . Forward joint  is positioned between intake section  and throat section ; likewise, rearward joint  is positioned between throat section  and output section . These joints allow extension and bending required to cant both the intake section  and output section  of the hull , thereby producing up to 10\u00b0 of canting for each section. The canting is accomplished by eight steering actuators  at each joint  and . Steering actuators  are preferably solenoids having multiple positions which are joined to the vehicle's guidance system. These actuators are evenly spaced around the circumference of vehicle . As the guidance system of the vehicle maintains an inertial reference, it is not necessary to maintain any particular orientation of the vehicle during operation. Turning and diving or ascending can be accurately accomplished while the vehicle is in any fixed roll orientation and during active rolling motion.","The features and advantages of the invention are numerous. The vehicle produces very little reflected acoustic energy in the forward hemisphere. Further, the emitted noise of the vehicle is very low due to reduced turbulence, reduced propeller noise and minimal actuator noise. Additionally, that noise which is generated by the vehicle is largely transmitted rearward.","It will be understood that many additional changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangement of parts, which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention, may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing objects and further advantages of the invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description with reference to the following figures wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
