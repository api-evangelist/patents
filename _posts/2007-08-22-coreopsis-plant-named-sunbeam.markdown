{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["Botanical designation: ","Cultivar denomination: \u2018Sunbeam\u2019.","The present invention relates to the new and distinct Threadleaf Coreopsis herein also referred to as \u2018Sunbeam\u2019, by the cultivar name, \u2018Sunbeam\u2019, or as the Plant. \u2018Sunbeam\u2019 was discovered by Ronald L. Walters in the summer of 2002 as an uninduced whole plant mutation of Coreopsis \u2018Moonbeam\u2019 (not patented) in the fields of a wholesale perennial grower in Zeeland, Mich., USA. It was then isolated and compared in subsequent years to other coreopsis and found to be different from all cultivars known to the discoverer.","Asexual propagation at the same nursery in Zeeland, Mich. USA by cuttings has shown \u2018Sunbeam\u2019 to be stable and reproduce true to type in successive generations.","The Plant has not been observed in all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary slightly with changes in environments such as light intensity, fertility, water availability, etc. without, however any variation in genotype.","\u2018Sunbeam\u2019 is distinct from all known cultivars in the following traits:\n\n","Plants of \u2018Sunbeam\u2019 are shorter in habit than \u2018Golden Showers\u2019 (not patented) and taller than \u2018Zagreb\u2019 (not patented). Flowers of \u2018Sunbeam\u2019 are smaller, with entire margins on ray petals and the flowers are above the foliage compared to \u2018Cr\u00e9me Brut\u00e9e\u2019 U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16,096 which hare larger flowers held at the foliage level and incised ray petal apices. The ray petal color of \u2018Sunbeam\u2019 is slightly darker yellow than \u2018Crm\u00e9me Brul\u00e9e\u2019.","The following description is based on a two-year old plant growing in a full-sun trial garden in Zeeland, Mich., USA. For the growing season up to the time of description the daytime temperatures range between 12-30\u00b0 C., and night temperatures range between 6-19\u00b0 C. Except for ordinary dictionary color usage, color references are according to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2001 edition.\n\n"],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE PLANT","SUMMARY OF THE PLANT","NEAREST COMPARISON","DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The color photographs illustrate the overall characteristics of the Plant.
