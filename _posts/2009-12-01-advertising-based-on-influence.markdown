title: Advertising based on influence
abstract: Advertising based on influence is provided. In some embodiments, advertising based on influence includes determining an influence score (e.g., based on a given dimension) for a subject (e.g., a user), in which the subject is a potential target for an advertisement; and determining targeting of the advertisement based on criteria including the influence score of potential recipients of the advertisement. In some embodiments, the influence score is a directly estimated objective measure of influence (e.g., estimated using a social graph). In some embodiments, advertising based on influence also includes determining pricing of advertisements based on criteria including the influence score of potential recipients of one or more advertisements. In some embodiments, advertising based on influence further includes sharing advertising revenue with the subject based on criteria including the influence score of the first subject (e.g., as an incentive for the subject to view the advertisement).

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO OTHER APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61\/200,659 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD OF ADVERTISING BASED ON INFLUENCE filed Dec. 1, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","Knowledge is increasingly more germane to our exponentially expanding information-based society. Perfect knowledge is the ideal that participants seek to assist in decision making and for determining preferences, affinities, and dislikes. Practically, perfect knowledge about a given topic is virtually impossible to obtain unless the inquirer is the source of all of information about such topic (e.g., autobiographer). Armed with more information, decision makers are generally best positioned to select a choice that will lead to a desired outcome\/result (e.g., which restaurant to go to for dinner). However, as more information is becoming readily available through various electronic communications modalities (e.g., the Internet), one is left to sift through what is amounting to a myriad of data to obtain relevant and, more importantly, trust worthy information to assist in decision making activities. Although there are various tools (e.g., search engines, community boards with various ratings), there lacks any indicia of personal trustworthiness (e.g., measure of the source's reputation and\/or influence) with located data.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","Currently, a person seeking to locate information to assist in a decision, to determine an affinity, and\/or identify a dislike can leverage traditional non-electronic data sources (e.g., personal recommendations\u2014which can be few and can be biased) and\/or electronic data sources such as web sites, bulletin boards, blogs, etc. to locate (sometimes rated) data about a particular topic\/subject (e.g., where to stay when visiting San Francisco). Such an approach is time consuming and often unreliable as with most of the electronic data there lacks an indicia of trustworthiness of the source of the information. Failing to find a plethora (or spot on) information from immediate non-electronic and\/or electronic data source, the person making the inquiry is left to make the decision using limited information which can lead to less than perfect predictions of outcomes, results, and can lead to low levels of satisfaction undertaking one or more activities for which information was sought.","Current practices also do not leverage trustworthiness of information or, stated differently, attribute a value to the reputation of the source of data (e.g., referral). With current practices, the entity seeking the data must make a value judgment on the reputation of the data source. Such value judgment is generally based on previous experiences with the data source (e.g., rely on Mike's restaurant recommendations as he is a chef and Laura's hotel recommendations in Europe as she lived and worked in Europe for 5 years). Unless the person making the inquiry has an extensive network of references from which to rely to obtain desired data needed to make a decision, most often, the person making the decision is left to take a risk or \u201croll the dice\u201d based on best available non-attributed (non-reputed) data. Such a prospect often leads certain participants from not engaging in a contemplated activity.","Reputation accrued by persons in such a network of references are subjective, in other words, they appear differently to each other person in the network, as each person's opinion is formed by their own individual networks of trust.","Real world trust networks follow a small-world pattern, that is, where everyone is not connected to everyone else directly, but most people are connected to most other people through a relatively small number of intermediaries or \u201cconnectors\u201d. This means that some individuals within the network may disproportionately influence the opinion held by other individuals. In other words, some people's opinions may be more influential than others.","In some embodiments, influence is determined for augmenting reputation, which may be subjective. In some embodiments, influence can be an objective measure. For example, influence can be useful in filtering opinions, information, and data.","Furthermore, current techniques for advertising are based on various proxy measures of the influence of their target audiences. Advertisers use demographic data as a way of estimating the influence of their advertisements, and advertisers are charged for access to a given audience based on the influence of that audience (e.g., in purchasing decisions) as estimated from indirect measures, such as demographics.","Accordingly, as described herein, more precise techniques of measuring the influence of recipients of advertisements can be used to improve the pricing structure and targeting of advertisements.","In some embodiments, various techniques are provided allowing for the determination of the targeting and pricing of advertisements based on the influence of actual or potential recipients of the advertising, in which the influence is estimated directly rather than through proxy means, such as demographics or expressions of interest in particular content, subject matter, information, or media. For example, the influence can be estimated directly using the techniques described herein.","In some embodiments, the techniques described herein include the use of directly estimated measures of the influence of individuals in a target audience for online advertisements. In some embodiments, aspects of which can be combined to create further illustrative implementations, the measures of influence is related to a specific topic (e.g., automobiles or restaurants); the measures of influence is used to determine whether persons view a given advertisement or not; the measures of influence for each individual or group of individuals is used to determine the price the advertiser pays for the advertisement being viewed by the individuals or groups of individuals; as an incentive for influential individuals to view advertising, advertising revenue is shared with individuals on condition that they view advertising targeted to them, and the advertising revenue is shared in a proportion related to the level of directly measured influence of each individual.","In some embodiments, the techniques described herein include a social graph of individuals on the Internet, such as shown in , in which the individuals represent natural or legal persons and the documents represent natural or legal persons, or other entities such as computational processes, documents, data files, or any form of product or service or information of any means or form for which a representation has been made within the computer network within this system.","In some embodiments, the social graph is directed, and in some embodiments, the social graph is undirected.","In some embodiments, the social graph is explicit, with individuals expressing a link to other individuals; and in some embodiments, the social graph is implicit, with a system and method for identifying the links between individuals, such as trust, respect, positive, or negative opinion.","In some embodiments, the links or edges of the social graph represent different forms of association including, for example, friendship, trust, acquaintance and the edges on the graph are constrained by dimensions representing ad-hoc types including but not limited to subjects, fields of interest, and\/or search terms.","In some embodiments, the nodes of the social graph represent people or other entities (e.g., web pages, blogs, and\/or any other entity) that include expressions of opinion, reviews, or other information useful for the estimation of influence, and that each node on the graph represents an influential entity, once influence for that node has been, for example, estimated.","In some embodiments, the nodes are placed in two categories, as subjects capable of having an opinion or making a citation, in which such expression is explicit, expressed, implicit, or imputed through any other technique; and as objects about which subjects have opinions or make citations; in which, for example, certain objects are also subjects; and in which an object has reputation scores indicating the possibly collective opinion of subjects on the object, and subjects have influence scores indicating the degree to which the subject's opinion influences other subjects.","In some embodiments, in which nodes are in two categories as described above, the reputation scores of objects are uses for the selection and ranking of objects, for example, weighted by the influence scores of the subjects related to the object, for example, in combination with other attributes of objects including to semantic or descriptive data regarding the object.","In some embodiments, the influence score is weighted by an expertise score for each subject based on descriptive criteria. In some embodiments, the influence score is weighted by an expertise score for each subject based on descriptive criteria, wherein the expertise score for each subject is based on the citations from each subject matching descriptive criteria as a relative share of all citations from the subject, and citations from all subjects matching the descriptive criteria as a relative share of citations from all subjects.","In some embodiments, the social graph is directed (e.g., a directed graph). In some embodiments, the social graph is undirected (e.g., an undirected graph).","In some embodiments, the social graph is explicit, in which individuals express a link to other individuals. In some embodiments, the social graph is implicit, in which techniques are provided for identifying the links between individuals, for example, trust, respect, positive, or negative opinion(s).","In some embodiments, the links or edges on the graph represent different forms of association including, for example, friendship, trust, and\/or acquaintance, and that the edges on the graph can be constrained by dimensions representing ad-hoc types including, for example, subjects, fields of interest, and\/or search terms.","In some embodiments, the nodes on the graph represent or correspond to people or other entities (e.g., web pages, blogs, and\/or other entities) that can have expressions of opinion, reviews, or other information useful for the estimation of influence, and that each node on the graph is viewed as an influential entity, for example, once influence for that node has been estimated.","In some embodiments, a price to be paid in order to display a given advertisement to the influential entity is determined at least in part based on the measure of influence of a given entity as directly estimated. In some embodiments, the measure of influence that is directly estimated is determined using various techniques to provide an objective measure of influence.","In some embodiments, a determination to display a given advertisement to the influential entity is made at least in part based on the measure of influence of a given entity as directly estimated.","In some embodiments, a proportion of revenue received for the display of a given advertisement to the influential entity is shared with the influential entity, in which the proportion of revenue is determined at least in part based on the measure of influence of the entity as directly estimated.","In some embodiments, the various techniques described herein are applied to assist in determining a price for advertising (e.g., online advertising), such as pay-per-view, pay-per-click-through, pay-for-purchase, and in which, in some embodiments, instead of a single price for each payment event (e.g., a view of an advertisement, a click through on a advertising link, or an actual purchase) or each payment level (e.g., different ranges of views), a graduated price range table is provided in which the multiple prices for each payment event or are based on influence values (e.g., directly estimated values of objective measure(s) of influence).","In some embodiments, pricing and advertising determinations are based at least in part on influence scores computed on one set of users of one platform or sets of platforms and applied to users of other systems or platforms in which advertising is being provided, with the users being individually tracked. For example, influence of bloggers can be calculated on one system and when such bloggers register themselves on that system they can be provided with an Internet cookie that allows them to be identified when they visit another system in which they are served with advertising based on the influence. Similarly, such individuals with identified influence can be identified in other ways such as by identifying themselves with a target system in which they are served with advertising based on the influence.","In some embodiments, pricing and advertising determinations are based at least in part on influence scores computed in aggregate rather than on individual users. For example, the aggregate influence for visitors to an online newspaper can be estimated by identifying the public citations, recommendations, or other expressions of opinion made by individuals for that online newspaper, indicating that authors of such citations are users of that online newspaper; the influence of such authors can be estimated and the distribution of such influence and topology of the graph (e.g., social graph) of such authors who are also users of that online newspaper can be used as a proxy for the influence of all actual users of that online newspaper, providing for a better refinement and metric for measuring the influence of that online newspapers users than, for example, proxy measures of influence based on readership surveys and demographics.","In some embodiments, the application of any of the techniques described herein to pricing for advertising (e.g., online advertising) is provided, such as pay-per-view, pay-per-click-through, pay-for-purchase, in which instead of a single price for each payment event (e.g., a view of an advertisement, a click through on a advertising link, or an actual purchase) or each payment level (e.g., different ranges of views), a graduated price range table is provided in which the multiple prices for each payment event or are based on influence values, as will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in view of the various embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","220","225","230","235","260","250","240","242","245","247","200","205","210","215","220","225","230"]},"In some embodiments, in an illustrative operation, client computing environments , , and  can communicate and cooperate with server computing environment  over communications network  to provide requests for and receive reputation data , , and .

In the illustrative implementation, an exemplary reputation target Q can inquire about the reputation of other reputation targets (e.g., obtain trusted data for use to assist in making a decision, determine an affinity, and\/or identify a dislike). The individual reputations of each of the target participants can be derived according to the herein described techniques (e.g., in ) so that each reputation target is attributed one or more reputation indicators (e.g., a reputation score associated for restaurant referrals, another reputation score associated for movie referrals, another reputation score associated for match-making, etc.). The reputation indicators can be calculated based on the degree and number of relationships between reputation targets in a given sub-environment and\/or outside of a sub-environment. Once calculated, an exemplary reputation target Q can query other reputation targets for trusted data (e.g., recommendations and\/or referrals) and can process such trusted data according to reputation score of the data source (e.g., reputation target).","For example, sub-environment  can represent a place of business, sub-environment  can represent home, and sub-environment can represent a country club. In some embodiments, in an illustrative operation, each of the reputation targets of reputation attribution environment  can be attributed one or more reputation scores (e.g., reputation score for business data, reputation score for family data, etc.).

Responsive to the request, the reputation targets of sub-environment  (e.g., reputation target can act as data sources for reputation target Q) providing data that can satisfy reputation target Q's request. Additionally, other reputation targets, who are not directly part of sub-environment , can also act as data sources to reputation target Q. In this context, the reputation score for reputation targets A, B, C, and\/or D) can have a higher reputation score than other reputation targets not part of sub-environment  as such reputation targets are within sub-environment , which is focused on business.
