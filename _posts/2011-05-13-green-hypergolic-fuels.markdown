No. 61\/355,598 filed Jun. 17, 2010.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","This invention relates to hypergolic fuels, particularly those having components of little or no toxicity.","The state-of-the-art, storable bipropulsion system uses a hydrazine (typically monomethylhydrazine) as a fuel component. This fuel affords useful performance characteristics and has a fast ignition with an oxidizer. Such fast (hypergolic) ignition provides system reliability for on-demand action of the propulsion system. In addition, a bipropellant's hypergolic character is very beneficial since it removes the requirement of a separate ignition component; additional components bring increased inert mass and reduced system performance. The energy density of the state-of-the-art, storable bipropulsion system is largely limited by the density of the fuel. Storable fuels range in density from 0.88 g\/cc (monomethylhydrazine) to 1.00 g\/cc (hydrazine). Energetic ionic liquids have established densities that range well above 1.00 g\/cc, and thus can confer greater energy density as bipropellant fuels. Also, there are significant costs and operational constraints associated with handling state-of-the-art fuels (hydrazines) that derive from the fuel's carcinogenic vapor. Fuel transport, loading and unloading are significantly complicated by its vapor toxicity and can require considerable efforts and costs in vapor monitoring with trained operations crews employed in expensive personal protection equipment.","Accordingly there is need and market for environmentally enhanced \u201cgreen\u201d fuels, which overcome the above prior art shortcomings.","Referring to the present invention in detail, advanced IL fuels with fast ignition (upon mixing with storable oxidizer), have been synthesized per the invention. Principally, such fuels are based upon ionic liquids containing borohydride including anions with borohydride as a structural component or other metallohydrides.

Such substituent (i.e., R-group) structures may be strained-ring (e.g., cyclopropyl-), or high-nitrogen moieties (e.g., azido-or cyano).","Ionic liquids have established characteristics of negligible vapor toxicity and generally higher density than typical propulsion fuels (e.g., hydrocarbons and hydrazines). The design and development of energy-dense, fast-igniting ionic liquids as fuels for bipropellants can provide improved handling characteristics (due to lower toxicity hazard) and thus lower operations cost. In addition, such fuels can impart greater performance capabilities such as increased velocity, range or system lifetime.","Advanced bipropellant fuels are designed for fast ignition, upon mixing","with storable oxidizer (NO, nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide) and have been synthesized per the invention. The bipropellant fuels are based upon salts, particularly ionic liquids, containing borohydride-based anions and employ cations designed to impart low melting point, stable molecules.","Fast igniting, ionic liquid fuels provide a means to overcome significant limitations of a state-of-the-art, storable bipropulsion system. Such ionic liquid fuels can provide greater than 20% improvement in density over hydrazine fuels. This confers greater energy density to the bipropulsion system. Also, the negligible vapor pressure of ionic liquid fuel provides an outstanding means of significantly reducing costs and operational constraints associated with handling the fuel. Prior to this invention, fast-igniting ionic liquid fuels were limited to operation with oxidizers based solely on oxides of nitrogen (e.g., NTO\/WFNA\/RFNA\/IRFNA) as the only suitable oxidizers. The discovery of hypergolic activity of metalohydride-based ILs in combination with stabilizing cations, affords a new class of IL-based fuel that provides fast ignition with not only oxides of nitrogen but also with hydrogen peroxide. The employment of a fast-igniting ionic liquid fuel with hydrogen peroxide oxidizer, provides an avenue toward a bipropulsion system that employs environmentally enhanced (or green) fuel and oxidizer.","The preferred embodiment of the invention is the employment of pure borohydride-based IL fuel as a fast-igniting, bipropellant. However, the use of these ionic liquid molecules as components in fuel mixtures to confer fast-ignition and density, is also a viable mode of the invention.","A hypergolic bipropellant based upon an ionic liquid, borohydride-based fuel and an oxidizer (HO\/NTO\/WFNA\/RFNA\/IRFNA) has potential as a replacement for bipropellants currently used in on-orbit spacecraft propulsion. Other application areas include liquid engines for boost and divert propulsion. The high energy density that is inherent in the new hypergol, lends itself to applications that require high performance from volume limited systems. The low vapor toxicity of the ionic liquid fuel is a benefit over toxic hydrazine fuels currently used.","Also, the performance aspects of this new hypergol can find use in commercial applications in satellite deployment and commercial space launch activities."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","p":["Broadly, the present invention provides a bipropellant having, an ionic liquid (IL) containing a metalohydride as fuel and an oxidizer, which fuel and oxidizer have hypergolic ignition upon contact.","In one embodiment, the above IL has an anion and cation, with the metalohydride being situated in the anion."]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
