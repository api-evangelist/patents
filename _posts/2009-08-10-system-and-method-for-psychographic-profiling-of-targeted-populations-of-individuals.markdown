title: System and method for psychographic profiling of targeted populations of individuals
abstract: A system and method are provided for psychographically profiling a target population of individuals, programmably implemented in a server apparatus. The psychographic segmentation portion includes a questionnaire processing part, a segment solution part, and a typing tool part. The questionnaire processing part acquires a plurality of responses to a predetermined set of questionnaire questions by an initial pool of target population members. The questionnaire processing part uses a combination of weighted statistical methodologies to arrive at a rule-based decision on whether the question would serve as a good wedge variable. Optionally, the rule based decision is then compared to an expert's opinion and the weights and threshold parameters of the weighted statistical combination are adjusted accordingly to more accurately match the expert's decision. The identified wedge variables are used for effectively segregating the target population into groups of homogenous individuals. The typing tool part selectively generates an abbreviated set of questions from the predetermined set of questionnaire questions for profiling an individual respondent to at least one of the segments.

No. 12\/134,864 filed 6 Jun. 2008, now pending, which is a Continuation-In-Part of 11\/851,146 filed 6 Sep. 2007, based on U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/842,489 filed on 6 Sep. 2006.","The present invention is generally directed to automated measures for optimally profiling a particularly targeted population of individuals so as to enable highly reliable predictive modeling and highly tailored communications based thereon. More specifically, the subject system for psychographic profiling employs a statistical engine for profiling individuals based on a predetermined set of personal data acquired for the targeted population. The acquired data may include qualitative and quantitative information relating comprehensively to subjective indicia for attitudinal, behavioral, and preferential attributes of the individuals to supplement other more objective information that may be available (such as health\/medical, pharmaceutical, and hospital claims history data).","The need for reliable predictive modeling to guide proper policy and planning is prevalent throughout virtually all identifiable sectors of modern day society. They include both public and private sectors, and run across the full spectrum of industries, markets, and business areas. While the particular demographics of the populations targeted will undoubtedly vary across enterprises\u2014as will the nature of the parameters predicted, and the purposes of the endeavor\u2014the need to capture and reduce the necessary personal information to meaningfully equip the predictive modeling required is a prevailing need, regardless of enterprise.","The health industry is but one example of the numerous applications for the present invention. The need for optimal patient profiling, and highly reliable predictive modeling of future behavior based thereon, is of particular importance in this industry historically marked by wide scale waste, poor management, and lack of cost control. Health care providers, insurers, and regulators alike have long struggled to predict responsive behaviors of patient populations with accuracy in the hopes of efficiently allocating vital resources, while actually improving the quality of care and resulting outcomes. Despite myriad of often very complex efforts, their attempts have largely failed in this regard.","Consequently, there remains a shared need in health care applications as well as others for a comprehensive tool which effectively captures and optimally reduces both subjective and objective information personal to individuals in a given population for use in predictive modeling to assess future outcomes. There remains a need for such tool, moreover, which captures and optimally factors the psychographic persuasion and\/or tendencies of individuals within the given population. There remains a particular need for such tool in health care applications to conveniently and effectively enable health care providers, insurers, and regulators to improve quality of care and resulting outcomes by proactively identifying behaviors and medical conditions that adversely affect the patient, employer, health plan, or the like.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and method which captures and optimally reduces subjective information personal to individuals in a given population, for use in predictive modeling.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method which provides psychographic profiles for individuals in the given population to enable reliable prediction of their behavioral tendencies.","It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a question selection tool for consistently and reliably choosing questions that are able to segment a given population into homogenous groups.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system and method that learns to arrive at decisions that an expert would make by selectively adjusting parameters until the system decisions are very similar to those decisions made by the expert.","It is still another object of the present invention to provide a psychographic profiling tool for reliably classifying individuals with one of a plurality of segments defined for the given population.","These and other objects are attained in a system and method formed in accordance with the present invention for psychographically profiling a target population of individuals. In an embodiment of the system and method, a psychographic segmentation portion is programmably implemented in a server apparatus. The psychographic segmentation portion includes a questionnaire processing part, a segment solution part, and a typing tool part. The questionnaire processing part is operable to acquire a plurality of responses to a predetermined set of questionnaire questions by an initial pool of target population members. It statistically analyzes the acquired responses to selectively identify a plurality of questionnaire questions as wedge variables through a weighted statistical analysis, which are ranked according to their capacity for segregating the target population into a predetermined distribution of groups. The segment solution part is operable to generate a plurality of candidate segments to correspond respectively to a set of highly ranked wedge variables. The segment solution part selectively sets an optimized set of segments from the candidate segments responsive to a predefined set of selection criteria, whereby each segment is defined by at least one highly ranked wedge variable. The typing tool part is operable to selectively generate an abbreviated set of questions from the predetermined set of questionnaire questions. The abbreviated set of questions correspond to the highly ranked wedge variables and serve to map a respondent of the abbreviated set of questionnaire questions to at least one of the segments.","In an application of the system and method for developing an instrument for psychographically profiling individuals within a target population, the system comprises a model build portion operable to generate at least one psychographic profiling model having a plurality of profiling segments. The model build portion includes a data definition part operable to control generation of a survey containing an initial set of questions pertaining to the target population, and to control acquisition of responses to the initial question set from an initial pool of target population members. The model build portion also includes a variable or question selection part operable to determine based upon evaluation of the acquired responses, through statistical analysis from a weighted combination of criteria, relative capacities of the questions to consistently segregate the target population relative to predefined group distribution criteria. The variable or question selection part identifies a plurality of meaningful wedge variables responsive to the determination to include at least a subset of the questions. The model build portion further includes a segment definition part operable to selectively define an optimal set of profiling segments correlated to respective ones of the wedge variables for selective combination in accordance with response data for the wedge variables. Various combinations of the profiling segments collectively define unique psychographic profiles for individuals within the target population.","A typing tool generation portion is also provided in the system. The typing tool generation portion is operable to identify a set of determinant variables selected from the wedge variables correlated to the optimal set of profiling segments. The determinant variables define a typing tool for substantially acquiring the response data from an individual.","Turning now to , there is schematically illustrated a flow of processes carried out in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The system generally includes a psychographic segmentation portion  wherein a comprehensive set of personal data for individuals belonging to a targeted patient population is acquired and processed to generate optimized segments by which to psychographically profile them. In accordance with the present invention, statistically meaningful psychographic information is ascertained and used to drive the segmentation process. This information preferably includes predetermined indicia for individuals' attitudes and wants, as well as subjectively perceived needs and the like.","The system preferably includes a utilization, or profiling, portion  wherein the optimized segments are programmably utilized to determine the relevant psychographic profiles of particular individuals. From this, the user may reliably assess future outcomes relating to those particular individuals. Unlike the segmentation portion , the actual configuration of this portion will vary considerably with the intended application, so as to suit the specific context of use.","In the embodiment illustrated in , various attitudinal, behavioral, and medical information data is acquired at block  for individuals in a targeted population of past or would be patients. This may be carried out, for instance, by directly obtaining questionnaire responses from a suitably sized pool of respondents, or indirectly by gleaning such responses from other available information. Preferably, the questionnaire (which may be administered to the population by any suitable means), captures subjective patient responses to questions relating to such things as personality, leadership, risk tolerance, patient-physician relationship, health habits, and readiness to change. At block , various secondary sources of personal information like medical and insurance records may be consulted to supplementally acquire other more objective information relating to demographics, medical claims history, pharmacy claims history, prior health risk assessments, lab data, or the like.","In the particular healthcare context illustrated, then, the disclosed system employs a server operably configured with program instructions to implement a plurality of highly determinative segmentation models derived by use of latent class modeling and\/or other suitable statistical modeling techniques to predict and assess the pertinent psychographic and behavioral profile of an individual, based on certain questionnaire responses of that individual. This informs the predictive modeling of insurers or other users to reliably predict healthcare-related costs and risk to be expected for the individual. This also assists population management programs and medical providers, as well as the patients themselves, to better manage patient health and mitigate risk. As a result, better treatment plans and protocols may be created based not only on patients' objective attributes and health status, but also on subjective tendencies as indicated by their psychographic and behavioral characteristics.","The system establishes and maintains a database which captures the complete psychographic profile of a particular patient, containing all pre-analyzed and post-analyzed data specific to that particular patient. The patient's data set preferably includes, but is not limited to, all attitudinal and behavioral responses, medical claims, pharmacy claims, lab data, and health risk assessments.","Preferably, psychographic profiles are characterized through a hierarchal tree of nodes at successive levels (parent and child nodes), as illustrated in the example of . Statistical modeling techniques are automatically executed to define one or more distinct characterizing segments within each node, which enable individuals to be accurately profiled therethrough. The hierarchal tree database structure captures parent to child relationships between nodes, with the levels of characterization broken more finely into smaller subsections at each successive child node. The nodes and segments are specifically defined by the attitudinal and behavioral characteristics found through the modeling and analysis of questionnaire responses from a sufficient pool of respondents (in view of the demographics and all the other health related data) to be the most consistent in segregating groups of individuals into like subgroups ().","In connection with , if the \u201capplied model\u201d ultimately resulting from the process, which includes mathematical formulas derived by statistical analyses, identifies a patient to be characterized by the highlighted blocks in its hierarchal tree as illustrated, the patient's characteristics would be identified as \u201c2-3-1,\u201d where the numeric values represent different segments or classifications. The Parent Node could be defined as \u201cdisease states,\u201d for example, with the Parent Node block \u201c2\u201d representing all populations of diabetics. The Child Node \u201c1\u201d (or . . . n) in this example could be defined as types of diabetics, either by medical classification or by other classifications such as behavioral or attitudinal indicators identified by the applied models created from statistical modeling techniques. Each subsequent Child Node level could be subdivided into additional Child Nodes (n) identified as further subsets of psychographic classifications defined by the given data.","As schematically illustrated in , various types of personal data relating to members of the target population are acquired and statistically analyzed (as indicated at block ) to obtain a set of profiling segments (as indicated at block ). Preferably, the types of data include subjective psychographic data such as personal attitudes and perceptions indicated by responses to certain carefully configured questionnaire questions, as well as the more objective data such as demographics , medical needs , and documented behavioral histories which may be available through secondary sources other than the questionnaire. The acquired information is processed to ultimately identify an optimized set of profiling segments inter-related in a hierarchically organized manner to provide a simple yet reliable profile of an individual based upon his or her responses to the questionnaire. In accordance with the present invention, the obtained segments inform the user to gain a holistic understanding of, among other things, who really the respondent is, what he\/she needs to hear, how the respondent's risks may be assessed and mitigated, how the respondent may be otherwise helped, and how the respondent may be effectively influenced to make corrective changes in habits, lifestyle, and the like.","Responses to the given questionnaires are captured by any suitable means\u2014via online, paper, telephonic and\/or in person\u2014and transferred into a database. The questionnaire questions are generated in predetermined manner to span a range of attitudinal and behavioral categories. One example of categories for the illustrated embodiment is shown in  and includes such categories as behaviors, attitudes, needs, marketing reach, and demographics. Obviously, these categories may overlap with information (such as demographics and behavior history) which may be available already through personal records and other such secondary sources of data. Also, particular questionnaire questions may fall within more than one category, so long as comprehensive coverage of all categories is collectively realized by the full set of questionnaire questions.","Generally, two types of questions are used to separate and segment profiles: scaled and fixed response question types. Examples of such question types for the illustrated embodiment are shown in . Scaled questions are those which invoke in response a relative measure referenced to a graduated continuum, such as a numeric scale of \u201c1\u201d to \u201c9\u201d representing an increasing range between \u201cdo not agree\u201d and \u201ctotally agree.\u201d Fixed questions are those that invoke discrete responsive information, such as identification of the respondent's gender and selection of one or more applicable items from a delineated set.","More objective information from other available sources of health-related records (medical, pharmaceutical, insurance records, personal history, demographic data, . . . ) are preferably combined with the questionnaire responses to fully identify and segment the population. In the example of , for instance, the population is initially segmented according to patients suffering from certain types of diabetes.","Wedge questions, or wedge variables, may, in certain embodiments be pre-selected (hypothesized), tested for significance, and confirmed or changed through the statistical analysis carried out at blocks , . Wedge variables in other embodiments may simply be identified by the statistical analysis. These wedge variables are defined as those that best segregate respondents into homogenous groups and serve to identify their most distinctive differences. The different groups should be heterogeneous or orthogonal with relation to each other. One group should be as distinct from another group as possible. When identified, the wedge variables are preferably flagged as such in the database.","Wedge variables are identified at block  upon separately analyzing at block  the pool of responses acquired for each questionnaire question from their distribution using histograms, for example, as illustrated in . The system operates to selectively identify, either automatically or with manual (expert) input, wedge variables by pre-defining the required distribution characteristics of the responses. Optimal wedge variables yield histograms that are relatively flat or multi-peaked (), whereas poor candidates for wedge variables yield histograms that are single peaked or shaped such that the majority of responses are clustered tightly around one response or one part of the scale ().","In the example illustrated in , a wedge variable would be chosen by seeking histograms pertaining to questions that divide respondents into more than one group. Multi-peaked or flat histograms would generally be preferable over single peak distributions of data.","In practice, it is important to ensure that no one topical area is over-represented by the questionnaire. Each question preferably contains meta-data relating to a thematic category, content area, or what topic the question pertains to. Thereby, questions or variables can be evaluated for potential wedge variable status from a mix of different content areas or topics. Otherwise, if wedge variables are selected having the same content area or topic, that content area or topic will be biased or over-represented. Some exemplary content areas could be demographics, health, psychographics, behavioral, need-based, media-based, product-based, service-based, or secondary-data-based. If all questions were selected from the content area of demographics, then the model becomes driven by similarities and differences in demographic data, and less influenced by other types of data. This is not preferable because the model would be forced to be uni-dimensional, rather than multi-dimensional. In certain embodiments, the area under each histogram curve is preferably normalized to unity, so that disparate weighting of responses is more readily apparent.","Optionally, a selectively set distribution threshold is employed in identifying wedge variables. If a peak for a response histogram exceeds the threshold, the corresponding question is rejected as a possible wedge variable (). Alternately, if the peak of the response histogram remains within the threshold, the corresponding question may be selected as a wedge variable (). By selectively adjusting this wedge variable threshold accordingly, the system may iteratively and automatically identify the required (or desired) number of wedge variables to be utilized in the segmentation process. Suitable factor analysis and multiple regression techniques may be employed at blocks ,  to hierarchically select wedge variables representative of the most notable topical areas. Wedge variables are not necessarily limited to questionnaire questions and may, depending on the requirements of the intended application, include variables taken from other additional data sets such as demographic and health data.","In the specific example illustrated in , a \u201cceiling method\u201d for auto-selection of wedge variables may accordingly be employed as follows: a ceiling is placed on the vertical \u201cpercent\u201d axis. Histograms for variables that remain below the preset ceiling level are then selected, while histograms for variables which surpass the ceiling level in height are deemed to be poor histograms. The ceiling level may be adjusted iteratively thereafter until a desired number of wedge variables are selected in this manner. If, for example, the ceiling level were set at 20% as in the illustrated example, the variable whose data is plotted on the left would be selected in the illustrated application, while the variable whose data is plotted on the right would be rejected.","More preferably, response histograms of parameter frequencies or characteristic data are evaluated in block  using a weighted combination of statistical analysis methods or functions to automatically determine and quantify their desirability in segmenting groups to output resultant final indicia. Once responses to a question have been collected and aggregated, they are represented in a histogram format or any similar format which calculates, describes, or tabulates frequency distribution. Each histogram may be evaluated and quantified based on a combination score representing a weighted summation of different statistical criteria illustratively including: standardized entropy, standard deviation, maximum odds ratio (individually or considering neighboring answers), index of qualitative variation, or any other suitable criteria employable to determine the spread, lumping, peaking, or distribution of histograms representing wedge candidate questions. A plurality of criteria dare chosen and combined to form a formal decision rule D based at least in part on the relative frequency of the ith answer.","An exemplary criterion, d, for measuring spread of answers may be standardized entropy. Entropy measures uncertainty of which slots answers will fall into. In this case, the entropy formula has been normalized or standardized by dividing by the maximum value log(m) such that the maximum value of H will always be 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"H","mo":"=","mfrac":{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["p","i"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}}}},{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"m"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"i "},"Another similar exemplary criterion, d, is standard deviation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"sd","mo":"=","msqrt":{"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]},"mo":"-","mover":{"mi":["x","_"]}}},"mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["p","i"]}}}}},{"mrow":[{"mi":"where","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"msub":{"mi":["x","i"]}},{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"-","mn":"1"},{"mi":"m","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mi":"and","mover":{"mi":["x","_"]}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["x","i"]},{"mi":["p","i"]}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}],"mo":","}}},"br":{}},"Another criterion is the maximum odds ratio which has two sub-parts.

Input=c; objective expert input=A.","(b) Compute d, D, E, and derivatives of the weights.","(c) Adjust the weights using the basic iteration step described supra.","(d) Compute the new d, D, and E.","(e) If the old E is less than the new E, \u03b7 is adjusted to \u03b7\/2 and return to step (c). Else, proceed to step (f).","(f) If the difference between the old E and the new E is less than a certain threshold, end the algorithm. Else, go to step (b).","Once calculations have been completed, and meta-data has been considered to avoid biasing or over-weighting a particular topic of question, questions having a D value greater than 0 may be selected to be wedge variables, while questions having a D value less than 0 generally will make poor wedge variables and will not be selected.","Next, in building the psychographic profiling model, suitable Latent Class, Cluster and\/or Factor statistical modeling techniques known in the art are applied at block  to the identified wedge variable responses to create segmentation solutions.  illustrates examples of such statistical modeling techniques which may be applied in this manner. They include linear regression , binary logistic regression , latent class regression, and the like. The details of such techniques are well known to those skilled in the art, and will not be further described herein.","Nonetheless, a few points bear mention in connection with the statistical techniques indicated in . Traditional linear regression makes restrictive assumptions such as:","Dependent variable (Y) shown at block  in  is continuous in nature (prediction errors (e) are normally distributed); and,\n\n","The parameters (b) in linear regression  are estimated via ordinary least square (OLS) techniques wherein:","The squared deviation between actual and predicted values of Y are minimized; and,","Certain parameters indicate change in Y associated with unit change in X.","The binary logistic regression technique  illustrated in  assumes that the dependent variable is dichotomous (e.g., Yes, No), and that the probability (\u03c0) of having one or the other is bounded between 0 and 1. Error is assumed to be distributed as binomial, not normal. The population is again assumed to be homogenous\u2014i.e. one model holding for all cases.","Where the model is nonlinear , parameters (b) are estimated via iterative numerical methods. This results in maximum likelihood estimates.","The advantages provided by latent class regression (LCR)  over traditional approaches include the following:","No assumption is made that any one model is best for all cases;","Unique regression models are developed simultaneously for each segment; and,","Diagnostic statistical criteria, such as AIC, VIC, AWE, are available to determine the optimal number of segments.","LCR typically includes three simultaneous steps: identifying segments; using covariates (e.g., demographics) to predict class membership; and, classifying cases into appropriate segments.","Regression coefficients such as shown in the general form of a two-segment solution  illustrated in  differ by segment indicating the direction and relative importance of each predictor in relation to the given criterion. This yields segment-specific regression equations and\/or lines.","The statistical analysis of wedge variable data preferably yield quantitative measures indicative of the degree to which given wedge variables may serve as predictors for the target population. Based on the results of statistical analysis, then, the wedge variables are ranked to identify the most powerful of the wedge variables in effectively segregating respondents, hence the most powerful indicia for reliably identifying the segregated class of respondents to which any one particular respondent may belong. Segments are defined according to these most powerful of wedge variables based on application-specific criteria, and an optimal number of such segments for the intended application are determined.","Depending on the application-specific criteria, segments may be defined such that they correspond to at least one ranked wedge variable and one or more other correlating wedge variable. Many segmentation solutions are possible, and an optimized set of segments are preferably identified upon iterative analysis of possible solutions responsive to application-specific selection criteria. Selection criteria may include the degree of relevance to the given implementation of each segment definition, the statistical validity of the segmentation, the feasibility of execution, and any other such factors suitable for the intended application. Once a segmentation solution has been chosen based upon the most determinative group of wedge variables, the responses to all of the questions are analyzed in order to characterize and\/or label each segment.","New data sets may be used as they are acquired to continually improve and\/or further delineate new segments within each segment, creating further child nodes. A psychographic profiling model is thus created for each segment. The resulting hierarchal tree may then be consulted for each respondent to assign that respondent to the appropriate segment.","In the example of , diabetic patients are profiled in the illustrated portion of the hierarchal tree obtained after segmentation. The class of all diabetic patients  is further classified in its succeeding child node  according to diabetes type , . Each diabetic type class is in turn further classified in its succeeding child node  according to personal psychographic attributes. For the class of type 1 diabetics, the psychographic profiles may include \u201ccommitted treaters\u201d  who tend to be highly compliant and responsive to treatment directives as indicated at block ; \u201chesitant compliers\u201d  who tend to follow treatment directives though with less consistency as those in the first segment as indicated at block ; \u201cignorant deniers\u201d  who tend to altogether lack sufficient appreciation of their condition and reject the notion that they are ill as indicated at block ; and, \u201cinvisible sufferers\u201d , who fail to consult a medical professional unless in a crisis (such as an Emergency Room situation) as indicated at block ","Referring more generally to the illustration of , each respondent may be uniquely profiled with reference to the hierarchal tree. A respondent in the example shown is profiled to be a \u201c2-3-1 patient.\u201d That is, the respondent is a patient who belongs in class 2 within the parent node, class 3 within the first child node, and class 1 within the second child node.","Referring back to , a typing tool, or a subset of key wedge variables, is preferably created at block  to enable quick and easy classification of respondents by asking fewer questions rather than the complete battery of questions identified as wedge variables. Utilizing suitable typing tool statistical modeling techniques known, a mathematical approach is derived to classify each segment based on the wedge variables. The typing tool thereby created mathematically defines the classification of a profile, such that whether or not a respondent fits the profile may be quickly determined without resort to full analysis of all the responses and supplemental information available for that respondent. Statistical modeling techniques which may be suitably applied in this regard include discriminate function analysis, multinomial logistic regression, classification and regression trees, as well as others.","Multiple typing tools, or mathematical models, for delineating segments are preferably created and captured in a database, cross-referencing questionnaires and responses for use in a production environment, employing software APIs (application programming interfaces), web browsers, applets, transaction processing systems, and the like. Each psychographic profile is thereby referenced by a subset of wedge variables, requiring evaluation of responses to just a subset of the questionnaire with demographic and health data to profile a particular respondent. Typing tools are generated so as to accurately identify and profile each individual respondent, preferably with an accuracy rate of 70% or higher.","The segmentation process of portion  is repeated until all needed classifications of parents and child nodes are completed. Profile of psychographic grouping is captured into a database for lookup against new data. Sources of new data may include a file of responses, online responses from a web server, and telephonic or direct face to face communication of information or secondary data (pharmaceutical, claims, health insurance, or other such information).","Once the intended hierarchy is completed, the psychographic profiles and cross referenced wedge variables are applied at block  (portion  of the system) for use in classifying individual respondents and prescribing further appropriate action. The database is then integrated into the software systems of the intended application by any suitable means known in the art. The database is generally made available for use over the internet on a web browser, integrated into server based client-server applets or integrated as part of other statistical modeling or transaction processing systems as through an API (application programming interface). Preferably, new data may be processed at block  in both real-time and in batched processing environments to forecast attitudinal and behavioral segments of each individual.","Each node of the hierarchal tree is analyzed at block  to realize standardized and effective positioning, messaging, marketing, treatment plan development, and better health management techniques for each profile.  illustrates a possible action plan resulting from such analysis for the class of \u201cignorant deniers\u201d  exemplified in . The standardized plan for this class of patients may be, for instance, to focus on treatment combined with education  to aid their understanding and acceptance of their condition (see blocks -). The insecurities underlying the tendencies of these individuals require the educational measures to be simple and straight forward, and carefully crafted for these persons particularly prone to fear or anxiety accompanying newfound medical awareness (see blocks , -). By analyzing each node, specific sets of action plans are so obtained and linked to each segment or node.","Turning to , responses from the wedge variables (or wedge questionnaires) are processed utilizing the developed applied models and typing tool formulas to predict and classify the individual into specific segments. While the initial development of psychographic profiles and creation of typing tools  is a one-time event (see blocks -), based on a sufficiently large pool of respondents' data, their updating remains ongoing. Additional data acquired through new respondents is added continually as use is made of the system. The segmentation process (in at least an abbreviated form) (see blocks -) is carried out to update the profiling segments and\/or refine the typing tools. The database is correspondingly updated with further information, and additional action plans are prescribed and linked, if necessary, to specific segments.","Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are preferably implemented as a system of interoperable software applications suitably embedded for execution in one or more host platforms, such as servers dedicated to certain functions and microprocessor based workstations.  is a diagram schematically illustrating a functional arrangement of hardware components in a system  established in accordance with one such exemplary embodiment of the present invention, for building and utilizing psychographic profiling models.","System  preferably includes a plurality of processing servers  which provide the processing power to execute the many analytical computations required for variable selection and segmentation solution development, as well as the various sorting, searching, or other computational functions requisite to developing and launching one or more psychographic profiling models.

Depending on where the users are located, they may establish a communication link with either of these servers via the internet .

Users at the call center level, and at the POS interviewer and online self-survey level, collect and enter responses to the survey questions to accumulate responses from a sufficient sampling of individuals (patients in the illustrated example) making up the targeted population of interest to yield statistically valid segmentation solutions. Once the necessary processing takes place to formulate the desired segmentation solution(s) and corresponding typing tool(s), the typing tool(s) may be administered to individual patients needing to be psychographically profiled, via the call center, POS, or online self-survey work stations , , . The typing tool responses are then passed by the questionnaire and database servers ,  to apply the proper profiling model at application server . Thereafter, the resulting profile and any action plan prescription are duly disseminated for the respondent patient's benefit.","A plurality of graphic user interfaces (GUI) to the system are preferably established at the various user level workstations, whereby a user may quickly and conveniently access and control system components and their operation through. Preferably, the computer programs driving system operation in this regard (such as web browsers) are launched as layered frames which host the given software applications. The programs may employ any suitable user interface elements known in the art. Where necessary, extended or custom controls may be incorporated to simplify the resulting user interface.","The data storage employed by system  may be of any suitable type known in the art. A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), for example, may be preferable in those embodiments wherein relationship definitions between entities are supported. It is important for efficient system performance that the database management measures employed be sufficiently robust to accommodate storage and retrieval of large data volume, while being structured to accommodate efficient comparison and correlation of attributes on distinct files or records.","Referring now to , there is shown a flow diagram schematically illustrating a flow of processes for implementing a psychographic segmentation portion  () in accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The processes shown are preferably implemented in software stored in a computer readable medium. Portions of these processes may incorporate, where suitable, known components which may be commercially available individually, such as database tools, reporting software, integration code, automation services, manual input interfaces, statistical analysis tools, and the like.","As described in preceding paragraphs, psychographic segmentation portion  is used to develop one or more programmable models for systematically and objectively classifying a population of interest (such as certain populations of healthcare consumers) according to a set of highly discriminating segments. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the models are formulated in such manner that distinct groups of the population are profiled to reveal their shared psychographic, behavioral, and attitudinal tendencies, such that optimal and efficient messages may be presented to the profiled population groups for suggested medications or other medical therapies to improve compliance or bring about the desired effects upon individuals belonging to the distinct group. In the healthcare consumer example, psychographic information obtained from profiling ensures the generation of healthcare-related content that is likely to be highly persuasive upon the profiled consumer. For example, healthcare consumers sharing a particular set of segmented attributes may, in light of their shared profile, be especially receptive to direct marketing of options for improving overall health or lowering overall costs of healthcare and insurance.","Toward the end of obtaining such practically meaningful profiling, segmentation is based on factors which are highly actionable for change. Suitable methods and analytical tools known in the art are employed in this regard to ultimately generate a typing tool which reduces the amount of data required to reliably profile a patient in this manner. As described in preceding paragraphs, segments are defined in the initial model development stages according to certain variables identified for notable acuity in distinguishing those qualities and attributes effectively shared only by a unique part of the overall population of interest. These variables may be demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and\/or attitudinal in nature.","At block , predefined segmentation objectives are accordingly established to guide the segmentation process in desired manner for the given population of interest. These objectives provide the direction in which to continually drive qualitative choices arising in the processes. Depending on the specifics of the intended application, the stated objectives may be relatively broad. For example, one objective may generally be to identify high risk patients concerned about their health. The objectives may be quite specific in other cases. An example of such may be to identify employees with diabetes within a company who are prone to foregoing required insulin shots because of the pain, but are otherwise open to alternative treatments and remain receptive to a call from a health care professional to discussing alternative treatments. Regardless of scope, the predefined segmentation objectives, while conceptually established and articulated, are preferably reflected only implicitly in such system features as selection criteria, tuning parameters, and\/or manually input information.","Obviously, different intended applications, different fields of endeavor, different subject matter of interest, and different makeup of the population pool will necessitate different segmentation objectives. Examples of such segmentation objectives in a healthcare context, with the population pool made up of current and perspective patients or healthcare service recipients, may include:\n\n","Once the predefined segmentation objectives are clearly established, the data definition process may proceed. This process includes first defining at block  a comprehensive survey consistent with the predefined segmentation objectives. Preferably, the collective expertise of learned individuals (\u2018advisory\u2019 users) in various areas of heathcare or any other field of interest in the intended application is brought to bear in generating a suitable survey. A plurality of questions pertaining to the relevant subject matter are created with the benefit of such expertise, then entered and recorded in the system. The resulting survey, preferably in the form of a personal questionnaire, is geared toward evoking psychographic information about the responding individual, including the individual's tendencies, attitudes, wants, and needs. For example, certain questions of the survey may induce responses which indicate the respondent's attitude and\/or perception as to the effectiveness of a particular treatment, or the respondent's attitude and\/or receptiveness or aversion to physician advice.","Other more objective information, such as demographic and behavior history data may, but need not be, included in the survey. More objective information like this may be readily gathered from secondary sources such as insurance eligibility listings, claims histories, and the like.","In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the survey questions are stored in the system to be available for further analysis as such, even apart from the survey responses. Preferably, the survey structure, or schema, is described for the system in this regard, independent of any responses thereto.","Each of the questions is categorically defined, for example, by its type, its text, and its response choices. The system preferably employs a plurality of predefined question types which determine, in part, how easily the response data may be statistically processed for use in the final model.

On the one hand, the question types must optimally promote accuracy of response, while on the other hand ensure that the responses are based on a clear understanding of the question by the respondent. Additionally, for the technical purposes of segmentation, scaled responses are particularly useful because they expand the variability of responses (for example, offering 11 response choices on a 0-10 point scale). Variability in responses is preferably one of the criteria on which selection of \u201cwedge\u201d variables is based. Typically, 40-60% of the questions in a questionnaire developed for the purposes of segmentation are questions invoking scaled responses.","In the presentation of response choices, the response choices are preferably rotated (in the order displayed for selection by the respondent) in the questionnaire methodology. This serves to mitigate the potential bias that might otherwise result from the particular positioning of answer choices relative to each other.","Referring back to , the flow proceeds from block  to block  wherein a complete variable profile is identified for the data to be acquired. The data schema for all data sources (survey, secondary sources, manually entered information) are provided as inputs for this process. Survey questions resulting from block  form a subclass of the variables being profiled, each question preferably constituting a variable. Also, information resulting from manual selection or entry by a user also forms a subclass of variables. Secondary sources, on the other hand, typically require an effective \u2018reverse engineering\u2019 or other process on their stored data file layout to extract (or interpret) the level of information suitable for use as a variable. Any suitable means known in the art may be used in that regard. A complete description of all available variables is thus obtained as a superset of the survey questions, manual entries, and schema of secondary sources.","The description of data variables may be recorded in the system using any suitable technique known in the art, such as database tables which describe schema information, structured files like XML files, or merely extrapolating from the data source schemas themselves. Preferably, the technique to be employed is selected based upon the efficiency with which the variable profile may be managed\u2014that is, with minimum processing overhead and without required modification of the source \u2018raw\u2019 data. The process at this stage is effectively one of data description, not data cleansing.","Regardless of the data recording\/management technique employed, variable analysis begins preferably with the following base properties defined for each variable:\n\n","Analysis of the variables preferably yields various meta-data attributes for each. These attributes lend insight into the meaning of the variables' data and guide advisory users of the system to draw appropriate conclusions on the usefulness of derived segmentations. Each variable preferably includes such attributes as category and theme, along with a \u2018common name\u2019 designation.","At block  the full survey is preferably conducted to collect primary data from respondents belonging to the targeted population of interest. The survey may be administered by any suitable means known in the art. For instance, they could simply be distributed to respondents belonging to a sampling of population groups. Alternatively, the surveys could be verbally conducted by call center operators communicating by telephone with respondents, or by POS interviewers\u2014for example, at physicians offices\u2014through direct interview or filled paper form. The surveys may also be self-conducted by respondents through online or other user-initiated sessions. The response data acquired from the surveys is entered and recorded preferably in a common structured format.","The conduct survey block  is shown in  to follow the variable profile identification block , but in alternate embodiments, the survey may be conducted prior to completion of variable profile identification, so long as the survey has been sufficiently defined as indicated at block . Normally, practical considerations limit initial administration of the survey to but a sampling of the entire population of interest. To supplement the survey response data, information extracted from secondary sources such as pre-existing marketing surveys or other such material, and their analysis, may also be acquired.","The data definition process is completed at block  where data from one or more secondary sources is acquired and assembled. Suitable data input tools are incorporated in the system to preferably place the data in common tables\/files. Consolidation of the secondary data with primary data serves to round out profiles of individuals in the resulting segmentation model. Though information from secondary sources may generally be more objective than, say, scaled responses to personal survey questions, such secondary source data often contains information directly relevant to development of the model and the segmentation objectives. For example, the secondary data may provide behavioral, demographic, or other information which serve to substantiate information gleaned from primary data.","Preferably, data from secondary sources is aggregated into a common format with data from primary sources like the survey, for consistent and systematic processing therewith. If any general data cleansing processes are to take place, they are carried out during the primary data collection stage at block  and\/or this data assembly stage at block .","The flow proceeds from the data definition processes to block  where the given model search effort is configured (preferably in user-selective manner) with the required initiation and tagging of system parameters. Inputs to the process include the full set of variables (survey questions, schema of secondary sources, and other potential discriminants for categorizing members of the targeted population into profiled groups), the primary and secondary data acquired, and the segmentation objectives. The process is executed to establish and build a repository of models preferably using \u201cbatches\u201d which contextualize the model searches. Records for each new batch are initiated using process parameters from the preceding batch, then updated or tuned for carrying out the search, before the search operation is actuated.","The process of block  also generates a designation by which to archive and locate the given model and its parameters in the repository of models. For example, the date and time at which a particular model search batch was initiated may serve as a designation. Other attributes, such as details of the sample group, may also contribute to the designation. The process of block  may further yield classification of a model resulting from a search in a hierarchal tree.","Blocks - collectively define the wedge variable selection processes, whereby the variables for optimally discriminating groups of individuals in the targeted population are obtained in view of the predefined segmentation objectives. At block , the superset of available variables and the corresponding primary and secondary data are initially examined for any invalid data and may be validated using other statistical methods for suitability. Those variables having sufficiently complete corresponding data are selected as suitable variables by this process and passed to block  for further selection of useful variables therefrom. Various known measures may be employed to analyze and detect the suitability of variables in this manner. Preferably, the option of partially or wholly overriding this suitability check to afford a more streamlined variable selection process where necessary is made available to advisory users.","At block , the variables emerging from the selection process at block , namely the pre-screened suitable variables, are reviewed and evaluated to determine whether or not they are viable candidates to serve as wedge variables providing highly effective segmentation. Histogram reviews of the response or other data corresponding to given variables, as illustrated in preceding paragraphs, are carried out at this stage. Preferably, other statistical evaluations, such as standard deviation evaluations, supplement the review. The selection level properties of variables are accordingly updated to the extent indicated by this review of corresponding data.","Ideally, a minor portion of the suitable variables emerging from the process of block  are identified at this stage as those sufficiently useful for further consideration as wedge variables. As also described in preceding paragraphs, a thresholding or other suitable technique may be employed to detect and responsively set the selection levels to limit the class of useful variables to only the most promising of the suitable variables.","The categorized set of useful variables resulting from block  are then passed to block  where one or more statistical methods known in the art, such as factor analysis, multiple linear regression, and the like, are adapted and executed on the variables' corresponding data to accordingly update their selection level properties further. Results of the statistical analyses identify sufficiently common factors to further classify certain useful variables as necessary variables\u2014those variables that optimally discriminate between or polarize individuals into various groups in the given sample.","Additional analysis is typically performed so as to identify \u201cKey Driver\u201d variables. These variables are strongly correlated with one or several other variables that are direct questions about the central focus of the research. Identifying and including such key variables as wedge variables intelligently informs the segmentation so that the created segments may be accorded varying levels of importance. For instance, if the goal of the research were to identify diabetes patients who would be more compliant with their treatment regimen if they received free diabetic supplies, key driver variables may include those whose responses were highly correlated with the question: \u201cI would be more compliant with my diabetes treatment regimen if my diabetic supplies were free.\u201d","The processing flow then proceeds to block  where the optimal, or wedge, variables are selected. Block  receives as its inputs the necessary variables, Key Drivers, and the statistical analyses results (such as factor analysis results, cutoff criteria, . . . ). Preferably, the necessary variables received at block  are ordered according to relevant ones of their properties, and the most highly ranked of the variables selected therefrom. The criteria for this selection of variables in this manner will depend on the specific requirements of the intended application and the segmentation objectives to be realized. Perhaps the simplest selection criteria may be threshold-based, with certain predefined cutoff criteria to be imposed in view of one or more system parameters.","The wedge variables identified at block  are subjected to a classification process at block  for classification by category and\/or theme. Depending on the nature of the classification involved, a degree of manual analysis may be preferable to properly ascertain the appropriate category and determine the thematic aspects of the given variables. While this classification process may be carried out earlier (for instance, during creation of the survey where manual advisory oversight may be required in any event), minimizing the number of variables to review and analyze is preferable, particularly since at least some degree of manual analysis is to be relied upon. Carrying out the classification process \u2018as late as possible\u2019 upon just the wedge variables thus avoids considerable waste of effort and time. Such classification of variables is required for proper latent class analysis in formulating a useful segmentation solution. Examples of question categories and themes on which to base this classification follow:","Category: Attitudinal","Purpose of Category: Appeal to target segments with customized language, tone, message that resonates with their attitudes and beliefs.","Themes:\n\n","Themes:\n\n","Themes:\n\n","Applying an effective combination of categories and themes preferably yields typing tools which provide simple means to accurately identify, project, or verify segment affiliation. Responses to the typing tools may then guide future research and marketing efforts, as well as population group targeting, contact, and\/or intervention efforts. An effective combination of categories and themes provide such actionable determinations as, for example:\n\n","The categories and themes selected for use in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention are selected in view of the overall segmentation objectives. Again, the categories and themes identified above are but examples of the numerous other categories and\/or themes which may be adopted, based upon the specific requirements and objectives of the intended application.","The flow proceeds from block  to blocks - which implement a latent class methodology to formulate an optimal segmentation solution. Preferably, the inputs for this analytical stage include wedge variables, sources of data, and results of the statistical techniques available from preceding processes. At block , one or more latent class methodology approaches, such as those illustrated in , are invoked to obtain segmentation solution candidates. Preferably, regression, dimension, and\/or cluster-based analytical algorithms known in the art are adapted and suitably implemented to obtain a segmentation solution candidate identifying, among other things, a certain combination of wedge variables.","The latent class analysis is carried out at block  to iteratively develop a set of segmentation solution candidates. Suitable measures are taken during this process to loop the analysis through the comprehensive set of all possible variations of the wedge variables with the different latent class analysis approaches and their parametric configurations. The process at block  thus yields a collection of possible segmentation solutions collectively derived by the various latent class analytical approaches.","At block , the optimal segmentation solution is selected by processing this collection of segmentation solutions preferably using certain predefined statistical tuning parameters and selection criteria. The statistical tuning parameters are set in accordance with standard practice using existing statistical software that performs latent class modeling based upon cluster analysis and\/or factor analysis techniques. Multiple iterations of the modeling are performed to generate a variety of segmentation solutions based upon subsets of wedge variables, varying numbers of output segments, including and\/or excluding variables with collapsed scales, etc.","At this point, the candidate segmentation solutions found to be of higher priority are manually searched in light of selection criteria predefined for the given application. These selection criteria are generally qualitative in nature requiring an advisory user of sufficient skill and knowledge to bring his\/her best judgment to bear on the segmentation solution candidates. Examples of selection criteria include:\n\n","While the full set of wedge variables factor into the selection of an optimal segmentation solution, the same full set of wedge variables may not be necessary in its entirety to adequately profile a newly-considered individual using the segmentation solution, namely, its hierarchal tree. Indeed, only a subset of the identified wedge variables will typically be required to profile an individual if the processes of blocks - have been carried out properly.","At block , a typing tool preferably containing a minor subset of the original survey questions, chosen from among the wedge variables, is generated toward this end. Although the questions may be refined versions of original questions contained in the initial survey, they are closely consistent in substance with the original versions. This preserves correlation with the preceding process by which the given segmentation solution was developed. In addition, screening criteria should remain the same when the typing tool is used, so that the population under study is consistent with the population from the initial survey.","In block , the optimal segmentation solution is received as the input, and those wedge variables found to be Key Drivers to the segments of that solution are identified. As illustrated in  and described in preceding paragraphs corresponding thereto, techniques  such as discriminant function analysis , multinomial logistic regression , and classification\/regression trees and others are implemented to develop the typing tool, a shortened survey of the most determinative questions. The system is equipped with a mathematical formula or other suitable measures by which to process responses to questions of this shortened survey and properly map a respondent to the appropriate profile using the segmentation solution.","At block , the wedge variables, optimal segmentation solution, typing tool, and their attendant parameters are stored into the system's data warehouse collectively as an \u2018applied model\u2019 which may be fully accessed as such. More than one such applied model may be generated to psychographically profile individuals based on different factors (and segmentation objectives), for the same or different targeted population, using the processes illustrated by blocks -.","Turning to , there is shown an exemplary flow of processes implemented and\/or controlled in software stored in a computer readable medium for making use of an applied model developed in accordance with the processes illustrated in . At block , the optimum segmentation solution for the applied model is preferably embedded in database reference tables. At block , the database is integrated into the system, in part by building application-specific content relating to the segments of the embedded segmentation solution, whereby psychographic profiling use may be made in accordance with the segments.","At block , the typing tool developed for the given applied model, such as an abbreviated patient survey, is used to acquire profiling information from a newly-responding individual. Based on the responses to the typing tool questions, the responding individual is psychographically profiled at block . The profile is appropriately directed at block  such that therapeutic, diagnostic, advisory, or other planned actions ideally suited for the profile is duly prescribed specifically for the individual at block . The planned action(s) may be generated automatically based upon a library of prescriptive actions, or manually generated upon considered review by a skilled care giver or other professional attendant.","Referring to , there is shown a diagram schematically illustrating the flow of data and relative operational configurations of certain processes illustrated in the example of . At block , variables and their tuning parameters obtained and updated in the variable selection and classification processes - of  are passed to block  (as indicated by the forward arrow ) in order to build a segmentation candidate using the latent class analysis process . A pool of segmentation candidates is thus developed in this exemplary embodiment preferably by carrying out the variable selection and classification and subsequent latent class analysis-based segmentation building processes in each iteration, is indicated by the reverse arrow \u2032. The segmentation candidates built through this process are stored at block  as a plurality of plausible segmentation solutions from which the optimal solution is selected at block  according to process  of .","As illustrated, the selection process at block  is preferably informed by expert review of the plausible segmentation solutions in light of predetermined selection criteria\/parameters illustrated at block .

It generally comprises those components which display information to users and request control parameters from the users.","The Questionnaire subsystem  is the area of the system devoted to generation and management of variables (reference blocks -). For example, the questions that make up a questionnaire are bound by the presentation layer, as represented by the \u201cbinds\u201d connection arrow.","The Data Collection subsystem  is an area of the system devoted to the management and assemblage of data from a number of sources (Reference blocks -). The subsystem uses the variable\/questionnaire schemas defined by the Questionnaire subsystem  to determine what data should be collected. It is bound by data provided from the Presentation layer  to obtain primary data, and uses external data systems for storage and additional (secondary) input sources.","The External Data Systems subsystem  is an umbrella of data sources and systems that allow for long term storage and retrieval. A common example is a database. The subsystem is labeled \u201cexternal\u201d because pre-existing data storage software is preferably integrated, rather than having data storage and management systems specifically developed. This is but one of many such industry standard systems which may be employed.","The Processing subsystem  is devoted to much of the processing described above (Reference blocks -). The subsystem uses the Data Collection subsystem  to access data for its processing, and uses the External Statistical Packages subsystem  to perform statistical modeling. The subsystem outputs the segmentation model which refines the Data Warehouse  of all models.","The External Statistical Packages subsystem  is devoted to statistical processing of data. This subsystem is also labeled \u201cexternal\u201d because pre-existing statistical packages are integrated, rather than having statistical modeling components specifically developed.","The Data Warehouse subsystem  is devoted to the long term storage and applicability of output segmentation models.
