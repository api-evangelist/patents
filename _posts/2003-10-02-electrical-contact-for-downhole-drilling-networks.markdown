No. 10\/430,734 \u201cLoaded Transducer for Downhole Drilling Components\u201d filed on May 6, 2003 and is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/612,255 \u201cTransmission Element for Downhole Drilling Components\u201d filed on Jul. 2, 2003, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/453,076 entitled \u201cImproved Transducer for Downhole Drilling Components\u201d filed on Jun. 3, 2003. All the above applications incorporated by reference herein for all they contain.","This invention was made with government support under Contract No. DE-FC26-01NT41229 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy. The government has certain rights in the invention.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to oil and gas drilling, and more particularly to apparatus and methods for reliably transmitting information between downhole drilling components.","2. Background of the Invention","In the downhole drilling industry, MWD and LWD tools are used to take measurements and gather information concerning downhole geological formations, status of downhole tools, and other conditions located downhole. Such data is useful to drill operators, geologists, engineers, and other personnel located at the surface. This data may be used to adjust drilling parameters, such as drilling direction, penetration speed, and the like, to effectively tap into an oil or gas bearing reservoir. Data may be gathered at various points along the drill string, such as from a bottom hole assembly or from sensors distributed along the drill string.","Nevertheless, data gathering and analysis represent only certain aspects of the overall process. Once gathered, apparatus and methods are needed to rapidly and reliably transmit the data to the earth's surface. Traditionally, technologies such as mud pulse telemetry have been used to transmit data to the surface. However, most traditional methods are limited to very slow data rates and are inadequate for transmitting large quantities of data at high speeds.","In order to overcome these limitations, various efforts have been made to transmit data along electrical and other types of cable integrated directly into drill string components, such as sections of drill pipe. In such systems, electrical contacts or other transmission elements are used to transmit data across tool joints or connection points in the drill string. Nevertheless, many of these efforts have been largely abandoned or frustrated due to unreliability and complexity.","For example, drill strings may include hundreds of sections of drill pipe and other downhole tools connected in series. In order to reach the surface, data must be transmitted reliably across each tool joint. A single faulty connection may break the link between downhole sensors and the surface. Also, because of the inherent linear structure of a drill string, it is very difficult to build redundancy into the system.","The unreliability of various known contact systems is due to several factors. First, since the tool joints are typically screwed together, each of the tools rotate with respect to one another. This causes the contacts to rotate with respect to one another, causing wear, damage, and possible misalignment. In addition, as the tool joints are threaded together, mating surfaces of the downhole tools, such as the primary and secondary shoulders, come into contact. Since downhole tools are not typically manufactured with precise tolerances that may be required by electrical contacts, this may cause inconsistent contact between the contacts.","Moreover, the treatment and handling of drill string components is often harsh. For example, as sections of drill pipe or other tools are connected together, ends of the drill pipe may strike or contact other objects. Thus, delicate contacts or transmission elements located at the tool ends can be easily damaged. In addition, substances such as drilling fluids, mud, sand, dirt, rocks, lubricants, or other substances may be present at or between the tool joints. This may degrade connectivity at the tools joints. Moreover, the transmission elements may be subjected to these conditions each time downhole tools are connected and disconnected.","Thus, what are needed are reliable contacts for transmitting data across tool joints that are capable of overcoming the previously mentioned challenges.","What are further needed are reliable contacts that are resistant to wear and tear encountered in a downhole environment.","What are further needed are reliable contacts that, even when damaged, still provide reliable connectivity.","What are further needed are apparatus and method to adjust the impedance of the contacts to minimize signal reflections at the tool joints.","In view of the foregoing, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide apparatus and methods for reliably transmitting information between downhole tools in a drill string. It is a further object of the invention to provide robust electrical connections that may withstand the rigors of a downhole environment. It is yet another object of the invention to provide apparatus and methods to reduce signal reflections that may occur at the tool joints.","Consistent with the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, an electrical contact system for transmitting information across tool joints, while minimizing signal reflections that occur at the tool joints, is disclosed in one embodiment of the invention as including a first electrical contact comprised of an annular resilient material. An annular conductor is embedded within the annular resilient material and has a surface exposed from the annular resilient material.","A second electrical contact is provided that is substantially equal to the first electrical contact. Likewise, the second electrical contact has an annular resilient material and an annular conductor. The two electrical contacts configured to contact one another such that the annular conductors of each come into physical contact. The annular resilient materials of each electrical contact each have dielectric characteristics and dimensions that are adjusted to provide desired impedance to the electrical contacts.","In selected embodiments, the first and second electrical contacts further include first and second annular housings, respectively, to accommodate the annular resilient materials, and the annular conductors, respectively. In certain embodiments, the electrical contact system includes one or several biasing member to urge each of the electrical contacts together. For example, the biasing member may be a spring, an elastomeric material, an elastomeric-like material, a sponge, a sponge-like material, or the like. In other embodiments, one or both of the annular housings are sprung with respect to corresponding mating surfaces of downhole tool in which they are mounted. This may provide a biasing effect to one or both of the electrical contacts.","In selected embodiments, the first and second electrical contacts are configured such that pressure encountered in a downhole environment presses them more firmly together. In other embodiments, one or both of the electrical contacts are configured to \u201corbit\u201d with respect to a mating surface of a downhole tool. By \u201corbiting,\u201d it is meant that the electrical contacts may pivot along multiple axes to provide improved contact.","In certain embodiments, the annular resilient materials are constructed of a material selected to flow into voids that may or may not be present within the electrical contacts. In selected embodiments, the annular resilient material may be constructed of a material such as silicone, Vamac, polysulfide, Neoprene, Hypalon, butyl, Teflon, millable or cast polyurethane, rubber, fluorosilicone, epichlorohydrin, nitrile, styrene butadiene, Kalrez, fluorocarbon, Chemraz, Aflas, other polymers, and the like. To provide strength, durability, or other characteristics, modifiers such as Kevlar, fibers, graphite, or like materials, may be added to the annular resilient material.","In selected embodiments, a cable is electrically connected to one or both of the electrical contracts, and the impedance of one or both of the electrical contacts is adjusted to match the impedance of the cable. In certain embodiments, the cable is a coaxial cable. In other embodiments, multiple annular conductors may be embedded in the annular resilient material to provide multiple connections.","In another aspect of the present invention, a method for transmitting information across tool joints in a drill string, while minimizing signal reflections occurring at the tool joints, may include providing a first electrical contact comprised of an annular resilient material, and an annular conductor embedded within the first annular resilient material. The annular conductor has a surface exposed from the annular resilient material. The method may further include providing a corresponding electrical contact substantially equal to the first electrical contact. The corresponding electrical contact also includes an annular resilient material and a second annular conductor. The method further includes adjusting the dielectric characteristics, the dimensions, or both of the annular resilient materials to provide desired impedance to the electrical contacts.","In selected embodiments, the method may further include providing annular housings to the electrical contacts, respectively, to accommodate the annular resilient materials, and the annular conductors. In certain embodiments, a method in accordance with the invention includes urging the electrical contacts together. Likewise, adjusting may include adjusting the impedance to match the impedance of a cable electrically connected to at least one of the first and second electrical contracts. In certain embodiments, the cable is a coaxial cable.","It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the Figures herein, could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus, the following more detailed description of embodiments of apparatus and methods of the present invention, as represented in the Figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is merely representative of various selected embodiments of the invention.","The illustrated embodiments of the invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings, wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. Those of ordinary skill in the art will, of course, appreciate that various modifications to the apparatus and methods described herein may easily be made without departing from the essential characteristics of the invention, as described in connection with the Figures. Thus, the following description of the Figures is intended only by way of example, and simply illustrates certain selected embodiments consistent with the invention as claimed herein.","Referring to , a contact assembly  in accordance with the invention may be characterized by a substantially annular shape. This annular shape may enable the contact assembly  to be installed in the box end or pin end of a downhole tool (not shown). For example, the contact assembly  may be installed in an annular recess milled into the primary or secondary shoulder of a downhole tool (not shown).","In selected embodiments, a contact assembly  may include an annular housing  and a resilient material  located within the housing . An annular contact  may be embedded into the resilient material and may have a surface exposed from the resilient material . The resilient material  may serve to insulate the annular conductor  from the housing  as well as perform other functions described in this specification. In selected embodiments, a cable  may include a conductor connected to the annular contact . In certain embodiments, the contact assembly  may include an alignment and retention member  that may fit within a corresponding recess milled or formed into the downhole tool. The retention member  may be used to retain a desired tension in the cable .","Referring to , a cross-sectional view of the contact assembly  of  is illustrated. As is illustrated, a housing  may be used to accommodate a resilient material  and a conductor  embedded within the resilient material. In certain embodiments, the conductor  may have a substantially rectangular or elongated cross-section to provide substantial surface area between the conductor  and the resilient material  to provide sufficient adhesion therebetween. Nevertheless, the conductor  may have any of numerous cross-sectional shapes, as desired. In selected embodiments, the resilient material  may have a rounded or curved contour  such that the resilient material  and conductor  reside above the housing .","Referring to , an enlarged cross-sectional view of the contact assembly  is illustrated. As shown, the housing  may include an angled surface . The contact assembly  may sit in a recess  milled or formed in the primary or secondary shoulder  of a downhole tool . The recess  may include a corresponding angled surface . By manufacturing the housing  such that it has a radius slightly smaller than the radius of the recess , the angled surfaces ,  may exert force against one another such that the contact assembly  is urged in a direction . That is, the angled surfaces ,  may create a spring-like force urging the housing  in the direction . Likewise, when a force  is exerted on the contact assembly , the contact assembly  may be urged down into the recess . In selected embodiments, the contact assembly  may \u201corbit\u201d with respect to a mating surface . That is, due to the biasing effect of the surfaces , , the annular contact  may move with respect to the mating surface  similar to a universal joint. This may provide better and more consistent contact between contact assemblies .","As illustrated, the housing  may include a shoulder  that may engage a corresponding shoulder milled or formed into the recess . This may enable the contact assembly  to be pressed into the recess . Once inserted, the shoulder  may prevent the contact assembly  from exiting the recess . Likewise, the housing  may optionally include one or several retaining shoulder , to help retain the resilient material  within the housing .","As was previously mentioned with respect to , the conductor  may be connected to a cable . In selected embodiments, the cable  may be a coaxial cable . As is typical of most coaxial cables , or other cables  for that matter, each usually has a rated impedance. In coaxial cable , the impedance is usually a function of the diameter of the cable , the diameter of the core conductor, and the diameter and dielectric constant of a dielectric material surrounding the core conductor. In order to minimize signal reflections, it is important to match as accurately as possible the impedance of the contact assembly  to the impedance of the coaxial or other cable .","Thus, in selected embodiments, the impedance of the contact assembly  may be adjusted to match a particular coaxial cable  being used. In certain embodiments, the contact assembly  may more or less resemble coaxial cable. For example, the conductor  may be analogous to the core conduct of coaxial cable, the housing  may be analogous to the coaxial shield, and the resilient material  may be analogous to the dielectric material within the coaxial cable . By adjusting the dimensions , ,  of the resilient material , and the dielectric properties of the resilient material , the impedance of the contact assembly  may be adjusted to provide a desired impedance. Thus, signal reflections occurring at the contact assemblies  may be minimized as much as possible.","The resilient material  may be constructed of any suitable material capable of withstanding a downhole environment. For example, in certain embodiments, the resilient material  may be constructed of a material such as silicone, Vamac, polysulfide, Neoprene, Hypalon, butyl, Teflon, millable or cast polyurethane, rubber, fluorosilicone, epichlorohydrin, nitrile, styrene butadiene, Kalrez, fluorocarbon, Chemraz, Aflas, other polymers, and the like. To provide strength, durability, or other characteristics, modifiers such as Kevlar, fibers, graphite, or like materials, may be added to the annular resilient materials .","Referring to , as was previously mentioned with respect to , the annular contact  might be connected to a cable , such as a coaxial cable . As is illustrated, a conductor  may extend through the housing  and the resilient material  to connect to the annular conductor . The connection may be made by soldering, welding, or any other suitable method to produce a strong, conductive bond. As illustrated, a sheath , such as an insulator or coaxial sheathing, may protect and insulate the conductor .","Referring to , two contact assemblies , are illustrated transitioning from a separated to a connected state. In , when the contact assemblies , are separated, the resilient material , may have a rounded or protruding surface , . In selected embodiments, the resilient material , may protrude out more than the contacts , such that the surfaces , meet before the contacts , . This may provide a seal to isolate the contacts , from the surrounding environment. Since the contacts , may electrically arc when they near each other, isolating the contacts , may help prevent this arcing from igniting gases or other flammable substances that may be present in a downhole drilling environment. Nevertheless, in other embodiments, the contacts , may actually be flush with or protrude out farther than the resilient materials , ","Referring to , as the contact assemblies , near one another, the contacts , may meet. As this occurs, the resilient materials , may begin to compress into the housings , . Due to their resiliency, the resilient materials , may provide a spring like force urging the contacts , together.","Referring to , in selected embodiments, as the resilient materials , continue to compress into the housings , , they may flatten to form more planar surfaces , . Likewise, the increased compression keeps the contacts , more firmly pressed together. In selected embodiments, the resilient materials , may actually protrude or be squeezed slightly from the housings , at a point . In other embodiments, even when the contact assemblies , are fully pressed together, a gap  may still be present between the housings , . Thus, the resilient materials , may continue to exert force on the contacts , without having this energy absorbed by contact of the housings , ","In selected embodiments, three \u201cenergizing\u201d elements may contribute to keep the contacts , firmly pressed together. First, as was previously mentioned with respect to , the housings , may be spring-loaded with respect to their respective recesses , thereby urging the contact assemblies , together. Second, the resilient materials , may provide a spring-like force urging the contacts , together. Lastly, high-pressure levels  often present downhole may exert a force on the housings , , keeping the contact assemblies , firmly pressed together. Any or all of these \u201cenergizing\u201d forces may be used to provide more reliable contact between the contacts , ","Referring to , two damaged or asymmetrical contact assemblies , are illustrated transitioning from a separated to a connected state. As was previously mentioned, downhole tools may be subjected to hostile environments downhole. Moreover, this harsh treatment may also occur at the surface as tool sections are connected and disconnected. This provides ample opportunity for the contact assemblies to be damaged, worn, and the like. Since the reliability of contact assemblies is very important, their ability to withstand damage or wear is a desired attribute.","Referring to , in certain instances, damage or other events may create a void  or damaged area  in the resilient material . For example, when the pin and box end of downhole tools are threaded together, the contact assemblies , may rub against one another. Dirt, rocks, or other substances may become interposed between the surfaces of the contact assemblies . This may cause abrasion or wear that may remove a portion of the resilient material , thereby creating the void . Other conditions, such as striking the ends of drill tools, downhole pressure, and the like, may also cause damage to the contact assemblies , ","Referring to , as the contact assemblies , come together, the void may create an undesirable gap  between the resilient materials , . This may cause undesired exposure of the contacts , , possibly causing shorting, corrosion, arcing, or the like.","Referring to , nevertheless, by proper selection of resilient materials , such as those listed with respect to , the contact assemblies , may compensate for voids or damage that may be present in the resilient material . For example, when the contact assemblies , are pressed together, the resilient material from one contact assembly may flow into the void  of the other resilient material . Thus, even when damage is present, the resilient materials , may conform to one another, provide a spring-like bias to the contacts , , and seal out potential contaminants.","Referring to , in selected embodiments, the contact  may be shaped or textured to include gripping features . For example, the gripping features  may be barbs, or may simply be surface textures created by sanding or otherwise roughening the surface of the contact . Since, the resilient material  may be compressed when contacting another contact assembly , the contact  may tend to separate from the resilient material . Thus, the gripping features  may provide improved adhesion between the resilient material  and the contact . Likewise, although not illustrated, the inside of the housing  may be textured or have other surface features to provide improved adhesion between the resilient material  and the housing .","Referring to , in selected embodiments, the contact  may resemble a half cylinder or a shape similar thereto. Thus, when two contact assemblies  come together, the contact  may form a substantially cylindrical core . Thus, the contact assemblies  may more closely resemble a typical coaxial cable having a cylindrical core. This may provide improved matching with a coaxial cable, thereby reducing signal reflections.","Referring to , in other embodiments, multiple annular conductors , may be provided in a contact assembly . For example, in selected embodiments, one conductor may provide a downhole link, and a second conductor may provide an uphole link. Or in other embodiments, one conductor may be used to carry data and the other power. In other embodiments, more than two conductors  may be used to carry, data, power, or a combination thereof.","Referring to , a cross-sectional view of the contact assembly  of  is illustrated. As shown, two or more conductors , may be embedded within the resilient material  and may be separated by an appropriate distance to prevent shorting or crosstalk.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its essence or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative, and not restrictive. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims, rather than by the foregoing description.
