{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to schedulers and, more specifically, to creating and modifying graphical schedules which are associated with devices that are controlled by a programmable multimedia controller.","2. Background Information","In recent years, both commercial and home automation solutions have advanced rapidly in terms of features and capabilities while falling in price. Prior solutions that required extensive custom programming and expensive, proprietary touchpanels for user input devices have been challenged and displaced by new solutions with open application programming interfaces and inexpensive user input devices such as multi-touch smartphones and tablets.","As automation solutions have advanced and evolved, so too have the number and variety of devices that users may own and wish to integrate into an automation solution. As more devices having increasingly diverse features and functionalities become available, a problem has arisen: how to reliably instruct an automation system to perform desired functions or take certain actions at desired times. Stated another way, in the area of automation solutions, there exists a need for a simple, intuitive, easily installed and inexpensive way to create and maintain schedules for the performance of desired functions and actions by a wide variety of devices and equipment.","In brief summary, the present invention provides a graphical user interface which enables a user to create graphical schedules, as well as modify existing graphical schedules, for a wide variety of devices controlled by a programmable multimedia controller. When displayed to the user, a graphical schedule graphically depicts a relationship between time and at least one user-selected condition to be satisfied (e.g., a minimum temperature to be maintained in a home during evening hours) or at least one user-selected action to be taken (e.g., turning on a sprinkler system at noon). Depending upon the user's data input device, the user may easily create or modify a graphical schedule by graphically manipulating the time-based relationship using techniques such as taps and swipes, drag and drop, point and click, or other techniques.","In addition, a user may create and modify presets which are associated with a graphical schedule. One type of preset represents a user-selected environmental state for a predetermined physical space. For example, a user may create a preset for a family room in a home in which, at a predetermined time, certain light fixtures are turned on, a television is turned on and tuned to a particular channel, and the motorized shades are closed. Presets may be created for single rooms or multi-room zones within a structure, or for the structure as a whole, and may address one or multiple devices controlled by a programmable multimedia controller.","The graphical user interface may be presented to a user using any of a variety of devices including touch-sensitive devices, an on screen display, or a conventional video display in which user input is made through a keyboard or mouse.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["90","100"]},"Programmable multimedia controller  may be coupled to or interfaced with a variety of A\/V devices, including audio source devices , such as compact disk (CD) players, digital video disc (DVD) players, microphones, digital video recorders (DVRs), cable boxes, audio\/video receivers, personal media players, and other devices that source audio signals.
