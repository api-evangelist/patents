Compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are directed to methods useful in the treatment of: pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); idiopathic PAH; familial PAH; PAH associated with: a collagen vascular disease, a congenital heart disease, portal hypertension, HIV infection, ingestion of a drug or toxin, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, splenectomy, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) or pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis (PCH); PAH with significant venous or capillary involvement; platelet aggregation; coronary artery disease; myocardial infarction; transient ischemic attack; angina; stroke; ischemia-reperfusion injury; restenosis; atrial fibrillation; blood clot formation in an angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery individual or in an individual suffering from atrial fibrillation; atherothrombosis; asthma or a symptom thereof; a diabetic-related disorder such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy or diabetic retinopathy; glaucoma or other disease of the eye with abnormal intraocular pressure; hypertension; inflammation; psoriasis; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's disease; transplant rejection; multiple sclerosis; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); ulcerative colitis; atherosclerosis; acne; type 1 diabetes; type 2 diabetes; sepsis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).","Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a lipid molecule derived from arachidonic acid through the cyclooxygenase pathway. It is a potent vasodilator, antiproliferative, anti-thrombotic and antiplatelet agent that mediates its effects as an agonist of a G protein-coupled receptor (PGI2 receptor; e.g., human PGI2 receptor, GenBank\u00ae Accession No. NP000951 and alleles thereof). It is known that the binding of PGI2 (or other such agonist) to the PGI2 receptor leads to coupling with the Gs protein and increases intracellular cAMP levels. (See, e.g., Zhang et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys., 2006, 454:80-88.)","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by a progressive pulmonary vasculopathy leading to right ventricular hypertrophy. Right heart failure occurs if left untreated. Prostacyclin, which has vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary vasculature has been found to be low in patients with PAH compared with normal controls. Exogenous administration of prostacyclin or an analog of prostacyclin (i.e., an agonist of the PGI2 receptor) has become an important strategy in the treatment of PAH. (See, e.g., Tuder et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med., 1999, 159:1925-1932; Humbert et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 2004, 43:13 S-24S; Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs, 2006, 11:609-619; McLaughlin et al., Circulation, 2006, 114:1417-1431; Rosenkranz, Clin. Res. Cardiol., 2007, 96:527-541; Driscoll et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:65-81.)","Trepostinil and iloprost are FDA-approved analogs of prostacyclin which, like prostacyclin, are not orally-active. Beraprost is an orally-active analog of prostacyclin approved for the treatment of PAH in Japan, but it has failed registration for the treatment of PAH in Europe and in the US. Of the three FDA-approved drugs, prostacyclin is the best studied in PAH patients. The approximate annual cost of treating PAH with these drugs is $25,000 to $200,000 depending on the dose. At present, many experts consider intravenous prostacyclin to be the most reliable agent for managing the sickest PAH patients. Due to the short half-life of prostacyclin, intravenous treatment is complicated by the need for a continuous infusion. Patients are at risk for potentially fatal rebound pulmonary hypertension if the infusion is abruptly disrupted, as well as significant risk of catheter-related complications including sepsis. (See, e.g., Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs, 2006, 11:609-619; Naeije et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2007, 8:2247-2265; Strauss et al., Clin. Chest. Med., 2007, 28:127-142; Driscoll et al., Expert Opin. Pharmacother., 2008, 9:65-81.)","There is considerable interest in developing prostacyclin analogs (i.e., agonists of the PGI2 receptor) for use in the treatment of other diseases, such as atherothrombosis. Developing stable, orally-active analogs of prostacyclin (i.e., stable, orally-active agonists of the PGI2 receptor) is a rate-limiting step in achieving this goal (see, e.g., Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008 Mar. 6 Epub ahead of print), as well as in the improved management of PAH.","One aspect of the present invention encompasses certain cyclohexane derivatives selected from compounds of

Evidence for the association of PAH with HIV infection and the beneficial of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor on PAH is given by Aguilar et al. (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 2000, 162:1846-1850). Evidence for the association of PAH with congenital heart defects (including ASD, VSD and patent ductus arteriosus) and the beneficial effect of an agonist of the PGI2 receptor on PAH is given by Rosenzweig et al. (Circulation, 1999, 99:1858-1865). Evidence for the association of PAH with fenfluramine and with dexfenfluramine, anorexigens, is given by Archer et al. (Am. J. Respir. Crit.

The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of symptoms of PAH.","2. Antiplatelet Therapies (Conditions Related to Platelet Aggregation)","Antiplatelet agents (antiplatelets) are prescribed for a variety of conditions. For example, in coronary artery disease they are used to help prevent myocardial infarction or stroke in patients who are at risk of developing obstructive blood clots (e.g., coronary thrombosis).","In a myocardial infarction (\u201cMI\u201d or \u201cheart attack\u201d), the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood as a result of a blockage in the coronary blood vessels. If taken while an attack is in progress or immediately afterward (preferably within 30 min), antiplatelets can reduce the damage to the heart.","A transient ischemic attack (\u201cTIA\u201d or \u201cmini-stroke\u201d) is a brief interruption of oxygen flow to the brain due to decreased blood flow through arteries, usually due to an obstructing blood clot. Antiplatelet drugs have been found to be effective in preventing TIAs.","Angina is a temporary and often recurring chest pain, pressure or discomfort caused by inadequate oxygen-rich blood flow (ischemia) to some parts of the heart. In patients with angina, antiplatelet therapy can reduce the effects of angina and the risk of myocardial infarction.","Stroke is an event in which the brain does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood, usually due to blockage of a cerebral blood vessel by a blood clot. In high-risk patients, taking antiplatelets regularly has been found to prevent the formation of blood clots that cause first or second strokes.","Angioplasty is a catheter based technique used to open arteries obstructed by a blood clot. Whether or not stenting is performed immediately after this procedure to keep the artery open, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of forming additional blood clots following the procedure(s).","Coronary bypass surgery is a surgical procedure in which an artery or vein is taken from elsewhere in the body and grafted to a blocked coronary artery, rerouting blood around the blockage and through the newly attached vessel. After the procedure, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of secondary blood clots.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Atrial fibrillation affects about two million Americans every year. In atrial fibrillation, the atria (the heart's upper chambers) rapidly fire electrical signals that cause them to quiver rather than contract normally. The result is an abnormally fast and highly irregular heartbeat. When given after an episode of atrial fibrillation, antiplatelets can reduce the risk of blood clots forming in the heart and traveling to the brain (embolism).","There is evidence that a PGI2 receptor agonist will inhibit platelet aggregation and thus be a potential treatment as an antiplatelet therapy (see, e.g., Moncada et al., Lancet, 1977, 1:18-20). It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the PGI2 receptor in mice leads to an increased propensity towards thrombosis (Murata et al., Nature, 1997, 388:678-682).","PGI2 receptor agonists can be used to treat, for example, claudication or peripheral artery disease as well as cardiovascular complications, arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction caused by serotonin, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and restenosis of arteries following angioplasty or stent placement. (See, e.g., Fetalvero et al., Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat., 2007, 82:109-118; Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Davi et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 2007, 357:2482-2494; Fetalvero et al., Am. J. Physiol. Heart. Circ. Physiol., 2006, 290:H1337-H1346; Murata et al., Nature, 1997, 388:678-682; Wang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006, 103:14507-14512; Xiao et al., Circulation, 2001, 104:2210-2215; McCormick et al., Biochem. Soc. Trans., 2007, 35:910-911; Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008, Mar. 6 Epub ahead of print.)","PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used alone or in combination with thrombolytic therapy, for example, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), to provide cardioprotection following MI or postischemic myocardial dysfunction or protection from ischemic injury during percutaneous coronary intervention, and the like, including complications resulting therefrom. PGI2 receptor agonists can also be used in antiplatelet therapies in combination with, for example, alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), echistatin (a disintegrin) or, in states of hypercoaguability, heparin. (See, e.g., Chan., J. Nutr., 1998, 128:1593-1596; Mardla et al., Platelets, 2004, 15:319-324; Bernabei et al., Ann. Thorac. Surg., 1995, 59:149-153; Gainza et al., J. Nephrol., 2006, 19:648-655.)","The PGI2 receptor agonists disclosed herein provide beneficial improvement in microcirculation to patients in need of antiplatelet therapy by antagonizing the vasoconstrictive products of the aggregating platelets in, for example and not limited to the indications described above. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for reducing platelet aggregation in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein. In further embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, angina, stroke, atrial fibrillation, or a symptom of any of the foregoing in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein.","In further embodiments, the present invention provides methods for reducing risk of blood clot formation in an angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery patient, or a patient suffering from atrial fibrillation, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein at a time where such risk exists.","3. Atherosclerosis","Atherosclerosis is a complex disease characterized by inflammation, lipid accumulation, cell death and fibrosis. It is the leading cause of mortality in many countries, including the United States. Atherosclerosis, as the term is used herein, shall be understood to encompass disorders of large and medium-sized arteries that result in the progressive accumulation within the intima of smooth muscle cells and lipids.","It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can confer protection from atherosclerosis, such as from atherothrombosis (Arehart et al., Curr. Med. Chem., 2007, 14:2161-2169; Stitham et al., Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat., 2007, 82:95-108; Fries et al., Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program, 2005, :445-451; Egan et al., Science, 2004, 306:1954-1957; Kobayashi et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2004, 114:784-794; Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008 Mar. 6 Epub ahead of print).","It has been shown that defective PGI2 receptor signaling appears to accelerate atherothrombosis in humans, i.e. that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can confer protection from atherothrombosis in humans (Arehart et al., Circ. Res., 2008 Mar. 6 Epub ahead of print).","The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating atherosclerosis in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein. In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of atherosclerosis in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein.","4. Asthma","Asthma is a lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory airway disorder characterized by airway eosinophilia, increased mucus production by goblet cells, and structural remodeling of the airway wall. The prevalence of asthma has dramatically increased worldwide in recent decades. It has been shown that genetic deficiency of the PGI2 receptor in mice augments allergic airway inflammation (Takahashi et al., Br J Pharmacol, 2002, 137:315-322). It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can suppress not only the development of asthma when given during the sensitization phase, but also the cardinal features of experimental asthma when given during the challenge phase (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Nagao et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 2003, 29:314-320), at least in part through markedly interfering with the function of antigen-presenting dendritic cells within the airways (Idzko et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2007, 117:464-472; Thou et Immunol., 2007, 178:702-710; Jaffar et al., J. Immunol., 2007, 179:6193-6203; Jozefowski et al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2003, 3:865-878). These cells are crucial for both the initiation and the maintenance phases of allergic asthma, as depletion of airway dendritic cells during secondary challenge in sensitized mice abolished all characteristic features of asthma, an effect that could be completely restored by adoptive transfer of wild-type dendritic cells (van Rijt et al., J. Exp. Med., 2005, 201:981-991). It has also been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion by human alveolar macrophages (Raychaudhuri et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2002, 277:33344-33348). The compounds of the present invention disclosed herein are useful in the treatment of asthma, and the treatment of the symptoms thereof. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein. In further embodiments, methods are provided for treating a symptom of asthma in a patient in need of the treatment, comprising administering to the patient a composition comprising a PGI2 receptor agonist disclosed herein.","5. Diabetic-Related Pathologies","Although hyperglycemia is the major cause for the pathogenesis of diabetic complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), diabetic nephropathy (DN) and diabetic retinopathy (DR), enhanced vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation in diabetic patients has also been implicated to play a role in disease progression (Cameron et al., Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol., 2003, 367:607-614). Agonists of the PGI2 receptor promote vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation. Improving microvascular blood flow is able to benefit diabetic complications (Cameron, Diabetologia, 2001, 44:1973-1988).","It has been shown that an agonist of the PGI2 receptor can prevent and reverse motor and sensory peripheral nerve conduction abnormalities in streptozotocin-diabetic rats (Cotter et Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch.

The embodiments pertain to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Formulations may be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing the active compound(s) with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape.","Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants and disintegrants may be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations may be in the form of dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives and flavorings and colorants may be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms may be prepared by dissolving the compound of the invention in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms.","A compound of the present invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see Remington, 20Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (Editors: Gennaro et al.)","While it is possible that, for use in the prophylaxis or treatment, a compound of the invention may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however to present the compound or active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","The invention thus further provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and\/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be \u201cacceptable\u201d in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J. Guillory, \u201cGeneration of Polymorphs, Hydrates, Solvates, and Amorphous Solids,\u201d in: , ed. Harry G. Brittan, Vol. 95, Marcel Dekker, Inc.; New York, 1999, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan.","The compounds of the invention, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed.","For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or a suspension, with conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","Compounds of the present invention or a solvate, hydrate or physiologically functional derivative thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as PGI2 receptor modulators. By the term \u201cactive ingredient\u201d is defined in the context of a \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d and is intended to mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an \u201cinactive ingredient\u201d which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit.","The dose when using the compounds of the present invention can vary within wide limits and as is customary and is known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated, on the condition of the patient, on the compound employed or on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention. Representative doses of the present invention include, but not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 2500 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 1000 mg, 0.001 mg to about 500 mg, 0.001 mg to about 250 mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Multiple doses may be administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be needed, for example 2, 3 or 4 doses. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate from the patient's physician or caregiver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein.","The amount of active ingredient, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular compound employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active compounds are administered in addition to the compounds of the present invention and as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with the compounds and\/or compositions of this invention is selected in accordance with a variety factors as cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosage and dosage regimen outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, may be used in the methods of this invention.","The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example 2, 3 or 4 part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated.","The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate of a compound of the invention.","For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, the selection of a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.","In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.","In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desire shape and size. The powders and tablets may contain varying percentage amounts of the active compound. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active compound; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term \u201cpreparation\u201d is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.","For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.","The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and\/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.","Aqueous formulations suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired.","Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending agents.","Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like.","For topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch.","Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and\/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.","Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If the compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of the compounds of the present invention as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of the compounds of the present invention in water, water\/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFCs, such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.","In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed.","Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.","The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.","Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration are preferred compositions.","The compounds according to the invention may optionally exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like. Certain compounds of the present invention which contain a carboxylic acid functional group may optionally exist as pharmaceutically acceptable salts containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable metal cations and cations derived from organic bases. Representative metals include, but are not limited to, aluminium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. In some embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable metal is sodium. Representative organic bases include, but are not limited to, benzathine (N,N-dibenzylethane-1,2-diamine), chloroprocaine (2-(diethylamino)ethyl 4-(chloroamino)benzoate), choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine ((2R,3R,4R,5S)-6-(methylamino)hexane-1,2,3,4,5-pentaol), procaine (2-(diethylamino)ethyl 4-aminobenzoate), and the like. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable salts are listed in Berge, et al., 66:1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The embodiments of the present invention include every combination of one or more compounds selected from the following group and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates thereof:\n\n","The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent. The compounds of this invention may form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known to the skilled artisan.","Compounds of the present invention can be converted to \u201cpro-drugs.\u201d The term \u201cpro-drugs\u201d refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds of the invention containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In one general aspect, the \u201cpro-drug\u201d approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and in , ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition for \u201ccombination-therapy\u201d comprising admixing at least one compound according to any of the compound embodiments disclosed herein, together with at least one known pharmaceutical agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.","It is noted that when the PGI2 receptor modulators are utilized as active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition, these are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care mandate that consideration be given for the use of active agents, such as PGI2 receptor modulators, for the treatment of an PGI2-associated disease or disorder in companionship animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.) and in livestock animals (e.g., cows, chickens, fish, etc.) Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such compounds in such settings.","Hydrates and Solvates","It is understood that when the phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates\u201d is used in reference to a particular formula herein, it is intended to embrace solvates and\/or hydrates of compounds of the particular formula, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula as well as solvates and\/or hydrates of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the particular formula. It is also understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that hydrates are a subgenus of solvates.","The compounds of the present invention can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or as a solvate or hydrate thereof. Moreover, various hydrates and solvates of the compounds of the invention and their salts will find use as intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J.

Form 1 of the sodium salt of Compound 22 can be identified by its unique solid state signature with respect to, for example, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD), and other solid state methods. Further characterization with respect to water or solvent content of the crystalline form can be gauged by any of the following methods for example, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), DSC and the like. For DSC, it is known that the temperatures observed will depend upon sample purity, the rate of temperature change, as well as sample preparation technique and the particular instrument employed. Thus, the values reported herein relating to DSC thermograms can vary by plus or minus about 6\u00b0 C. The values reported herein relating to DSC thermograms can also vary by plus or minus about 20 joules per gram. For PXRD, the relative intensities of the peaks can vary, depending upon the sample preparation technique, the sample mounting procedure and the particular instrument employed. Moreover, instrument variation and other factors can often affect the 2\u03b8 values. Therefore, the peak assignments of diffraction patterns can vary by plus or minus about 0.2\u00b0 2\u03b8. For TGA, the features reported herein can vary by plus or minus about 5\u00b0 C. The TGA features reported herein can also vary by plus or minus about 2% weight change due to, for example, sample variation. Further characterization with respect to hygroscopicity of the crystalline form can be gauged by, for example, dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). The DVS features reported herein can vary by plus or minus about 5% relative humidity. The DVS features reported herein can also vary by plus or minus about 5% weight change.

In some embodiments, reactions can be carried out in the absence of solvent, such as when at least one of the reagents is a liquid or gas.","Suitable solvents can include halogenated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform, chloroform, bromochloromethane, dibromomethane, butyl chloride, dichloromethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 2-chloropropane, hexafluorobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, fluorobenzene, fluorotrichloromethane, chlorotrifluoromethane, bromotrifluoromethane, carbon tetrafluoride, dichlorofluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane, trifluoromethane, 1,2-dichlorotetrafluorethane and hexafluoroethane.","Suitable ether solvents include: dimethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxane, 1,4-dioxane, furan, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, anisole, or t-butyl methyl ether.","Suitable protic solvents can include, by way of example and without limitation, water, methanol, ethanol, 2-nitroethanol, 2-fluoroethanol, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, ethylene glycol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, i-butyl alcohol, t-butyl alcohol, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol, 1-, 2-, or 3-pentanol, neo-pentyl alcohol, t-pentyl alcohol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, phenol, or glycerol.","Suitable aprotic solvents can include, by way of example and without limitation, tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, 1,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, N-methylpyrrolidinone, formamide, N-methylacetamide, N-methylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, propionitrile, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, hexachloroacetone, acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, ethyl acetate, sulfolane, N,N-dimethylpropionamide, tetramethylurea, nitromethane, nitrobenzene, or hexamethylphosphoramide.","Suitable hydrocarbon solvents include benzene, cyclohexane, pentane, hexane, toluene, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, heptane, ethylbenzene, o, m-, or p-xylene, octane, indane, nonane, or naphthalene.","Supercritical carbon dioxide can also be used as a solvent.","The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out at appropriate temperatures which can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. Reaction temperatures will depend on, for example, the melting and boiling points of the reagents and solvent, if present; the thermodynamics of the reaction (e.g., vigorously exothermic reactions may need to be carried out at reduced temperatures); and the kinetics of the reaction (e.g., a high activation energy barrier may need elevated temperatures).","The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in air or under an inert atmosphere. Typically, reactions containing reagents or products that are substantially reactive with air can be carried out using air-sensitive synthetic techniques that are well known to one skilled in the art.","In some embodiments, preparation of compounds can involve the addition of acids or bases to effect, for example, catalysis of a desired reaction or formation of salt forms such as acid addition salts.","Example acids can be inorganic or organic acids. Inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and nitric acid. Organic acids include formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, propiolic acid, butyric acid, 2-butynoic acid, vinyl acetic acid, pentanoic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid and decanoic acid.","Example bases include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and potassium carbonate.

All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis.","The processes described herein can be stereoselective such that any given reaction starting with one or more chiral reagents enriched in one stereoisomer forms a product that is also enriched in one stereoisomer. The reaction can be conducted such that the product of the reaction substantially retains one or more chiral centers present in the starting materials. The reaction can also be conducted such that the product of the reaction contains a chiral center that is substantially inverted relative to a corresponding chiral center present in the starting materials.","Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallization (for example, diastereomeric salt resolution) using a \u201cchiral resolving acid\u201d which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as \u03b2-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of \u03b2-methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like.","Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art.","Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium.","Compounds of the invention can also include tautomeric forms, such as keto-enol tautomers. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution.","Upon carrying out preparation of compounds according to the processes described herein, the usual isolation and purification operations such as concentration, filtration, extraction, solid-phase extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like may be used, to isolate the desired products.","Example processes and certain intermediates of the present invention, are shown in Scheme I below, wherein each substituent of the compounds depicted are defined herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0815","num":"0920"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00150","num":"00150"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00150","he":"122.77mm","wi":"143.85mm","file":"US08895776-20141125-C00150.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"One aspect of the present invention pertains to processes, such as that exemplified by Scheme I (supra), that involve compounds of Formulae (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII) and (IX) or salt forms thereof, wherein:","Ris selected from C-Calkyl, aryl and heteroaryl; each optionally substituted with one or two substituents selected from: C-Calkoxy, C-Calkyl, aryl, C-Chaloalkoxy, C-Chaloalkyl and halogen; and","Ris selected from: H, C-Calkyl and aryl; wherein said aryl is optionally substituted with one or two substituents selected from: C-Calkyl and halogen;","Ris C-Calkyl;","Ris selected from: C-Calkylarylsulfonate, C-Calkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, C-Chaloalkylsulfonate and halogen;","Ris a first leaving group;","Ris a second leaving group; and","M\u2295 is a metal cation or a cation derived from an organic base.","It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment.

It is a further object of this invention to develop novel PGI2 receptor assays of which comprise such radio-labeled compounds.","The present invention embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention. Isotopically or radio-labeled compounds are those which are identical to compounds disclosed herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to H (also written as D for deuterium), H (also written as T for tritium), C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, F, S, Cl, Br, Br, Br, Br, I, I, I and I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro PGI2 receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate H, C, Br, I, I, or S will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications C, F, I, I, I, I, Br, Br or Br will generally be most useful.","It is understood that a \u201cradio-labeled\u201d or \u201clabeled compound\u201d is a compound of Formula (Ia), (Ic), (Ie), (Ig), (Ii), (Ik), (Im) or (II) that has incorporated at least one radionuclide; in some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of H, C, I, S and Br.","Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In some embodiments the radionuclide H and\/or C isotopes are useful in these studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Drawings and Examples infra, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Other synthetic methods that are useful are discussed infra. Moreover, it should be understood that all of the atoms represented in the compounds of the invention can be either the most commonly occurring isotope of such atoms or the scarcer radio-isotope or nonradioactive isotope.","Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are applicable to compounds of the invention and are well known in the art. These synthetic methods, for example, incorporating activity levels of tritium into target molecules, are as follows:","A. Catalytic Reduction with Tritium Gas: This procedure normally yields high specific activity products and requires halogenated or unsaturated precursors.","B. Reduction with Sodium Borohydride [H]: This procedure is rather inexpensive and requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters and the like.","C. Reduction with Lithium Aluminum Hydride [H]: This procedure offers products at almost theoretical specific activities. It also requires precursors containing reducible functional groups such as aldehydes, ketones, lactones, esters and the like.","D. Tritium Gas Exposure Labeling: This procedure involves exposing precursors containing exchangeable protons to tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst.","E. N-Methylation using Methyl Iodide [H]: This procedure is usually employed to prepare O-methyl or N-methyl (H) products by treating appropriate precursors with high specific activity methyl iodide (3H). This method in general allows for higher specific activity, such as for example, about 70-90 Ci\/mmol.","Synthetic methods for incorporating activity levels of I into target molecules include:","A. Sandmeyer and like reactions: This procedure transforms an aryl amine or a heteroaryl amine into a diazonium salt, such as a diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt and subsequently to I labeled compound using NaI. A represented procedure was reported by Zhu, G-D. and co-workers in 2002, 67, 943-948.","B. Ortho Iodination of phenols: This procedure allows for the incorporation of I at the ortho position of a phenol as reported by Collier, T. L. and co-workers in 1999, 42, S264-S266.","C. Aryl and heteroaryl bromide exchange with I: This method is generally a two step process. The first step is the conversion of the aryl or heteroaryl bromide to the corresponding tri-alkyltin intermediate using for example, a Pd catalyzed reaction [i.e. Pd(PhP)] or through an aryl or heteroaryl lithium, in the presence of a tri-alkyltinhalide or hexaalkylditin [e.g., (CH)SnSn(CH)]. A representative procedure was reported by Le Bas, M.-D. and co-workers in 2001, 44, S280-S282.","A radiolabeled PGI2 receptor compound of Formula (Ia) can be used in a screening assay to identify\/evaluate compounds. In general terms, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of the \u201cradio-labeled compound of Formula (Ia)\u201d to the PGI2 receptor. Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the \u201cradio-labeled compound of Formula (Ia)\u201d for the binding to the PGI2 receptor directly correlates to its binding affinity.","The labeled compounds of the present invention bind to the PGI2 receptor. In one embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 500 \u03bcM, in another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 100 \u03bcM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 10 \u03bcM, in yet another embodiment the labeled compound has an ICless than about 1 \u03bcM and in still yet another embodiment the labeled inhibitor has an ICless than about 0.1 \u03bcM.","Other uses of the disclosed receptors and methods will become apparent to those skilled in the art based upon, inter alia, a review of this disclosure.","As will be recognized, the steps of the methods of the present invention need not be performed any particular number of times or in any particular sequence.
