filed under 37 CFR \u00a71.53(b), claims the benefit under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/306,751 filed on 22 Feb. 2010, which is incorporated by reference in entirety","The invention relates generally to compounds for treating disorders mediated by lipid kinases such as inflammation, immunological, and cancer, and more specifically to compounds which inhibit PI3 kinase activity. The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Phosphatidylinositol (PI), a phospholipid found in cell membranes, plays an important role in intracellular signal transduction. Cell signaling via 3\u2032-phosphorylated phosphoinositides has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, e.g., malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity (Rameh et al (1999) J. Biol Chem, 274:8347-8350). The enzyme responsible for generating these phosphorylated signaling products, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (also referred to as PI 3-kinase or PI3K), was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3\u2032-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al (1992) Trends Cell Biol 2:358-60).","Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) are lipid kinases that phosphorylate lipids at the 3-hydroxyl residue of the inositol ring of phosphoinositols (Whitman et al (1988) Nature, 332:664). The 3\u2032-phosphorylated phospholipids (PIP3s) generated by PI3-kinases act as second messengers recruiting kinases with lipid binding domains (including plekstrin homology (PH) regions), such as Akt and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). Binding of Akt to membrane PIP3s causes the translocation of Akt to the plasma membrane, bringing Akt into contact with PDK1, which is responsible for activating Akt. The tumor-suppressor phosphatase, PTEN, dephosphorylates PIP3 and therefore acts as a negative regulator of Akt activation. The PI3-kinases Akt and PDK1 are important in the regulation of many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation, proliferation, survival, apoptosis and motility and are significant components of the molecular mechanisms of diseases such as cancer, diabetes and immune inflammation (Vivanco et al (2002) Nature Rev. Cancer 2:489; Phillips et al (1998) Cancer 83:41). PI3K inhibition is a promising mechanism for targeted therapies for cancer treatment (Maira et al (2009) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 37:265-272).","PI3 kinase is a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p110 subunits (Otsu et al (1991) Cell 65:91-104; Hiles et al (1992) Cell 70:419-29). Four distinct Class I PI3Ks have been identified, designated PI3K \u03b1 (alpha), \u03b2 (beta), \u03b4 (delta), and \u03b3 (gamma), each consisting of a distinct 110 kDa catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. More specifically, three of the catalytic subunits, i.e., p110 alpha, p110 beta and p110 delta, each interact with the same regulatory subunit, p85; whereas p110 gamma interacts with a distinct regulatory subunit, p101. The patterns of expression of each of these PI3Ks in human cells and tissues are also distinct.","The p110 delta isoform has been implicated in biological functions related to immune-inflammatory diseases, including signaling from the B-cell receptor, T cell receptor, FcR signaling of mast cells and monocyte\/macrophage, and osteoclast function\/RANKL signaling (Deane J and Fruman D A (2004) Annu Rev. Immunol. 2004. 22:563-98; Janas et al., The Journal of Immunology, 2008, 180: 739-746; Marone R et al., Biochim. Biophy. Acta 2007, 1784:159-185). Deletion of the PI3K delta gene or selective introduction of a catalytically inactive mutant of PI3K delta causes a nearly complete ablation of B cell proliferation and signaling, and impairment of signaling through T cells as well.","The invention relates to pyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidine Formula I compounds with PI3 kinase inhibitory activity and selective binding to the p110 delta isoform relative to binding to the p110 alpha isoform.","Formula I compounds have the structures:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"38.52mm","wi":"60.20mm","file":"US08440651-20130514-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \u201cTreatment\u201d can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.","The phrase \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and\/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can be measured, for example, by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","\u201cInflammatory disorder\u201d as used herein can refer to any disease, disorder, or syndrome in which an excessive or unregulated inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue damage, or loss of tissue function. \u201cInflammatory disorder\u201d also refers to a pathological state mediated by influx of leukocytes and\/or neutrophil chemotaxis.","\u201cInflammation\u201d as used herein refers to a localized, protective response elicited by injury or destruction of tissues, which serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off (sequester) both the injurious agent and the injured tissue. Inflammation is notably associated with influx of leukocytes and\/or neutrophil chemotaxis. Inflammation can result from infection with pathogenic organisms and viruses and from noninfectious means such as trauma or reperfusion following myocardial infarction or stroke, immune response to foreign antigen, and autoimmune responses. Accordingly, inflammatory disorders amenable to treatment with Formula I compounds encompass disorders associated with reactions of the specific defense system as well as with reactions of the nonspecific defense system.","\u201cSpecific defense system\u201d refers to the component of the immune system that reacts to the presence of specific antigens. Examples of inflammation resulting from a response of the specific defense system include the classical response to foreign antigens, autoimmune diseases, and delayed type hypersensitivity response mediated by T-cells. Chronic inflammatory diseases, the rejection of solid transplanted tissue and organs, e.g., kidney and bone marrow transplants, and graft versus host disease (GVHD), are further examples of inflammatory reactions of the specific defense system.","The term \u201cnonspecific defense system\u201d as used herein refers to inflammatory disorders that are mediated by leukocytes that are incapable of immunological memory (e.g., granulocytes, and macrophages). Examples of inflammation that result, at least in part, from a reaction of the nonspecific defense system include inflammation associated with conditions such as adult (acute) respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ injury syndromes; reperfusion injury; acute glomerulonephritis; reactive arthritis; dermatoses with acute inflammatory components; acute purulent meningitis or other central nervous system inflammatory disorders such as stroke; thermal injury; inflammatory bowel disease; granulocyte transfusion associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.","\u201cAutoimmune disease\u201d as used herein refers to any group of disorders in which tissue injury is associated with humoral or cell-mediated responses to the body's own constituents.","\u201cAllergic disease\u201d as used herein refers to any symptoms, tissue damage, or loss of tissue function resulting from allergy. \u201cArthritic disease\u201d as used herein refers to any disease that is characterized by inflammatory lesions of the joints attributable to a variety of etiologies. \u201cDermatitis\u201d as used herein refers to any of a large family of diseases of the skin that are characterized by inflammation of the skin attributable to a variety of etiologies. \u201cTransplant rejection\u201d as used herein refers to any immune reaction directed against grafted tissue, such as organs or cells (e.g., bone marrow), characterized by a loss of function of the grafted and surrounding tissues, pain, swelling, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. The therapeutic methods of the present invention include methods for the treatment of disorders associated with inflammatory cell activation.","\u201cInflammatory cell activation\u201d refers to the induction by a stimulus (including, but not limited to, cytokines, antigens or auto-antibodies) of a proliferative cellular response, the production of soluble mediators (including but not limited to cytokines, oxygen radicals, enzymes, prostanoids, or vasoactive amines), or cell surface expression of new or increased numbers of mediators (including, but not limited to, major histocompatibility antigens or cell adhesion molecules) in inflammatory cells (including but not limited to monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, granulocytes (i.e., polymorphonuclear leukocytes such as neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils), mast cells, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, and endothelial cells). It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the activation of one or a combination of these phenotypes in these cells can contribute to the initiation, perpetuation, or exacerbation of an inflammatory disorder.","The term \u201cNSAID\u201d is an acronym for \u201cnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\u201d and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic, antipyretic (lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness) and, in higher doses, with anti-inflammatory effects (reducing inflammation). The term \u201cnon-steroidal\u201d is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (among a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. As analgesics, NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non-narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, acute gout, dysmenorrhoea, metastatic bone pain, headache and migraine, postoperative pain, mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury, pyrexia, ileus, and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib.","The terms \u201ccancer\u201d refers to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of the invention, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.","The term \u201cchiral\u201d refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term \u201cachiral\u201d refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.","The term \u201cstereoisomers\u201d refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.","\u201cDiastereomer\u201d refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate \u201cmesylate\u201d, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1\u2032-methylene-bis(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, methanesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include, but are not limited to, organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable\u201d indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and\/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and\/or the mammal being treated therewith.","A \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound of the invention. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethylacetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine.","The terms \u201ccompound of this invention,\u201d and \u201ccompounds of the present invention\u201d and \u201ccompounds of Formula I\u201d include compounds of Formulas I and stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, solvates, metabolites, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.","Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. If at least one asymmetrical carbon atom is present in a compound of the formula I, such a compound may exist in optically active form or in the form of a mixture of optical isomers, e.g. in the form of a racemic mixture. All optical isomers and their mixtures, including the racemic mixtures, are part of the present invention. Thus, any given formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e. cis and trans isomers), tautomers, or atropisomers.","Any formula given herein is also intended to represent hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof.","Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2H (deuterium), 3H (tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 31P, 32P, .sup.18F 35S, 36Cl, 125I respectively. Various isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H, 13C, and 14C are incorporated. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies, reaction kinetic studies, detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent in the compound of the formula (I). The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term \u201cisotopic enrichment factor\u201d as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as \u201cH\u201d or \u201chydrogen\u201d, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Accordingly, in the compounds of this invention any atom specifically designated as a deuterium (D) is meant to represent deuterium, for example in the ranges given above.","Pyrido[3,2-d]Pyrimidine

exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention.","In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a Formula I compound incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures thereof, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers are also within the scope of the present invention.","In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined.","The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms.","The compounds of the present invention may also exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons.","The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, O, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (e.g., those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","Biological Evaluation","The relative efficacies of Formula I compounds as inhibitors of an enzyme activity (or other biological activity) can be established by determining the concentrations at which each compound inhibits the activity to a predefined extent and then comparing the results. Typically, the preferred determination is the concentration that inhibits 50% of the activity in a biochemical assay, i.e., the 50% inhibitory concentration or \u201cIC\u201d. Determination of ICvalues can be accomplished using conventional techniques known in the art. In general, an ICcan be determined by measuring the activity of a given enzyme in the presence of a range of concentrations of the inhibitor under study. The experimentally obtained values of enzyme activity then are plotted against the inhibitor concentrations used. The concentration of the inhibitor that shows 50% enzyme activity (as compared to the activity in the absence of any inhibitor) is taken as the ICvalue. Analogously, other inhibitory concentrations can be defined through appropriate determinations of activity. For example, in some settings it can be desirable to establish a 90% inhibitory concentration, i.e., IC, etc.","Accordingly, a \u201cselective PI3K delta inhibitor\u201d can be understood to refer to a compound that exhibits a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC) with respect to PI3K delta that is at least at least 10-fold lower than the IC50 value with respect to any or all of the other Class I PI3K family members.","Determination of the activity of PI3 kinase activity of Formula I compounds is possible by a number of direct and indirect detection methods. Certain exemplary compounds described herein were assayed for their ability to inhibit PI3K alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isoforms (Example 901). The range of IC50 values for inhibition of PI3K delta was less than 1 nM (nanomolar) to about 10 \u03bcM (micromolar). Certain exemplary compounds of the invention had PI3K delta inhibitory ICvalues less than 10 nM. The compounds are selective for the p110\u03b4 (delta) isoform, which is a class Ia PI3 kinase, over other class Ia PI3 kinases, and are thus selective for the p110\u03b4 isoform over both the p110\u03b1 (alpha) isoform and the p110\u03b2 (beta) isoform. In particular, they are selective for p110\u03b4 (delta) over p110\u03b1 (alpha). The compounds are also selective for the p110\u03b4 isoform over p110\u03b3 (gamma), which is a class Ib kinase. The selectivity exhibited by certain Formula I compounds of the invention for p110\u03b4 (delta) over the p110\u03b1 (alpha) isoform of PI3 kinase is at least 10 fold, as exemplified by the ratios of biochemical ICvalues (Example 901).","Certain Formula I compounds may have antiproliferative activity to treat hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer. The Formula I compounds may inhibit tumor growth in mammals and may be useful for treating human cancer patients. Formula I compounds may be tested for in vitro cell proliferation activity and in vivo tumor growth inhibition according to the methods in WO 2006\/046031; US 2008\/0039459; US 2008\/0076768; US 2008\/0076758; WO 2008\/070740; WO 2008\/073785, which are incorporated by reference herein.","Evaluation of drug-induced immunosuppression by the compounds of the invention may be performed using in vivo functional tests, such as rodent models of induced arthritis and therapeutic or prophylactic treatment to assess disease score, T cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Other in vivo systems including murine models of host defense against infections or tumor resistance (Burleson G R, Dean J H, and Munson A E. , Vol. 1. Wiley-Liss, New York, 1995) may be considered to elucidate the nature or mechanisms of observed immunosuppression. The in vivo test systems can be complemented by well-established in vitro or ex vivo functional assays for the assessment of immune competence. These assays may comprise B or T cell proliferation in response to mitogens or specific antigens, measurement of signaling through the PI3K pathway in B or T cells or immortalized B or T cell lines, measurement of cell surface markers in response to B or T cell signaling, natural killer (NK) cell activity, mast cell activity, mast cell degranulation, macrophage phagocytosis or kill activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst and\/or chemotaxis. In each of these tests determination of cytokine production by particular effector cells (e.g., lymphocytes, NK, monocytes\/macrophages, neutrophils) may be included. The in vitro and ex vivo assays can be applied in both preclinical and clinical testing using lymphoid tissues and\/or peripheral blood (House R V. \u201cTheory and practice of cytokine assessment in immunotoxicology\u201d (1999) Methods 19:17-27; Hubbard A K. \u201cEffects of xenobiotics on macrophage function: evaluation in vitro\u201d (1999) Methods; 19:8-16; Lebrec H, et al (2001) Toxicology 158:25-29).","Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) 6-week detailed study using an autoimmune mechanism to mimic human arthritis; rat and mouse models (Example 902). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is one of the most commonly used animal models of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Joint inflammation, which develops in animals with CIA, strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with RA. Blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an efficacious treatment of CIA, just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T-cells and antibodies (B-cells). Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development, CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). It is most commonly induced in the DBA\/1 mouse strain, but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats.","There is good evidence that B-cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and\/or inflammatory disease. Protein-based therapeutics that deplete B cells such as Rituxan are effective against autoantibody-driven inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Rastetter et al. (2004) Annu Rev Med 55:477). CD69 is the early activation marker in leukocytes including T cells, thymocytes, B cells, NK cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils. The CD69 human whole blood assay (Example 903) determines the ability of compounds to inhibit the production of CD69 by B lymphocytes in human whole blood activated by crosslinking surface IgM with goat F(ab\u2032)2 anti-human IgM.","The T-cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) is a predictive assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM-Plaque Forming Cell (PFC) assay, using Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) as the antigen, is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test, TDAR has proven to be a highly predictable assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) database (M. I. Luster et al (1992) Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18:200-210). The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments: (1) antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells; (2) T-helper cells, which are critical players in the genesis of the response, as well as in isotype switching; and (3) B-cells, which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically-induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR (M. P. Holsapple In: G. R. Burleson, J. H. Dean and A. E. Munson, Editors, , Volume 1, Wiley-Liss Publishers, New York, N.Y. (1995), pp. 71-108). Usually, this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody (R. J. Smialowizc et al (2001) Toxicol. Sci. 61:164-175) or as a plaque (or antibody) forming cell assay (L. Guo et al (2002) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181:219-227) to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells (e.g. sheep erythrocytes) or soluble protein antigens (T. Miller et al (1998) Toxicol. Sci. 42:129-135).","Exemplary Formula I compounds No. 101-201 in Tables 1 and 2 were made, characterized, and tested for inhibition of PI3K delta and selectivity according to the methods of this

administered by a route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below.","A dose to treat human patients may range from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of Formula I compound. A typical dose may be about 100 mg to about 300 mg of the compound. A dose may be administered once a day (QID), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy.","Methods of Treatment with Formula I Compounds","Formula I compounds of the present invention are useful for treating a human or animal patient suffering from a disease or disorder arising from function or behavior associated with PI3 kinase, in particular with the p110\u03b4 (delta) isoform of PI3 kinase such as an immune disorder, cardiovascular disease, viral infection, inflammation, a metabolism\/endocrine disorder or a neurological disorder, may thus be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a compound of the present invention as defined above. A human or animal patient suffering from abnormal cell growth or cellular proliferative diseases such as tumor and\/or cancerous cell growth mediated by PI3K may also be treated by a method comprising the administration thereto of a Formula I compound. The condition of the patient may thereby be improved or ameliorated. In particular, the compounds are useful in the treatment of human or animal (e.g., murine) cancers, including, for example, breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, genitourinary tract, esophagus, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, stomach, skin, keratoacanthoma, lung, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, colon, adenoma, pancreas, adenocarcinoma, thyroid, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminoma, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, pancreatic, myeloid disorders, lymphoma, hairy cells, buccal cavity, naso-pharyngeal, pharynx, lip, tongue, mouth, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's, leukemia, bronchus, thyroid, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, hepatocellular, gastric, glioma\/glioblastoma, endometrial, melanoma, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, uterine corpus, uterine cervix, multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, myeloid leukemia, oral cavity and pharynx, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, and villous colon adenoma.","Formula I compounds may be useful for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, organisms, or associated pathological conditions, such as systemic and local inflammation, immune-inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune suppression, organ transplant rejection, allergies, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, dermatitis, asthma, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome, multiple sclerosis, scleroderma\/systemic sclerosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) vasculitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), psoriasis, and for general joint protective effects.","Methods of the invention also include treating such diseases as arthritic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, monoarticular arthritis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, spondylitis; Behcet disease; sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram negative sepsis, gram positive sepsis, and toxic shock syndrome; multiple organ injury syndrome secondary to septicemia, trauma, or hemorrhage; ophthalmic disorders such as allergic conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, uveitis, and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy; eosinophilic granuloma; pulmonary or respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, ARDS, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, pleurisy, alveolitis, vasculitis, emphysema, pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary oxygen toxicity; reperfusion injury of the myocardium, brain, or extremities; fibrosis such as cystic fibrosis; keloid formation or scar tissue formation; atherosclerosis; autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, some forms of diabetes, and Reynaud's syndrome; and transplant rejection disorders such as GVHD and allograft rejection; chronic glomerulonephritis; inflammatory bowel diseases such as chronic inflammatory bowel disease (CIBD), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and necrotizing enterocolitis; inflammatory dermatoses such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or urticaria; fever and myalgias due to infection; central or peripheral nervous system inflammatory disorders such as meningitis, encephalitis, and brain or spinal cord injury due to minor trauma; Sjogren's syndrome; diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; alcoholic hepatitis; bacterial pneumonia; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases; hypovolemic shock; Type I diabetes mellitus; acute and delayed hypersensitivity; disease states due to leukocyte dyscrasia and metastasis; thermal injury; granulocyte transfusion-associated syndromes; and cytokine-induced toxicity.","The methods of the invention can have utility in treating subjects who are or can be subject to reperfusion injury, i.e., injury resulting from situations in which a tissue or organ experiences a period of ischemia followed by reperfusion. The term \u201cischemia\u201d refers to localized tissue anemia due to obstruction of the inflow of arterial blood. Transient ischemia followed by reperfusion characteristically results in neutrophil activation and transmigration through the endothelium of the blood vessels in the affected area. Accumulation of activated neutrophils in turn results in generation of reactive oxygen metabolites, which damage components of the involved tissue or organ. This phenomenon of \u201creperfusion injury\u201d is commonly associated with conditions such as vascular stroke (including global and focal ischemia), hemorrhagic shock, myocardial ischemia or infarction, organ transplantation, and cerebral vasospasm. To illustrate, reperfusion injury occurs at the termination of cardiac bypass procedures or during cardiac arrest when the heart, once prevented from receiving blood, begins to reperfuse. It is expected that inhibition of PI3K delta activity may result in reduced amounts of reperfusion injury in such situations.","Methods of the invention also include treating cancer in a mammal comprised of administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I compound wherein the cancer is breast, ovary, cervix, prostate, testis, genitourinary tract, esophagus, larynx, glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, stomach, skin, keratoacanthoma, lung, epidermoid carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, bone, colon, adenoma, pancreas, adenocarcinoma, thyroid, follicular carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, seminoma, melanoma, sarcoma, bladder carcinoma, liver carcinoma and biliary passages, kidney carcinoma, pancreatic, myeloid disorders, lymphoma, hairy cells, buccal cavity, naso-pharyngeal, pharynx, lip, tongue, mouth, small intestine, colon-rectum, large intestine, rectum, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin's or leukemia.","Formula I compounds may be useful for treating conditions of the brain and central nervous system which require transport across the blood-brain barrier. Certain Formula I compounds have favorable penetrant properties across the blood-brain barrier for delivery to the brain. Disorders of the brain which may be effectively treated with Formula I compounds include metastatic and primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma and melanoma.","Pharmaceutical Formulations","In order to use a Formula I compound for the therapeutic treatment (including prophylactic treatment) of mammals including humans, it is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. According to this aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of this invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier.","A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and\/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG 400, PEG 300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).","The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug administration and bioavailability of the drug substance. For delivery via inhalation the compound can be formulated as liquid solution, suspensions, aerosol propellants or dry powder and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration. There are several types of pharmaceutical inhalation devices-nebulizer inhalers, metered dose inhalers (MDI) and dry powder inhalers (DPI). Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the therapeutic agents (which are formulated in a liquid form) to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. MDI's typically are formulation packaged with a compressed gas. Upon actuation, the device discharges a measured amount of therapeutic agent by compressed gas, thus affording a reliable method of administering a set amount of agent. DPI dispenses therapeutic agents in the form of a free flowing powder that can be dispersed in the patient's inspiratory air-stream during breathing by the device. In order to achieve a free flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is formulated with an excipient such as lactose. A measured amount of the therapeutic agent is stored in a capsule form and is dispensed with each actuation.","Formulations include where the particle size of a Formula I compound is between 10-1000 nm, or between 10-400 nm. Such pharmaceutical formulations may be useful for a Formula I compound with poor bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the surface area by decreasing particle size (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,107,288, 5,145,684) to the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm where the Formula I compound is supported on a cross linked matrix of macromolecules.","The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to enable patient compliance with the prescribed regimen.","The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.","Pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared for various routes and types of administration. For example, a compound of Formula I having the desired degree of purity may optionally be mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients or stabilizers (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (1980) 16edition, Osol, A. Ed.), in the form of a lyophilized formulation, milled powder, or an aqueous solution. Formulation may be conducted by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed. The pH of the formulation depends mainly on the particular use and the concentration of compound, but may range from about 3 to about 8. Formulation in an acetate buffer at pH 5 is a suitable embodiment.","The compound ordinarily can be stored as a solid composition, a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution.","The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be formulated, dosed and administered in a fashion, i.e., amounts, concentrations, schedules, course, vehicles and route of administration, consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat the hyperproliferative disorder.","As a general proposition, the initial pharmaceutically effective amount of the inhibitor administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg\/kg, namely about 0.1 to 20 mg\/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg\/kg\/day.","Acceptable diluents, carriers, excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and\/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN\u2122, PLURONICS\u2122 or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsules, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 16edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).","Sustained-release preparations of compounds of Formula I may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinyl alcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT\u2122 (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate) and poly-D-(\u2212)-3-hydroxybutyric acid.","The formulations include those suitable for the administration routes detailed herein. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.","Formulations of a compound of Formula I suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as pills, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of Formula I. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therefrom. Tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared for oral use. Formulations of compounds of Formula I intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.","For treatment of the eye or other external tissues, e.g., mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include a polyhydric alcohol, i.e., an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulfoxide and related analogs. The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner, including a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil, or with both a fat and an oil. A hydrophilic emulsifier included together with a lipophilic emulsifier acts as a stabilizer. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween\u00ae 60, Span\u00ae 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","Aqueous suspensions of Formula I compounds contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose, povidone, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate). The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.","The pharmaceutical compositions of compounds of Formula I may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.","The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a time-release formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total compositions (weight:weight). The pharmaceutical composition can be prepared to provide easily measurable amounts for administration. For example, an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 \u03bcg of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL\/hr (hour) can occur.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5 to 20% w\/w, for example about 0.5 to 10% w\/w, for example about 1.5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis disorders as described below.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.","The formulations may be packaged in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water, for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally, orally or by any other desired route.","Combination Therapy","The compounds of Formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as inflammation or a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second therapeutic compound that has anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating an inflammation, immune-response disorder, or hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second therapeutic agent may be an NSAID anti-inflammatory agent. The second therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen preferably has complementary activities to the compound of Formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, in combination with a therapeutic agent such as an NSAID.","Combination refers to either a fixed combination in one dosage unit form, or a kit of parts for the combined administration where a compound of Formula I and a second therapeutic agent may be administered independently at the same time or separately within time intervals, especially where these time intervals allow that the combination partners show a cooperative, e.g. synergistic effect. The combination therapy methods and compositions of the invention are meant to encompass administration of the selected combination to a single subject in need thereof (e.g. a patient), and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are not necessarily administered by the same route of administration or at the same time. The term \u201cpharmaceutical combination\u201d means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term \u201cfixed combination\u201d means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a second therapeutic combination partner, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term \u201cnon-fixed combination\u201d means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula I and a second therapeutic combination partner, are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the two compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of three or more active ingredients.","The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein preferably there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.","Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other therapeutic agents or treatments.","The combination therapy may provide \u201csynergy\u201d and prove \u201csynergistic\u201d, i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes, separate pills or capsules, or separate infusions. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.","In a particular embodiment of therapy, a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, may be combined with other therapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, solvate, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula I and the other pharmaceutically active chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.","Metabolites of Compounds of Formula I","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of Formula I described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of compounds of Formula I, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","Metabolite products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabelled (e.g., C or H) isotope of a compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g., greater than about 0.5 mg\/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g., by MS, LC\/MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The metabolite products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention.","Articles of Manufacture","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing materials useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a compound of Formula I. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert, on or associated with the container. The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of Formula I or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a compound of Formula I. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In addition, the label or package insert may indicate that the patient to be treated is one having a disorder such as a hyperproliferative disorder, neurodegeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, pain, migraine or a neurotraumatic disease or event. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a compound of Formula I can be used to treat a disorder resulting from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of Formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a second pharmaceutical formulation, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof.","In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a compound of Formula I, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a \u201cblister pack\u201d. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.","According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of Formula I contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution.

Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.","Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial \u2018split and mix\u2019 approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.","General Procedures and Examples provide exemplary methods for preparing Formula I compounds. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the Formula I compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted and discussed in the Schemes, General Procedures, and Examples, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and\/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the exemplary compounds prepared by the described methods can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art.","In preparing compounds of Formulas I, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991.","Methods of Separation","In the methods of preparing Formula I compounds, it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and\/or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and\/or purified to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction, crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture, distillation, sublimation, or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including, for example: reverse-phase and normal phase; size exclusion; ion exchange; high, medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus; small scale analytical; simulated moving bed (SMB) and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography, as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography.","Another class of separation methods involves treatment of a mixture with a reagent selected to bind to or render otherwise separable a desired product, unreacted starting material, reaction by product, or the like. Such reagents include adsorbents or absorbents such as activated carbon, molecular sieves, ion exchange media, or the like. Alternatively, the reagents can be acids in the case of a basic material, bases in the case of an acidic material, binding reagents such as antibodies, binding proteins, selective chelators such as crown ethers, liquid\/liquid ion extraction reagents (LIX), or the like. Selection of appropriate methods of separation depends on the nature of the materials involved, such as, boiling point and molecular weight in distillation and sublimation, presence or absence of polar functional groups in chromatography, stability of materials in acidic and basic media in multiphase extraction, and the like.","Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and\/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.","A single stereoisomer, e.g., an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds,\u201d John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: \u201cDrug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology,\u201d Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993).","Under method (1), diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, \u03b1-methyl-\u03b2-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts.","Alternatively, by method (2), the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (E. and Wilen, S. \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g., (\u2212) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, \u03b1-methoxy-\u03b1-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob III. J. Org. Chem. (1982) 47:4165), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the H NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96\/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (\u201cChiral Liquid Chromatography\u201d (1989) W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York; Okamoto, J. Chromatogr., (1990) 513:375-378). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism.","General Preparative Procedures","General Procedure A Suzuki Coupling",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0236","num":"0234"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00132","num":"00132"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00132","he":"69.60mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US08440651-20130514-C00132.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"To a microwave reaction tube is charged a 4-(2-chloropyrido[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)morpholine compound (1 mmol), a C-Caryl, C-Cheterocyclyl or C-Cheteroaryl boronic ester (1.3 mmol), a 2M solution of sodium carbonate in water (3 mmol), bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride (0.05 mmol) and acetonitrile (200 mmol).
