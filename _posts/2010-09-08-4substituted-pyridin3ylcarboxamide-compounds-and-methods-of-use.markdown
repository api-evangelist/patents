under 35 USC \u00a7119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/240,474 filed on 8 Sep. 2009, which is incorporated by reference in entirety","The invention relates to 4-substituted N-(pyridin-3-yl) carboxamides of formula (I) which are useful as kinase inhibitors, more specifically useful as Pim kinase (Pim-1, Pim-2, and\/or Pim-3) inhibitors, thus useful as cancer therapeutics. The invention also relates to compositions, more specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same, either alone or in combination, to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative disorders, as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells, or associated pathological conditions.","Pim kinases are family of three highly-related serine and threonine protein kinases encoded by the genes Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3. The gene names are derived from seminal experiments by Anton Berns et al., seeking oncogenes causing lymphoma, and the names are derived from the phrase Proviral Insertion, Moloney, as they were discovered as frequent integration sites for murine moloney virus wherein the insertions lead to overexpression of Pim's and either de novo T-cell lymphomas, or dramatic acceleration of tumorigenesis in a transgenic Myc-driven lymphoma model, revealing not only a strong synergy with the oncogene c-Myc, but also a functional redundancy among Pim kinase family members and suggesting that inhibition of the Pim's may have therapeutic benefit. (Cuypers et al (1984) Cell vol. 37 (1) pp. 141-50; Selten et al (1985) EMBO J vol. 4 (7) pp. 1793-8; van der Lugt et al (1995) EMBO J vol. 14 (11) pp. 2536-44; Mikkers et al (2002) Nature Genetics vol. 32 (1) pp. 153-9; van Lohuizen et al (1991) Cell vol. 65 (5) pp. 737-52).","Mouse genetics suggest that antagonizing Pim kinases should have an acceptable safety profile; a Pim 1\u2212\/\u2212; Pim-2\u2212\/\u2212, Pim-3\u2212\/\u2212 mouse knockout is viable although slightly smaller than wild type littermates (Mikkers et al (2004) Mol Cell Biol vol. 24 (13) pp. 6104-154). The three genes give rise to six protein isoforms that are little more than a protein kinase domain. In particular, they are without recognizable regulatory domains. All six isoforms are constitutively active protein kinases that do not require post-translational modification for activity, thus Pim kinases are regulated primarily at the transcriptional level (Qian et al (2005) J Biol Chem vol. 280 (7) pp. 6130-7). Pim kinase expression is highly inducible by cytokines and growth factors receptors and Pim's are direct transcriptional targets of the Stat proteins, including Stat3 and Stat5. Pim-1, for example, is required for the gp130-mediated Stat3 proliferation signal (Aksoy et al (2007) Stem Cells vol. 25 (12) pp. 2996-3004; Hirano et al (2000) Oncogene vol. 19 (21) pp. 2548-56; Shirogane et al (1999) Immunity vol. 11 (6) pp. 709-19).","Pim kinases have been shown to function in cellular proliferation and survival pathways parallel to the PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR signaling axis (Hammerman et al (2005) Blood vol. 105 (11) pp. 4477-83). Indeed, several of the phosphorylation targets of the PI3k axis including Bad and eIF4E-BP1 are cell growth and apoptosis regulators and are also phosphorylation targets of the Pim kinases (Fox et al (2003) Genes Dev vol. 17 (15) pp. 1841-54; Macdonald et al (2006) Cell Biol vol. 7 pp. 1). Pim-1 kinase promotes inactivation of the pro-apoptotic Bad protein by phosphorylating it on the Ser112 gatekeeper site, suggesting a role for the Pim kinase in cell survival since phosphorylation of Bad increases Bcl-2 activity and therefore promotes cell survival (Aho et al BMC FEBS Letters (2004) vol. 571 (1-3) pp. 43-9; Tamburini et al (2009) Blood vol. 114 (8) pp. 1618-27). Likewise, phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP1 by mTOR or Pim kinases causes depression of eIF4E, promoting mRNA translation and cellular growth. In addition, Pim-1 has been recognized to promote cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of CDC25A, p21, and Cdc25C (Mochizuki et al (1999) J Biol Chem vol. 274 (26) pp. 18659-66; Bachmann et al (2006) Int J Biochem Cell Biol vol. 38 (3) pp. 430-43; Wang et al (2002) Biochim Biophys Acta vol. 1593 (1) pp. 45-55).","Pim kinases have been implicated in multiple human oncology indications. Pim kinases show strong synergy in transgenic mouse models with c-Myc-driven and Akt-driven tumors (Verbeek et al (1991) Mol Cell Biol vol. 11 (2) pp. 1176-9; Allen et al (1997) Oncogene vol. 15 (10) pp. 1133-41; Hammerman et al (2005) Blood vol. 105 (11) pp. 4477-83). Pim Kinases are required for the transforming activity of oncogenes identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) including Flt3-ITD, BCR-ab1, and Tel-Jak2. Expression of these oncogenes in BaF3 cells results in strong upregulation of Pim-1 and Pim-2 expression, resulting in IL-3 independent growth, and subsequent pim inhibition results in apoptosis and cell growth arrest (Adam et al (2006) Cancer Research vol. 66 (7) pp. 3828-35). Pim overexpression and dysregulation has also been noted as a frequent event in many hematopoetic cancers, including leukemias and lymphoma (Amson et al (1989) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA vol. 86 (22) pp. 8857-61); Cohen et al (2004) Leuk Lymphoma vol. 45 (5) pp. 951-5; H\u00fcttmann et al (2006) Leukemia vol. 20 (10) pp. 1774-82), as well as multiple myeloma (Claudio et al (2002) Blood vol. 100 (6) pp. 2175-86).","In prostate cancer, Pim-1 has been shown to be overexpressed and correlated to disease progression (Cibull et al (2006) J Clin Pathol vol. 59 (3) pp. 285-8; Dhanasekaran et al (2001) Nature vol. 412 (6849) pp. 822-6). Pim 1 expression increases with disease progression in mouse models of prostate cancer progression (Kim et al (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA vol. 99 (5) pp. 2884-9). Pim-1 has been reported to be the most highly overexpressed mRNA in the subset of human prostate tumor samples which have a c-Myc-driven gene signature (Ellwood-Yen et al (2003) Cancer Cell vol. 4 (3) pp. 223-38). Pim-3 has been also been shown to be overexpressed and to have a functional role in pancreatic cancer and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Li et al. (2006) Cancer Research vol. 66 (13) pp. 6741-7; Fujii et al (2005) Int J Cancer vol. 114 (2) pp. 209-18).","Therefore, multiple lines of evidence exist to support the possible therapeutic value of Pim kinase inhibition in oncology. Beyond these applications, Pim kinases could play an important role in normal immune system function and Pim inhibition could be therapeutic for a number of different immunologic pathologies including inflammation, autoimmune conditions, allergy, and immune suppression for organ transplantation (Aho et al (2005) Immunology vol. 116 (1) pp. 82-8).","The invention relates generally to 4-substituted N-(pyridin-3-yl) carboxamides of formula (I) (and\/or solvates, hydrates and\/or salts thereof) with Pim kinase (Pim-1, Pim-2, and\/or Pim-3) inhibitory activity. The compounds of the present invention are useful as inhibitors of Pim kinase. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention and compositions thereof are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"33.53mm","wi":"61.30mm","file":"US08435976-20130507-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["X is N, S, or O;","Y is NH, N, S, or O;

Diastereomers have different physical properties, for example melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as crystallization, electrophoresis and chromatography.","\u201cEnantiomers\u201d refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.","Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., -(1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., \u201cStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","The term \u201ctautomer\u201d or \u201ctautomeric form\u201d refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. For example, any reference to a structure of 2-hydroxypyridine include its tautomer 2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine, also known as 2-pyridone, and vice versa.","The phrase \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention.

A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and\/or one or more counter ion.","If the compound of the invention is a base, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, mandelic acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha hydroxy acid, such as citric acid or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid or ethanesulfonic acid, or the like.","If the compound of the invention is an acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like.

For example, an \u201camino-protecting group\u201d is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ),2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl (SEM) and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).

Cell-based in vitro assays were used to measure viability, i.e. proliferation (IC), cytotoxicity (EC), and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation).","The in vitro potency of the combinations of formula I compounds with chemotherapeutic agents was measured by the cell proliferation assay of Example 11 and the results are compiled in Example iii. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (commercially available from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.) is a homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of Coleoptera luciferase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,583,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,713; U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,670) and determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, an indicator of metabolically active cells (Crouch et al (1993) J. Immunol. Meth. 160:81-88; U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,677). The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay was conducted in 96 or 384 well format, making it amenable to automated high-throughput screening (HTS) (Cree et al (1995) AntiCancer Drugs 6:398-404). The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Reagent) directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. Cell washing, removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells\/well in a 384-well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing.","The homogeneous \u201cadd-mix-measure\u201d format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay generates a \u201cglow-type\u201d luminescent signal, produced by the luciferase reaction, which has a half-life generally greater than five hours, depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units (RLU). The substrate, Beetle Luciferin, is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half-life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats, for example 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units (RLU), measured over time.","The anti-proliferative effects of formula I exemplary compounds and combinations with chemotherapeutic agents were measured by the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Assay (Example ii) against the tumor cell lines in Example iii.

These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, inhalation and rectal administration.","The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg\/kg\/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g\/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g\/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.","The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents, for example those described herein. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of treatment.","Pharmaceutical compositions also embrace isotopically-labeled formula I compounds which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of the invention, and their uses. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I and I. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention (for example, those labeled with H and C) are useful in compound and\/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (H) and carbon-14 (C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Positron emitting isotopes such as O, N, C and F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and\/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.","The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.","Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.","Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.","Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Ester, Pa., 15.sup.th Edition (1975).","Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of formula I compounds described herein. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, deamidation, esterification, deesterification, enzymatic cleavage, and the like, of the administered compound. Accordingly, the invention includes metabolites of formula I compounds, including compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.","In another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture, or \u201ckit\u201d, containing formula I compounds useful for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described above is provided. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a container comprising a formula I compound. The kit may further comprise a label or package insert, on or associated with the container. The term \u201cpackage insert\u201d is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and\/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, blister pack, etc. The container may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container may hold a compound of Formula I or a formulation thereof which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example, the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). At least one active agent in the composition is a formula I compound. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice, such as cancer. In one embodiment, the label or package inserts indicates that the composition comprising a Formula I compound can be used to treat a disorder resulting from abnormal cell growth. The label or package insert may also indicate that the composition can be used to treat other disorders. Alternatively, or additionally, the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","The kit may further comprise directions for the administration of the compound of formula I and, if present, the second pharmaceutical formulation. For example, if the kit comprises a first composition comprising a compound of formula I and a second pharmaceutical formulation, comprising for example chemotherapeutic agent Formula A or B compound, the kit may further comprise directions for the simultaneous, sequential or separate administration of the first and second pharmaceutical compositions to a patient in need thereof.","In another embodiment, the kits are suitable for the delivery of solid oral forms of a compound of formula I, such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit dosages. Such kits can include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their intended use. An example of such a kit is a \u201cblister pack\u201d. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are widely used for packaging pharmaceutical unit dosage forms. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered.","According to one embodiment, a kit may comprise (a) a first container with a compound of Formula I contained therein; and optionally (b) a second container with a second pharmaceutical formulation contained therein, wherein the second pharmaceutical formulation comprises a second compound with anti-hyperproliferative activity. Alternatively, or additionally, the kit may further comprise a third container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as bacteriostatic water for injection (BWFI), phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, and syringes.","Where the kit comprises a composition of formula I and a second therapeutic agent, i.e. the chemotherapeutic agent, the kit may comprise a container for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet, however, the separate compositions may also be contained within a single, undivided container. Typically, the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (for example, oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.","Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3 enzymes were generated as fusion proteins expressed in bacteria and purified by IMAC column chromatography (Sun, X., Chiu, J.
