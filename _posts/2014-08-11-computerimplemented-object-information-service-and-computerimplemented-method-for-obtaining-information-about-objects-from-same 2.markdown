title: Computer-implemented object information service and computer-implemented method for obtaining information about objects from same
abstract: A computer-implemented method includes obtaining information about an object at a device; providing at least some of the information to an identification mechanism; obtaining an identifier for the object from the identification service; and using the identifier to access and store information about the object at an information mechanism. The information about the object may be determined from at least one image of the object. The information mechanism may include at least one object information application, and the information mechanism may have an Application Program Interface (API) to the at least one object information application, wherein the device uses the identifier to access the at least one object information application via the API. The identifier may be a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is resolvable to the information mechanism.

A mechanism may be implemented in hardware, software (e.g., as a software module), firmware, using a special-purpose device, or any combination thereof. A mechanism may be integrated into a single device or it may be distributed over multiple devices. The various components of a mechanism may be co-located or distributed. The mechanism may be formed from other mechanisms. In general, as used herein, the term \u201cmechanism\u201d may be considered to be shorthand for the term device(s) and\/or process(es) and\/or service(s).","A client device  may be running multiple applications, e.g., applications related to the functionality of the device. For example, if the device is a phone, the device may be running multiple applications relating to its functionality as a phone. At least one client application  (i.e., an application running on client device ) may interface with or be integrated with a client module  providing functionality according to embodiments hereof.","The client application  may interact and interface with the client module  in any known manner in order for the client module to provide information to or obtain information from the client application . It should be appreciated, however, that the system is not limited by the manner in which the client application  and the client module  interact or interface. For example, the client module  may be a plug-in associated with the client application , or the client module  may be a linked or dynamically linked library to which the client application  may link, or the client module may be provided as a separate application that the client application  may invoke.","In general, the client module  is a mechanism and thus may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, using a special-purpose device, or any combination thereof. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate and understand, upon reading this description, that the client module  may be provided in multiple parts or components that may interact with each other and or with the client application  in multiple ways.","In a presently preferred implementation, the client module  is a software module provided to the client application  in source or object code form and incorporated appropriately by the client application, e.g., at compile or link time. Thus, although shown logically in the drawings as two separate components, those of ordinary skill in the art will realize and appreciate, upon reading this description, that in a particular implementation the client application  and client module  may comprise a single application .","Upon request or invocation by the client application , the client module  provides functionality to invoke and\/or control aspects of the client device  (e.g., to invoke and\/or control sensor(s) such as camera(s) on the client device ) in order, e.g., to obtain information about an object . In a presently preferred implementation the client module  uses one or more cameras on the client device  to obtain at least one image of an object . It should be appreciated that the client module  may, in addition to or instead of image data, obtain or determine other data associated with the object .","An object  may include object indicia  such as, for example, a numeric code (such as a serial number, SKU, UPC, JAN, EAN, GTIN, or the like), a one-dimensional barcode, a two-dimensional barcode (such as a QR code) or the like. A particular object  may include multiple object indicia . It should be appreciated that the system is not limited by the type or number (if any) of object indicia  on any particular object , or by the manner in which such indicia are incorporated in or associated with the object. For example, indicia may be printed on the object, printed on a tag or label or sticker associated with the object, etched into the object, engraved on the object, etc. Different indicia on the same object may be incorporated in or associated with that object in different ways. It should further be appreciated, as explained below, that some objects  may not include any indicia  (or at least not include any usable indicia).","Although the client module  is described herein as preferably using one or more cameras associated with a client device , it should be appreciated that other sensors may be used instead of or in addition to a camera. For example, if the client device has the ability to read RFID tags, the client module  may also (or instead) obtain object indicia using this ability.","The framework  also includes an object information service  that maintains information about objects and at least one object identification service  (both described in greater detail below).","The object information service  generates, maintains, uses, and hosts persistent and structured information profiles that describe and store information about individual objects known to the object information service . The object information service  may use object information application(s)  to perform some or all of its functionality, including generating, maintaining, accessing, using, and hosting the persistent and structured information profiles that describe and store information about individual objects.","The object information service  preferably maintains information about individual objects in one or more object databases . Each object  for which the object information service  maintains information has a unique object identifier associated therewith within the object information service , and information about each particular object within the object information service  is preferably keyed or indexed on the unique object identifier for that particular object. Thus, given a particular unique object identifier corresponding to a particular object, the object information service  may use that particular unique object identifier to operate on (e.g., use, access, etc.) that particular object.","The object identification service  may include or have access to one or more image recognition services .","As used herein, the term \u201caccess\u201d means, without limitation, to read, write, copy, update, or use in any way, directly or indirectly.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize and appreciate, upon reading this description, that information within the object information service  may also be keyed or indexed on other information or keys.","The object database(s)  may use any known methods of storing and accessing object information, and the scope of the system is not limited by the manner in which information is stored or accessed in the object database(s) . At least some of the object database(s)  may be co-located with the object information service , however the object database(s) may be fully or partially located apart from the object information service .","Information in object database(s)  may be accessed by object information application(s) , e.g., through application programming interfaces (APIs) . The object information application(s)  preferably include one or more applications to support functions such as creation, storage, update, and access of object information object database(s) . Exemplary APIs are described in greater detail below.","Access to information in the object information service  preferably requires authorization by the object information service, and is preferably authorized for users who are required to be registered in some manner with the object information service .","In some exemplary implementations the object information service  may use one or more rules databases  in order to provide some or all of the functionality. Rules database(s)  may be used to support policy\/rule-based interaction with the object information. The rules database(s)  may be updated.","In order to obtain the unique object identifier associated with a particular object (e.g., a physical object), a client application  may interact with an object identification service  via an associated client module . An object identification service  may thus be used to try to identify an object  and to provide the invoking client module  with a unique identifier for a particular object, based, e.g., on information about the particular object (e.g., processed image and processed image information) it receives from the client module . The client module  may then provide this unique object identifier to an associated client application .","The unique object identifier is preferably a URI (or included in a URI), and an object identification service  preferably provides the client module that invoked it with a URI associated with the object .","The syntax of URIs is defined in Network Working Group \u201cUniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax,\u201d RFC 3986, STD 66, January, 2005, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purpose. For the purposes of this description, a URI representing or comprising a unique object identifier preferably has the form:\n\n","Where <scheme> is \u201chttp\u201d or preferably \u201chttps\u201d, <domain> is a domain name (preferably a FQDN) that resolves to the object information service ; <path> is an optional field that represents a path on the object information service , and <id> is an identifier (or name) that is unique within the object information service .","By way of example, if the object information service  (or the APIs  associated with the object information service ) may be accessed at the domain api.evrythng.com, and the <path> is \u201cthugs\u201d (described below with reference to an exemplary API), and a particular object has the unique identifier \u201c504766a7c8f205a0744243c1\u201d within the object information service , then the URI corresponding to that particular object may look like:","https:\/\/api.evrythng.com\/thngs\/504766a7c81205a0744243c1","The object information service  is preferably an online software web service accessed via network  (e.g., the Internet). The object information service  is preferably operated independently of client applications. An object identification service  is preferably an online web service, and a client module  may interact with the object identification service  via a network  (e.g., the Internet). Although shown in the drawings as using the same network , it should be appreciated that the client module need not access the object identification service  using the same network as is used to access the object information service .","The client application  and\/or client module  may access the various services (object information service , object identification service ) by any connection mechanism(s) or combinations thereof, including wired (e.g., WAN, LAN), wireless (e.g., WiFi), cellular, etc. The system is not limited by the manner or type of connection mechanism(s) used to access the various services.","An object identification service  may make use of third party services (not shown) to assist it in identifying the object type, e.g., via image processing or the decryption of a URI encoded in information it receives from a client module .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["100","100","126","128","126","106","112","126","126"]},"Exemplary Data Structures & Organization",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["118","202","204","206","208","202","210","212","210"]},"With reference to , each user  has a user identity (ID) . A user may also have one or more objects  (corresponding to object  in ) associated therewith.","Exemplary Object Information Service API","This section describes exemplary data structures, object information applications used by\/in object information service , as well as a public API  to those applications.","The API  preferably follows the RESTful architectural principles, which means it tries to get the best out of HTTP and the Web. The API  may be used in a programming language or via any HTTP client that handles at least POST and GET.","Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize and appreciate, upon reading this description, that the applications, data structures, and API described here are given only by way of example, and any particular embodiment or implementation may use different and\/or other applications, data structures, and APIs.","As can be seen in the following, the API allows users to access the functionality (e.g., the object information applications ) of the object information service  using a domain associated with the object information service . In the case of a specific object, the domain is preferably specified in the URI comprising the unique object identifier for that specific object. Thus, as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art will realize and appreciate, upon reading this description, the URI comprising the unique object identifier for a specific object provides a way to access the object information service  with respect to that object.","API Overview","A central data structure in the exemplary object information service  is referred to as Thngs that are data containers to store all the data generated by and about any object. Various properties can be attached to any Thng, and the content of each property can be updated any time, while preserving the history of those changes. Thngs can be added to various Collections that support sharing a set of Thngs with other Users within the object information service.","Thng","A Thng is essentially an abstract notion of an object which may have property data (e.g., location data) associated with it. Also called Active Digital Identities (ADIs), these resources can model objects such as real-world elements (e.g., persons, places, cars, guitars, mobile phones, etc.). Every thng in the object information service  is assigned a unique identifier (ThngID) at creation time. The unique identifier is necessary to access\/edit the thng.","An example basic (JSON) document schema of a Thng (as stored within object information service ) is as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0068"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<Thng>={"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cid\u201d: <String>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201ccreatedAt\u201d: <timestamp>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cupdatedAt\u201d: <timestamp>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cname\u201d: <String>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cdescription\u201d: <String>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201clocation\u201d: {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201clongitude\u201d: <Number>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201clatitude\u201d: <Number>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201ctimestamp\u201d: <timestamp>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cproduct\u201d: <String>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201cproperties\u201d: {"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<String>: <String>,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003... },"]},{"entry":[{},"\u201ctags\u201d: [<String>, ...]"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Property","A Thng may have various and arbitrary properties, preferably stored as arbitrary key\/value pairs.

As shown in , the exemplary process includes the following:\n\n","The various processing steps are shown in the drawing separated by a vertical line to indicate where they are being performed (by a client or an object identification service).","With reference to the flow chart in , the object identification service  obtains the processed images and possibly other information from the client (at S) and then identifies the object (at S). If the object identification service  knows the unique ID of the object then it may provide that to the client, otherwise it provides information to the object information service  (at S) to create a new object (e.g., using the API interface to \u201cCreate a single thng,\u201d as described above. Since the device is associated with a particular user, the new object will preferably be associated with that particular user. The object information service  provides the object ID to the object identification service  (at S, if needed), and then the object identification service  provides the object ID to the client (at S).","Once it obtains the URI for an object's profile in the object information service , the client application may use that URI (or information therein) to interact with the object information service  with respect to that object. Preferably the client application uses the URI to address and thereby access the API .","As noted, a unique object identifier may be provided as a URI. However, since the client may already know some of the information needed in the URI (e.g., the domain and path), in some cases the object identification service  need only provide the identifier to the client. For example, if the client already knows that the object information service  (or the APIs  associated with the object information service ) may be accessed at the domain api.evrythng.com, and the <path> is \u201cthugs\u201d, and a particular object has the unique identifier \u201c504766a7c8f205a0744243c1\u201d within the object information service , then the client need only be provided with the unique identifier in order to form the URI corresponding to that particular object:","https:\/\/api.evrythng.com\/thngs\/504766a7c81205a0744243c1","Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize and appreciate, upon reading this description, that a client module may access and interact with the object identification service  in any manner (e.g., via a cellular network, satellite network, or in some other fashion, including combinations of approaches), and the system is not limited by the manner in which such communication or interaction takes place. Similarly, the manner in which a client application interacts with object information service  may take place in any manner, and the system is not limited by the manner in which such communication occurs.","The following are examples of application of the system disclosed herein. These use cases are provided only as examples and are not intended to be in any way limiting of the invention.","Use Case 1","In this scenario, a user installs an application on his mobile phone. It then launches the application, which runs the client software code described above and takes a photo of a product. The product photo is then sent to an identification server application to be identified. A product SKU (or some such indicia) is found in the image, and a unique product identity for that object for the user is generated on the fly. The user can then attach personalized multimedia content (for example a photo of himself) and he can then invite another friend to view the video.","Use Case 2.","In this scenario, a user buys a bottle of wine that has a UPI tag attached. The user sees an advertisement on a wine review website that prompts him to scan his bottle to take part in a contest. The user clicks on the advertisement, which starts the camera of the device and he can then scan the UPI tag on his bottle. Because the product is verified as genuine and has not yet been used to take part in the contest, the user's participation is validated and the user enters the contest.","The services, mechanisms, operations and acts shown and described above are implemented, at least in part, by software running on one or more computers or computer systems or user devices. It should be appreciated that each user device is, or comprises, a computer system.","Programs that implement such methods (as well as other types of data) may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media (e.g., computer readable media) in a number of manners. Hard-wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of, or in combination with, some or all of the software instructions that can implement the processes of various embodiments. Thus, various combinations of hardware and software may be used instead of software only.","One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate and understand, upon reading this description, that the various processes described herein may be implemented by, e.g., appropriately programmed general purpose computers, special purpose computers and computing devices. One or more such computers or computing devices may be referred to as a computer system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0263"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"According to the present example, the computer system  includes a bus  (i.e., interconnect), one or more processors , one or more communications ports , a main memory , optional removable storage media , read-only memory , and a mass storage .
