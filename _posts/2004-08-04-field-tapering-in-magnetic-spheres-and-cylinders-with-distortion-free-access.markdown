Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to permanent magnets and, more particularly, to high intensity permanent magnets having gradient fields and to methods of making such magnets.","2. Related Art","Permanent magnets that are capable of producing high intensity magnetic fields and that have a compact structure are known and are used, e.g., in miniaturized electrical components including disk drives for laptop and palmtop computers. In particular, permanent magnet materials that are highly remanent and coercive, such as those of the rare earth type, are produced to make compact flux sources of extraordinary strength. Examples of high-intensity, compact permanent magnets, which may employ these materials, may be found in the following patents. U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,542, to Leupold, entitled \u201cHollow Substantially Hemispherical Permanent Magnet High Field Flux Source for Producing a Uniform High Field\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 4,839,059 to Leupold, entitled \u201cClad Magic Ring Wigglers\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,103,200 to Leupold, entitled \u201cHigh-Field Permanent Magnet Flux Source\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,401 to Leupold, entitled \u201cMagnetic Field Sources Having Non-Distorting Access Ports\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,936 to Leupold et al., entitled \u201cField Augmented Permanent Magnet Structures\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,338 to Leupold, entitled \u201cHigh-Power Electrical Machinery with Toroidal Permanent Magnets\u201d; U.S. Pat. No. 5,434,462 to Leupold et al., entitled \u201cHigh-Power Electrical Machinery\u201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,731 to Leupold, entitled \u201cSimplified Method of Making Light Weight Magnetic Field Sources Having Distortion-Free Access Ports. The entire contents of each of the foregoing patents is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the extent necessary to make and practice the present invention.","The basic configuration from which the magnetic arrangements described above are derived may be referred to as a Halboch Structure or a magic cylinder or ring. The magic ring is a permanent magnet which is magnetized in accordance with the configuration shown in FIG. . The orientation of magnetization at any point (P) is at an angle (\u03b3) from a vertical axis (z) and is equal to twice the polar coordinate of P,(\u03b8) or according to equation (1) as follows:\n\n\u03b3=(2)(\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(1) \n\nwhere:\n\n","It may be desired in particular applications employing magic rings or cylinders that access ports of various sizes, shapes and locations extend through the shell and communicate with the internal cavity (c). However, removal of magnetic material to provide an access port to the interior through the magnetic shell will distort the interior field especially in the vicinity of the port. To overcome this drawback, a further method is proposed, as also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,731, wherein some of the thin washer-shaped pieces that are sliced from the uniformly magnetized cylinder are interleaved with the magic ring slices to form a cylinder that allows for non-distorting access ports. In such a case, removal of magnetic material results in a non-distorting access port, since a uniformly magnetized ring produces no field in its interior cavity and superposition of such a magnetization pattern upon that of ae magic ring would result in no change in the field located in the cavity of the magic ring.","It is also sometimes desired to produce permanent magnets having a shell and a cavity wherethrough a high intensity magnetic field extends which is tapered, or has a gradient. For example, electron-beam tubes often require gradient fields, which typically vary along a beam axis, for use in focusing and guiding the beam. Microwave and millimeter wave sources require an axial field variation of a longitudinal magnetic field in order to produce a crisp waveform and storage rings and particle accelerators may require transverse magnetic fields including field tapering in the direction of a longitudinal axis of a beam in order to compensate for changes in a velocity of the beam. In spectroscopic analysis, magnetic fields with a linear taper in the direction of the field are often used to produce a spectral distribution of absorbed or emitted electromagnetic energy.","U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,400 to Leupold (below referred to as the \u201c400 Patent\u201d), the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference to the extent necessary to make and practice the present invention, describes a permanent magnet having a cavity and producing a magnetic field that varies in intensity and in the direction of its orientation to produce a tapered or gradient magnetic field within a cavity thereof. As generally described therein, to provide a linear taper along the z axis of a magnetic ring or cylinder where the south pole is at z=0 at an inner edge of a cavity, the remanence is tapered along the polar angle \u03b8 according to equation (2) as follows:\n\nB(\u03b8)=m\u03b8+B(0\u00b0)\u2003\u2003(2) \n\nwhere:\n\n","The permanent magnets described in the above patents and documents have numerous applications and advantages, however, it is desired to provide a permanent magnet including a cavity having both a gradient magnetic field and a distortion free access port.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a permanent magnet comprises a shell surrounding a cavity. The shell comprises a magnetic remanence B(\u03b8) configured such that a magnetic field taper extends through the cavity and wherein the shell also comprises a non-distortive access region that is substantially absent any magnetic field.","Another aspect of the present invention concerns a permanent magnet that comprises a shell surrounding a cavity and wherein the shell comprises a magnetic remanence configured whereby a magnetic field taper extends through the cavity. The remanence B(\u03b8) of the shell varying according to the formula:\n\nB(\u03b8)=[(B(\u03b8))+(B(\u03b8))]\n\nwhere:\n\n","A further aspect involves a method of making a permanent magnet having a cavity, comprising providing at least one first segment having a first magnetic field that has a single predetermined direction of magnetization and that has a uniform first remanence; providing at least one second segment having a second magnetic field that has a direction of magnetization (\u03b3) that varies circumferentially along the segment according to the formula \u03b3=(2)(\u03b8) where \u03b8 is a polar angle from \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=360\u00b0 and wherein the second magnetic field comprises a second remanence which increases in magnitude from \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=180\u00b0 and decreases in magnitude from \u03b8=180\u00b0 to \u03b8=360\u00b0; and combining the at least one first segment and the at least one second segment to form a permanent magnet.","One embodiment of the present invention concerns a permanent magnet that has both a cavity comprising a gradient magnetic field and a distortion free access port. In another embodiment of the invention, a permanent magnet may comprise a plurality of first and second segments that may be easily assembled together to provide the desired magnetic field parameters.","Referring to , and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a combination of magnetic rings, each having a particular magnetization, may be combined to form a magnetic ring having a particular resultant magnetization, the particulars of which may be found by vector analysis. For example, a first magnetic ring A including a magnetization direction and magnitude represented by arrows a may be combined with a magnetic ring B including a magnetization represented by arrows b (of equal magnitude to those of arrows a and in tandem at poles p where \u03b8=0\u00b0 and \u03b8=180\u00b0) to form a magnetic ring C that has a resulting field reflected in arrows cand voids or nulls in points c, located at \u03b8=\u00b190\u00b0. It will be understood that since a magnetization of zero is present at the nulls, represented at points c, material may be removed from the magnetic ring C at points cin order to provide non-distortive access ports as described in more detail below. Within the magnetic ring C the magnetization (M) components vary in the x and z directions according to the following equations (4) and (5):\n\nM=Msin(2\u03b8);\u2003\u2003(4) \n\nM=M(cos2\u03b8+1);\u2003\u2003(5) \n\nwhere: \n","Mis the magnetization of the material used and is equal to the remanence (B) divided by 4\u03c0 (M=B\/4\u03c0). It will be recognized that where a desired Bexceeds that of the best available material, an increase in the radius of the ring may be used to compensate for this.","In another example, by combining magnetic ring D including magnetization represented by arrows d with magnetic ring E including a magnetization represented by arrows e (of equal magnitude to those of arrows e and in opposition at poles p), a magnetic ring F is formed with a resulting field reflected in arrows fand voids in points f, located at \u03b8=0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0. Accordingly, material may be removed from the magnetic ring F and non-distortive access ports may be provided at points f. Within the magnetic ring C the magnetization (M) components vary in the x and z directions according to the following equations (6) and (7):\n\nM=Mcos(2\u03b8);\u2003\u2003(6) \n\nM=M(sin \u03b8+1).\u2003\u2003(7) \n","Referring now to , a cylindrical permanent magnet having both-a gradient magnetic field in a cavity thereof and a distortion free access port in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown generally at . The permanent magnet  may comprise a shell  and a plurality of sections . Each section  may be magnetized, as described in more detail below, such that both a direction of magnetization and a magnitude of magnetization may vary section by section. This is represented by the direction and length of arrows .","Further in accordance with this embodiment, a non-distortive access region or notch  is provided for access to a cavity . Also, a gradient magnetic field, represented by arrow , resides within the cavity .","It has been found that when a magnetization of two separate magnetic rings or cylinders, such as those illustrated in , are combined, a magnetization that results is consistent with the magnetization represented by the arrows  of the permanent magnet  of FIG. .","Referring now also to , a magnetic ring  may be magnetized by a uniform magnetic field to form a uniform remanence (B) as represented by the direction and length of arrows . As is evident to one of ordinary skill in the art, generally no magnetic field is present within a cavity  of the magnetic ring .","Referring now further to , a magnetic ring , which may be similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,400, above incorporated herein by reference, is shown which may be magnetized such that the direction of magnetization (\u03b3) varies circumferentially along the segment according to the equation (8) as follows:\n\n\u03b3=(2)(\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(8) \n\nwhere:\n\n","Arrows  are oriented in a manner to illustrate the direction of magnetization (\u03b3) which varies about the circumference of the magnetic ring . Arrows  also illustrate the magnitude of a remanence (B) which also varies about the circumference of the magnetic ring . In particular, the remanence (B) generally increases from \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=180\u00b0 and decreases from \u03b8=180\u00b0 to \u03b8=0\u00b0. More specifically, the remanence (B) varies according to equation (9) as follows:\n\nB(\u03b8)=m\u03b8+B\u2003\u2003(9) \n\nwhere:\n\n","Combining the uniform magnetization of the magnetic ring  with the varying magnetization arrangement of the magnetic ring  results in a varying magnetization such as that of the permanent magnet  of FIG. . Since generally no magnetic field is present in the cavity  of the magnetic ring , combining magnetic rings  and  results in no change to the tapered or gradient magnetic field of the magnetic ring  and thus is represented in the magnetic ring  by arrow . Also since the remanences (B) and (B) are equal but opposite in direction where \u03b8=0\u00b0, a non-distortive access region exists at \u03b8=0\u00b0 and notch  may be provided. Further, the direction of magnetization (\u03b3), illustrated by the direction of arrows , may be found in accordance with vector analysis as exemplified above in connection with FIG. .","In accordance with vector analysis, the resulting remanence in the permanent magnet  for \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=\u00b1180\u00b0 for each vector component of the remanence along the x direction may be found from equation (6) as follows:\n\nB(\u03b8)={[(B\u2212B)\/90\u00b0](\u03b8)\u2212B90\u00b0\u22122\u03b8) \u2003\u2003(11) \n\nEach vector component of the resulting remanence along the z direction for \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=\u00b1180\u00b0 may be found from equation (12) as follows:\n\nB(\u03b8)={[(B\u2212B)\/90\u00b0](\u03b8)\u2212B}sin(90\u00b0\u22122\u03b8)\u2212B\u2003\u2003(12) \n\nThe vector components B(\u03b8) and B(\u03b8) may be combined to form a resultant remanence via equation (13) as follows:\n\nB(\u03b8)=[(B(\u03b8))+(B(\u03b8))]\u2003\u2003(13) \n\nThe direction of magnetization (\u03b3) for each of B(\u03b8) may be found in accordance with equation (14) as follows:\n\ntan(\u03b3)=B\/B\u2003\u2003(14) \n","It will also be appreciated that the particular location (\u03b8) of the notch  (or slot in the case of a cylinder) may be varied depending upon a desired location for distortion free access. For example, distortion free access may be provided in the permanent magnet  at \u03b8=90\u00b0 and at \u03b8=270\u00b0 by modifying the uniform remanence (B) of the magnetic ring  to equal (B+B)\/2 whereby the following equations (15) and (16) for vector components of the remanence are obtained.\n\nB(\u03b8)={[(B\u2212B)\/90\u00b0](\u03b8)\u2212B}cos(90\u00b0\u22122\u03b8)\u2003\u2003(15) \n\nB(\u03b8)=[((B\u2212B)\/90\u00b0)(\u03b8)\u2212B]sin(90\u00b0\u22122\u03b8)+(B+B)\/2\u2003\u2003(16) \n\nThe vector components B(\u03b8) and B(\u03b8) may be combined to form a resultant remanence via equations (13) and (14) above.\n","It will be appreciated that the above-described equations may be used in connection with a sphere, although, the resulting distortion free access ports are cylindrical tunnels at the poles and an equatorial slot at the equator.","Optional Embodiment For Simple Assembly","Referring now to , a permanent magnet, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment, the permanent magnet  comprises a plurality of segments ,  each having an aperture . As illustrated, each of the segments ,  are magnetized, as described in more detail below, and may be concatenated together to create a magnetic field within the apertures  which is tapered or increases in strength in the direction of the arrow  and which comprises a non-distortive access region or notch .","The segments , or washer-shaped pieces and shown also in , may be cut (illustrated by dashed lines ) from a cylindrical blank  that may comprise any suitable material capable of high remanence and thereby producing a high strength magnetic field such as a composition that includes a rare earth element. The cylindrical blank  may be magnetized by a uniform magnetic field to form a uniform remanence (B) as represented by the direction and length of arrows .","Referring to , a cylindrical blank  is shown from which segments , or magnetic ring slices, may be cut (as illustrated by dashed lines ). The cylindrical blank  may comprise a similar material to that of the cylindrical blank , although, it will be appreciated that other materials capable of high remanence may be employed. The cylindrical blank  may be magnetized such that the direction of magnetization (\u03b3) varies circumferentially along the segment similar to that described above in connection with FIG.  and according to the equations (9) and (10) above. Accordingly, arrows  are oriented in a manner to illustrate the direction of magnetization that varies about the circumference of the cylindrical blank . Arrows  also illustrate the magnitude of the remanence (B) which also generally increases from \u03b8=0\u00b0 to \u03b8=180\u00b0 and decreases from \u03b8=180\u00b0 to \u03b8=360\u00b0 as described above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00091","num":"00091"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 5"],"b":["10","12","14","10","30","12","14"]},"Referring now also to , after assembly of the permanent magnet , the permanent magnet may have a resultant magnetic field remanence (represented by arrows ) that includes a general null at the notch  and an increasing field strength (H) along a z axis through cavity . As shown, H(min) represents a minimum field strength within the cavity  while H(max) represents a maximum field strength.","Another embodiment of a permanent magnet in accordance with the present invention is illustrated generally at  in FIG. . The permanent magnet  may be similar to permanent magnet  in many aspects except that, instead of a generally cylindrical configuration, the permanent magnet  comprises a generally spherical configuration. Accordingly, similar components are labeled with similar reference numbers excepting that a one is included in the reference number for those referring to permanent magnet .","The permanent magnet  comprises segments  and  each of which comprise a magnetic remanence Band B(represented by arrows , , respectively) which may be similar to that described above in connection with .
