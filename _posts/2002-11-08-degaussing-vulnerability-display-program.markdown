title: Degaussing vulnerability display program
abstract: Magnetic signature measurements are taken at various points corresponding to an original water depth beneath a ship. A computer processor receives and processes (i) this group of measured magnetic signature values and (ii) the designed magnetic signature value the sensing of which actuates the subject magnetic mine, implementing graph display management on a user interface display screen. According to the computer processing, some or all such measured magnetic signature values are extrapolated at different depths each greater than the original depth, thereby yielding several or many groups, each group being of extrapolated magnetic signature values associated with various points corresponding to the same depth, the groups collectively representing a three-dimensional arrangement of extrapolated magnetic signature values associated with various points corresponding to different depths. Each point is characterized as either actuating or non-actuating of the mine, and various perspectives of some or all such characterizations are displayed.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE APPENDICES","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The present invention relates to magnetically responsive devices such as magnetic mines, more particularly to methods and apparatuses for evaluating the performance of a ship's degaussing system with respect to threats posed by magnetic mines that are situated in a marine environment.","A mine is an explosive device which is usually concealed either underground or underwater, and which is used primarily by military forces for defensive purposes. Mines typically are self-contained devices which include an explosive capability and a detonator (a firing mechanism for triggering the mine explosion), and which explode when touched by or approached by a target. \u201cMinefields\u201d are areas where mines have been placed. Generally there are two categories of mines, based on their situation, viz., \u201cland mines\u201d and \u201cunderwater mines\u201d (synonymously referred to as \u201cwater mines,\u201d \u201csubmarine mines,\u201d \u201csea mines\u201d or \u201cnaval mines\u201d).","An underwater mine is a mine which is situated in or on water or contiguously with respect to water or which otherwise bears physical or functional relation to a water environment. A typical underwater mine comprises an explosive charge positioned underwater and set to fire in response to the presence of a marine vehicle (e.g., a ship or submarine) in contact therewith or in proximity thereto. Underwater mines are generally laid in the water for purposes of damaging or sinking ships or of deterring ships from entering an area. \u201cMoored mines\u201d are underwater mines having positive buoyancy, typically held below the water surface at a pre-selected depth by a mooring (e.g., cable) attached (e.g., tethered) to an anchor (e.g., on a sea bottom). \u201cBottom mines\u201d are underwater mines having negative buoyancy and resting on a seabed (e.g., at the bottom of relatively shallow water). \u201cFloating mines\u201d are underwater mines that are not entirely underwater but are visible on the surface.","Underwater mines are triggered either by direct contact or by indirect influence. Typically, when an underwater mine is triggered, an expanding gas sphere caused by the explosion sends shock waves through the water, these shock waves having deleterious effects on the nearby target marine vessel. \u201cContact mines\u201d are actuated as a result of physical contact between the target ship and the mine's casing or one or more of the mine's appendages (e.g., rods or antennae protruding from the mine's surface). \u201cInfluence mines\u201d are actuated either as a result of sensing an \u201cinfluence field\u201d emanating from the target marine vessel, or as a result of the target marine vessel's intrusion within an \u201cinfluence field\u201d emanating from the mine. Generally, influence mines sense changes in physical patterns in surrounding water, such as pertaining to magnetic fields (\u201cmagnetic mines\u201d), pressure change (\u201cpressure mines\u201d) or sound waves (\u201cacoustic mines\u201d).","U.S. Navy surface combatant ships are equipped with degaussing systems comprising a set of current-carrying coils which are adjusted to reduce the ship's magnetic field and thereby reduce it's vulnerability to the magnetic mine threat. Currently, performance of U.S. naval combatant degaussing systems is determined by recording the combatant's magnetic field at a Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSR), measuring the peak field, and adjusting degaussing coil currents to reduce this peak field to less than a specified level.","However, magnetic mines do not operate by measuring the peak value of a ship's magnetic field; rather, magnetic mines operate by measuring the rate of change of a ship's magnetic field. In addition, many mines measure the rate of change in the ship's horizontal magnetic fields to determine when to actuate. Current methods for measuring combatant degaussing system performance may not reflect the combatant's actual susceptibility to the magnetic bottom mine threat.","In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved methodology for assessing the performance of a ship's degaussing system relative to underwater magnetic mine threat.","It is another object of the present invention to provide such a methodology wherein an improvement resides in the concordance of the performance assessment with the mine's designed criterion for actuation thereof.","In accordance with typical embodiments of the present invention, a method is provided for visually representing information pertaining to the threat to a vehicle of a magnetically responsive device of interest. The inventive method comprises the steps of: (a) determining a relationship, in a spatial region, between magnetic signature data and device actuation data; and, (b) effecting a display indicative of the relationship. The magnetic signature data pertains to the vehicle. The device actuation data pertains to the magnetically responsive device.","According to frequent practice of such inventive methodology, the magnetically responsive device is a magnetic mine. The device actuation data is mine actuation data. The magnetic signature data includes plural magnetic field values associated with the vehicle. The magnetic field values correspond to plural locations in the spatial region. Each magnetic field value corresponds to a different location in the spatial region. The mine actuation data includes plural mine actuation criteria associated with the magnetic mine. The actuation criteria correspond to plural locations in the spatial region. Each actuation criterion corresponds to a different location in the spatial region. The determination of a relationship between the magnetic signature data and the mine actuation data includes establishing a correlation, in the spatial region, between the magnetic field values and the mine actuation criteria.","According to typical inventive practice, each actuation criterion is used by the magnetic mine for the purpose of making a threshold determination of whether or not the magnetic mine actuates at that particular location\u2014i.e., a threshold determination of actuation of the magnetic mine versus non-actuation of the magnetic mine at such location. Each actuation criterion includes consideration of at least one influence parameter, at least one of which is a magnetic influence parameter (i.e., pertains to magnetic field or magnetic signature). For instance, each actuation criterion can be based at least in part on a magnetic influence parameter pertaining to the magnetic field rate-of-change value.","Typically according to practice of the present invention, the vehicle is a nautical vehicle. The determination of a relationship between the magnetic signature data and the mine actuation data includes extrapolating plural measured magnetic field values associated with the nautical vehicle so as to obtain plural two-dimensional arrays of extrapolated magnetic field values. Each two-dimensional array corresponds to a different water depth which is greater than an initial water depth. The correlation is between the extrapolated magnetic field values and the mine actuation thresholds, a two-dimensional array of measured magnetic field values having been obtained at the initial water depth. According to some inventive embodiments, the determination of a relationship between the magnetic signature data and the mine actuation data includes obtaining the two-dimensional array of said measured magnetic field values.","In accordance with many embodiments of the present invention, a computer program product comprises a computer useable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for enabling a computer system to display, on a display screen of said computer system, information pertaining to the vulnerability of a marine vessel to an underwater magnetic mine. The present invention's computer program logic comprises: (a) means for enabling the computer system to extrapolate magnetic signature measurement values, taken at various locations at a selected water depth, so as to obtain a three-dimensional matrix of magnetic signature extrapolation values existing at various locations at various water depths greater than the selected water depth; (b) means for enabling the computer system to relate a magnetic mine model to the three-dimensional matrix of magnetic signature extrapolation values, wherein the magnetic mine model includes a criterion for actuation of a magnetic mine for each of various locations, and wherein at each of various locations the magnetic signature extrapolation value is understood to either satisfy or not satisfy the magnetic mine actuation criterion; and, (c) means for enabling the computer system to render a graphical representation informative of the relation of the magnetic mine actuation criterion to the three-dimensional matrix of magnetic signature extrapolation values. According to typical such embodiments, the computer program logic further comprises means for enabling the computer system to adjust the number of magnetic signature measurement values prior to the extrapolation.","Many inventive embodiments provide apparatus comprising a machine having a memory. The machine contains a data representation pertaining to hazard posed to navigation by a magnetic water mine. The data representation is generated, for availability for containment by the machine, by the method comprising: (a) extrapolating measured magnetic field values to obtain a three-dimensional array of extrapolated magnetic field values; and, (b) associating the three-dimensional array with a model pertaining to actuation of the mine. The measured magnetic field values correspond to a shallowest water depth. The extrapolated magnetic field values correspond to at least two deeper water depths. Each extrapolated magnetic field value is defined as being either one (but not both) of the following: (i) a magnetic field value which does not actuate the mine; and, (ii) a magnetic field value which does actuate the mine (That is, in an exclusively disjunctive manner, each extrapolated magnetic field value is defined as meeting either condition \u201c(i)\u201d or condition \u201c(ii)\u201d). According to typical such embodiments, the inventive apparatus further comprises another machine for graphically representing at least one aspect of the association of the three-dimensional array with the model pertaining to mine actuation.","According to typical embodiments, the present invention's \u201cDegaussing Vulnerability Display Program\u201d enables the rapid determination of the performance of a surface combatant's degaussing system against the magnetic mine threat, with visualization of both the ship's magnetic signature and resulting mine actuation contours. The present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program provides a new metric for measuring degaussing system performance. Using accurate mine models and extrapolation techniques, the inventive program enables degaussing engineers at magnetic silencing facilities to rapidly compute and visualize a surface combatant's vulnerability to the magnetic mine threat. Moreover, the present invention admits of mine threat vulnerability assessment in terms of the specific kind of magnetic field phenomenon (e.g., rate of change of magnetic field) that, according to the design of a given magnetic mine, precipitates actuation of such given magnetic mine.","A \u201cmine model\u201d (also known as a \u201cmine simulation\u201d) is a representation of the decision-making process that a particular mine undergoes in order to determine whether or not to actuate under various circumstances. Typically, a mine model is a computer mine model (or computer mine simulation)\u2014e.g., a software simulation of the process that an actual mine uses to determine when to actuate. A mine can use one influence signature, or a combination of plural influence signatures, in the mine's process of determining when to actuate. For example, an acoustic signature can be used together with a magnetic signature in the mine's detection-and-actuation process. Basically, any measurable signature emitted by a passing target can be used in the mine's detection-and-actuation process. For inventive embodiments which are practiced in association with plurally influenced devices, it is assumed that all other (e.g., non-magnetic) influence parameters are satisfied; that is, it is assumed that all influence parameters which are unrelated to the type(s) of influence parameter(s) with which the inventive embodiment is concerned (viz., magnetic influence parameters, which are influence parameters involving magnetic field or magnetic signature) are satisfied.","A magnetic mine model\/simulation incorporates data obtained through testing of the magnetic mine of interest. Generally, a mine model\/simulation is based upon experimentally obtained data concerning the behavior of the subject mine. The mine is tested by ascertaining how the mine reacts under various circumstances (e.g., at various distances from or locations relative to various stimuli). In particular, investigation involves when the mine actuates and when it does not under various conditions. In this manner, the investigators can rather accurately determine the mine's functional characteristics. The information thus learned can be used for computer modeling (computer simulating) the mine's behavior.","Techniques for testing mines and preparing computer models\/simulations are well known in the pertinent arts. For instance, one who is ordinarily skilled in computational sciences (or a related mathematical, scientific or engineering discipline) and who is tasked with computer modeling\/simulating a mine's behavior would be capable of applying his or her skill for such assignment. The inventive practitioner(s) may or may not have participated in mine testing and\/or mine modelling\/simulating; in any event, in the light of the instant disclosure, the inventive practitioner(s) will be capable of practicing the present invention. Ordinarily skilled artisan or artisans who read the instant disclosure will be capable of utilizing a mine model\/simulation (e.g., in order to evaluate ship degaussing performance) in accordance with the present invention.","The term \u201cmine model\u201d as used herein refers to any model or simulation of or relating to a mine's behavior. A mine model is typically in computer software form. The term \u201cmagnetic mine\u201d as used herein refers to any mine that is influenced by one or more phenomena involving magnetism, regardless of whether and to what extent the mine is influenced by one or more phenomena not involving magnetism (such as involving acoustics or pressure). The term \u201cmine actuation criterion\u201d as used herein refers to the standard, rule or test on which a mine (e.g., in its processing) bases its judgment or decision as to whether or not to actuate. A mine actuation criterion can be characterized by any degree of complexity and can include consideration of any singular or plural number of parameters (factors).","The present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program has several other features and advantages that are consistent with U.S. Navy goals. Firstly, input to the inventive program comes from the binary range data files collected by the U.S. Navy's magnetic silencing facilities; this will enable vulnerability of a ranged combatant to be determined quickly after ranging, either at the magnetic silencing facility or onboard the ranged ship\u2014e.g., simply by copying the data file to a floppy disk and sending the disk to the ship. Furthermore, the inventive program is able to display onset-of-actuation contours at multiple depths in a plan view, allowing the user to select the depth of display. In addition, the inventive program is capable of displaying, in an elevation view, the overall onset-of-actuation curve for all depths at which actuation will occur. Moreover, the inventive program is very easy to use and is interactive, with quick as possible turn-around. Finally, the inventive program has an architecture which will allow new mine models to be added as new mines are exploited and new models developed.","This application bears some relation to the following pending U.S. nonprovisional patent applications, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: Ser.

A ship  has a degaussing system installed thereon, and is thus equipped with plural L-coils , plural A-coils and plural M-Coils , such as shown in .","As shown in , ship  is \u201cranged\u201d at a \u201cMagnetic Silencing Facility\u201d (\u201cMSF\u201d) , using magnetic sensors (e.g., magnetometers) . The magnetic field of ship  is recorded in a range file . The inventive program (the present invention's \u201cDegaussing Vulnerability Display Program\u201d) reads the range file  into a signature array . The inventive program \u201cdecimates\u201d signature array  to a decimated signature array  which is suitable for extrapolation. Signature array  and decimated signature array  correspond to the same water depth.","When an underwater magnetic mine model  is selected, the decimated signature  is extrapolated to produce the ship's magnetic signatures  at deeper water depths. The extrapolated signatures , , . . . each represent a planar array of signature values at a particular water depth (e.g., the distance below the water surface w shown in  and ), based on the configuration of the magnetic sensors  distributed below the ship  hull at magnetic sensing facility . Each signature  is extrapolated from the planar signature array  derived from the range file  readings, such range file  readings having previously been taken (at a magnetic silencing facility ) at a water depth shallower than that corresponding to any of the extrapolated signatures .","As shown in , the combination of all of these signatures at varying water depths represents a three-dimensional array  of parallel planar arrays . Each two-dimensional array  represents a kind of two-dimensional mathematical matrix of magnetic signature values, while the three dimensional array  represents a kind of three-dimensional mathematical matrix of magnetic signature values which is the aggregate of the plural two-dimensional arrays . Extrapolated signatures  are processed in association with a mine model , and the resulting actuation contour is stored in the actuation surface . If the inventive program is directed to plural mine models , each mine model  has its own actuation surface  associated therewith.","If any mine actuation has occurred at the extrapolation depth, the depth is incremented, the signature is extrapolated at the new depth, the signature is processed with the mine model, and the new actuation contour is added to the actuation surface. This process is repeated until a water depth is reached where actuation does not occur. At this point, all extrapolated signatures are in memory and any profile from any depth can be displayed in the program display . The actuation surface is also complete at this point, so the actuation curve and any contour at any depth in the actuation surface can be displayed.","Particularly with reference to  through , the inventive program associates the three-dimensional signature array  information with the mine model  information indicative of the magnetic actuation locations of a particular mine. Each two-dimensional signature array  has a mathematical array of signature values, each location  having its own corresponding signature value. The magnetic signature array  is processed using the mine model  to determine actuation surface . The inventive program permits an association between these two groups of information in terms of a causal relationship between magnetic signature indicia and mine actuation. Magnetic signature array  and mine model  are inventively cohered so that, at any given location in the region of interest, a threshold determination is made of whether or not a particular mine model  mine is actuated. Regardless of the nature of mine model  in terms its mine actuation processing, the present invention can utilize mine model  so as to process the magnetic signature  information and thereby determine mine actuation locations.","In the world of mine warfare, there are many types of mines having diverse actuation \u201cthought processes.\u201d Mine actuation processing varies both in principle and complexity. Each mine's mine model  reflect that mine's actuation processing characteristics. For instance, let us take a relatively simple case wherein the actuation of a mine depends only on the rate-of-change (e.g., peak rate-of-change) of the magnetic field; that is, rate-of-change is the only factor (influence parameter) characterizing the mine's actuation processing. Then, the inventive association of mine model  with 3-D signature array  (which is the combination of individual 2-D signature arrays  wherein each location  has its own corresponding magnetic field\/signature value) involves a less complicated determination of magnetic field rate-of-change at each location; in other words, according to the mine model , magnetic field rate-of-change is the only condition that needs to be satisfied in order to result in mine actuation. In this example, at each location , mine  is characterized by a minimum (threshold) magnetic field value above which (or at or above which) such mine  is actuated. Each location  is related with mine model  in terms of the mine's threshold magnetic field value so as to manifest whether or not this threshold magnetic field value is reached, and hence mine  actuates, at such location .","As another example, let us take a more complicated case wherein a mine's actuation depends on plural influence parameters, among which is the ship's magnetic field\/signature (e.g., rate-of-change); another influence parameter can be, e.g., the ship's acoustic signature. Since there are plural conditions (each condition pertaining to an influence parameter) precedent to mine actuation, the present invention's processing (whereby mine model  is used to process 3-D signature array  to determine mine actuation locations) must take every such condition into account; hence, for any given location, the inventive processing's determination of mine actuation-versus-non-actuation examines all such conditions and decides whether the magnetic signature information corresponding to such location results in mine actuation. The magnetic signature phenomenon\/phenomena will not result in mine actuation unless every other influence parameter condition is satisfied.","Inventive practice can involve any among diverse magnetic and non-magnetic influence parameters. Examples of non-magnetic influence parameters are those involving sound and pressure. Examples of magnetic (magnetic signature\/field) influence parameters, any one or more of which can be that influence parameter (or among those influence parameters) which is (are) pertinent to inventive practice, include the following: magnetic field (e.g., peak magnetic field); rate-of-change (e.g., peak rate-of-change) of the magnetic field (e.g., in a segment of the magnetic field); root mean square of the magnetic field; distance of the magnetic field from a desired goal magnetic field. Terms such as \u201cmagnetic field value\u201d and \u201cmagnetic signature value\u201d are used interchangeably herein, and broadly refer to any physical parameter or parameters that relate to magnetic field or magnetic signature, including but not limited to those mentioned hereinabove. Rate-of-change (e.g., peak rate-of-change) will be an influence parameter for many inventive embodiments.","Upon association of each of the 2-D magnetic field arrays  (shown in ) with the pertinent magnetic field\/signature parameter of a given mine , 2-D magnetic field arrays  (shown in ) become 2-D mine actuation arrays  (shown in ). That is, upon association of 3-D magnetic field array  (shown in ) with the pertinent magnetic field\/signature parameter of a given mine , 3-D magnetic field array  (which is a collection of 2-D magnetic field arrays , as shown in ) becomes 3-D mine actuation array  (which is a collection of 2-D mine actuation arrays , as shown in ). Thus, 2-D magnetic field arrays , , , , , , , . . . become 2-D mine actuation arrays , , , , , , , . . . respectively.","This correlation of the mine  actuation value(s) with 3-D magnetic field array , thereby forming 3-D mine actuation array , is best visualized conceptually in , wherein multiple circles each represent a particular \u201cuncorrelated\u201d location  in a particular 2-D magnetic field array . Mine model  is inventively utilized so as to process the magnetic signature  information and determine, based on the mine's design, where such mine is actuated (e.g., explodes). Each uncorrelated location  is related with mine  in terms of the mine's actuation criterion at such location  so as to manifest whether or not this actuation criterion is met (and hence mine  actuates) at such location . The graphical representation is thus informative in an exclusively disjunctive demarcating fashion, wherein each location manifests either a mine actuation condition or a mine non-actuation condition. Cumulative manifestations, at some or all locations, of this either\/or condition can be represented visually using delineation and\/or contrasting shading and\/or contrasting coloring on the display screen of a computer display .","When a given uncorrelated location  (shown as an empty circle, or circular outline) of 2-D signature array  is correlated with mine  actuation information, that location  becomes either actuated location (shown as a solid black circle) or non-actuated location (shown as a solid gray circle). Therefore, a given 2-D mine actuation array  describes \u201cactuation-versus-non-actuation\u201d of a mine , as 2-D mine actuation array  can include: (i) all actuated locations and no non-actuated locations , as shown in 2-D mine actuation array ; or, (ii) all non-actuated locations and no actuated locations , as shown in 2-D mine actuation array ; or, (iii) some (one or more) actuated locations and some (one or more) non-actuated locations , as shown in 2-D mine actuation array .","Each 2-D mine actuation array  is characterized by a two-dimensional pattern of actuated locations and\/or non-actuated locations . The combination of these individual two-dimensional array actuation-versus-non-actuation patterns yields a three-dimensional \u201cactuation surface\u201d  which bounds the three-dimensional \u201cactuation region\u201d  of three-dimensional space. Actuation region  represents the sum of all locations, relative to ship , at which mine  will be actuated. Actuation surface  represents the outer boundary of this actuation region .","The graphical representation shown in  is one of many ways in which, according to the present invention, information indicative of actuation surface  (or actuation region ) can be displayed for human visualization or comprehension. As elaborated upon hereinbelow with reference to  through , the three-dimensional actuation surface  (or actuation region ) can be displayed as a crosswise \u201cslice\u201d in any of multifarious orientations, such as that which is described by the following: (i) existing in a vertical geometric plane oriented longitudinally through the ship  at any of various selected locations (e.g., through the centerline) from bow to stern (in a manner akin to that which is shown in ); (ii) existing in a vertical geometric plane oriented transversely through the ship  at any of various selected locations (e.g., through the midline) from port to starboard (in a manner akin to that which is shown in ); or, (iii) existing in a horizontal geometric plane oriented at any of various selected water depths below the ship  (in a manner akin to that which is shown in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["14","40","42","44","40","42","42","14","16","16","18","18","20","200","20","200","22","24","240","44","20","200","22"]},"Computer system  can be located onboard ship  and\/or offboard\/ashore, e.g., at a magnetic silencing facility .

Depending on the inventive embodiment, the decimation step can be performed or skipped by processor ; if such decimation is omitted, processor  extrapolates 2-D signature array  directly into plural extrapolated 2-D signature arrays  at various water depths (which together constitute 3-D extrapolated signature array ). In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, the computer system  operations can be performed for any number of mine models  corresponding to a diversity of mine types.","Now with reference to  through , in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program, a display  includes a window .

During correlational (associative between signature  and mine ) processing, the onset-of-actuation curve \u2032 is displayed as a thick line. Once extrapolation and correlational processing have reached a water depth at which the mine  does not actuate, correlational processing stops and the onset-of-actuation curve \u2032 is indicated in the curve display  by a filled closed planar geometric figure (e.g., a filled polygon), such as shown in . The actuation curve \u2033 for the selected magnetic signature component (vertical, longitudinal, or athwartship) is obscured in  but is more clearly displayed in  as a thin black line.","The actuation contour  shown in  and the actuation curve  shown in  are but two examples of how mine actuation can be visualized in accordance with the present invention. The actuation contour  represents a horizontal longitudinal slice of an actuation surface, whereas the actuation curve  represents a transverse vertical slice of an actuation surface. According to inventive practice, the actuation surface \u201cslice\u201d (segment) can be oriented any which way. Actuation contour  and actuation curve  are two preferred orientation modes for rendering humanly comprehensible visuals. Another orientation mode which may be preferable in inventive practice for purposes of showing mine actuation is a longitudinal vertical slice, analogous to that which is depicted in the magnetic signature profile display shown in ; it is readily envisioned that a like graph can represent a longitudinal vertical slice of an actuation surface rather than a longitudinal vertical slice of a magnetic signature.","Similarly as may be performed for magnetic profile display  and actuation contour , the practitioner can: click on actuation curve display  and thereby zooms it to fill window  (such as shown in ); resize actuation curve display  as desired; clicking on the zoomed curve display  (shown in ) to return to the overview display (shown in ).","Prior to processing, the longitudinal spacing of the magnetic signature profile data samples can be changed. This is done from the \u201cSignature\u201d menu, in the longitudinal spacing pop-up menu . The initial spacing of the data varies with ship speed and range sampling rate. It is typically less than one foot between data samples in the longitudinal direction. The athwartship spacing depends on sensor spacing, which is twenty feet between sensors at the magnetic silencing facilities.","It is not necessary, albeit often preferable, to decimate range signature  array so as to become decimated signature array . In other words, according to some inventive embodiments, the decimation step can be omitted, and the extrapolated signatures  can be taken directly from the range signature . Nevertheless, in order to speed up the extrapolation process, the original range signature  data can be decimated by up to eighty-foot spacing between samples. This provides a very quick overview of onset of actuation, but may not be accurate.","For accurate processing, the data needs to be sampled at a rate which provides a good indication of local peak fields and signature shape. Depending upon the complexity of the ranged magnetic signature, this rate will vary, but can be quickly determined by trying different spacing and observing signature profile degradation. For accurate extrapolation, the longitudinal spacing should be no more than twenty feet. The selected spacing is printed in the run information display  quadrant of the overview display shown in .","The depth increment at which extrapolation and correlational mine processing occurs can be changed by selecting the water depth increment pop-up menu from the mines menu. According to this inventive embodiment, water depth increments from five (5) to twenty (20) feet can be selected. A depth increment of twenty feet will result in quicker completion of processing, but the five-foot increment will yield a more detailed actuation curve , with more actuation contours .","Ship speed can be changed by selecting the \u201cSpeed\u201d pop-up menu from the \u201cMines\u201d menu. According to this inventive embodiment, speeds of five to fifteen knots can be selected. The default speed is the speed at which the ship  was ranged at the magnetic silencing facility .","Vulnerability computation according to the present invention begins when a mine model  is selected from the \u201cMines\u201d menu. \u201cVersion 1.0\u201d of the present invention's \u201cDegaussing Vulnerability Display Program\u201d includes two mine models , viz., \u201cFM1\u201d and \u201cFM2.\u201d The sensitivity of both mines is set to maximum. When a mine  is selected for the first time after opening a binary range file, the magnetic signature is extrapolated to twenty (20) feet below the range depth. The extrapolated magnetic signature  is then processed by the selected mine model , and the resulting actuation contour  is displayed, along with the actuation curve , which are each complete only to the extrapolated water depth.","Once mine processing is complete, the water depth is incremented, the magnetic signature is extrapolated to the new depth and processed with the selected mine model , and the new actuation contour  and actuation curve  are displayed. Processing continues in this fashion until a water depth is reached where mine  actuation no longer occurs. After this point is reached, all of the extrapolated signatures and actuation contours are in computer memory and can be reviewed by using the mouse to drag the water depth slider  (located above the actuation contour display ) to display the actuation contour  and magnetic signature profile  at the desired water depth.","During extrapolation and mine processing, a progress box (not shown) appears above the actuation curve display , indicating which stage of processing (e.g., the extrapolation stage versus the mine processing stage) the inventive program is in. A stop button is located within the progress box, to enable processing to be interrupted. The display window  cannot be closed, and the program cannot be exited, while processing is occurring.","The present invention's degaussing vulnerability display window  (whether overview display , magnetic profile display , actuation contour display or actuation curve display ) can be print-previewed and printed out in either portrait or landscape mode, using the \u201cPage Setup,\u201d \u201cPrint Preview,\u201d and \u201cPrint\u201d entries in the \u201cFile\u201d menu. After processing is complete, the Degaussing Vulnerability Display program contains a set of extrapolated signatures, and an actuation surface for each mine model that has been selected. All of this data can be saved in a \u201cVulnerability\u201d file, with a \u201c.dvd\u201d extension, using the \u201cSave As\u201d entry in the \u201cFile\u201d menu. Once saved, vulnerability files can be re-opened for performing additional vulnerability studies at different ship speeds. These follow-on studies will be much quicker than the original processing, as the magnetic signature will not need to be extrapolated again.","The present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program was written by the inventor in the Microsoft\u00ae Visual C++\u00ae programming language, using the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) and a set of degaussing classes. The MFC are a set of C++ classes which provide an application framework for windows programming in the Windows NT\u00ae and Windows 95\u00ae operating systems. The degaussing classes are encapsulations of data and algorithms which are commonly used in degaussing software programming.","Reference is now made to APPENDIX A, APPENDIX B, APPENDIX C and APPENDIX D. The computer code set forth in the appendices herein, representative of the present invention's software (written in C++), is characterized by a \u201cdocument-view\u201d architecture. That is, part of the inventive code handles the data that is involved, e.g., program initialization and data management; this part includes the \u201cdocument code\u201d and represents the \u201cdocument\u201d aspect of the inventive code. The other part of the inventive code handles the user interface; this part includes the \u201cview code\u201d and represents the \u201cview\u201d aspect of the inventive code. The inventive code is presented herein in the appendices in four sections, viz.: APPENDIX A, containing the header file for the document code; APPENDIX B, containing the document code file; APPENDIX C, containing the header file for the view code; and, APPENDIX D, containing the view code file.","The degaussing classes used in the design and implementation of the present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program include range data, signature, mine, actuation surface and display classes. The range data class opens a range data file, allocates enough computer memory to hold the data, and reads the data from disk into memory. The signature class holds a triaxial, uniformly sampled magnetic signature comprising multiple longitudinal profiles, and provides methods for decimating and extrapolating the signature, locating the keel profile, and compiling signature statistics. The mine classes encapsulate mathematical mine models which receive uniformly sampled data as input and output mine look and fire signals. The actuation surface class holds mine actuation location information for multiple depths. Finally, the display class encapsulates the data and algorithms necessary to draw the magnetic signature profiles, actuation contours and actuation curves, which are needed or desired for degaussing vulnerability display.","Mathematically, the extrapolation technique used in the inventive computer code embodiment set forth hereinabove, a generally preferred extrapolation technique for practice of the present invention's degaussing vulnerability display program, is known as \u201cthe solution of the Dirichlet problem for the plane.\u201d This extrapolation technique allows calculation of the three components of the magnetic field of a ship (vertical, longitudinal and athwartship), when the vertical magnetic field has been measured by a magnetic range located between the ship and the calculation depth. This extrapolation technique is accurate at or below a distance equal to the largest spacing used in the data measurement grid. Since the magnetic range sensors are separated by twenty feet, the first extrapolation depth is always twenty feet below the range depth.","Onset of actuation for a particular mine is determined by applying all of the ship magnetic signature profiles to the selected mine model and noting where actuation occurs. The onset-of-actuation contour for a particular depth is determined by forming the union of the actuation contours at that depth, for the vertical, longitudinal and athwartship components of the magnetic signature at that depth. The onset-of-actuation curve is determined by forming the union of the actuation curves for the vertical, longitudinal and athwartship components of the magnetic signature.","Generally, a magnetic mine is a device having a magnetic detection component. Although inventive practice will typically involve magnetic mines, the present invention can be practiced in association with any magnetically responsive (e.g., magnetically actuated or magnetically activated or magnetically sensitive) system or devices, such as magnetic mines and magnetic detectors. Moreover, although inventive practice will more typically be concerned with vulnerability assessment of ships and other surface naval vessels, the present invention can be practiced whether the vehicle in question is a marine vehicle or land vehicle. Furthermore, it is not necessary, according to inventive practice, that the spatial region examined for vulnerability assessment lie entirely or mainly below the vehicle. For instance, a submarine may require vulnerability assessment with regard to magnetic devices located below, beside and\/or above the submarine. In the light of the instant disclosure, the ordinarily skilled artisan will be capable of practicing the present invention with regard to diverse vehicles as well as diverse magnetic systems and devices.","Other embodiments of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein. Various omissions, modifications and changes to the principles described herein may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the true scope and spirit of the invention which is indicated by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In order that the present invention may be clearly understood, it will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like numbers indicate the same or similar components, and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 6","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
