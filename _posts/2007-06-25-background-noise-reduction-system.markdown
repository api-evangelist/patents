Technical Field","This disclosure relates to noise reduction. In particular, this disclosure relates to reduction of background noise in a hands-free vehicle communication system.","3. Related Art","The voice quality of vehicle communication systems, such as wireless telephone systems, may be degraded by background noise. Spectral subtraction circuits have been used to reduce noise, but are limited to processing stationary noise perturbations and positive signal-to-noise distances.","Microphone arrays and fixed beamforming techniques have also been used to improve the quality of transmitted speech. However, use of multiple microphones or microphone arrays may be limited by spatial restrictions and cost considerations. To reduce broadband noise, a reference signal should be detected close to the source of the primary signal. However, additional reference microphones placed near the primary signal source necessarily detect portions of the desired speech signal, causing distortion and damping of the audio speech signal.","Existing hands-free communication systems in vehicle environments do not provide adequate background noise reduction. Therefore, a need exists for a background noise reduction system that reduces background noise in a vehicle environment.","A noise reduction system includes a microphone that detects an acoustic signal. A first digitizer converts an output of the microphone into a discrete output signal. An acoustic sensor detects structure-borne noise, and a second digitizer converts an output of the acoustic sensor into a discrete acoustic noise reference signal. A noise compensation circuit processes the discrete output signal based on the discrete acoustic noise reference signal to generate a noise compensated digital audio signal.","Other systems, methods, features and advantages will be, or will become, apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the following claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","114","116","114","120","124","116","130","110","100","114","114","134","116","140"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["204","204","206","114","210","220","224","116","230"]},"A noise compensation filter circuit  may receive the digitized microphone output signal  and the digitized structure-borne noise reference signal . The noise compensation filter circuit  may include a linear finite impulse response filter (FIR) . Alternatively, the noise compensation filter circuit  may include an infinite impulse response filter (IIR). An infinite impulse response filter may be recursive and may have a shorter length (number of taps) than a finite impulse response filter.","Filter coefficients corresponding to the noise compensation filter circuit  may be adapted using a normalized least mean square (NLMS) process. The coefficients may be calculated by processes described in a publication entitled \u201cAcoustic Echo and Noise Control,\u201d by H\u00e4nsler and G. Schmidt.
