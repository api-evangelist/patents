No. 10\/434,337, filed May 9, 2003 U.S. Pat. No. 6,762,954, and entitled \u201cLocal Probe of Magnetic Properties,\u201d the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and\/or licensed by or for the United States Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention generally relates to magnetic sensor methods and systems, and more particularly to probing devices associated with magnetic sensors and spin-dependent tunneling (SDT) sensors.","2. Description of the Related Art","Magnetic films are used in a variety of devices that include magnetic random access memories MRAM and magnetic recording media. In the magnetic recording industry, information is generally stored as magnetic bits on thin ferromagnetic films. In reading such magnetic bits, the magnetic recording industry requires detection devices that measure the magnetization of small regions along a magnetic track. Computer storage devices, such as, for example, magnetic disk drives, utilize read\/write heads to store and retrieve data. A write head stores data by utilizing magnetic flux to set the magnetic moment of a particular area on a magnetic media. The state of the magnetic moment is later read by a read head, which senses the magnetic fields.","Presently, quality read heads utilize giant magnetoresistance (GMR) read heads, which are spin valves or similar to spin valves. Such GMR thin-film read heads employ magnetoresistive material, generally formed in a layered structure of ferromagnetic magnetoresistive and non-ferromagnetic non-magnetoresistive materials, to detect the magnetic moments of the data bits on the media. A sensing current is passed through the magnetoresistive material to detect changes in the resistance of the material induced by the data bits as they pass the read head. Spin valves are usually formed as three layer structures including a hard or pinned ferromagnet, a soft ferromagnet, and a thin intervening conductor. Another device for measuring local magnetizations is a magnetic force microscope. Magnetic force microscopes are scanning tunneling microscopes with ferromagnetic tips.","The magnetoresistivity of GMR devices depends on the ease with which electrons can make transitions between the soft and hard ferromagnetic materials. Electrons traveling along the layers without making this transition do not contribute to the magnetoresistance. Thus, the layers in a GMR device must be thin in order for a signal generated by a field change not to be too small. Another type of magnetic sensor is a spin dependent tunneling SDT sensor. An SDT sensor consists of a hard ferromagnetic layer, a soft ferromagnetic layer, and a thin insulating intervening layer. The tunneling impedance between the two ferromagnets is less when the magnetizations of the two ferromagnets are parallel. An example of a GMR sensor is the GMR sensor disclosed in the above-mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/434,337. Recent magnetic modeling calculations with a single thin layer, have achieved less than optimum results because if the sense layer is very thin, it will not affect the magnetic field flux lines. The ratio of the field in the sense material when it was over a soft magnetic material to the field to when it was not over the soft magnetic material was found to be approximately only 1.14. This small field change makes it difficult to read magnetic information.","Other conventional methods for measuring local magnetization such as magnetic force microscopes and electron microscopes with magnetic electrodes that analyze the spin direction of tunneling electrons can be cumbersome, inefficient, and expensive.","Therefore, while the above-referenced U.S. patent application discloses embodiments that were satisfactory for the purposes for which they were intended, there remains a need for improved systems and methods for probing the magnetic properties of materials. In particular, a need exists for improved methods and systems for measuring the extent to which a local surface region of a material can be magnetized. Conventional magnetic sensing systems and methods are limited because most other magnetic probes do not measure how easily a material may be magnetized. Furthermore, most other conventional devices do not readily permit varying the length over which the material's magnetic properties are being probed. Thus, there is a need to overcome the limitations of the conventional systems and methods and to effectively probe the magnetic properties of a particular material.","In view of the foregoing, an embodiment of the invention provides an apparatus, system, and method for probing the magnetic permeability of a material comprising a sensor unit that comprises a plurality of magnetic layers thereof, including a first soft ferromagnetic layer, a second soft ferromagnetic layer, a first hard ferromagnetic layer and a second hard ferromagnetic layer; an intermediate layer separating the first hard ferromagnetic layer from the first soft ferromagnetic layer; an insulating layer separating the first soft ferromagnetic layer from second soft ferromagnetic layer; and a spacer layer separating the second soft ferromagnetic layer from the second hard ferromagnetic layer, wherein the second soft ferromagnetic layer is dimensioned and configured to have a thickness greater than the first soft ferromagnetic layer, and wherein the sensor unit measures the magnetic permeability of a material located a distance from the sensor unit through the magnetic interaction of the magnetic layers of the sensor unit. The first ferromagnetic layer may be an effective hard ferromagnetic layer that is a bilayer comprising a ferromagnet and a pinning layer such as an antiferromagnet.","In one embodiment, the first soft ferromagnetic layer and the second soft ferromagnetic layer may comprise a same material. While in another embodiment, the materials may be different. Moreover, the second soft ferromagnetic layer increases an on\/off ratio of a magnetic field in the first soft ferromagnetic layer, wherein the on\/off ratio is approximately 1.6. Additionally, the second soft ferromagnetic layer pulls a magnetic field of the system into the first soft ferromagnetic layer. The intermediate layer comprises an insulator or a conductor. In one embodiment, the conduction between the first hard ferromagnetic layer and the first soft ferromagnetic layer occurs via tunneling. In this embodiment the layer, separating the first hard ferromagnetic layer and the first soft ferromagnetic layer is an insulator. In another embodiment, the conduction between the first hard ferromagnetic layer and the first soft ferromagnetic layer occurs via in-plane conduction. In this case, the layer separating the first hard ferromagnetic layer and the first soft ferromagnetic layer is a non-ferromagnetic conductor such as silver or copper.","Furthermore, the thickness of the second hard ferromagnetic layer is greater than the thicknesses of the intermediate layer, the first hard ferromagnetic layer, and the first soft ferromagnetic layer. Moreover, a magnetic interaction occurs between the second hard ferromagnetic layer and the second soft ferromagnetic layer, if the thickness of the spacer layer is comparable to the thicknesses of the second hard ferromagnetic layer and the second soft ferromagnetic layer. A change in magnetization of the first soft ferromagnetic results in a change in the impedance between the first hard ferromagnetic layer and the first soft ferromagnetic layer if the separating layer is an insulator. Alternatively, the change in magnetization of the first soft ferromagnetic layer and the second soft ferromagnetic layer results in a change in in-plane conduction thereof if the separating layer is a conductor. Also, the sensor unit is moveable in at least one direction proximate to the material for probing the magnetic permeability thereof, wherein a length L of the first hard ferromagnetic layer, the second hard ferromagnetic layer, the first soft ferromagnetic layer, the second soft ferromagnetic layer, the intermediate layer, the insulating layer, and the spacer layer is greater than the lateral dimension of the material to be investigated that is located the distance from the sensor unit, and wherein the length L is approximately 10 to 100 microns.","Several advantages are afforded by varying embodiments of the invention. The device described herein, including systems and methods thereof, can be adapted to probe the magnetic permeability of magnetic surface layers that include magnetic recording media. The length over which one probes the material utilizing the sensor unit described herein can be varied. Moreover, adding a bridging ferromagnetic layer can increase the sensitivity of the device.","Because the device described herein can be implemented as a miniature magnetic sensor a number of applications are available for sensing the local magnetic permeability in a variety of materials, wherein the invention lends itself to a variety of uses including industrial, biomedical, oceanographic, environmental, military, and space related applications, to name a few. For example, the local probe of magnetic properties provided by the invention can be used to read non-erasable magnetic media on credit cards, ID tags, etc. The trend in magnetic sensor design and development is constantly evolving toward smaller size, lower power consumption and lower cost for similar performance. Thus, the device described herein, including systems and methods thereof, is ideally suited for use with magnetic sensing applications, including MEMS-type components. Essentially, the invention allows a more practical use of GMR and SDT sensors in a local probe of magnetic properties.","These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following description, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention and numerous specific details thereof, is given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the invention without departing from the spirit thereof, and the invention includes all such modifications.","The invention and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the invention may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.","As previously mentioned, there is a need for improvements to the conventional devices for probing the magnetic properties of a particular material. The invention achieves this by changing the electrical impedance in the sense layer of a magnetic sensor unit. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention. In the above-referenced parent application, the sense layer comprises a single layer of a soft ferromagnetic material. According to the novel design of the invention the single layer is replaced by two layers separated by a thin insulating layer. Replacing the single soft ferromagnetic layer with a double layer, one thin soft ferromagnetic layer and another thicker soft ferromagnetic layer assists in pulling the magnetic flux lines to the thin soft ferromagnetic layer. Doing this increases the on\/off ratio of the magnetic field in the thin sense strip to a much higher value of approximately 1.6.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","104","109","100","101","100","100"]},"As indicated in , sensor unit  can be located a distance D from a material  being probed by the sensor unit .
