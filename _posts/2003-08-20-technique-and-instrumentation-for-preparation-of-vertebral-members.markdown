title: Technique and instrumentation for preparation of vertebral members
abstract: Instrumentation and techniques for preparing vertebral members for insertion of an implant. Foundation instruments provide a reference relative to the vertebral members. The foundation devices guide the placement of one or more instruments that prepare the vertebral members. The instruments operatively align with the foundation instruments in a specific orientation to ensure proper placement relative to the vertebral members. Preparatory instruments may be used to further remove bone from the vertebral members. The preparatory instruments may be used prior to or after the other instruments. An insert is inserted and mounted to the vertebral members after the bone has been removed. A holder may be used for holding and placing the implant relative to the vertebral members.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Current surgical procedures often require a great deal of skill from the surgeon. The procedures may include making fine manipulations by hand using high-speed equipment. One example includes preparing opposing surfaces of vertebral members for receiving an intermediate device, such as preparing the end plates of adjacent vertebrae to receive a graft or interbody fusion device. Each of the end plates is contoured and shaped using a cutting instrument that is held and manipulated by the surgeon. The surgeon guides the cutting instrument by hand and relies upon experience and training to ensure the end plates are contoured correctly.","It may be difficult for the surgeon to determine the amount of contouring and shaping required for each of the vertebral members. A trial-and-error routine is performed as the surgeon removes a first amount of material from one or both surfaces and determines whether the spacing is adequate for receiving the intermediate device. If the spacing is not adequate, the surgeon removes an additional amount from one or both of the surfaces. This routine continues until the proper amount has been removed and the surfaces are adequately prepared. The surgeon is careful not to remove too much from either surface, and instead tends to remove small increments.","The present invention is directed to devices and method of preparing vertebral members and for mounting an implant. The invention includes one or more foundation devices that are aligned relative to the vertebral members. The foundation device forms a reference relative to the vertebral members which are used for subsequent bone removal steps. A physician aligns one or more instruments relative to the reference and removes bone from the vertebral members. The alignment of the instruments with the reference ensures the proper amount and location of bone is removed. Preparatory instruments may be used to further remove bone from the vertebral members. The preparatory instruments may be used prior to or after the other instruments. An insert is inserted and mounted to the vertebral members after the bone has been removed. A holder may be used for holding and placing the implant relative to the vertebral members.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","300","200","100","300","100","100","200","300","600","200","100","300","600","400","600","400","600","300","400","500","300","600","500","300","100","500"]},"One preparatory instrument  is a template trial .

One foundation device  includes a docking ring  as illustrated in . Docking ring  comprises a body  forming a window . In one embodiment, window  has a substantially rectangular shape. A plurality of spikes  extend outward from a distal side of the body  to mount the docking ring  relative to the vertebral members . In one embodiment, spikes  are ground with a point of the spike toward the median of the docking ring  with an angled portion on the outside. This configuration provides for the spikes  to engage the vertebral members  more readily during insertion than if the spikes  were ground from the opposite direction which could result in splaying of the spikes . In one embodiment, a total of four spikes  extend outward and the docking ring  is placed with two spikes  in the first vertebral member , two spikes  in the second vertebral member , and the window  positioned to extend over the endplates and disc space  of the vertebral members .","A pair of channels  are positioned on opposing sides of the docking ring .

In one embodiment, grooved sections  extend between a distal end of the channels  and the distal side of the body . In one embodiment, grooved sections  result in the body  having a narrower width at the channels . In one embodiment, grooved sections  are cut-away from the interior of the body . Grooved sections  may have a variety of depths and widths depending on the application.

In one embodiment, indents  are centered along the length of the head . Indents may have a variety of widths and depths.","Wings  extend from the head  and have a size corresponding to the grooved sections  of the docking ring . In one embodiment, wings  are positioned at a lateral end of the head  and extend outward from opposite sides. Tabs  extend outward from the wings  and may have a variety of shapes and sizes. In one embodiment, tabs  are positioned at the distant ends of the wings  and have a width greater than the width of the wings . In one embodiment, tabs  are sized to extend into the channels  and wings  sized to fit within the grooved sections .","A shaft  is connected to the head  and includes a locking mechanism  for locking the interbody trial  to the docking ring . In one embodiment, pivot  extends through the tab . The shaft  is adjustable between an unlocked orientation in which the shaft  pivots relative to the head , and a locked position in which the shaft  is fixed relative to the head . An extension  extends outward from the shaft  at a point distal to the pivot . Shaft  may have a variety of lengths and shapes.

The depth is adjusted such that the proximal end of the stylus  is about flush with the head . In one embodiment, head  includes a cut-out section in which the stylus  is positioned. The gauge  is removed once the docking ring\/trial has been impacted into the vertebral members .","Once the docking ring\/trial has been mounted to the vertebral members , the interbody trial  may be detached from the docking ring , and reattached as needed. In one embodiment, detaching the interbody trial  includes unlocking the locking mechanism , pivoting the shaft  relative to the head , removing the interbody trial extension  from the docking ring slot , and lifting the interbody trial away from the docking ring . Reattaching the interbody trial  is accomplished in the reverse manner.","In one embodiment, it is necessary to remove the anterior surface of the vertebral members  so the implant  is positioned securely on the bone. However, not too much bone on the anterior surface should be removed because the more bone that is removed on the anterior surface, the closer the posterior end of the implant will be positioned to the spinal cord. In smaller patients, this is more critical since this distance is smaller. A planing guide  controls the gardening depths and areas of the vertebral members . One embodiment is illustrated in  and includes a plurality of apertures  formed by a flange  and extensions . The flange  is positioned around a portion or the entire periphery of the planing guide , and the extensions  extend outward a distance above the flange .","In one embodiment, the planing guide  includes inverting offset first and second sides.

The body depth y controls the depth that the bone is removed posteriorly from the vertebral members .","A saw blade  removes bone from the vertebral members . One embodiment of the saw blade is illustrated in  and includes a pair of arms  separated by a predetermined distance. The arms  are separated to straddle the saw guide  with a first arm on a first side of the body  and a second arm on the second side of the body . Cutting surfaces  are positioned at the distal ends of each arm for simultaneously cutting the first and second vertebral members . In one embodiment, cutting surfaces  are parallel to cut the vertebral members  in a parallel manner to receive the implant . In one embodiment, a pin  extends between slots  within each arm . Pin  serves as a depth gauge and contacts the proximal edge of the saw guide body  up full insertion. In another embodiment, a forked section  between the arms  acts as a depth gauge. In one embodiment, the distance between the cutting edge and the depth gauge (either the pin  or forked section) is equal to the height y plus the length of the fingers  to control the maximum depth of cutting and prevent cutting into the spinal cord.
