{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and more particularly, to reducing distortion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images of a recipient caused by the presence of a implantable medical device in the recipient.","2. Related Art","Various implants can be implanted into a recipient to provide a medical benefit. Such implants may range from, on the one hand, passive devices such as screws that are utilized to adhere bones together to, on the other hand, active implants, such as, for example, hearing prostheses such as cochlear implants that perform an active function such as stimulating the cochlea of a recipient to enhance hearing. Other exemplary active devices include devices for regulating hormones or regulating cardiac activity.","A range of active implantable medical devices apply electrical energy to tissue of a recipient to stimulate that tissue. Examples of such implants include pacemakers, auditory brain stem implants (ABI), functional electrical stimulators and cochlear implants. Other implantable medical devices perform other functions such as monitoring various functions of the recipient's body such as glucose level, and others can be used to administer drugs internally.","A cochlear implant allows for electrical stimulating signals to be applied to the auditory nerve of a recipient, causing the brain to perceive a hearing sensation approximating the natural hearing sensation, thereby enhancing hearing. These stimulating signals may be applied by an array of electrodes implanted into the recipient's cochlea.","The electrode array is connected to a stimulator that generates the electrical signals for delivery to the electrode array. The stimulator in turn is operationally connected to a sound processor (which may be implanted in the recipient, or which may be located externally to the recipient, communication with the stimulator being via a transcutaneous inductance link) which is in signal communication with a microphone. The microphone receives audio signals from the environment. The sound processor processes these signals to generate control signals for the stimulator.","It is not uncommon for a recipient of an implantable medical device to undergo subsequent medical treatment or investigations related to the implantable medical device or the recipient's condition. Certain post-operative investigations utilize Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).","MRI relies on the application of a strong magnetic field to a recipient's body to generate images of tissue and bone structure. The magnetic field aligns protons (hydrogen atoms) within the recipient's body. These atoms are then be excited into resonance by an applied RF field. When the RF field is removed, the atoms release energy as they exit their excited state. This release of energy is detected by a receiver and utilized to create an MRI image.","The presence of materials within the applied magnetic field which have a magnetic property may distort the magnetic field, causing artifacts in the resulting MRI image. Such artifacts may obscure features, resulting in misdiagnosis of the patients' conditions such as, for example, tumors, that are not able to be resolved in the image due to the distortion.","For example, a cochlear implant may contain a transformer which includes a small quantity of ferromagnetic material. Other materials such as the housing and\/or the electronics of the stimulator\/receiver of the cochlear implant have an adverse effect.","The human body has a magnetic permeability similar to that of water. Implantable medical devices such as cochlear implants typically have components with permeability different to that of water (e.g., transformer cores, housings, etc.). In the past, designers of implantable medical devices have attempted to address this problem by designing the medical device implant with a minimum of ferromagnetic materials. Alternatively, designers utilized additional components made from materials having low magnetic permeability to counterbalance components made from materials having high magnetic permeability. Some designs rely upon devices having ferromagnetic components that are removable through a minor medical procedure prior to undergoing an MRI scan.","According to one aspect of the present invention, there is a method for generating a new set of MRI images of a region of a recipient in which an implanted medical device having magnetic properties is located. The method comprises scanning a plurality of scan slices of the recipient with an MRI machine set at a first fat shift direction resulting in a first set of MRI images including a plurality of MRI images respectively corresponding to the plurality of scan slices, wherein the first set of MRI images comprises at least one MRI image having an artifact resulting from the implanted medical device, rescanning at least some of the plurality of scan slices with the MRI machine set at a second fat shift direction different than the first fat shift direction resulting in a second set of MRI images including at least one MRI image having an artifact resulting from the implanted medical device, comparing a respective artifact of an MRI image corresponding to a first scan slice of the recipient of one of the first set of MRI images and the second set of MRI images to a respective artifact of an MRI image corresponding to the first scan slice of the recipient of the other of the first set of MRI images and the second set of MRI images, and selecting one of the compared MRI images based on the distortion to the respective MRI image created by the respective artifact.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is a method of obtaining a new MRI image of a recipient of an implantable medical device, the method comprises generating a first MRI image by scanning a first scan slice of the recipient with an MRI machine set at a first fat shift direction, generating a second MRI image by repeating the scan of the first scan slice with the MRI machine set at a second fat shift direction, approximately opposite to the first fat shift direction, and generating a new MRI image based on the first MRI image and the second MRI image.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is a method for generating a set of MRI images of a region of a recipient in which an implanted medical device having magnetic properties is located, the method comprises obtaining a first set of MRI images of the region of the recipient, the first set of MRI images comprising a plurality of MRI images obtained by MRI scanning a first plurality of scan slices of the recipient using a first fat shift direction, wherein at least one MRI image of the first set of MRI images includes an artifact resulting from the implanted medical device, obtaining a second set of MRI images, the second set of MRI images comprising a plurality of MRI images obtained by MRI scanning a second plurality of scan slices of the recipient using a second fat shift direction approximately opposite to the first fat shift direction, wherein at least a first scan slice of the second plurality of respective scan slices is the same scan slice as a scan slice of the first plurality of respective scan slices, and generating a third set of MRI images by selecting a sub-set of MRI images from the first set of MRI images and a sub-set of MRI images from the second set of MRI images and combining the sub-sets, wherein the third set includes an MRI image corresponding to the first scan slice, and wherein the size of the artifact of an MRI image of the third set corresponding to the first scan slice is reduced as compared to the size of the artifact of the MRI image of the first set of the first scan slice or the size of the artifact of the MRI image of the second set of the first scan slice.","Some exemplary embodiments of the present invention include methods, apparatuses, systems and algorithms for reducing the above-discussed artifact in a set of MRI images. Exemplary methods include generating a first set of images using an MRI machine using a first fat shift direction. The scans are repeated for the same MRI slices of the recipient using a second fat shift direction, approximately opposite to the first fat shift direction. The first and second sets of MRI images will have the artifact displaced with respect to each other. A set of MRI images is then generated by replacing some of the images of the various sets with new images of the same respective MRI slice. In an exemplary embodiment, MRI images from the first and second sets are selected and then combined into a new set of MRI images such that the artifact appearing on the images is reduced.","Some exemplary embodiments of the present invention also include obtaining a new MRI image from a selection of one of two or more MRI images generated using approximately opposite fat shift directions, the new MRI image containing a reduced artifact.","The following abbreviations are used herein in the description of some embodiments of the present invention:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["T2W_FFE","T2 weighted _ fast field echo"]},{"entry":["T1W_SE","T1 weighted _ spin echo"]},{"entry":["PDW-TSE","Proton density weighted - turbo spin echo"]},{"entry":["T2W-TSE","T2 weighted - turbo spin echo"]},{"entry":["PDW_FLAIR","Proton density weighted _ fluid attenuation inversion"]},{"entry":[{},"recovery"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A","FIG. 1A"],"b":["400","401","50","50","50","401","430","420","440"]},"During operation of the MRI machine , magnetic field generator  and RF field generator  is controlled by control station .

This magnetic field B is generated by magnetic field generator  as described above.","In most volumes of tissue, the magnetic vector sum of all hydrogen nuclei (also referred to as the Net Magnetic Vector (NMV)) should be zero, as the spin vectors of all protons are randomly oriented. However, the application of magnetic field B causes magnetic moments of the protons in the hydrogen atoms of the recipient's tissue to align parallel (including anti-parallel) to the magnetic field B. As a result of a quantum phenomenon known as Zeeman interaction, there should be a slight excess of the protons' magnetic moments oriented parallel to the magnetic field B. This results in a macroscopic net magnetization, M, aligned parallel to B. Furthermore, due to interactions between B and the positively charged nucleus of the hydrogen atoms that are spinning, the protons within the magnetic field should precess about the direction of the magnetic field B.","A high amplitude radio frequency (RF) pulse is applied to the recipient  in a direction 90\u00b0 from B, in order to generate a magnetic resonance (MR) signal, at the same and\/or about the same frequency at which the hydrogen nuclei precess. In some embodiments, this causes the hydrogen nuclei to resonate with the applied RF signal. However, nuclei other than hydrogen may not resonate, as their gyromagnetic ratios are different.","In some embodiments of the present invention, two phenomena occur at resonance: energy absorption and phase coherence. With respect to energy absorption, the hydrogen nuclei absorb energy from the RF pulse, which alters the distribution of magnetic moments aligned parallel and anti-parallel to the magnetic field. This has the effect of rotating the NMV into a transverse plane. With respect to phase coherence, the RF pulse causes the magnetic moments of all or substantially all hydrogen nuclei to precess in phase\/about in phase with each other, which means the NMV precesses (now in the transverse plane).","As the NMV rotates in the transverse plane it induces a voltage signal in the receiver coil\/receiver , positioned close to the recipient . This phenomenon is referred to as free induction decay, and the detected voltage is the fundamental MR signal.","Many fine variations of parameters of the magnetic field B and RF signal are used to control the types of received signals to produce desired effects in the generated image, including controlling the depth of the image, the type of tissue targeted and the contrast between different tissue types.","The scans generated by the MRI machine  result in a set of images representing \u201cslices\u201d at different depths of a region of the recipient . In some embodiments of the present invention, the thickness of the slices are varied from, for example, about 1 mm or less to about 5 mm or more.

Specifically, such an implanted medical device may cause the signal received by receiver coil  during a scan to have a dramatic loss of signal vis-\u00e0-vis a corresponding received signal if the implanted medical device were absent. The resulting artifact in the images prevents that area from being properly imaged and can obscure diseased tissue, such as, for example, a tumor, thus resulting in that tumor (or other ailment) not being detected.","A number of characteristics of MRI imaging result in effects that can distort or otherwise change the results of an MRI image obtained from a scan. One of these characteristics is a chemical shift in general, and a fat shift in particular. In this regard, due to the different molecular environments of protons, the resonant frequency of protons in water and fat differ by approximately 3.5 ppm (220 Hz at 1.5 T). The detected signal from each voxel of a scan is mapped to a position based on its frequency, under the assumption that all protons contained within it resonate at the same frequency. The lower resonant frequency of fat protons causes such protons to be mapped to a lower frequency pixel during frequency encoding gradient direction. This misregistration may not be noticed in tissues with uniform fat-water content. However, the misregistration may produce artifacts at the borders of tissue with significantly different fat water content. Traditionally, various techniques and signal processing are applied in an attempt to minimize the effect of fat shift, hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cfat shift signal processing.\u201d","According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, rather than use the fat shift signal processing to minimize the effect of fat shift as is traditionally done, the fat shift signal processing is used to provide a set of MRI images that overall show a reduced artifact\/distortion caused by an implanted medical device. This fat shift signal processing also has an effect on the registration of image artifacts resulting from an implantable medical device. This can be used to obtain images with reduced artifact. For example, two sets of images are generated or otherwise obtained, wherein one set of MRI images is obtained via scans taken with the fat shift set in one direction, and the other set of MRI images is obtained via scans taken with the fat shift in an approximately opposite direction. Accordingly, some embodiments of the present invention utilize MRI machines where a technician\/operator may select the direction in which fat shift occurs (sometimes constrained by the direction of the frequency encoding gradient), allowing the appearance and orientation of the artifact to be controlled and\/or reduced (including eliminated) in the resulting set of MRI images as will be described in greater detail below.","We note that in the following description \u201cfat shift\u201d should be understood to mean the fat shift setting on the MRI machine which controls the fat shift processing performed by the machine.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A to 4G","FIGS. 4A-4C","FIGS. 3A-3E","FIGS. 4A to 4G","FIGS. 3A to 3E","FIGS. 4A to 4G"],"b":["4","4"]},"With respect to , it may be seen that  shows an MRI image taken with a scan at a region of the recipient's head identified as slice  and that  shows an MRI image taken with a scan at a region of the recipient's head identified as slice , slice  corresponding to a slice of the recipient's head a distance from slice .","Comparing  to  ( C showing an MRI image obtained at slice , except obtained with a scan using MRI machine parameters corresponding to Series 2 of the above charts, as detailed above), it may be seen that the artifact of  and the artifact of  is different.

This vibration is coupled to oval window or fenestra ovalis  through three bones of middle ear , collectively referred to as the ossicles  and comprising the malleus , the incus  and the stapes . Bones ,  and  of middle ear  serve to filter and amplify sound wave , causing oval window  to articulate, or vibrate in response to vibration of tympanic membrane . This vibration sets up waves of fluid motion of the perilymph within cochlea . Such fluid motion, in turn, activates tiny hair cells (not shown) inside of cochlea . Activation of the hair cells causes appropriate nerve impulses to be generated and transferred through the spiral ganglion cells (not shown) and auditory nerve  to the brain (also not shown) where they are perceived as sound.","Cochlear implant  comprises an external component  (which, in some embodiments, corresponds to external component  detailed above) which is directly or indirectly attached to the body of the recipient, and an internal component  (which, in some embodiments, corresponds to implantable device  detailed above) which is temporarily or permanently implanted in the recipient.
