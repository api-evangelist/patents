title: Realization of sleep and reconnecting functions on network system and the method
abstract: Realization of sleep and reconnecting functions is developed for network systems which comprise a number of end devices, network path sharing devices and coordinators. End devices and, even, network path sharing devices can be enforced to enter a sleep state at the first preset times and wake up at the second preset times. The two preset times are either assigned offline or adjustable at run time, according to the actual traffic load in the network. When a node wakes up, it checks whether the corresponding parent node is in the active state or not. If the corresponding parent node is not in the active state, the node will find a new parent node to establish a new transmission path.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["(a) Field of the Invention","The invention relates to a network system, particularly to a network system in which network path sharing devices tend to enter a sleep state for energy savings.","(b) Description of the Related Art","ZigBee is a specification for a suite of communication protocols using small, short-range, low-power devices based on an IEEE 802 standard for personal area networks. There are three different types of ZigBee devices\u2014coordinator, router, and end device. Only ZigBee end devices are allowed to enter the sleep state, whereas ZigBee coordinator and ZigBee routers are not able to enter the sleep state. When an end device is too far apart from the coordinator, data collected by the end device is passed back to the coordinator in a multi-hop manner, via a path formed by a number of network path sharing devices (i.e., routers).","However, in a ZigBee network, network path sharing devices, which are responsible for maintaining a network backbone, have no sleep mechanism built in and thus cannot enter a sleep state to save energy. Even worse, without additional mechanism(s), a network path sharing device in a sleep state, if it were allowed, would make the network disconnected. Considering network path sharing devices are the nodes at large load, their power consumption is high.","Network path sharing devices deployed at a location without power outlets are usually powered by batteries. High power consumption at a network path sharing device may easily result in battery depletion. When a network path sharing device has no remaining battery capacity, the network becomes disconnected and end devices become unable to communicate to the coordinator.","Therefore, one object of the invention is to provide a network system to enforce a network path sharing device to enter the sleep state.","One object of the invention is to provide a network system to decrease power consumption of a network path sharing device.","One object of the invention is to provide a network system to prolong lifetime of a wireless network.","One object of the invention is to provide a network system to maintain operation of a wireless network even if the parent node of the network path sharing device is not in an active state.","One embodiment of the invention provides a network sleep system, comprising a plurality of end devices, a plurality of network path sharing devices and a single or a plurality of coordinators. Network path sharing devices and end devices can enter the sleep state at the first preset times and wake up at the second preset times.","One embodiment of the invention provides a method of sleeping and reconnecting mechanism for network path sharing devices in a network system, comprising the following steps: determining whether itself is a network path sharing device or not; entering a sleep state at the first preset time and waking up at the second preset time; after waking up, determining whether its parent node is in an active state or not; and searching for a new parent node to establish a new transmission path, if the parent node is not in an active state.","Please refer to .  shows a schematic diagram illustrating a network system according to one embodiment of the invention. The network system  includes nine nodes N\u02dcN and a coordinator C. In this embodiment, the wireless network is a ZigBee wireless network. The number of nodes of the network system  is not limited to this number, that is, 9.","The coordinator C is responsible to establish a wireless network. The nodes N\u02dcN are network path sharing devices while the nodes N\u02dcN are end devices of a ZigBee network. In one embodiment, the end device can be a sensing unit to sense environmental data at which it is located. The network path sharing devices comprise the backbone of the ZigBee wireless network and have functions of passing data from or to the coordinator C. In this embodiment, the network path sharing device also has a sensing function and can sense the environmental data at which it is located. It should be noted that the devices corresponding to the nodes N\u02dcN can be adjusted according actual needs of users. The invention is not limited to the above example.","In one embodiment, the network path sharing device can be implemented by a router. The nodes N\u02dcN can be used to relay the environmental data sensed by the nodes N\u02dcN to the coordinator C. It should be noted that the end device can be, but not limited to, a sensing unit in this embodiment. The end device can be implemented by an electric power device, a video device and so forth.","For example, for the node N, the nodes N and N are the corresponding children nodes. In other words, the node N is the parent node of the nodes N and N. For the node N, the nodes N and N are the corresponding children nodes. In other words, the node N is the parent node of the nodes N and N. For the node N, the nodes N, N and N are candidates for the corresponding parent node.","It can be seen that the network system  comprises a plurality of children nodes and a plurality of parent nodes. For each node, it can be a children node of the other node(s) or a parent node of the other node(s), depending on the configuration of the whole wireless network but the invention is not limited to this example. In other words, a network path sharing device also can be a children node or a parent node.","Please refer to .  shows a block diagram illustrating the network system  according to one embodiment of the invention. The network path sharing device comprises a device object circuit , a network layer circuit , a medium access control layer circuit , and a physical layer circuit . The physical layer circuit  is used to transmit and receive packets.","The main control program of the invention is written into the medium access control layer circuit . Through the medium access control layer circuit , each node determines whether or not to enter a sleep state according to the device type and current status.","Then, please refer to the function macSleep( ).

The reason is that, the function MAC_PwrOffReq( ) calls uint  macSleep(uint  sleepState) whose main functionality is to close the wireless RF module.

Then, the function halSleepSetTimer (timeout) is used to set the sleep time length of the network path sharing device and a user can set the network path sharing device to enter a sleep state at the first preset time and wake up at the second preset time. Furthermore, when the network path sharing device enters the sleep state, power mode PM1 specified by ZigBee network system is selected according to the function HAL_SLEEPSET_POWERMODE (CC2430_PM1) and the node enters sleep state in PM1 mode.","When the network path sharing device wakes up, the function HAL_SLEEP_SETMAIN_CLOCK_CRYSTAL( ) is used to recover back to the system main clock. The function MAC_PwrOnReq( ) restarts the wireless RF module of the network path sharing device to continue packet transmission and the function osal_adjust_timers( ) feedbacks the time interval of being sleep to the system main clock, in order to calibrate the system time of the network path sharing device that just woke up.","It should be noted that the power mode specified by ZigBee network system can be divided into three levels: power mode 1 (PM1), power mode 2 (PM2), and power mode 3 (PM3). The detailed specification can be referred to . The power modes PM1 and PM2 are light sleep modes and can be woken up by the internal timer. The power mode PM3 is a deep sleep mode and can only be woken up externally (for example: clicking a button by a user).","In addition to time calibration by the function osal_adjust_timers( ), a node can check whether or not the corresponding parent node is in the active state. It is possible that the parent node is not active even if the parent node is not dead. Nodes might enter the sleep state at their first preset times and wake up at their second preset times.","However, in the network configuration originally set by ZigBee, a network path sharing device never enters a sleep state. A network path sharing device is always active unless it is shut down by a user or it fails. In an original ZigBee network, as long as a node leaves (for example, breaks down or is shut down manually), its corresponding children nodes cannot reconnect to other network path sharing devices.","For example, in a ZigBee network system according to the prior technology, if the node N is not in the active state, the corresponding children nodes (nodes N and N) cannot reconnect to their parent node. Afterward, the nodes N and N cannot transmit sensing data and the whole sensing network cannot operate normally.","However, in a ZigBee network system according to the invention, if a node finds out that its parent node is not in the active state, ZDO_SyncIndicationCB( ) will be called. We modify the program codes of standard publication version of ZigBee network system such that the function ZDO_StartDevice( ) is called which makes the network layer circuit  establish a new transmission path to avoid the sensing data of the end device unable to be transmitted.","For example, please refer to .  shows a schematic diagram illustrating the network system  establishing the new transmission path according to one embodiment of the invention.
