title: System and method for controlling markets during a stop loss trigger
abstract: A system and method for mitigating effects of a market spike caused by triggering and election of a conditional order in an automated matching system. The system includes evaluation logic which monitors conditional orders submitted to a trading engine compares a price of an order to a first predefined price range (“first range”) and delay logic which delays matching of the submitted orders when the price thereof lie outside of the first range. Pricing logic derives an opening price for use by the trading engine. Timing logic measures a time interval to delay matching of the orders until the opening price is within a predefined price range up to a maximum delay time set by a control center.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention claims priority to and incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/490,145, filed Jul. 25, 2003.","This invention relates to a system and a method that monitor investments, and more particularly, to a system and a method that monitor, and in some instances, mediate an unbalanced market.","The speed in which trades are executed through electronic trading systems provide many benefits. Electronic trading systems can facilitate a large number of market transactions. The greater the number of market transactions, the greater a market's liquidity. In liquid markets, prices are driven by competition; prices reflect a consensus of an investment's value; and trading systems provide a free and open dissemination of information.","While speed and efficiency in electronic markets can enhance trader wealth, these qualities can also increase the adverse affect of a trade that triggers an election of buy or sell stop orders. In a futures market that has few resting orders but many stop orders, an order executed at a limit price can cause a cascading execution of buy or sell stop orders. The triggering and election of these stop orders can seem almost instantaneous lowering the value of a market in just a few seconds.","The problem may occur when one or more trades bring many stop orders into the market. A fast execution of these stop orders may prevent opposite side orders from entering the market, preventing buyers from competing against other buyers and sellers from competing against other sellers. An onset of stop orders may enter the market in the following sequence:","1. A stop order, triggered by a trade, enters the market at a limit price.","2. The limit price trades almost immediately.","3. A second stop order to buy, triggered by the last trade, enters the market at a higher limit price (or a lower limit price if the order is a stop order to sell).","4. This new limit price trades almost immediately.","5. A third stop order to buy, triggered by the last trade, enters the market at a higher limit price (or a lower limit price if the order is a stop order to sell) and so forth. The order processing sequence occurs quickly; so quickly that traders are not be able to prevent the buy or sell stop orders from trading away from the current market prices by entering opposite side orders.","The entire process may be illustrated through a hypothetical E-Mini S&P 500 futures market (\u201cESM3\u201d). In Table 1, an order entered on the bid side of the market for a quantity of 1 at a price of 873.75, trades. As the order trades, multiple stop orders enter the market, which in turn trade and bringing other stop orders into the market. In the ESM3 market,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"ESM3",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TON",{},"QTY","BID","ASK","QTY","TON"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TON 6","Stop (88075)","5","88475","87375","10","TON 1"]},{"entry":["TON 7","Stop (87875)","5","88475","87475","5","TON 2"]},{"entry":["TON 8","Stop (87825)","5","88325","87675","5","TON 3"]},{"entry":["TON 9","Stop (87675)","5","88475","87900","1","TON 4"]},{"entry":["TON 10","Stop (87525)","5","88475","88075","1","TON 5"]},{"entry":["TON 11","Stop (87375)","10","87900"]},{"entry":["TON 12","Stop (87375)","10","87675"]},{"entry":["Incoming",{},"1","873.75"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Trade 1 Incoming (1-lot) trades with Trade Order Number (TON) 1 (1-lot) at 873.75;","TON 12-Stop (87375), TON 11-Stop (87375) are triggered by Trade 1;","Trade 2 TON 12 (9-lot) trades with TON 1 (9-lot) at 873.75;","Trade 3 TON 12 (1-lot) trades with TON 2 (1-lot) at 874.75;","Trade 4 TON 11 (4-lot) trades with TON 2 (4-lot) at 874.75;","Trade 5 TON 11 (5-lot) trades with TON 3 (5-lot) at 876.75;","TON 10-Stop (87525), TON 9-Stop (87675) are triggered by Trade 5;","Trade 6 TON 11 (1-lot) trades with TON 4 (1-lot) at 879.00;","TON 8-Stop (87825) and TON 7-Stop (87875) are triggered by Trade 6.","Trade 7 TON 10 (1-lot) trades with TON 5 (1-lot) at 880.75;

However, the cancellation or busting of trades does not occur simultaneously and is not in the best interest of market participants. An Exchange must first identify the problem and then decide on a solution.","In the hypothetical E-Mini S&P 500 futures market, first the Exchange must determine what caused the market movement. Once that problem is discovered, the Exchange would then have to decide if the market movement lies outside of a \u201cno-bust range.\u201d In a \u201cno-bust range,\u201d trades executed within a price range may not be subject to cancellation, even if executed in error. Trades executed at prices outside of the Exchange's \u201cno-bust range\u201d are considered as quite possibly being beyond normal market forces. Considering the high interdependence of many markets, disruptions may occur in other related markets such as the Nasdaq-100 Index or a larger S&P 500 futures contract that are highly correlated to the hypothetical E-Mini S&P 500.","While such decisions are considered, traders are exposed to serious market risk until a decision is made and until they are notified of the decision. Furthermore, traders will not know if their gains or loses will be reversed. Traders that were short before the cascade of stop order triggers occurred and bought at the bottom of the market may not realize expected gains. Similarly, traders that went long after the market dip could lose their expected gains. Because gains and loses may disappear the instant an Exchange announces that trades will be busted, some traders will not spend unrealized money on new trades. Other traders may be forced out of the market until the decision to bust trades is reached to avoid an unexpected margin call.","The present invention is directed to a system and method that overcome some of these potential drawbacks in the prior art.","The present invention is defined by the following claims. This description summarizes some aspects of the present embodiments and should not be used to limit the claims.","A system mitigates the effects of a market spike caused by the triggering and the election of a conditional order in an automated matching system. The system comprises evaluation logic, delay logic, pricing logic and timing logic. The evaluation logic monitors orders submitted to a trading engine. The evaluation logic is configured to compare an execution price of an order to a predefined price range. The delay logic delays the matching of orders submitted to the trading engine when the execution price of an order lies outside of the pre-determined price range. The pricing logic derives an opening price to be used by the trading engine. The timing logic measures a time interval used to delay a matching of the orders until the opening price is within a predefined price range or an interval of time lapses.","A method of mitigating the effect of a market spike caused by the triggering and the election of an order comprises monitoring orders submitted to the trading engine. The method compares an execution price of a conditional order to a predefined price range and delays the matching of orders submitted to the trading engine when an execution price of the order lies outside of the pre-determined price range. The method derives an opening price to be used by the trading engine; and measures the time interval that delays the matching of the orders until the opening price is within a second predefined price range or a time interval lapses. The method may be repeated to ensure that the opening price reflects a current market movement.","An alternative embodiment includes a matching engine. When a matched order changes a last traded price level, a matching engine checks a stop order book to determine if any new stop orders can be introduced into the market. When a difference between an original price and a currently traded price caused by a stop execution reaches a predefined threshold, the matching engine sends a command to reserve, or temporarily suspend matching, for a predefined period of time. Thus allowing opposite side orders to enter the system in response to this event.","During this suspension of trading, an indicative opening price (IOP) is calculated and stops, resting orders and newly arriving orders resolve into a single price opening. In this embodiment, the single price opening may use pre-opening and circuit breaker logic used in Exchanges. The nature of this opening is such that stop orders, once synthetically introduced during a reserved or pre-opening state, are filled in a limit price priority sequence instead of in the trigger price sequence used in some continuous trading systems. This effectively breaks a stop order ladder and allows the market to trade at more appropriate price levels.","An alternative method checks the value of a single price opening and compares the price to the last traded price to verify that the price is within the previously specified threshold. If it is not within the threshold, another timing window will lapse and the method check is repeated at a second predefined threshold, such as twice a defined threshold, etc. After a predefined or programmed number of iterations of timing windows lapses or a manual intervention occurs, the product opens and the matching engine matches orders regardless of a price movement.","Further aspects and advantages of the invention are described below in conjunction with the present embodiments.","The present system and method mitigates or prevents market spikes due to the triggering, election and trading of conditional orders. The present embodiments include a trading engine that performs a verification of a tradable conditional order that is triggered, to ensure that a traded price will not violate a predefined trade threshold or existing Exchange matching rules. If a potential trade price lies outside of the trade threshold, the instrument is placed in a reserved state allowing orders to be entered, modified, and\/or cancelled.","While an instrument may not trade when it is reserved; an indicative opening price of that instrument may be derived and disseminated to the market. The indicative opening price may reflect the price the instrument would be trading at if the market were open. Placing an instrument in a reserved state allows market participants to enter additional orders that adjust the indicative opening price to a level that reflects buyers competing with other buyers and sellers vying against other sellers. The present embodiments may suspend trading until the market is adjusted within a threshold range, or when a period of time lapses. The period of time may vary in length in relation to the time of day, the product traded, market volatility and\/or any other relevant market condition or combination of market conditions. Similarly, the threshold range may vary by the product and\/or the time of day.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["114","110","112","114","102","112"]},"In , the clients are illustrated as interfaces -, and one or more networks such as a wide area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), a local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a ring network, a token ring network, a bus network,  and , etc. Other peripheral devices may be coupled to hub , such as a printer, a speaker, and\/or any other device.","Preferably, the hub  comprises a management server. The management server receives, converts, and transfers data in a form compatible with protocols used by servers -, a communication link , the interfaces -, and\/or the networks  and . The interfaces may include an application programming interface (an \u201cAPI\u201d) , a data interface , a market data interface , and\/or other interfaces , for example. Preferably, the market data interface  provides quote vendors with access to selected output disseminated from the hub .","In , the hub  provides routing control to a trade matching system, such as an automated trading engine shown as servers  and . When orders are matched automatically by a matching algorithm or system within one or both of the servers  and\/or , preferably the details of the trade and information of interest to the market are disseminated to quote vendors and trade participants that include the buyers and the sellers.","Preferably, the trade evaluation system , shown as servers - in  interfaces the hub . In the embodiment of , the trade evaluation system  may include an order book manager , an order processor , a spike control processor , a reserve market processor , and an open market processor . In the embodiment shown in , the trade evaluation system  may include evaluation logic , delay logic , pricing logic , and timing logic . Preferably, the evaluation logic  and order processor  calculate a price threshold or price that extends above and below a selected or a theoretical price. Such a threshold or interval may be fixed within a number of ticks above and below a last traded price. The threshold or interval may vary by product, instrument, contract, or other relevant market considerations.","When the present system and method is used in a futures Exchange, the price threshold or range may comprise a no-bust range that defines a price interval within which transactions that fall within that interval are not subject to cancellation by the Exchange. Preferably, trades that fall within the no-bust range do not have a significant adverse effect on the market, and therefore, the trade stands even in error. In these embodiments, the trades that fall within the no-bust range cannot be cancelled by agreement. In other embodiments, trades that fall within the no-bust range may be cancelled by an agreement between market participants.","Preferably, the market data interfaces , the data interfaces , the networks  and , the APIs  and the other interfaces  provide market participants, quote vendors, and others with real and\/or delayed time access to trade data. The trade data can include investment prices such as futures contract prices, settlement prices, bids, offers, and other Exchange related or derived information. In some embodiments, inter-process communication methods, such as a Dynamic Data Exchange (\u201cDDE\u201d) and\/or an Object Linking and Embedding (\u201cOLE\u201d) are used to exchange data and commands between two or more servers or applications that run simultaneously.","As shown in , the trade evaluation system  includes an order book manager , an order processor , a spike control processor , a reserve market processor , and an open market processor . Preferably, orders flow into the order processor  and are maintained by the order book manager . The order book manager  may maintain the Exchange's order books, manage communication with an automated trading engine, and allow an Exchange administrator to establish order filters (e.g., trading authorizations, instrument access, price bands, trading limits, etc.).","The order book manager  may also retain a predefined or a programmable parameter used by order process logic or the order processor . In this embodiment, instrument parameters are stored in a table of rows and columns. In another embodiment, the parameters are stored in a data structure comprising a list of entries that use a unique key to identify each entry. The data structure may include a set of related values such as a linked list that use a common indexing scheme. In these embodiments, an instrument is reserved when the instrument is stored in a data table or data structure.","Preferably, parameters are initialized on start up of an automated trading engine and are maintained for a predefined period of time such as a trading week. When a conditional order is triggered in a futures market, such as a stop order that enters the market at a limit or market price, the order processor  compares an execution price of the stop order to a predefined price threshold such as a no-bust range. Preferably, this comparison determines if the transaction may be completed. If an execution price lies outside of the predefined price threshold, the order processor  notifies the spike control processor .","Once notified, the spike control processor  reserves the instrument through a reserve market processor  and activates a verification timer. The verification timer may measure a time interval that varies in length in relation to a time of day, a product, a trader's location, market volatility, and\/or any other relevant market conditions or combination of market conditions. At the end of an initial time period, the spike control processor  compares an indicative opening price to the predefined price threshold. If the indicative opening price is above\/below the predefined threshold, the verification timer is reactivated for an additional iteration that may vary with one or more market conditions. In this embodiment, the indicative opening price is a changing price that may be based on an indicative trade, a better bid, or a better offer. Similarly, a predefined price threshold may comprise a dynamic price range that changes with each iteration.","The spike control processor  will reserve a market unless the indicative opening price lies within the predefined price threshold, a predetermined number of iterations or time periods lapse, or a manual intervention occurs. When one of those condition occurs, the spike control processor  notifies the open market processor  opening the market.","One variable utilized by the spike control processor  identifies the duration that an instrument may be held in reserve. A price verification time variable is invoked and a timer activated when the order processor  invokes the spike control processor . The price verification time variable comprises a programmable or a constant time value.","The spike control processor  also uses a price iteration variable. The price iteration variable comprises a programmable multiplier. Preferably, the product of the price iteration variable and price verification time variable calculates a maximum length of time an instrument may remain in a reserved state. If the price verification time variable is five seconds and the price iteration variable is eleven, the maximum time the market may be in a reserved state is fifty-five seconds. The time variables are initialized on start up and are maintained for a length of time, such as a trading week. If the variables are changed before the period lapses, such as in the middle of a trading week, the variables may be update in a real or a delayed time.","Another embodiment of the trade evaluation system  shown in  couples a trading engine  and . In this embodiment, the trade evaluation system includes evaluation logic , delay logic , pricing logic , and timing logic . Preferably, the evaluation logic  monitors orders submitted to an automated matching system or trading engine  and . The evaluation logic  may be programmed or configured to compare an execution price of a conditional order such as a stop order to a predefined price range. Preferably, the price ranges reflects a range of prices that extend above and below an actual or synthetic market price. The price range may differ by product, may be fixed within a number of ticks above and below an actual or synthetic market price, or may vary above and below an actual or synthetic market price. Additionally, a synthetic no bust range may also be used including the no bust ranges disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10\/405,025 entitled System and Method for Monitoring Trades of a No-Bust Range in an Electronic Trading System, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","While in some embodiments price comparisons can occur in delayed or batch time, preferably, the comparison occurs in real-time, which is within a narrow time period after a potential trade would occur. If the price of the trade is within the price range, the trade stands and an open continuous trading is maintained. If the price of the trade caused by the execution of conditional orders falls outside of the price range, the evaluation logic  places the product into a reserved state. Upon its reservation, delay logic  determines a maximum time the market may remain in a reserved state.","Pricing logic  derives an opening price at which a product would trade upon the opening of the market or an equilibrium price that falls substantially within the overlap of the pending bid and offer prices. Preferably, the pricing logic  calculates opening prices upon demand, in delayed-time, or in real-time as orders are received.","Preferably, the delay logic  delays the matching of orders submitted to the trading engine  and . The delay will reserve a product until an opening price lies within a price range, a period of time lapses, or an automated or a manual intervention occurs. Preferably price ranges, delay, and\/or the measure of time are retained in an audit trail and\/or memory coupled to or resident to the evaluation system . The tracking and\/or storage of one or more of these values can preserve market integrity and allow an Exchange to review an event.","As shown in , one or more of the components that comprise the trade evaluation system of  and\/or  may couple a control center  and the trade matching system  and . Preferably, the trade matching system  and  uses one or more matching systems or methods, such as a \u201cfirst in, first out\u201d (\u201cFIFO\u201d), an allocation, a hybrid price\/time priority, such as a Lead Market Maker (\u201cLMM\u201d), for example, or any other matching systems or methods to automatically match orders. Once the details of the orders are entered through a user interface , preferably, the trade matching system  and  executes the trade and transmits matched trade data (e.g., instrument type, the price, the quantity, the buyer, the seller, etc.) to the trade evaluation system  and the user interface . The trade matching system  and  also transmits matched trade data and quote data to the quote and data vendors  and . Preferably, the matched trade data and quote data describe recent market movements.","Through a control center , preferably an Exchange or a member of the Exchange oversees the reservation of products in the market. The control center  may manually or automatically override the trade evaluation system  or perform a state change on any product, instrument, parameter, or group. The control center may view, configure, and program the predetermined price thresholds and timing variables of  to any market condition or combination of market conditions just as it may view, configure, and program the logic of  to such market conditions.","To assure that market participants and the Exchange are aware of the status of the market or any changes to thresholds, variables, or logic, preferably, the evaluation system  may provide a notice to the user interfaces - ( (), the control center  (), and any communication system. In some instances, each of the embodiments may provide selected notices only to the control center , allowing the Exchange to notify the market of certain conditions if needed through a messaging system.","Because market participants may not be aware that a product or an instrument is reserved due to the large volume of messages sent over an electronic trading system or because the market participants are no longer trading, the present system and method also may encompass independent communication systems that are coupled to the trade evaluation system  to convey information, warnings, or alerts about an instrument in a reserved state. Such systems can include devices that send and\/or receive messages via telecommunication or wireless links such as portable phones, personal digital assistants (\u201cPDAs\u201d), and\/or electronic mail devices, devices that send and\/or receive images and can print them on a tangible media such as faxes, etc. Preferably, these systems make market participants aware of the state of the market in a narrow timeframe.","The present system and method mitigates or prevents market spikes caused by the triggering, election, and trading of conditional orders. An embodiment of the method may be translated into a computer readable medium, programming instructions (e.g., code), or information that can be stored and retrieved from a volatile or non-volatile memory.","Any Exchange, such as a futures Exchange that enforces a no-bust range or another price range may use the method shown in . The method may be encoded in a signal bearing medium, a computer readable medium such as a memory, programmed within a device such as one or more integrated circuits, or processed by a controller, a computer, a server, or a server cluster. If the methods are performed by code or software, the code or software may reside in a memory resident to or interfaced to the trade matching system  and  of  or , a communication interface, or any other type of non-volatile or volatile memory interfaced or resident to the trade evaluation system  of . The memory may include an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. A logical function may be implemented through digital circuitry, through source code, or through analog circuitry. The code or software may be embodied in any computer-readable or signal-bearing medium, for use by, or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. Such a system may include a computer-based system, a processor-containing system, or another system that may selectively fetch instructions from an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device that may also execute instructions.","A \u201ccomputer-readable medium,\u201d \u201cmachine-readable medium,\u201d \u201cpropagated-signal\u201d medium, and\/or \u201csignal-bearing medium\u201d may comprise any means that contains, stores, communicates, propagates, or transports code or software for use by or in connection with an instruction executable system, apparatus, or device. The machine-readable medium may selectively be, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. A non-exhaustive list of examples of a machine-readable medium would include: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable magnetic or optical disk, a volatile memory such as a Random Access Memory \u201cRAM,\u201d a Read-Only Memory \u201cROM,\u201d an Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM or Flash memory), or an optical fiber (optical). A machine-readable medium may also include a tangible medium upon which code or software is printed, as the code or software may be translated into a high-level language that may be compiled through a scanner, and\/or interpreted or otherwise processed. The processed medium may then be stored in a computer and\/or machine memory.","As shown in , a stop order is triggered and enters the market at a limit price or at a market price at act . In this embodiment, a stop order, sometimes called a stop-loss order, or simply a stop, is an order to buy or sell at a limit price when the market reaches a specified price. A limit price is a specified price or a price that is more favorable to the trader. A limit order to buy will be executed at or below the specified price limit. A limit order to sell will be executed at or above the specified price limit.","At act , the method compares an execution price to a no-bust range that is calculated separately for each product or instrument. The no-bust range may comprise a synthetic price range or a last traded price plus or minus a no bust-range variable.","If the price of the trade lies within the no-bust range, the trade stands and open continuous trading is maintained at acts  and . The process will then be applied each time a stop order would create a trade. A price comparison is performed at each tradable price level of the market.","If the price of the trade falls outside of the no-bust range, preferably, the product is placed into a reserved state at acts  and . Upon its reservation, a timer that is coupled to or resident to a trading engine is activated. A counter will also be activated to track the number of times an indicative opening price verification process is performed.","In the illustrated embodiment, the counter is initialized to \u201c1\u201d at act . Preferably, the counter cannot exceed a value that is retained in a table or a data structure. If more than one comparison to an indicative opening price occurs, a varying price range (e.g., an expanded no-bust range) will be determined for verification of an indicative opening price. The varying price range may comprise a product of the no-bust range and a multiplier. Preferably, the multiplier increases incrementally or in multiples each time an indicative opening price verification occurs.","Once a predetermined length of time lapses, an indicative opening price and a price range are calculated and broadcast to the market through a data feed at acts  and . The indicative opening price represents a price at which a product would trade upon an opening of a market. An indicative opening price may comprise an equilibrium price that falls within an overlap of bid and offer prices.","A comparison of an indicative opening price to a calculated price range occurs at act . If the indicative opening price lies within the price range, the market opens, and trading begins at the indicative opening price or a market price. The process resumes when another stop order is triggered at act .","If the indicative opening price lies outside of the price range, process variables are incremented at acts  and , and the process continues until a predetermined number of iterations is reached at act . When a maximum number of iterations are reached, a product reopens at act  and the process resumes when another stop order is triggered at act .","If a maximum number of iterations is not reached, the process resumes when the time variable is read or programmed at act  and another indicative opening price is calculated. At act , the indicative opening price is a dynamic price that changes as orders are entered into the market and pending orders are modified, and\/or cancelled. The present method continues until a predetermined number of iterations is reached or an external event occurs. An external event may include the closing of the market or a manual market intervention.","The above-described embodiments, scale well to large networks, to new products, or to the large volatility that occurs in the markets that trade popular contracts. The embodiments may facilitate any exchange between buyers and sellers, including markets that exchange equities, debt, investment indices, and other investments as well as any commodity or combination or series of commodity contracts, such as bundles that can comprise the purchase of one of a series of consecutive contracts.","When the trade evaluation system  is integrated or linked to a trading engine that matches spreads, all related spreads are automatically reserved when the spread lies outside of a predefined threshold. When reserved, all related spread instruments are reserved and any implied spreading becomes inactive. When the market is allowed to open, all spreads corresponding to an underlying leg open. In addition, if a contract is utilizing implied trading, the implied trading will be turned off until the Exchange's rules or other rules allow for a re-initiating of an implied trading.","As shown in , the trade evaluation system  may couple a control center . Through the control center an Exchange administrator may take an appropriate action on a spread and manually open corresponding spreads. Under these circumstances the implied spreading will remain inactive for a remainder of a trading session. An Exchange administrator may also set a group of differing contracts to a pre-opening, take appropriate action on the spread, and reset an opening for the group of differing contracts. In one embodiment, implied spreading is automatically reactivated at the opening of a market if the states of the investment leg allow it.","The present embodiments described above provide Exchanges and users with a flexible approach and structure that mitigates or prevent sharp rises or declines in market prices due to the triggering, election, and trading of conditional orders. To further illustrate the present embodiments, exemplary markets are described and illustrated.","In a first example, a price verification time is programmed to five seconds and the initial no-bust range is six.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0083"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"ESM3",{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TON",{},"QTY","BID","ASK","QTY","TON"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"7"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["TON 6","Stop (88075)","5","88475","87375","10","TON 1"]},{"entry":["TON 7","Stop (87875)","5","88475","87475","5","TON 2"]},{"entry":["TON 8","Stop (87825)","5","88325","87675","5","TON 3"]},{"entry":["TON 9","Stop (87675)","5","88475","87900","1","TON 4"]},{"entry":["TON 10","Stop (87525)","5","88475","88075","1","TON 5"]},{"entry":["TON 11","Stop (87375)","10","87900"]},{"entry":["TON 12","Stop (87375)","10","87675"]},{"entry":["Incoming",{},"1","873.75"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"7","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"With the market in a continuous trading state, the following sequence occurs when an Incoming\u2014Buy of 1 @ 873.75 enters the market:\n\n","The market is placed in a reserved state because the trade that would occur at a price of 880.75 would violate the no bust range.
