title: Method, system and process for data encryption and transmission
abstract: A system, process and method for data encryption and transmission are disclosed. By adopting the paradigm of a pre-paid self addressed express envelope end-users will interact with this invention in much the same way they interact with traditional delivery systems. They simply provide the content, and delivery takes place without any further user intervention. The encryption is a “software appliance”. This software already knows the identity of the sender and the receiver and the encryption key that is to be used; all it needs from the user is the information which is to be securely transported.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims priority of Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/305,216 entitled METHOD, SYSTEM AND PROCESS FOR DATA ENCRYPTION AND TRANSMISSION, filed Jul. 13, 2001.","This invention relates generally to the field of information handling and more specifically to a method and system for data encryption and transmission. Even the best encryption system can't protect data if it is too difficult and or time consuming for the end user to use. This invention focuses on making secure data transmission drag and drop simple by adopting the paradigm of a pre-paid self addressed express envelope or courier.","The security of information poses challenges for businesses and other organizations that transmit and store information. Data encryption is intended to transform data into a form readable only by authorized users. However a large majority of information is not encrypted due to the difficulty or inconvenience of using most encryption software. In light of this the need has arisen to develop encryption into a \u201csoftware appliance\u201d. This software knows the identity of the sender and the receiver and the encryption key that is to be used; all it needs from the user is the information which is to be securely transported. By adopting the paradigm of a pre-paid, self addressed express envelope end users will interact with this invention in much the same way they interact with traditional delivery systems that simply provide for the delivery and take place without any further user intervention.","This invention is primarily a process to make using strong encryption (such as described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09\/797,272 09\/797,066 09\/797,107 09\/797,068 09\/797,079 09\/796,694) easier for end users. In doing so it leverages the wide-spread availability of public information networks to rapidly deliver private content to a predetermined recipient. This software encryption appliance is designed around the look and feel of a pre-paid pre-addressed express delivery envelope similar to those used every day in such industries as accounting, legal and financial. When an accountant, lawyer, broker or other professional needs to get high-value, confidential correspondence from a client, it is accepted practice to provide the client with pre-addressed pre-paid express envelopes from some commercial overnight or express delivery service. This invention seeks to translate this process into the digital world. A client would be provided with a computer program whose graphical user interface (GUI) resembles an addressed envelope. In order to send a secure communication to the providing professional service \u201cPPS\u201d, the client merely has to \u201cdrag and drop\u201d the intended document into the appropriate desktop Icon. This process is far easier and more streamlined than email programs that use the so called public key infrastructure. After dropping a file on the icon, a confirm box pops up. After confirming the intention to send, there is no other intervention needed on the user's part. This eliminates the hassle of public key management, prevents misdirected communications and assures that the delivery will take place without the confidentiality of the message being compromised.","This invention is primarily a process to make using strong encryption (such as described in co-pending commonly assigned U.S. patent applications identified as Ser. Nos. 60\/226,400 09\/797,272 09\/797,066 09\/797,107 09\/797,068 09\/797,079 09\/796,694) easier for end-users, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. This software encryption appliance is designed around the look and feel of a pre-paid pre-addressed express delivery envelope similar to those used every day in such industries as accounting, legal and financial. When an accountant, lawyer, broker or other professional needs to get high-value, confidential correspondence from a client, it is accepted practice to provide the client with pre-addressed pre-paid, express envelopes from some commercial overnight or express delivery service. This invention seeks to translate this process into the digital world.","This process has two main components. The first component is the creation and distribution of a pre-addressed digital envelope. The second portion is the digital envelope itself. This envelope allows drag and drop encryption and transmission back to the distributing party. This digital envelope also has the ability to decrypt and display return correspondence or files.","Envelope creation is handled by an administration program that allows the creation and assignment of encryption such as disclosed in the cross referenced patent application Ser. Nos. 09\/797,079 and 09\/796,694, keys and the management of distribution lists or groups. To facilitate ease of use, the user interface for envelope creation contains elements that simulate the look and feel of a traditional mailing envelope. In one commercial implementation model the administration program assigns a number of uses to the digital envelope that counts down. This information appears in the area where stamps would be placed on a traditional envelope. The \u201cTO\u201d and \u201cFROM\u201d fields of the envelope are filled out prior to distribution. Typically, the envelope provider puts their own information in the \u201cTO\u201d field and their client's information in the \u201cFROM\u201d field. A key is assigned to the envelope and the creation time along with all other relevant information is logged for auditing purposes. The envelope is generated and distributed by some suitable trusted means generally to the party listed in the \u201cFROM\u201d field.","An end user is provided with a computer program from some party who wishes to receive confidential communications. The program sets itself up as a desktop icon that resembles an envelope. Any file dragged over and dropped on the envelope is copied, encrypted and sent to whatever address was embedded in the envelope at the time of creation. After confirming the intention to send, there is no other intervention needed on the user's part. This eliminates the need for public key management and prevents misdirected communications. Since the communications are secured with the strong encryption technology, such as disclosed in the cross referenced patent application Ser. Nos. 60\/226,400 09\/797,272 09\/797,066 09\/797,107 09\/797,068 09\/797,079 09\/796,694, there is assurance that the delivery will take place without the confidentiality of the message being compromised.","In the current operational mode of the present invention, referred to as Asier Digital Courier, there consists of two different pieces of software. The first is an administrative tool that has the ability to create secure communication channels. This application is referred to as an \u201cEnvelope Administrator\u201d or server.  depict the inner workings of the server and  deals with the actual use of the server to create a second type of software, a client or digital envelope.  deal with the working of the client and ,  and  show its operation in sending and receiving secure messages.","As illustrated in , the server software is made up of numerous elements. The Envelope Administrator (ELEMENT ) is the central logic that controls everything, and receives user input\/output at . The Envelope Administrator interacts with all the various modules and databases. A data compression module (ELEMENT ) is adapted to reduce the size of incoming data. An encryption\/decryption module (ELEMENT ) is adapted to encrypt all database records stored on the local drive and all information sent over the network. A MAPI (Messaging Application Programming Interface) interfaces (ELEMENTS  and ) so that the server application can access the address books of third party MAPI compliant e-mail application and use the IN\/OUT Boxes of such applications for message handling. Additional network flexibility is in the form of a standard POP (Post Office Protocol)\/SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) interface (ELEMENT ) that allows the envelope administrator to distribute client envelopes and send\/receive messages directly to compatible network servers  via network input\/output module  even when MAPI compliant e-mail applications are unavailable. The envelope server software is distinguished from the client software in several important ways. The administrator\/server gets its name from its ability to generate subordinate client applications, and this is possible due to the envelope and key generator modules (ELEMENTS  and ). For business reasons the total number of clients (or envelopes) issued is adapted to be monitored and controlled with the Audit Report Generator (ELEMENT ). In some instances the administrator may produce envelopes with a limited number of uses, while in other scenarios the administrator can only produce a limited number of client envelopes. The results are stored securely within the Auditing Database (ELEMENT ). ELEMENT  depicts a key database module, ELEMENT  is an address database module, and ELEMENT  shows an envelope database module.","The envelope (client) creation process is detailed in . At the beginning  of this process a determination is made about the availability a MAPI compliant e-mail application (ELEMENT ). If such an application is present, then the server can use the MAPI address book for envelope creation, and steps -, and -,  are executed (ELEMENT ). The \u201cTO\u201d and \u201cFROM\u201d information can be populated from internal databases (ELEMENTS  and ), external (MAPI) address books  (ELEMENT )  (ELEMENT ) or manually  (ELEMENT ). It is important to remember that the server has complete control over the operation of the envelope and that the eventual user of the client cannot change the destination key or any other feature of the envelope. An existing encryption key may be selected (ELEMENT ), or a new one may be created and named (ELEMENT ). The user has the opportunity to continue or cancel (ELEMENT ). If the user continues, relevant information is stored encrypted in the appropriate databases (ELEMENTS , ,  and ) and a client envelope application is created. The envelope is sent over a network (ELEMENT ) or stored locally for other distribution  (ELEMENT ).","The client envelope software detailed in  is highly reminiscent of the server software from . The most important difference is that the envelope database contains the key and address databases and is not alterable (ELEMENTS ,  and ). The client can necessarily compress decompress, encrypt and decrypt with the same modules (ELEMENTS  and ) as the server software. The client also has the same network (ELEMENT ) access choices (ELEMENTS  and ) as the server which are accessible via network input\/output module . Envelope creation module  receives user input\/output .","There is little difference between how a server sends a client envelope and how either a client or a server sends a secure message. As shown in  the process begins at  with checking for MAPI compliant e-mail clients at steps  and . If no MAPI e-mail applications are present, the MAPI function is disabled at . Next, an envelope must be selected (ELEMENTS , , , ,  and ). If only one envelope exists (as in a client), then this process is greatly simplified (ELEMENT ). The envelope contains the necessary information about keys and addresses (ELEMENTS ,  and ). A user may append files or add text message to be encrypted and sent (ELEMENT )  (ELEMENTS  and ). The user is given a choice to continue or abort (ELEMENT ). If the user continues, the program checks to see if the licensing rules are being followed (ELEMENT ). If user does not continue, the program ends at . All data is compressed and encrypted (ELEMENT ). Next, a network status check is made at . If the network is available the secure message is sent immediately (ELEMENT ). If no network is available and MAPI is present at , the message is placed in the MAPI compliant application's OUT Box for later delivery (ELEMENT ) and the process ends at . After the message is delivered a sweep of network POP3 servers and or local MAPI IN Boxes is made for any pending incoming secure mail (ELEMENT ). Any waiting incoming encrypted messages are moved (ELEMENT ) decrypted (ELEMENTS  and ) and displayed for the user  Part , and the process ends at . If there are no awaiting incoming encrypted messages at , the process ends at .","The creation of digital courier client envelopes is designed to be very simple for the user, as shown in . From the main screen, the \u201cEnvelope\u201d is clicked at the menu on the tool bar and the \u201cCreate Courier Envelope\u201d (ELEMENT ) is selected. Screen  of the envelope creation tool (ELEMENT ) pops up. In most cases it will already have the server's return address (ELEMENT ). The graphic user interface is designed around the paradigm of a business reply envelope (ELEMENT ). An envelope may be created for an individual or a group (ELEMENT ). The number of envelopes remaining for a particular server may be shown next to the stamp graphic or in it's own text field (ELEMENT ). The client's address (ELEMENT ) can be selected form an address book (ELEMENT ) or manually entered in the space provided (ELEMENT ). \u201cNext\u201d brings the user to screen  of the envelope creation tool (ELEMENT ) pops up. Encryption keys may be created and named (ELEMENT ) or selected from a database (ELEMENT ). Additionally, a password (or phrase) for initial (one time) key exchange and installation may be added for extra security (ELEMENT ). The third and final envelope creation screen (ELEMENT ) allows the user to select the delivery method. A user can choose to send the envelop as an executable file or a zip file (ELEMENT ). Due to firewall issues a zip file is usually preferred. This compressed and encrypted file can be e-mailed across the network, or it could be saved to some other location for other delivery means (ELEMENT ). Finally, after the file is sent, the user receives a confirmation message (ELEMENT ). Element  depicts a key, element  depicts an envelope destination field, and element  depicts the finish.","There are a variety of ways to invoke digital courier to send a message as  show. The \u201cNew Message\u201d button (ELEMENT ) may be clicked or a file (ELEMENT ) may be dragged over the Digital Courier short cut (ELEMENTS ,  and ). In either case, the \u201cDispatch Secure Courier\u201d screen (ELEMENT ) pops up. If more than one envelop exists then selection can be made from a drop down list (ELEMENT ) or page arrows (ELEMENT ). Once the envelope is selected the FROM (ELEMENT ), TO(ELEMENT ), and KEY fields are set. Attachments can be added (ELEMENT ) and messages can be typed (ELEMENT ). Administrators with the server application can customize the look of the envelope (ELEMENT ) by adding graphics (ELEMENT ) that can be seen on the server and on the client. An administrator can customize an envelope so that the client sees a picture of the administrator (and perhaps a marketing message) while the server sees a picture of the client so as to ensure the correct envelope is selected for delivery. Element  depicts a digital envelope, element  depicts a reference number, element  depicts a subject field, and element  depicts a dispatch courier. Element  depicts a dispatch secure courier window, element  depicts a \u201cFROM\u201d field, element  depicts a \u201cTO\u201d field and element  depicts a \u201cMESSAGE\u201d field. Element  depicts a \u201cSUBJECT\u201d field, element  depicts an \u201cATTACH\u201d field, and element  depicts a \u201cFORWARD and REVERSE\u201d arrow. Element  depicts a company logo, element  depicts an \u201cADD ATTACHMENT\u201d button, element  depicts an \u201cEDIT RECIPIENT LOGO's\u201d button, and  depicts a \u201cDISPATCH COURIER\u201d button.","Advantageously, reading encrypted messages is no more difficult with Asier Digital Courier than reading normal email. As shown in , simply double click on the shortcut (ELEMENTS  and ) and the main viewer screen opens. Multiple folders (ELEMENT ) are provided for moving (ELEMENT ) sorting and storing messages. Normal e-mail function like \u201cReply\u201d (ELEMENT ), \u201cForward\u201d (ELEMENT ), \u201cSplit Preview\u201d (ELEMENT ) and \u201cAddress Book\u201d (ELEMENT ) are fully supported. A list of stored messages (ELEMENT ) allows the user to pick a message that is stored encrypted and have it immediately decrypted and displayed (ELEMENT ). Attachments (ELEMENT ) are stored encrypted in Digital Courier and decrypted when they are clicked on. Element  depicts a \u201cFROM\u201d and \u201cTO\u201d field, along with a \u201cSUBJECT\u201d field.","It is important to note that Digital Courier has a host of additional security features that are not obvious. All Digital Courier databases (address, key, envelope, message and attachments) are stored encrypted on the hard drive. Strong password access is available for application launch. When a client user is attempting to install a client envelope a search of the registry is made. If the email address and name provided by the server are not present in the client's registry the installation is aborted and the envelope will not deploy. The digital courier reader application will not support scripts, DHTML or Java code, and this is to prevent a possible infected file from gaining a foothold. All attachments are stored in an encrypted \u201cinert state.\u201d mail cannot be misdirected.","Though the invention has been described with respect to a specific preferred embodiment, many variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the present application. It is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention and for further features and advantages, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
