One (1) of the most common items utilized to protect infants is a car seat. A car seat holds an infant in place to protect them while being transported in a motor vehicle.","A problem associated with conventional car seats is that they are generally ergonomically unfriendly and place more emphasis on restraint than comfort. In particular, the child's head tends to end up at awkward angles when the child is sleeping.","Prolonged placement of a child's neck and head at a poor angle causes a number of problems. This is uncomfortable for the child and can cause great distress when the child wakes. Furthermore, this causes a large amount stress on the child's neck which can cause strain and even damage. This is particularly dangerous in the event of a sudden stop or crash.","Various attempts have been made to provide support pillows adapted for use in a vehicle. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents including U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,080; U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,611; U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,245; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,255; U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,388; U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,195; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,554,363.","Additionally, ornamental designs for a neck support pillow exist, such as U.S. Pat. No. D 322,380. However, none of these designs are similar to the present invention.","While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives, each of these references suffer from one (1) or more disadvantages. Many such devices are not readily adjustable. Many such devices do not work for a child, particularly a sleeping child, as they assume a certain level of coordination on the part of the user. Many such devices are not easily adaptable for use with a car seat. Furthermore, many such devices are adapted for comfort but not support, or are not adapted to support and protect the neck and head of a sleeping child. Accordingly, there exists a need for a support pillow for a child in a car seat without the disadvantages as described above. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need.","In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for a support adapted for use by a child while in a car seat, which provides unconditional comfort and support in an easily installed and adjustable manner. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need.","To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pair of pillows for supporting each side of a child's head in an upright position while the child is seated in a child car seat. Each pillow assembly comprises an inflatable pillow having a removable cover and a pillow strap for attached the device to a car seat.","Another object of the present invention is to removably attach each pillow assembly to a seat belt of a child car seat utilizing a strap attached to the attached to each pillow cover. The straps include fasteners that allow the straps to encircle and secure to the seat belt.","Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each pillow of a kidney-shape that provides a comfortable contoured surface conforming to the profile of a child's neck and lower head. The pillows provide upright support to both sides of the child's head and neck as well as forward support to the child's chin area to ensure that the child's neck remains at a safe and comfortable angle at all times, even while sleeping.","Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each inflatable pillow of a foam pillow having a nozzle for selectively inflating the pillow. Each nozzle comprises a vented cap valve that enables air to enter the foam body and remain within the body to maintain its expanded form. The nozzle can be opened to remove are from within the body until a desired level of support is achieved.","Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each cover of a removable fabric cover for providing comfort against a child's skin during use, providing protection to the inflatable pillow, and enabling removal of the cover for purposes of washing or replacement. Each cover further comprises a nozzle aperture enabling manipulation of the nozzles while the cover is in place.","Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of utilizing the device that provides a unique means of attaching a pair of pillow assemblies onto respective seat belts using the straps; actuating the nozzles to inflate or deflate each pillow as desired; positioning a child with respect to the pillows such that the apparatus provides support to both sides of the child's head and neck areas; and, increasing the comfort and providing increased safety for the child.","Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0027"},"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0002","num":"0028"},"b":"15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0003","num":"0029"},"b":"16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0004","num":"0030"},"b":"17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0005","num":"0031"},"b":"20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0006","num":"0032"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0007","num":"0033"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0008","num":"0034"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0009","num":"0035"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0010","num":"0036"},"b":"26"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0011","num":"0037"},"b":"27"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0012","num":"0038"},"b":"28"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0013","num":"0039"},"b":"29"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0014","num":"0040"},"b":"30"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0015","num":"0041"},"b":"40"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0016","num":"0042"},"b":"41"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0017","num":"0043"},"b":"42"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0018","num":"0044"},"b":"43"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0019","num":"0045"},"b":"44"}]}}}},"The best mode for carrying out the invention is presented in terms of its preferred embodiment, herein depicted within .
