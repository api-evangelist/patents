Field of the Invention","The disclosures herein generally relate to a memory circuit, and particularly relate to a memory circuit having a test circuit to check an amount of current flowing through a cell transistor.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, a nonvolatile memory cell requires a special structure such as a floating gate or a special material such as a ferroelectric material or ferromagnetic material for the purpose of achieving nonvolatile data retention. There is a new type of nonvolatile semiconductor memory device called PermSRAM, which uses a MIS (metal-insulating film-semiconductor) transistor as a nonvolatile memory cell (i.e., the basic unit of data storage). The MIS transistor used as a nonvolatile memory cell in PermSRAM has the same structure as ordinary MIS transistors used for conventional transistor functions (e.g., switching function), and do not require a special structure or a special material as described above. The absence of such a special structure and special material offers an advantage in cost reduction. PermSRAM was initially disclosed in PCT\/JP2003\/016143, which was filed on Dec. 17, 2003, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The MIS transistor used as a nonvolatile memory cell in PermSRAM is configured to experience an irreversible hot-carrier effect on purpose for storage of one-bit data. Here, the irreversible hot-carrier effect refers to the injection of carriers into the oxide film (insulating film) and\/or sidewalls, which causes a change in the transistor's threshold voltage. Whether the threshold voltage has been changed due to a hot-carrier effect represents one-bit data \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d. Such a change in the threshold voltage may be detected by sensing a difference in ON current between the nonvolatile-memory-cell MIS transistor and a reference MIS transistor by using a sensing circuit such as a latch circuit.","When a nonvolatile memory device having nonvolatile memory cells as described above is manufactured, there is a need to conduct a test to ensure that the memory cells perform properly as designed. Testing, however, cannot be performed by use of a conventional test technique, which checks memory cells by writing data to and reading data from these cells. This is because the operation of the above-noted nonvolatile memory cell is founded on an irreversible change of the transistor characteristics. If a test that creates such an irreversible change is actually performed, the memory circuit may no longer be usable.","A test circuit may be provided to compare an amount of current flowing through a nonvolatile memory cell with an amount of current flowing through a test-purpose reference cell. Such a test circuit can determine whether the tested cell transistor can be sufficiently conductive to serve as a memory cell. Occurrence of an excessive amount of current flowing through a cell transistor, however, cannot be detected by this type of test circuit. A cell transistor that allows an excessive amount of current flow is not suitable as a memory cell because an excessively strong hot-carrier effect may be required to sufficiently change an ON current for the purpose of data storage. There may even be a case in which data cannot be properly stored in the cell transistor.","Accordingly, it may be desirable to provide a memory device that can test a cell transistor to check the amount of current flowing through the cell transistor.","It is a general object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor memory device. According to at least one embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor memory device includes a plurality of memory cell transistors arranged in a matrix and each configured to store data, and a test circuit configured to output to outside the semiconductor memory device an output signal indicative of an amount of test current flowing through a selected one of the plurality of memory cell transistors, wherein the test circuit includes a plurality of reference cell transistors employed to successively produce varying amounts of currents, a comparison circuit configured to successively compare the amount of test current with each of the varying amounts of currents, and a code generating circuit configured to generate a code indicative of a result of the successive comparisons performed by the comparison circuit, wherein the code is output as the output signal.","In the following, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","10","10"]},"The memory cell array  includes a plurality of memory cells arranged in a matrix form, each memory cell having a circuit configuration as will later be described. The memory cells arranged in the same column are connected to the same bit lines, and the memory cells arranged in the same row are connected to the same word line.","The mode selector  receives mode input signals from an exterior of the device, and decodes the mode input signal to determine an operation mode (e.g., a write operation mode, a read operation mode, or a test operation mode). Control signals responsive to the determined operation mode are supplied to the write amplifier , the sense amplifier & column selector , the row signal driver , etc., for control of the individual parts of the semiconductor memory device .","The column decoder  receives a column address input from the exterior of the device, and decodes the column address input to determine a selected column. The decode signals indicative of the selected column are supplied to the write amplifier  and the sense amplifier & column selector .","The row decoder  receives a row address input from the exterior of the device, and decodes the row address input to determine a selected row. The decode signals indicative of the selected row are supplied to the row signal driver .","In response to the control signals from the mode selector  and the decode signals from the row decoder , the row signal driver  activates a selected word line among the word lines extending from the row signal driver . As a result of the activation of the selected word line, access to each memory cell corresponding to the selected word line is performed through a corresponding bit line (or bit line pair) among a plurality of bit lines.","In response to the control signals from the mode selector  and the decode signals from the column decoder , the sense amplifier & column selector  couples one or more bit lines corresponding to the selected column to a data bus. Through this coupling, data is transferred between the memory cell array  and the data bus. The sense amplifier & column selector  amplifies the data read from the memory cell array  for provision to the output buffer . The data is output from the output buffer  to the exterior of the device as output data. Input data supplied to the input buffer  is provided to the write amplifier . The write amplifier  amplifies the input data to be written to the memory cell array .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"The memory cell includes NMOS transistors  and , a PMOS transistor , NMOS transistors  through , PMOS transistors  and , and NMOS transistors  and . The NMOS transistors  and  PMOS transistors  and  together constitute a volatile memory unit (latch circuit) . The NMOS transistors  and  constitute a nonvolatile memory unit . The NMOS transistors  and  serving as nonvolatile memory cell transistors have the same structure as the other NMOS transistors including the NMOS transistors  through  used in the volatile memory unit and the NMOS transistors  and  used as a transfer gate between the memory cell and the bit lines.","As shown in , bit lines BL and \/BL extend from the write amplifier  and the sense amplifier & column selector , and are coupled to the volatile memory unit  via the NMOS transistors  and  serving as a data transfer unit. A word selecting line WLW extends from the row signal driver , and is coupled to the gate nodes of the NMOS transistors  and  serving as the nonvolatile memory unit . A word line WL extends from the row signal driver  to be connected to the gates of the NMOS transistors  and . Further, a restore line RESTORE, plate line (controlled-power line) PL, and equalize line EQ also extend from the row signal driver .","It should be noted that the configuration shown in  is identical with respect to each and every one of the memory cells provided in the memory cell array . Namely, multiple sets of the lines RESTORE, PL, WLW, EQ, and WL are provided in one-to-one correspondence to the rows of the memory cell array . In this configuration, a store operation (storing data from the volatile memory unit  to the nonvolatile memory unit ) and a restore operation (reading data from the nonvolatile memory unit  to the volatile memory unit ) may be performed with respect to the entirety of the memory cell array , rather than performed on a row-address-specific basis. Read\/write operations of the volatile memory unit  with respect to the bit lines BL and \/BL may be performed on a row-address-specific basis.","The store operation of the nonvolatile memory device  will now be briefly described. When the mode input from the exterior of the device indicates a store operation, the control lines PL, RESTORE, WLW, EQ, and WL are set to EXTRA-HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, HIGH, and LOW, respectively. EXTRA-HIGH is an extra-high voltage Vpp (e.g., 3.3 V), and HIGH is a power supply voltage Vdd (e.g., 1.8V). The potentials of the node C and the node \/C are inverse to each other, and the data stored in the latch circuit (NMOS transistors  and  and PMOS transistors  and ) determines which one of the nodes C and \/C is HIGH. For the sake of convenience of explanation, it is assumed that the node \/C is HIGH (Vdd=1.8 V), and the node C is LOW (GND: ground). In this case, only the NMOS transistor  experiences a rise in the threshold voltage due to a hot-carrier effect. The NMOS transistor  does not experience a change in the threshold voltage. This achieves the storing of the data of the volatile memory unit  in the nonvolatile memory unit .","During the store operation as described above, the high potential (3.3 V) is never applied to the latch circuit. This is because the NMOS transistors  and  serve as intervening circuit elements between the plate line PL (Vpp=3.3 V) and the nodes C and \/C. Since the word selecting line WLW is set to HIGH, and the nodes C and \/C are serving as source nodes, the potentials at the nodes C and \/C cannot exceed HIGH minus the threshold voltage. In this configuration, therefore, a hot-carrier effect does not happen in the transistors used in the latch circuit (volatile memory unit ).","In the following, the restore operation of the nonvolatile memory device  will be briefly described. When the mode input from outside the device indicates a restore operation, the control lines PL, RESTORE, WLW, EQ, and WL are set to LOW, LOW\u2192LOW\u2192HIGH, LOW\u2192HIGH\u2192LOW, LOW\u2192HIGH\u2192HIGH, and LOW, respectively. Here, LOW\u2192HIGH\u2192LOW, for example, indicates that the signal level is set to LOW at a first phase, HIGH at a second phase, and LOW at a third phase.","At the first phase, the signal RESTORE is set to LOW, and the signal EQ is set to LOW. As a result, the NMOS transistor  in  becomes nonconductive to deactivate the volatile memory unit , and the PMOS transistor  in  becomes conductive to equalize the nodes C and \/C.","At the second phase, the signal EQ is set to HIGH, and the word selecting line WLW is set to HIGH. As a result, the PMOS transistor  is turned off to separate the nodes C and \/C from each other, and the NMOS transistors  and  are turned on. Assuming that the store operation as described above has been performed prior to the restore operation, the NMOS transistor  has a higher threshold voltage, and thus has a higher ON resistance. Accordingly, the force that pulls down the node C is weaker than the force that pulls down the node \/C, resulting in the nodes C and \/C changing to HIGH and LOW, respectively.","At the third phase, the signal RESTORE is set to HIGH, and the word selecting line WLW is set to LOW. As a result, the NMOS transistor  becomes conductive to activate the volatile memory unit , and the NMOS transistors  and  are turned off. The activated volatile memory unit  amplifies a potential difference appearing between the node C and the node \/C, thereby sensing (detecting) the data stored in the nonvolatile memory unit .","In the configuration described above, a drain node and a source node of the NMOS transistors  and  used to apply a bias for generating the hot-carrier effect are swapped and used as a source node and a drain node, respectively, at the time of reading the data. With the swapping of the source and drain nodes at the time of data read operation relative to the time of data write operation, a change in the transistor characteristics caused by the hot-carrier effect is efficiently used as a means to store data. It should be noted, however, that the storing and reading (restoring) of data can be performed without such swapping of source and drain nodes, as described in PCT\/JP2003\/016143, for example. The swapping of drain and source nodes merely serves to utilize asymmetry of a hot-carrier effect. Namely, when the source node and drain node used to apply a bias for generating a hot-carrier effect are swapped and used as a drain node and a source node, respectively, at the time of detecting a drain current, the detected drain current exhibits a larger drop caused by the hot-carrier effect than would be observed when no swapping was performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},"As shown in , bit lines BL extend from the write amplifier  and the sense amplifier & column selector , and are coupled to memory cells (i.e., NMOS transistors) . Further, a reference bit line RBL extends from the write amplifier  and the sense amplifier & column selector , and is coupled to reference cells (i.e., NMOS transistors)  each serving as a constant current source. The NMOS transistor  may be designed such that its ON current is smaller than the ON current of the NMOS transistor  having experienced no hot-carrier effect, and is larger than the ON current of the NMOS transistor  having experienced a hot-carrier effect. Word selecting lines WLW extend from the row signal driver  to be coupled to the gates of the NMOS transistors  and to the gates of the NMOS transistors . Plate lines PL also extend from the row signal driver  to be connected to the source\/drain of the NMOS transistors  and to the source of the NMOS transistors .","In the case of a data write operation, a selected bit line BL corresponding to a selected column carries write data supplied from an external source. The row signal driver  sets a selected word selecting line WLW to 1.8 V, and sets the remaining word selecting lines WLW to 0 V. Further, the row signal driver  sets a selected plate line PL to 3.3 V, and sets the remaining plate lines PL to 0 V. This causes the NMOS transistor  on the selected row at the selected column to experience a hot-carrier effect or not to experience a hot-carrier effect, depending on the value of the corresponding data bit carried on the selected bit line BL. Further, the write amplifier  and sense amplifier & column selector  may be designed such that the reference bit line RBL is placed in a floating state, for example. This ensures that the threshold voltages of the NMOS transistors  are not changed by a hot-carrier effect.","In the case of a data read operation, the row signal driver  sets a selected word selecting line WLW to 1.8 V, and sets the remaining word selecting line WLW to 0 V. All the plate lines PL are kept at 0 V in the data read operation. A selected bit line BL corresponding to a selected column is coupled to a latch which may be provided in the sense amplifier & column selector . The reference bit line RBL is also coupled to this latch. The latch senses the data stored in the NMOS transistor  on the selected row at the selected column by comparing a data current flowing through this NMOS transistor  with a reference current flowing through the NMOS transistor  arranged on the same selected row.","In the following, a test mechanism provided in the semiconductor memory device  will be described. A cell test circuitry is provided together with the write amplifier & sense amplifier & column selector , . In a test operation mode, the cell test circuitry detects a current flowing through the NMOS transistor  or  in the case of the cell-array configuration shown in , and detects a current flowing through a selected one of the NMOS transistors  in the case of the cell-array configuration shown in . It should be noted that, when the NMOS transistor  or  is to be tested, the word line WL is activated to turn on the NMOS transistors  and .","The detected current is supposed to flow in proper amount when the tested NMOS transistor , , or  is tuned on and thus conductive. No current is supposed to flow when the tested NMOS transistor , , or  is tuned off and thus nonconductive. The cell test circuitry provided in the semiconductor memory device  is configured to detect an amount of current flowing through the tested memory cell transistor. One or more signals indicative of the detected current amount is output to outside the semiconductor memory device , thereby informing a user of the test results. With this provision, the amount of current flowing through a cell transistor prior to hot-carrier injection may be tested to determine whether the cell transistor has been properly manufactured. Also, the amount of current flowing through a cell transistor after hot-carrier injection may be tested to determine whether the cell transistor is placed in a properly stored state.","The sense amplifier & column selector  inclusive of the cell test circuitry and the row signal driver  are controlled by the mode selector  to perform the above-noted test operation. A memory cell transistor that is to be tested may be specified by a row address and a column address applied from outside the semiconductor memory device . The specified memory cell transistor may be coupled to the cell test circuitry under the control of the sense amplifier & column selector  and the row signal driver . The test operation described herein may be performed with respect to each of the cell transistors  and  or  of all the memory cells.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["41","44","45","46","47","1","47","16","41","43","41","47","1","47","16","47","1","47","16","43","46","21","29"],"sub":["ref1 ","ref16 ","BL","BL "]},"The NMOS transistors - through - have the gate nodes thereof to which reference select signals MEAS[0] through MEAS[15] are applied, respectively.

The present invention is not limited to such an example, and is applicable to any memory device in which memory cell transistors are used to store data bits. Such a memory device is not limited to a nonvolatile memory device, and may be a volatile memory device. The cell test circuitry disclosed heretofore may be used to test the memory cell transistors embedded in such a memory device. Further, memory cell transistors to be tested are not limited to N-channel transistors, and may be P-channel transistors. Those skilled in the art would easily recognize that the testing of P-channel transistors can be performed basically in the same manner as in the case of the testing of N-channel transistors. Modification to be made to the test cell circuitry disclosed heretofore for the purpose of testing P-channel transistors requires only a routine skill in the art.","Moreover, the embodiments described heretofore have been directed to an example in which a reference current is successively increased. This is not intended to be limiting in any manner. The reference current may be successively decreased, and the first current to go below a test current may be used to indicate the amount of test current.","Further, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, but various variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects and further features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 14","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 15","FIG. 13"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIGS. 17A through 17D","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 18","FIG. 19"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 21","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 23","FIG. 21"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 26","FIG. 10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 27","FIG. 26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIGS. 28A through 28D","FIG. 27"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 29","FIG. 27"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 30A and 30B","FIG. 26"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 31","FIG. 30A"],"b":"31"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 32"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 33","FIG. 30B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 34","FIG. 30B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 30B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIGS. 36A and 36B","FIG. 26"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
