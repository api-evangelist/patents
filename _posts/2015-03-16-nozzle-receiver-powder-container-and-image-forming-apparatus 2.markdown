A toner container described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2012-133349 and Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No 2009-276659 includes a rotatable cylindrical powder storage, a nozzle receiver attached to the powder storage, an opening arranged on the nozzle receiver, and an opening\/closing member that moves to a closing position at which the opening is closed and to an opening position at which the opening is opened along with insertion of the conveying nozzle of the powder replenishing device. When the opening\/closing member is moved to the opening position by the conveying nozzle inserted in the toner container along with attachment of the toner container to the powder replenishing device, the opening\/closing member moves toner located near the opening.","In the configuration as described above, if there is no escape for toner that moves with the movement of the opening\/closing member, the toner is compressed and cohered, and prevents the opening\/closing member from moving to the closing position when the toner container is detached from the powder container, for example.","It is an object of the present invention to cope with the abovementioned issues.","According to an embodiment, a nozzle receiver is to be arranged in a powder container used in an image forming apparatus. The nozzle receiver includes a nozzle receiving opening, in which a conveying nozzle for conveying powder supplied from the powder container is inserted in the image forming apparatus; an opening\/closing member to open and to close the nozzle receiving opening; and a supporter to support the opening\/closing member. The opening\/closing member includes a sealing portion to seal the nozzle insertion opening. The supporter includes an end surface portion perpendicular to a moving direction of the opening\/closing member. The projection area of the end surface portion in the moving direction of the opening\/closing member is smaller than a projection area of the sealing portion in the moving direction of the opening\/closing member.","Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the descriptions of the embodiments and conventional configurations, the same components or components with the same functions are basically denoted by the same reference symbols, and the same explanation will not be repeated in subsequent embodiments and conventional configurations. The descriptions below are mere examples and do not limit the scope of the appended claims. Further, a person skilled in the art may easily conceive other embodiments by making modifications or changes within the scope of the appended claims; however, such modifications and changes obviously fall within the scope of the appended claims. In the drawings, Y, M, C, and K are symbols appended to components corresponding to yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively, and will be omitted appropriately.","A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below. The first embodiment includes techniques according to first to third examples to be described later.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["500","500","500","100","200","400","100"]},"Four toner containers Y, M, C, K serving as powder containers corresponding to different colors (yellow, magenta, cyan, black) are detachably (replaceably) attached to a toner container holder  serving as a container holding section provided in the upper part of the printer . An intermediate transfer device  is arranged below the toner container holder .","The intermediate transfer device  includes an intermediate transfer belt  serving as an intermediate transfer medium, four primary-transfer bias rollers Y, M, C, K, a secondary-transfer backup roller , multiple tension rollers, an intermediate-transfer cleaning device, and the like. The intermediate transfer belt  is stretched and supported by multiple rollers and endlessly moves counterclockwise in  along with rotation of the secondary-transfer backup roller  serving as one of the rollers.","In the printer , four image forming sections  (Y, M, C, K), as image forming units, corresponding to the respective colors are arranged in tandem so as to face the intermediate transfer belt . Four toner replenishing devices Y, M, C, K serving as powder supply (replenishing) devices corresponding to the four toner containers Y, M, C, K of the four colors are arranged below the toner containers Y, M, C, K, respectively. The toner replenishing devices Y, M, C, K respectively supply (replenish) toner that is powder developer contained in the toner containers Y, M, C, K to developing devices of the image forming sections Y, M, C, K for the respective colors. In the embodiment, the four image forming sections Y, M, C, K form an image forming unit.","As illustrated in , the printer  includes an exposing device  serving as a latent-image forming means below the four image forming sections Y, M, C, K. The exposing device  exposes and scans the surfaces of photoconductors Y, M, C, K serving as image bearers (to be described later) with light based on image information of an original image read by the scanner , so that electrostatic latent images are formed on the surfaces of the photoconductors. The image information may be input from an external apparatus, such as a personal computer, connected to the copier , instead of being read by the scanner .","In the embodiment, a laser beam scanning system using a laser diode is employed as the exposing device . However, other configurations, such as a configuration including an LED array, may be employed as the exposing means.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"46"},"The image forming section Y includes the drum-shaped photoconductor Y. The image forming section Y includes a charging roller Y serving as a charging device, a developing device Y serving as a developing means, a cleaning device Y serving as a photoconductor cleaning device, a neutralizing device, and the like, all of which are arranged around the photoconductor Y. Image forming processes (a charging process, an exposing process, a developing process, a transfer process, and a cleaning process) are performed on the photoconductor Y, so that a yellow toner image is formed on the photoconductor Y.","The other three image forming sections M, C, K have almost the same configurations as the image forming section Y for yellow except that colors of toner to be used are different and toner images corresponding to the respective toner colors are formed on the photoconductors M, C, K. Hereinafter, explanation of only the image forming section Y for yellow will be given, and explanation of the other three image forming sections  (M, C, K) will be omitted appropriately.","The photoconductor Y is rotated clockwise in  by a drive motor. The surface of the photoconductor Y is uniformly charged at a position facing the charging roller Y (charging process). Subsequently, the surface of the photoconductor Y reaches a position of irradiation with laser light L emitted by the exposing device , where an electrostatic latent image for yellow is formed through exposure scanning (exposing process). The surface of the photoconductor Y then reaches a position facing the developing device Y, where the electrostatic latent image is developed with yellow toner to form a yellow toner image (developing device).","The primary-transfer bias roller Y of the intermediate transfer device  and the photoconductor Y sandwich the intermediate transfer belt , so that a primary transfer nip for yellow is formed. A transfer bias with polarity opposite to the polarity of toner is applied to the primary-transfer bias roller Y.","The surface of the photoconductor Y, on which the toner image is formed through the developing process, reaches the primary transfer nip facing the primary-transfer bias roller Y across the intermediate transfer belt , and the toner image on the photoconductor Y is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  at the primary transfer nip (primary transfer process). At this time, a slight amount of non-transferred toner remains on the photoconductor Y. The surface of the photoconductor Y, from which the toner image has been transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  at the primary transfer nip, reaches a position facing the cleaning device Y. At this position, the non-transferred toner remaining on the photoconductor Y is mechanically collected by a cleaning blade included in the cleaning device Y (cleaning process). The surface of the photoconductor Y finally reaches a position facing the neutralizing device, where the residual potential on the photoconductor Y is removed. In this way, a series of the image forming processes performed on the photoconductor Y is completed.","The above image forming processes are also performed on the other image forming sections M, C, K in the same manner as the image forming section Y for yellow. Specifically, the exposing device  arranged below the image forming sections M, C, K emits laser light L based on the image information toward the photoconductors M, C, K of the image forming sections M, C, K. More specifically, the exposing device  emits the laser light L from a light source and irradiates each of the photoconductors M, C, K with the laser light L via multiple optical elements while performing scanning with the laser light L by a rotating polygon mirror.","Subsequently, toner images of the respective colors formed on the photoconductors M, C, K through the developing process are transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  due to the action of transfer biases applied to the respective primary-transfer bias rollers at the four-color primary-transfer nips that are formed by sandwiching the intermediate transfer belt  between the primary-transfer bias rollers M, C, K and the photoconductors M, C, K.","At this time, the intermediate transfer belt  moves counterclockwise in  and sequentially passes through the primary transfer nips of the primary-transfer bias rollers Y, M, C, K. Therefore, the toner images of the respective colors on the photoconductors Y, M, C, K are primary-transferred to the intermediate transfer belt  in a superimposed manner, so that a color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .","The intermediate transfer belt , on which the color toner image is formed by the superimposed toner images of the respective colors, reaches a position facing a secondary-transfer roller . At this position, the secondary-transfer backup roller  and the secondary transfer roller  sandwich the intermediate transfer belt , so that a secondary transfer nip is formed. The color toner image formed on the intermediate transfer belt  is transferred to a recording medium P, such as a sheet of paper, conveyed to the position of the secondary transfer nip, due to the action of a transfer bias applied to the secondary-transfer backup roller , for example. At this time, non-transferred toner which has not been transferred to the recording medium P remains on the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt  that has passed through the secondary transfer nip reaches the position of the intermediate-transfer cleaning device, where the non-transferred toner remaining on the surface is collected. In this way, a series of transfer processes performed on the intermediate transfer belt  is completed.","Movement of the recording medium P will be explained below.","The recording medium P is conveyed to the secondary transfer nip from a feed tray  provided in the sheet feeder  arranged below the printer  via a feed roller , a registration roller pair , and the like. Specifically, multiple recording media P are stacked in the feed tray . When the feed roller  is rotated counterclockwise in , the topmost recording medium P is fed to a nip between two rollers of the registration roller pair .","The recording medium P conveyed to the registration roller pair  temporarily stops at the position of the nip between the rollers of the registration roller pair , the rotation of which is being stopped. The registration roller pair  is rotated to convey the recording medium P toward the secondary transfer nip in accordance with the timing at which the color toner image on the intermediate transfer belt  reaches the secondary transfer nip. Accordingly, a desired color image is formed on the recording medium P.","The recording medium P on which the color toner image is transferred at the secondary transfer nip is conveyed to the position of a fixing device . In the fixing device , the color toner image transferred on the surface of the recording medium P is fixed to the recording medium P by heat and pressure applied by a fixing belt and a pressing roller. The recording medium P that has passed through the fixing device  is discharged to the outside of the apparatus via a nip between rollers of a discharge roller pair . The recording medium P discharged to the outside of the apparatus by the discharge roller pair  is sequentially stacked, as an output image, on a stack section . In this way, a series of image forming processes in the copier  is completed.","A configuration and operation of the developing device  in the image forming section  will be explained in detail below. In the following, the image forming section Y for yellow will be explained by way of example. However, the image forming sections M, C, K for the other colors have the same configurations and perform the same operation.","As illustrated in , the developing device Y includes a developing roller Y serving as a developer bearer, a doctor blade Y serving as a developer regulating plate, two developer conveying screws Y, a toner density sensor Y, and the like. The developing roller Y faces the photoconductor Y. The doctor blade Y faces the developing roller Y. The two developer conveying screws Y are arranged inside two developer accommodating sections, i.e., first and second developer accommodating sections Y and Y. The developing roller Y includes a magnet roller disposed inside thereof, a sleeve that rotates around the magnet roller, and the like. Two-component developer G containing carrier and toner is stored in the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y. The second developer accommodating section Y communicates with a toner dropping passage Y via an opening provided in the upper side thereof. The toner density sensor Y detects a toner density in the developer G stored in the second developer accommodating section Y.","The developer G in the developing device  circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being stirred by the two developer conveying screws Y. The developer G in the first developer accommodating section Y is supplied to and borne on the surface of the sleeve of the developing roller Y due to a magnetic field generated by the magnet roller in the developing roller Y while the developer G is being conveyed by one of the developer conveying screws Y. The sleeve of the developing roller Y rotates counterclockwise as indicated by an arrow in , and the developer G borne on the developing roller Y moves on the developing roller Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this time, the toner in the developer G electrostatically adheres to the carrier by being charged to the potential opposite to the polarity of the carrier due to triboelectric charging with the carrier in the developer G, and is borne on the developing roller Y together with the carrier that is attracted by the magnetic field generated on the developing roller Y.","The developer G borne on the developing roller Y is conveyed in the arrow direction in  and reaches a doctor section where the doctor blade Y and the developing roller Y face each other. The amount of the developer G on the developing roller Y is regulated and adjusted to an appropriate amount when the developer G passes through the doctor section, and then the developer G is conveyed to a development area facing the photoconductor Y. In the development area, the toner in the developer G adheres to the latent image formed on the photoconductor Y by a developing electric field generated between the developing roller Y and the photoconductor Y. The developer G remaining on the surface of the developing roller Y that has passed through the development area reaches the upper side of the first developer accommodating section Y along with the rotation of the sleeve. At this position, the developer G is separated from the developing roller Y.","The developer G in the developing device Y is adjusted so that the toner density falls within a predetermined range. Specifically, toner contained in the toner container Y is replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y by the toner replenishing device Y (to be described later) through the toner dropping passage Y in accordance with the consumption of toner of the developer G in the developing device Y through the development. The toner replenished to the second developer accommodating section Y circulates between the first developer accommodating section Y and the second developer accommodating section Y while being mixed and stirred with the developer G by the two developer conveying screws Y.","Next, the toner replenishing devices Y, M, C, K will be described.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["32","32","32","32","70","32","60","60","60","60","60","60","32","60","60","60","32","32","32","32","60","1","32","60"]},"Incidentally, the diameter of the toner container K containing black toner among the four toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) may be increased relative to the diameters of the toner containers  (Y, M, C) containing yellow toner, magenta toner, and cyan toner. With this configuration, it is possible to reduce the frequency to replace the toner container K containing black toner that is frequently used. Even in this case, the toner replenishing devices  have approximately the same configurations except that the colors of toner used in the image forming processes and the diameters of the toner containers  vary from one another. Therefore, the toner container Y will be mainly described below.","The yellow toner contained in the toner container Y among the toner containers Y, M, C, K for the respective colors attached to the toner container holder  of the printer  illustrated in  is appropriately replenished to the developing device in accordance with the consumption of toner in the developing device  as illustrated in . At this time, the toner in the toner container Y is replenished by the toner replenishing device Y. The toner replenishing device Y includes the toner container holder , a conveying nozzle Y serving as a conveying pipe, a conveying screw Y serving as a main body conveyor, the toner dropping passage Y, a driving part Y serving as a container rotating part, and the like. The toner replenishing devices for the other colors have the same configurations. When a user performs attachment operation to push the toner container Y in the attachment direction Q in  and the toner container Y is moved inside the toner container holder  of the printer  along with the attachment direction Q, the conveying nozzle Y of the toner replenishing device Y is inserted from a front side of the toner container Y in the attachment operation. Therefore, the toner container Y and the conveying nozzle Y communicate with each other. A configuration for the communication along with the attachment operation will be described in detail later.","The toner container Y may be referred to as a toner bottle. The toner container Y mainly includes a container front end cover Y serving as a container cover or a held portion that is non-rotatably held by the toner container holder , and includes an approximately cylindrical container body Y serving as a powder storage integrated with a container gear Y serving as a container-side gear. The container body Y is rotatably held by the container front end cover Y. In , a setting cover Y is a part of a container cover receiving section  of the toner container holder .","As illustrated in , the toner container holder  mainly includes the container cover receiving section , a container receiving section , and an insertion hole part . The container cover receiving section  is a section for holding the container front end covers Y, M, C, K and the container bodies Y, M, C, K of the toner containers Y, M, C, K for the respective colors. The container receiving section  is a section for supporting the container bodies Y, M, C, K of the toner containers Y, M, C, K. An insertion hole serving as an insertion opening used in the attachment operation of the toner containers Y, M, C, K is defined by the insertion hole part . When a main-body cover arranged on the front side of the copier  (the front side in the direction normal to the sheet of ) is opened, the insertion hole part  of the toner container holder  is exposed. Then, attachment\/detachment operation of the toner containers Y, M, C, K (attachment\/detachment operation with the longitudinal direction of the toner containers  taken as an attachment\/detachment direction in which the toner containers  of the respective colors are attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices ) is performed from the front side of the copier  while the toner containers Y, M, C, K are oriented with their longitudinal directions being parallel to the horizontal direction.","The container receiving section  is provided such that its longitudinal length becomes approximately the same as the longitudinal lengths of the container bodies Y, M, C, K of the respective colors. The container cover receiving section  is arranged on a container front side (a side in the attachment direction Q) of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction (attachment\/detachment direction), and the insertion hole part  is arranged on one end side (a side in the detachment direction Q) of the container receiving section  in the longitudinal direction. The four toner containers Y, M, C, K are able to moves on the container receiving section  in a sliding manner. Therefore, along with the attachment operation of the toner containers, the container front end covers Y, M, C, K first pass through the insertion hole part , slides on the container receiving section  for a while, and are finally attached to the container cover receiving section .","While the container front end cover Y is attached to the container cover receiving section , the driving part (container rotating part) Y including a driving motor, a driving gear, and the like as illustrated in  inputs rotation drive to the container gear Y that is a gear arranged in the container body Y, via a container driving gear Y serving as an apparatus main-body gear. Therefore, the container body Y is rotated in the arrow A direction in . With the rotation of the container body Y, a spiral rib Y formed in a spiral shape on the inner surface of the container body Y conveys toner in the container body Y from one end on the right side in  to the other end on the left side in  along the longitudinal direction of the container body. Namely, in the embodiment, the spiral rib Y serves as a rotary conveyor. Consequently, the toner is supplied to the inside of the conveying nozzle Y via a nozzle hole Y serving as a powder receiving hole provided on the conveying nozzle Y, and supplied from the other side of the toner container Y where the container front end cover Y is attached. The nozzle hole Y communicates with an opening of shutter supporting portion serving as a shutter side opening (to be described later), at an inner position relative to the position where the container gear Y is arranged in the longitudinal direction of the container body Y. Specifically, the container gear Y meshes with the container driving gear Y on a container opening side in the longitudinal direction of the toner container, relative to the position where the nozzle hole  and the opening of shutter supporting portion communicate with each other.","The conveying screw Y is arranged in the conveying nozzle Y. When the driving part (container rotating part) Y inputs the rotation drive to a conveying screw gear Y, the conveying screw Y rotates to convey the toner supplied in the conveying nozzle Y. A downstream end of the conveying nozzle Y in the conveying direction is connected to the toner dropping passage Y. The toner conveyed by the conveying screw Y falls along the toner dropping passage Y by gravity and is replenished to the developing device Y (the second developer accommodating section Y).","The toner containers Y, M, C, K are replaced with new ones at the end of their lifetimes (when the containers become empty because almost all of the contained toner is consumed). Grippers Y, M, C, K are arranged on one ends of the toner containers Y, M, C, K opposite to the container front end covers Y, M, C, K in the longitudinal direction in , that is, on the detachment direction Q sides. When the toner containers are to be replaced, an operator can grip the grippers Y, M, C, K to pull out and detach the toner containers Y, M, C, K attached to the toner container holder .","The configuration of the driving part  will be further described below with reference to . In , symbols representing the colors are omitted. The driving part  includes the container driving gear  and the conveying screw gear . When a driving motor  fixed to a mounting frame  is driven and an output gear is rotated, the container driving gear  rotates. The conveying screw gear  rotates by receiving the rotation of the output gear via a coupled gear .","As illustrated in , the toner replenishing device Y controls the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y in accordance with the rotation frequency of the conveying screw Y. Therefore, toner that passes through the conveying nozzle Y is directly conveyed to the developing device Y through the toner dropping passage Y without the need to control the amount of toner supplied to the developing device Y. Even in the toner replenishing device Y configured to insert the conveying nozzle Y into the toner container Y as described in the embodiment, it may be possible to arrange a temporary toner storage, such as a toner hopper. In the toner replenishing devices M, C, K for the other colors, the supply amount of toner is controlled in the same manner as in the toner replenishing device Y.","The toner containers Y, M, C, K and the toner replenishing devices Y, M, C, K according to the embodiment will be described in detail below. As described above, the toner containers Y, M, C, K and the toner replenishing devices Y, M, C, K have almost the same configurations except that the colors of toner to be used are different. Therefore, in the following descriptions, symbols Y, M, C, and K representing the colors of toner will be omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0134","num":"0133"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 9"],"b":["60","32","32","32","34","60","32","32","73","70"]},"The toner replenishing device  includes the conveying nozzle  in which the conveying screw  is arranged, and a nozzle shutter . The nozzle shutter  is slidably mounted on the outer surface of the conveying nozzle  so as to close the nozzle hole  at the time of detachment, which is before the toner container  is attached (in the state in ), and to open the nozzle hole  at the time of attachment, which is when the toner container  is attached (in the state in ). The nozzle shutter  includes a nozzle shutter flange serving as a flange on the downstream side in the attachment direction relative to an end surface of a nozzle receiver  serving as a nozzle insertion member (to be described later) that comes in contact with the conveying nozzle .","As illustrated in , a receiving opening , which serves as a nozzle insertion opening into which the conveying nozzle  is inserted at the time of attachment, is provided in the center of the front end of the toner container , and a container shutter , which serves as an opening\/closing member that closes the receiving opening  at the time of detachment, is arranged.","As illustrated in , the container receiving section  arranged on the toner container holder  is divided into four sections in a width direction W perpendicular to the longitudinal direction (attachment\/detachment direction) of the toner container , and gutters  serving as container mounting sections as illustrated in  are provided so as to extend from the insertion hole part  to the container cover receiving section  along the longitudinal direction of the container bodies  (Y, M, C, K). The toner containers  (Y, M, C, K) for the respective colors are able to move on the gutters  in a sliding manner in the longitudinal direction.","As illustrated in , on side surfaces and of the gutter , which are opposite surfaces arranged in the width direction W, the guide rails  are arranged so as to face each other. The guide rails  protrude in the width direction W from the respective side surfaces and , extend in the longitudinal direction, and are arranged in front of the container cover receiving section . The guide rails  have functions to guide the container opening serving as the opening to a container setting section  serving as a container receiving section by being fitted to sliding guides  serving as guiding portions on the toner container  side illustrated in  when the toner container  is attached to the printer  (the toner container holder  and the toner replenishing device ). Each of the guide rails  is provided so as to be parallel to the rotation axis of the container body  when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device .","As illustrated in , the setting cover  for each color is arranged on the container cover receiving section . The conveying nozzle  is arranged in the center of the setting cover . The conveying nozzle  is arranged so as to protrude from an end surface , which is on the inner side in the attachment direction, of the container setting section , which is located on the downstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container , toward the upstream side in the attachment direction inside the container cover receiving section . The container setting section  serving as the container receiving section is arranged in the protruding direction of the conveying nozzle , that is, toward the upstream side in the attachment direction of the toner container  so as to surround the conveying nozzle . Specifically, the container setting section  is arranged at the base of the conveying nozzle  and serves as a positioner to determine the position of the container opening relative to the toner container holder , where the container opening functions as a rotational shaft when the rotary conveyor inside the toner container  rotates to convey the toner contained in the toner container . Namely, when the container opening is inserted in and mated to the container setting section , the radial position of the container opening is determined.","When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , an outer surface of the container opening of the toner container  is slidably mated to the container setting section . On an inner surface of the container setting section , contact surfaces , which are parts of the inner surface of the container setting section  and which protrude inward in the radial direction from the inner surface of the container setting section , are provided at four evenly-spaced positions. The contact surfaces and the outer surface slide against each other with rotation of the toner container .","By the mating of the inner surface of the container setting section  and the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container , the position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  in the radial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction (attachment\/detachment direction) of the toner container  is determined. Further, when the toner container  rotates, the outer surface of the container opening functions as a rotational shaft, and the inner surface of the container setting section  functions as a bearing. In , a indicates the position at which the outer surface of the container opening comes in sliding contact with the contact surfaces as the parts of the inner surface of the container setting section  and at which the radial position of the toner container  relative to the toner replenishing device  is determined at this time.","In the descriptions below, it is repeatedly explained that the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container  and the container setting section  mate with each other in a slidable manner. The mating state is, in a precise sense, a state in which the outer surface of the container opening of the toner container  is in contact with the contact surfaces provided on the inner surface of the container setting section . Hereinafter, for simplicity of explanation, the mating will be referred to as mating the outer surface of the container opening with the inner surface of the container setting section  by omitting the contact surfaces ","As illustrated in , holes are provided so as to face each other in the width direction W of the setting cover . On the setting cover , replenishing device engaging members  (to be described later) are arranged so as to be able to move back and forth from the outer surface to an inner surface side of the setting cover  via the holes . The replenishing device engaging members  are biased from the outer side to the inner side of the setting cover  by biasing means, such as torsion coil springs .","The toner container  will be described below.","As illustrated in , the toner container  mainly includes the container body  containing toner, and includes the container front end cover . The container body  is in the form of an approximate cylinder and rotates about a central axis of the cylinder as a rotation axis. Hereinafter, one side of the toner container  where the receiving opening  is provided (the side where the container front end cover  is arranged) in the longitudinal direction of the toner container  may be referred to as \u201ca container front end\u201d. The other side of the toner container  where the gripper  is arranged (the side opposite the container front end) may be referred to as \u201ca container rear end\u201d. The longitudinal direction of the toner container  is the rotation axis direction, and corresponds to the horizontal direction when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device . The container rear end of the container body  relative to the container gear  has a greater outer diameter than that of the container front end, and the spiral rib  is provided on the inner surface of the container body . When the container body  rotates in the arrow A direction in the figures, a conveying force for moving toner from one end (the container rear end) to the other end (the container front end) in the rotation axis direction is applied to the toner in the container body  due to the action of the spiral rib .","As illustrated in , scooping portions , which scoop up the toner conveyed to the container front end by the spiral rib  along with the rotation of the container body  in the arrow A direction in the figures, are provided on the inner wall of the container front end of the container body . Each of the scooping portions  scoops up toner, which has been conveyed by the conveying force of the spiral rib , by using a scooping wall surface along with the rotation of the container body . Therefore, the toner can be scooped up so as to be located above the inserted conveying nozzle . As illustrated in  for example, a spiral rib of the scooping portion is formed in a spiral shape on the inner surface of each of the scooping portions  in order to convey the internally-located toner, similarly to the spiral rib .","As illustrated in , the container gear  is provided on the container front side relative to the scooping portions  on the container body .

The cover hooks  are thinner than the front surface (in , recessed toward the rear side relative to the front surface ), and the cover hooks  and the cover hook stopper  face each other in the attachment direction Q. Therefore, the movement of the container front end cover  relative to the container body  in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q is restricted. The restriction involves allowing the cover hooks  to move between the cover hook stopper  and the container gear  in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q in . Accordingly, the container body  becomes rotatable relative to the container front end cover .","In the first embodiment, \u201cthe rotation direction A\u201d is a direction in which the container front end cover  rotates relative to the container body  in the toner container  attached to the copier  (the toner replenishing device  and the toner container holder ), and \u201cthe attachment rotation direction R\u201d is a direction in which the container front end cover  (the cover hooks ) rotates relative to the container body  when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body .

The conveying nozzle  for conveying toner supplied from the toner container  in the image forming apparatus is inserted in the receiving opening . The nozzle receiver  includes the container shutter  serving as an opening\/closing member, a container seal  serving as a seal, a container shutter supporter  serving as a supporter, a container shutter spring  serving as a biasing member, and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The container shutter  is inserted in and supported by the container shutter supporter  in a reciprocating manner so as to move to the opening position to open the receiving opening  by being pressed with insertion of the conveying nozzle , and to move a closing position to close the receiving opening  with removal of the conveying nozzle . Namely, the container shutter supporter  supports the container shutter  to guide the movement to the opening position and the closing position. The container shutter spring  is a coil spring that is arranged inside the container shutter supporter  and biases the container shutter  toward the closing position.","The container shutter supporter  includes a shutter rear end supporting portion  as a shutter rear portion, a pair of shutter side supporting portions as shutter side portions, the openings of shutter supporting portion as side openings, and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The shutter side supporting portions are arranged so as to face each other, and extend along the moving direction of the container shutter . One ends of the shutter side supporting portions are connected by the shutter rear end supporting portion , and the other ends are connected to the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion . The shutter side supporting portions and the openings of shutter supporting portion are arranged adjacent to each other in the rotation direction of the toner container. Namely, the container shutter supporter  has a shape in which cylindrical portions corresponding to the shutter side supporting portions from the nozzle receiver attachment portion  side to the shutter rear end supporting portion  are vertically cut out along the moving direction of the container shutter , and the openings of shutter supporting portion are provided in the cutout portions. The container shutter supporter  is configured such that the container shutter  can move along the insertion direction of the conveying nozzle  in a space S. The space S is enclosed by the pair of the shutter side supporting portions , the shutter rear end supporting portion , and the nozzle receiver attachment portion . In other words, the container shutter supporter  is configured to be able to guide the movement of the container shutter  to the opening position to open the receiving opening  and the closing position to close the receiving opening .","As illustrated in , the nozzle receiver  attached to the container body  rotates with the container body  when the container body  rotates. At this time, the shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver  rotate around the conveying nozzle  of the toner replenishing device . Therefore, the shutter side supporting portions being rotated alternately pass a space just above the nozzle hole  provided in the upper side of the conveying nozzle . Consequently, even if toner is instantaneously accumulated above the nozzle hole , because the shutter side supporting portions cross the accumulated toner and alleviate the accumulation, it becomes possible to prevent cohesion of the accumulated toner when the apparatus is not used and prevent a toner conveying failure when the apparatus is resumed. In contrast, when the shutter side supporting portions are located on the sides of the conveying nozzle  and the nozzle hole  and the opening of shutter supporting portion face each other, toner in the container body  is supplied to the conveying nozzle  as indicated by an arrow \u03b2 in .","As illustrated in , the container shutter  includes a front cylindrical portion serving as a closure, a slide area , a guiding rod serving as an elongated portion, and shutter hooks . The front cylindrical portion is a container front end portion to be tightly fitted to a cylindrical opening (the receiving opening ) of the container seal . The slide area is a cylindrical portion serving as a gliding portion or a sealing portion, which is provided on the container rear end relative to the front cylindrical portion . The slide area has an outer diameter slightly greater than that of the front cylindrical portion , slides on the inner surfaces of the pair of the shutter side supporting portions , and seals the receiving opening .","The guiding rod is a cylinder that stands from the inner side of the cylinder of the front cylindrical portion toward the container rear end, and serves a rod portion that prevents the container shutter spring  from being buckled when the guiding rod is inserted to the inside of the coil of the container shutter spring . A guiding rod sliding portion , serving as a flat guiding portion, includes a pair of flat surfaces that are provided on both sides across the central axis of the cylindrical guiding rod from the middle of the guiding rod . The container rear end of the guiding rod sliding portion is bifurcated into a pair of cantilevers as illustrated in . The shutter hooks are provided on ends of the cantilevers opposite to the base from which the guiding rod stands, and form an engaging portion to be hooked on the container shutter supporter . The shutter hooks and the guiding rod sliding portion are inserted in a rear end opening serving as a through hole provided on the shutter rear end supporting portion , and the shutter hooks are hooked on the rear end opening , so that the shutter hooks and the guiding rod sliding portion serve as a pair of hooks that prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter .","A front end of the container shutter spring  abuts against an inner wall surface of the front cylindrical portion , and a rear end of the container shutter spring  abuts against an inner wall surface that is an opposite surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion . At this time, the container shutter spring  is in a compressed state, so that the container shutter  receives a biasing force in a direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion  (to the right or toward the container front end in ). However, the shutter hooks provided on the container rear end of the container shutter  are hooked on the rear end opening of the shutter rear end supporting portion . Therefore, the container shutter  is prevented from moving further in the direction away from the shutter rear end supporting portion  in the state illustrated in .","Due to the hooked state between the shutter hooks and the shutter rear end supporting portion  and the biasing force of the container shutter spring , the position of the container shutter  is determined. Specifically, the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal  in the axial direction, both of which have a toner leakage preventing function of the container shutter , are determined relative to the container shutter supporter . Therefore, it becomes possible to determine the positions of the front cylindrical portion and the container seal  so that they can be fitted to each other, enabling to prevent toner leakage.","As illustrated in , the nozzle receiver attachment portion  is in the form of a cylinder, the outer diameter and the inner diameter of which are reduced in a stepped manner toward the container rear end. The diameters are gradually reduced from the container front end to the container rear end. As illustrated in , two outer diameter portions (outer surfaces AA and BB located in this order from the container front end) are provided on the outer surface, and five inner diameter portions (inner surfaces CC, DD, EE, FF, and GG located in this order from the container front end) are provided on the inner surface. The outer surfaces AA and BB on the outer surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. Similarly, the fourth inner diameter portion FF and the fifth inner diameter portion GG on the inner surface are connected by a tapered surface at their boundary. The inner diameter portion FF on the inner surface and the connected tapered surface correspond to a seal jam preventing space to be described later, and the ridge lines of these surfaces correspond to sides of a pentagonal cross-section to be described later.","As illustrated in , the pair of the shutter side supporting portions , which face each other and which have flake shapes obtained by cutting a cylinder in the axial direction, protrude from the nozzle receiver attachment portion . The ends of the two shutter side supporting portions on the container rear side are connected by the shutter rear end supporting portion . The nozzle receiver attachment portion  includes the inner diameter portion GG, which is the fifth portion from the front end, as a cylindrical inner surface having the same inner diameter as the diameter of the slide area of the container shutter . The third inner surface EE of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  is a virtual periphery that passes through longitudinal tips of nozzle shutter positioning ribs that are equally spaced at 45\u00b0. The container seal  with a quadrangular cylindrical (cylindrical tube shaped) cross section (the cross section in the cross-sectional view in ) is arranged so as to correspond to the inner surface EE. The container seal  is fixed to a vertical surface connecting the third inner surface EE and the fourth inner surface FF with adhesive agent, double-stick tape, or the like. The exposed surface of the container seal  opposite to the attachment surface (the right side in ) serves as an inner bottom of the cylindrical opening of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion  (the container opening).","Further, as illustrated in , the seal jam preventing space (a catch preventing space) is provided so as to correspond to the inner surface FF of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the connected tapered surface. The seal jam preventing space is a ring-shaped sealed space enclosed by three different parts. Specifically, the seal jam preventing space is a ring-shaped space enclosed by the inner surface (the fourth inner surface FF and the connected tapered surface) of the nozzle receiver attachment portion , the vertical surface on the attachment side of the container seal , and the outer surface from the front cylindrical portion to the slide area of the container shutter . A cross section of the ring-shaped space is in the form of a pentagon. The angle between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the end surface of the container seal  and the angle between the outer surface of the container shutter  and the end surface of the container seal  are 90\u00b0.","Functions of the seal jam preventing space will be described below. When the container shutter  moves toward the container rear end from the state in which the receiving opening  is closed by the container shutter , the inner surface of the container seal  slides against the front cylindrical portion of the container shutter . Therefore, the inner surface of the container seal  is pulled by the container shutter  and elastically deformed so as to move toward the container rear end. At this time, if the seal jam preventing space is not provided and the vertical surface (the attachment surface of the container seal ) continuing from the third inner surface is connected to the fifth inner surface GG so as to be perpendicular to each other, the following situation may occur. Specifically, the elastically-deformed portion of the container seal  may be caught between the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  sliding against the container shutter  and the outer surface of the container shutter , resulting in causing a jam. If the container seal  is jammed in the portion where the nozzle receiver attachment portion  and the container shutter  slide against each other, that is, between the front cylindrical portion and the inner surface GG, the container shutter  is firmly attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion , so that the receiving opening  may not be opened and closed.","In contrast, the nozzle receiver  according to the first embodiment is provided with the seal jam preventing space in the inner area thereof. The inner diameter of the seal jam preventing space (the inner diameter of each of the inner surface EE and the connected tapered surface) is smaller than the outer diameter of the container seal . Therefore, the entire container seal  can hardly be entered into the seal jam preventing space . Further, an area of the container seal  to be elastically deformed by being pulled by the container shutter  is limited, and the container seal  can be restored by its own elasticity before the container seal  is brought to and jammed at the inner surface GG. With this action, it becomes possible to prevent a situation in which the receiving opening  cannot be opened and closed because of the attached state between the container shutter  and the nozzle receiver attachment portion .","As illustrated in , the multiple nozzle shutter positioning ribs are provided so as to radially extend on the inner surface of the nozzle receiver attachment portion  that comes in contact with the outer periphery of the container seal . When the container seal  is attached to the nozzle receiver attachment portion , the vertical surface of the container seal  on the container front side slightly protrudes relative to the front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs in the rotation axis direction.","As illustrated in , when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , the nozzle shutter flange of the nozzle shutter  of the toner replenishing device  presses and deforms the protruding portion of the container seal  by being biased by a nozzle shutter spring . The nozzle shutter flange further moves inward and abuts against the container front ends of the nozzle shutter positioning ribs , thereby covering and sealing the front end surface of the container seal  from the outside of the container. Therefore, it becomes possible to ensure the sealing performance in the periphery of the conveying nozzle  at the receiving opening  in the attached state, enabling to prevent toner leakage.","The back side of a biased surface of the nozzle shutter flange biased by the nozzle shutter spring  abuts against the nozzle shutter positioning ribs , so that the position of the nozzle shutter  relative to the toner container  in the rotation axis direction is determined. Therefore, a positional relationship of the front end surface of the container seal , the front end surface of a front end opening  (an inner space of the cylindrical nozzle receiver attachment portion  arranged in the container opening as will be described later), and the nozzle shutter  in the rotation axis direction is determined.","The operation of the container shutter  and the conveying nozzle  will be described below with reference to . Before the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , as illustrated in , the container shutter  is biased by the container shutter spring  toward the closing position so as to close the receiving opening . The appearance of the container shutter  and the conveying nozzle  at this time is illustrated in . When the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device , as illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the receiving opening . When the toner container  is further pushed into the toner replenishing device , an end surface of the front cylindrical portion , which serves as an end surface of the container shutter  (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cthe end surface of the container shutter\u201d) and an end surface located in the insertion direction of the conveying nozzle  (hereinafter, referred to as \u201cthe front end (end surface) of the conveying nozzle\u201d) come in contact with each other. When the toner container  is further pushed from the state as described above, the container shutter  is pushed as illustrated in . Accordingly, as illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the shutter rear end supporting portion  from the receiving opening . Therefore, as illustrated in , the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the container body  and located at the set position. At this time, as illustrated in , the nozzle hole  is located at a position overlapping the opening of shutter supporting portion ","Subsequently, when the container body  rotates, toner scooped up above the conveying nozzle  by the scooping portions  falls in and is introduced into the conveying nozzle  via the nozzle hole . The toner introduced into the conveying nozzle  is conveyed inside the conveying nozzle  toward the toner dropping passage  along with the rotation of the conveying screw . Subsequently, the toner falls in and is supplied to the developing device  through the toner dropping passage .","A configuration of a conventional nozzle receiver \u2032 will be described below with reference to , and A to D. The same components as those of the nozzle receiver  of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference symbols.","Toner stored in the toner container  serving as a toner bottle contains air and has predetermined fluidity just after the toner is sealed in the toner container . However, the toner in the toner container  is gradually deaerated and the fluidity is reduced during transportation or storage. Therefore, it is preferable to shake the toner container  to mix the internal toner and air to thereby obtain the predetermined fluidity just before the toner container  is attached to the copier .","However, in some cases, the toner container  may be inserted without being shaken just before the toner container  is attached to the copier . In this case, as illustrated in , when the conveying nozzle  is inserted in the nozzle receiver \u2032, the container shutter  starts to move. At this time, toner with the reduced fluidity remains in the space S, which is defined by the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter \u2032 that guides the container shutter  and by the shutter rear end supporting portion \u2032 of the container shutter supporter \u2032 and in which the container shutter spring  is held. Further, in the conventional configuration, as illustrated in , the shutter rear end supporting portion \u2032 is formed in a cylindrical shape, and the projection area of the shutter rear end supporting portion \u2032 is greater than the projection area of a rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter ; therefore, toner is likely to be accumulated in the cylindrical portion. Further, as illustrated in , the projection area, which is indicated by the gray-shaded area, of an end surface portion of the supporter from which the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are excluded is made nearly equal to or slightly larger than the projection area in the same direction, which is indicated by the hatched area, of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter . Therefore, the toner is pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and an opposite surface of the nozzle receiver \u2032 facing the shutter rear end supporting portion \u2032.","At this time, if the toner has the predetermined fluidity, the toner can move away from the openings of shutter supporting portion \u2032. By contrast, when the fluidity is low, such as when the toner container  is inserted without being shaken, the toner is pressed and compressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and the opposite surface of the container shutter supporter \u2032 (the nozzle receiver \u2032) facing the shutter rear end supporting portion \u2032 as described above. When the toner container  is further pushed, the compressed toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter  and the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter \u2032 (the nozzle receiver \u2032). If the compressed and cohered toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter  and the two shutter side supporting portions of the container shutter supporter \u2032 (the nozzle receiver \u2032) as described above, the container shutter  is prevented from returning to the closing position when the toner container  is detached from the copier . Consequently, the toner container  may be detached while the receiving opening  remains open, resulting in toner leakage.","In a first example of the first embodiment, as illustrated in , the container shutter supporter  of the nozzle receiver  is configured as described below. Specifically, the end surface portion , which serves as the end surface portion of supporter, is provided on the shutter rear end supporting portion  of the container shutter supporter . At the end surface portion , portions other than the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are opened. Namely, when the portions is on both side of the end surface portion in the horizontal direction, the portions other than the portions are opened in the vertical direction. The end surface portion is an opposite portion facing the rear end surface of the slide area ","Specifically, the container shutter  includes the guiding rod serving as an elongated portion extending toward the end surface portion serving as the end surface portion of supporter.","The shutter rear end supporting portion  includes the end surface portion , which is a portion facing the rear end surface of the slide area , and includes the rear end opening provided on the end surface portion . The end surface portion is integrally formed with the two shutter side supporting portions , and the portions other than the portions connected to the shutter side supporting portions are opened. As illustrated in , the shutter rear end supporting portion  is configured such that, within the projection area in the direction perpendicular to the moving direction of the container shutter  of the shutter rear end supporting portion , the projection area, which is indicated by the gray-shaded area, of the end surface portion of the supporter from which the portions connected to the two shutter side supporting portions are excluded is smaller than the projection area in the same direction, which is indicated by the hatched area, of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter .","If the shutter rear end supporting portion  of the container shutter supporter  of the nozzle receiver  is configured as described above, the following advantage is achieved. Even when the container shutter  moves with insertion of the conveying nozzle , and then toner is moved by the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter , a first part of the toner moves to the inside of the toner container  without being compressed. The first part of the toner is toner moved by a region, which is of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and which does not overlap with the end surface portion in the moving direction of the container shutter . Further, a second part of the toner can easily move away from the opening of shutter supporting portion because the first part of the toner located nearby is moved. The second part of the toner is toner moved by a region, which is of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and which overlaps with the end surface portion in the moving direction of the container shutter .","If the area of the shutter rear end supporting portion  facing the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  is reduced, and even when the toner container  is attached to the copier  while the fluidity of toner is low, that is, even when the toner container  is attached without being shaken, it is possible to reduce the possibility that the toner is pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  of the container shutter supporter  of the nozzle receiver .","Meanwhile, the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  functions as a bottom portion serving as a receiver of the container shutter spring  that biases the container shutter  toward the closing position. As illustrated in , in the process of attaching the toner container , in which the container shutter  moves along with insertion of the conveying nozzle  and the container shutter spring  is compressed, the end surface portion receives the restoring force of the container shutter spring . Therefore, if the area of the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  is excessively reduced, the strength of the container shutter supporter  is reduced. If the strength is reduced, components may be broken during the process of attaching the toner container .","Therefore, as illustrated in , a tapered surface as an inclined surface is provided along an opening edge of the rear end opening of the inner wall surface with which the container shutter spring  on the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  comes in contact.  illustrates an appearance of the container shutter supporter .  is a cross-sectional view cut along the line in .  is an end view cut along the J-J line in . The tapered surface is provided along the entire opening edge of the rear end opening , which is tapered from the end surface portion toward the inside of the rear end opening . In other words, on the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion , the tapered surface is provided on the upstream surface in the moving direction, in which a container shutter  moves to the opening position, along the entire circumference of the opening edge of the rear end opening ","The tapered surface allows toner pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and the surface of the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  to easily move to the circumference, as compared to a flat surface. Therefore, if the tapered surface is maintained even if the area of the end surface portion (the surface ) as a flat surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  and as the bottom portion of the container shutter spring  is minimized, it becomes possible to let the toner out while maintaining the strength.","Further, in the first embodiment, as illustrated in , the container shutter supporter includes a protrusion that protrudes from the end surface portion in a longitudinal direction of the container shutter supporter. In other words, the protrusion protrudes from the end surface portion in an opening direction of the opening\/closing member. The protrusion extends in a direction parallel to the moving direction of the container shutter  and is arranged along the outer edge of a downstream surface (a container rear end surface when the nozzle receiver  is attached to the toner container ) in the moving direction in which the container shutter  of the shutter rear end supporting portion  moves toward the opening position.","With the above configurations of the tapered surface and the protrusion , even when the projection area of the shutter rear end supporting portion  is smaller than the projection area of the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter , it becomes possible to maintain the strength enough to prevent breakage when the restoring force due to the compression of the container shutter spring  is applied to the container shutter supporter .","As illustrated in , the flat guiding portion of the container shutter  is provided so as to face the shutter side supporting portions (vertical arrangement). The slide area of the container shutter  slides by being guided by the two shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver , and the strength in the non-guided direction (the strength parallel to the shutter side supporting portions ) is lower than the strength on the guided side. However, by arranging the flat guiding portion of the container shutter  so as to face the shutter side supporting portions (vertical arrangement), the strength against a force parallel to the shutter side supporting portions increases as compared to the configuration in which the flat guiding portion of the container shutter  is arranged so as to face the openings of shutter supporting portion (horizontal arrangement), and therefore, deformation due to the toner pressed between the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  and the end surface portion of the shutter rear end supporting portion  of the nozzle receiver  is less likely to occur, which is advantageous.","Further, as illustrated in , on the pair of the shutter side supporting portions facing each other in the container shutter supporter , stepped portions are provided so as to have mutually different widths in the moving direction of the container shutter . The shutter side supporting portions are divided into a first region Y and a second region Y, which has a smaller width than the first region Y, by the stepped portions . The second region Y is located on the shutter rear end supporting portion  side, and has a width corresponding to the diameter of the container shutter spring  that is configured by a coil spring. Therefore, it is possible to stably hold an end of the container shutter spring  in the space S.","The configuration of the container shutter supporter  is not limited to the configuration in which the stepped portions are arranged on the shutter side supporting portions . For example, as illustrated in , it is possible to employ a configuration that does not include the stepped portions on the shutter side supporting portions and does not include the regions Y and Y for the width.","A second example of the first embodiment will be described below. In the second example, explanation of the same configurations as those of the first example will be omitted appropriately, and the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols.","In the first example, as described above, if compressed and cohered toner enters between the slide area of the container shutter  and the two shutter side supporting portions of the nozzle receiver , the container shutter  may be prevented from returning to the closing position when the toner container  is detached from the copier , and, the toner container  may be detached while the receiving opening  remains open, resulting in toner leakage.","Therefore, the present inventors have studied a compressed state caused by the container shutter . The compressed state caused by the container shutter  will be described by the idea of a compression ratio.  illustrates a state before compression by the container shutter .  illustrates a state after compression. As illustrated in , a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion  in the closed state is assumed as a before-compression distance L1. As illustrated in , a distance from the rear end surface of the slide area of the container shutter  to the surface of the shutter rear end supporting portion in the opened state is assumed as an after-compression distance L2. The compression ratio is simply assumed as L1\/L2.","Specifically, assuming that L1 denotes a distance in the case where the container shutter  is at the closing position and L2 denotes a distance in the case where the container shutter  is at the opening position with regard to the distance between the rear end surface of the slide area opposite to the end surface portion and the end surface portion , L1\/L2 is set to be greater than one and not greater than two.","Experiments on a toner cohesion state were performed, in which the compression ratio (L1\/L2) was changed by changing the before-compression distance L1 and the after-compression distance L2. The results are illustrated in Table 1 below. In Table 1, a stroke indicates a stroke (L1-L2) of the container shutter . The evaluation of the experiments is indicated by \u2218, \u0394, and x. \u2218 indicates a state in which toner cohesion and toner leakage do not occur. \u0394 indicates a state in which toner cohesion occurs but toner leakage does not occur. x indicates a state in which toner cohesion and toner leakage occur.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0211","num":"0210"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Stroke"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"Compression",{}]},{"entry":["L1","L1 \u2212 L2","L2","Ratio","Result"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["76.5","57.4","19.1","4.01","x"]},{"entry":["85.5","57.4","28.1","3.04","\u0394"]},{"entry":["115","57.4","57.6","2.00","\u2218"]},{"entry":["155","57.4","97.6","1.59","\u2218"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Through the experiments by the present inventors, it is found that when L1\/L2 (the compression ratio) is set to be greater than one and not greater than two, it is possible to prevent a situation in which the compressed and cohered toner prevents the container shutter  from returning to the closing position at the time of detachment of the toner container  from the copier  and the toner container  is detached with the receiving opening  remaining open resulting in toner leakage.","The advantageous effect of a change in the compression ratio is not limited to the combination of the container shutter supporter  and the container shutter  of the embodiment.

Techniques according to the third example may preferably be implemented with the techniques described in the first and the second examples; however, even when the techniques according to the third example are implemented independently, the same advantageous effects as described below can be achieved.","In each of the examples, for convenience of assembly, as illustrated in , the container shutter  and the container shutter spring  are assembled with the container shutter supporter  to fabricate the nozzle receiver , and thereafter the nozzle receiver  is assembled with the container body  to fabricate the toner container .","The shutter hooks of the container shutter  are hooked on the rear end opening of the container shutter supporter  to prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter . However, during fabrication of the toner container  as described above, an external stress may be applied to the shutter hooks when the shutter hooks may bump against anything or may be touched by mistake, and the shutter hooks may be elastically deformed, resulting in causing the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter .","Further, in a process of fabrication of the toner container , the nozzle receiver  may be fabricated in a different place and then conveyed or transported to assemble the nozzle receiver  with the container body  to fabricate the toner container .

Therefore, an external stress is less likely to be applied to the shutter hooks , so that it becomes possible to prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter .","Further, even when the nozzle receiver  is conveyed or transported, a packing material for packing the nozzle receiver  is less likely to interfere with the shutter hooks or the packed nozzle receivers  are less likely to interfere with each other, so that it becomes possible to prevent the container shutter  from coming off from the container shutter supporter .","A second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the second embodiment, the same configurations as those of the first embodiment will be omitted appropriately, and the same components are denoted by the same reference symbols. Techniques according to the second embodiment may preferably be implemented with the techniques described in the first embodiment; however, even when the techniques according to the second embodiment are implemented independently, the same advantageous effects as described below can be achieved. Further, the second embodiment includes techniques according to fourth to eleventh examples to be described below.","First, a problem will be described.","In a comparative example illustrated in , when the container front end cover  and the container body  are assembled by being attached to each other, the container body  is inserted in the container front end cover  in the direction Q, and the container body  is moved in the attachment direction Q from the hole arranged in the center of the front surface of the container front end cover . In this case, the tongue-shaped cover hook  is elastically deformed so as to spread from the cover hook stopper  in the radial direction and then passes over the cover hook stopper , so that the front end of the cover hook  is hooked on a groove between the cover hook stopper  and the container gear . The cover hook stopper  is arranged along the entire circumferential direction, and the outer diameter of the cover hook stopper  is greater than the inner diameter of the hole . Therefore, the container front end cover  is restricted from moving in the direction Q, but is held so as to rotate relative to the container body . As described above, when the toner container  is held by the toner container holder , a stress (restoring force) for compressing the container shutter spring  and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied to the toner container  (the container front end cover ). Therefore, if the cover hook  is configured so as to be easily attached (elastically deformed) to the cover hook stopper , and when a pushing force is applied in the detachment direction Q, the container body  is easily detached from the container front end cover . By contrast, if the cover hook  is configured so as to be difficult to detach (less deformable) in order to prevent the container body  from being easily detached from the container front end cover , the cover hook  is not easily attached to the cover hook stopper .","Therefore, in the second embodiment, as illustrated in , the cover hook stopper  provided on the container body  includes the openings  through which the cover hooks  arranged on the container front end cover  respectively pass in the attachment\/detachment direction of the container body  perpendicular to the rotation direction. The cover hook stopper  serves as a restrictor, and the opening  serves as a notch or a cutout.","Herein, the attachment\/detachment direction of the container body  is a direction in which the toner container  is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices . However, an attachment\/detachment direction of the container front end cover  in which the container front end cover  is attached to and detached from the toner container body  is the same an opposite direction to the direction in which the toner container  is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing devices . Therefore, the term \u201cthe attachment direction\u201d used in the second embodiment has two meanings, \u201cthe attachment direction of the container body \u201d and \u201cthe detachment direction of the container front end cover \u201d. And the term \u201cthe detachment direction\u201d used in the second embodiment has two meanings, \u201cthe detachment direction of the container body \u201d and \u201cthe attachment direction of the container front end cover \u201d. Similarly, the term \u201cthe attachment direction Q\u201d used in the second embodiment has two meanings, \u201cthe attachment direction of the container body \u201d and \u201cthe detachment direction of the container front end cover \u201d; and the term \u201cthe detachment direction Q\u201d used in the second embodiment has two meanings, \u201cthe detachment direction of the container body \u201d and \u201cthe attachment direction of the container front end cover \u201d.","On the front surface of the container front end cover  in the attachment direction Q, the hole serving as a through hole is provided, which penetrates in the attachment\/detachment direction of the container body  and into which the container opening is inserted. The cover hooks  are provided such that the inner ends A protrude toward the center of the hole . As indicated by the dashed-line circle in , the tips of the inner ends A protrude inward relative to the outer periphery of the hole . The cover hooks  respectively pass through the openings  in the attachment\/detachment direction when the container body  rotates relative to the container front end cover . In the second embodiment, the three openings  are provided on the cover hook stopper  in the rotation direction. The openings  are arranged such that intervals between the openings  in the circumferential direction coincide with the intervals between the cover hooks  in the circumferential direction. In the second embodiment, the three cover hooks  and the three openings  are provided in the rotation direction; however, it is sufficient that at least one cover hook  and one opening  are provided.  illustrates a state into which the cover hook  is inserted in the cover hook stopper  from the state illustrated in . As illustrated in , a center side portion of the front surface and a outer side surface of the cover hook stopper  face each other. The cover hooks  are thinner than the front surface (in , recessed toward the rear side relative to the front surface ), and the cover hooks  and the cover hook stopper  face each other in the attachment direction Q. Therefore, the movement of the container front end cover  relative to the container body  in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q is restricted. The restriction involves allowing the cover hooks  to move between the cover hook stopper  and the container gear  in the attachment direction Q and the detachment direction Q in . Accordingly, the container body  becomes rotatable relative to the container front end cover .","Namely, in the configuration of the powder container described using the comparative example, the protrusion provided on the holder is elastically deformed in the radial direction so as to be hooked on the restrictor of the powder storage. Therefore, if the protrusion is configured to be easily detached or be difficult to detach, it becomes difficult to hook the restrictor on the protrusion, resulting in the reduced operability.","Therefore, the powder container according to the second embodiment includes a cylindrical powder storage to contain powder; a holder attachable to and detachable from the powder storage; a protrusion that is on one of the powder storage and the holder; and a restrictor that is on the other one of the powder storage and the holder and is to restrict the movement of the protrusion in the longitudinal direction of the powder storage. The powder storage is to rotate relative to the holder. The restrictor includes an opening through which the protrusion passes in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction when the holder is attached to the powder storage.","According to the second embodiment, the protrusion is provided on one of the powder storage and the holder that are rotatable relative to each other, and a restrictor, on which the protrusion is hooked and which extends in the rotation direction, is provided on the other one of the powder storage and the holder. Further, the restrictor includes the opening through which the protrusion passes in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction. Therefore, after the protrusion has passed through the opening, the hooked state between the opening and the protrusion is maintained. Consequently, it becomes possible to attach the protrusion to the restrictor without reducing the operability, enabling to prevent the protrusion from easily coming off, as compared to the conventional configuration.","Specific configurations of the cover hook  and the opening  will be described in each of the examples below. In the examples, \u201ca rotation direction A\u201d is a direction in which the container front end cover  rotates relative to the container body  in the toner container attached to the image forming apparatus, and \u201can attachment rotation direction R\u201d is a direction in which the container front end cover  (the cover hooks ) rotates relative to the container body  when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body . The three cover hooks  and the three openings  have the same configurations, respectively; therefore, the configurations and operation of the single cover hook  and the single opening  will be described as representatives. The outer diameter of the cover hook stopper  is equal to or greater than the inner diameter of the hole in the center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0232","num":"0231"},"figref":["FIGS. 37A and 37B","FIG. 37A","FIG. 37B","FIG. 37C"],"b":["3061","33","340","34","3061","340"]},"In the cover hook stopper  having a thickness in the attachment\/detachment direction, an end surface located in the attachment direction Q serves as a guiding surface toward the opening  when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body , and an end surface located in the detachment direction Q serves as a guiding surface toward the opening  at the time of detachment.","The cover hook  serving as the protrusion includes an inclined portion of the protrusion on an end surface serving as an end located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is inclined upward from the downstream side to the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface with a flat top surface. A surface of the cover hook  that is continued from the inclined portion is referred to as a bottom surface of the cover hook , which serves as a second surface of the protrusion. The bottom surface faces the end surface in the attachment operation of the container cover  to the container body . A surface of the cover hook  that is continued from the inclined portion and located on the side opposite to the bottom surface of the cover hook  is referred to as an upper surface of the cover hook , which serves as a first surface of the protrusion.","In the cover hook , the bottom surface of the cover hook  and the upper surface of the cover hook  serve as parallel planes parallel to each other. It is preferable that the bottom surface of the cover hook  and the end surface of the cover hook stopper  are parallel to each other in the state before the container front end cover  is attached to the container body  as illustrated in . It is also preferable that the upper surface of the cover hook  and the end surface are parallel to each other in the state in which the container front end cover  is attached to the container body . As illustrated in , the width (length) of the bottom surface of the cover hook  in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201cc\u201d, the width (length) of the upper surface of the cover hook  in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201ce\u201d, and the thickness between the bottom surface of the cover hook  and the upper surface of the cover hook , which is the thickness of the cover hook , in the attachment\/detachment direction is denoted by \u201cd\u201d. In the cover hook , as illustrated in , a width \u201cc\u201d of the bottom surface of the cover hook  (i.e., a length of the bottom surface in the rotation direction R) is greater than the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook . The cover hook  has a trapezoidal cross-section, in which the inclined portion serves as an inclined surface inclined downward from the upper surface of the cover hook  to the bottom surface of the cover hook  with respect to the rotation direction. In the descriptions below, it is assumed that the configuration of the cover hook  is the same in the fourth to the seventh examples.","A surface located on the downstream side of the opening  in the attachment rotation direction R serves as an opening inclined portion inclined in the same direction as the inclined portion of the protrusion. The opening  includes an opposite surface facing the opening inclined portion . The opposite surface is an inclined surface. In the fourth example, the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface are parallel planes parallel to each other.","As illustrated in , in the opening , an interval between the opening inclined portion and the opposite surface is denoted by \u201ct\u201d; the width (length) of the opening  on a first port side on the end surface side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201ca\u201d; and the width (length) of the opening  on a second port side in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201cb\u201d. The first port serves as an outlet port (a downstream end port, an outlet, or a first portion of the opening ). The second port serves as an inlet port (an upperstream end port, an inlet, or a second portion of opening). The second port of the opening  is one end of the opening  opened on the end surface and is located on the upstream side in the direction in which the protrusion  passes through the opening  when the container front end cover  serving as the holder is attached to the container body  serving as a powder storage. The first port of the opening  is the other end of the opening  opened on the end surface and is located on the downstream side in the direction in which the protrusion  passes through the opening  when the container front end cover  is attached to the container body . In the fourth example, the relation of (the thickness \u201cd\u201d of the cover hook )\u2266(the interval \u201ct\u201d of the opening ) and the relation of (the width \u201ca\u201d of the first port of the opening )<(the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook ) are satisfied.","The entering operation of the cover hook  at the opening  configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in , when the container front end cover  is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R, the cover hook  moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . When the inclined portion of the cover hook  is located above the second port of the opening , the cover hook  is pressed toward the opening  (from the upstream side to the downstream side in the detachment direction Q) as illustrated in . Accordingly, the cover hook  slightly deforms counterclockwise in the figures toward the inside of the opening  by using an end S of the second port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot, and enters the opening  with the inclined portion of the protrusion in the lead as illustrated in . Subsequently, as illustrated in , an end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook  passes by an end S of the second port of the opening  located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time, because the relation of (the thickness \u201cd\u201d of the cover hook )\u2266(the interval \u201ct\u201d of the opening ) is satisfied, the cover hook  passes through the opening  as illustrated in  and . When an upstream end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook  in the attachment rotation direction R passes by an end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R, the cover hook  is located such that the upper surface and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time, if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body  located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q of the container body  is set such that the cover hook  can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port , rotational displacement of the cover hook  in the opening  is smoothly performed, which is preferable.","That is, the opening  is configured such that when the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion , the cover hook  passes through the opening .","As described above, when the cover hook  passes through the opening  that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper , an engaged state is obtained, in which the upper surface of the cover hook  and the end surface of the cover hook stopper  face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore, it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body  and the container front end cover , and simplify the assembly and attachment.","Further, the width \u201ca\u201d of the first port of the opening  is smaller than the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook , so that even when the opening  and the cover hook  face each other after the container front end cover  is attached to the container body , the cover hook  does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore, for example, when the toner container  is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device , and even if a stress (restoring force) for compressing the container shutter spring  and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied to the toner container , the container body  and the container front end cover  are not detached from each other. Consequently, it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container  is attached and detached.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0242","num":"0241"},"figref":["FIGS. 39A to 39C","FIG. 39A","FIG. 39B","FIG. 39C"],"b":["3062","33","340","34","3062","340"]},"The opening  provided on the cover hook stopper  according to the fifth example differs from the opening  according to the fourth embodiment. The opening  includes an opening inclined portion and an opposite surface inclined in the same direction as the opening inclined portion . In the fifth example, the opposite surface is a surface moderately inclined by an acute angle, which is smaller than that of the opening inclined portion , from the downstream side to the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R.

The inclined portion of the protrusion is an inclined surface with a flat top surface. A first surface is provided so as to be connected to an end of the inclined portion . The first surface includes a standing surface standing in a direction perpendicular to the attachment rotation direction R. A bottom surface of the cover hook , which serves as a second surface of the protrusion, faces the end surface . A surface, which is continued from the inclined portion of the protrusion and located opposite to the bottom surface of the cover hook , is referred to as an upper surface of the cover hook . The upper surface serves as a first surface of the protrusion. An inclined surface opposite to the inclined portion of the protrusion serves as a side surface of the cover hook . A second surface parallel to the first surface is provided between the side surface and the upper surface of the cover hook .","In the cover hook , the width of the bottom surface of the cover hook  in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201cc\u201d; the width of the upper surface of the cover hook  in the attachment rotation direction R is denoted by \u201ce\u201d; and the thickness between the bottom surface and the upper surface of the cover hook , which is the thickness of the cover hook , in the attachment\/detachment direction is denoted by \u201cd\u201d. In the cover hook , the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook  and the width \u201cc\u201d of the bottom surface of the cover hook  are the same.","In the eleventh example, the relation of (the thickness \u201cd\u201d of the cover hook )\u2266(the interval \u201ct\u201d of the opening ), the relation of (the width \u201ca\u201d of the first port of the opening )<(the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook ), and the relation of _(the width \u201cc\u201d of the bottom surface of the cover hook )<(the width \u201cb\u201d of the second port of the opening ) are satisfied.","The entering operation of the cover hook  at the opening  configured as described above will be described with reference to . As illustrated in , when the container front end cover  is rotated in the attachment rotation direction R, the cover hook  moves from the right to the left on the end surface in . As illustrated in , when the cover hook  is located above the second port of the opening , because the relation of (the width \u201cc\u201d of the bottom surface of the cover hook )<(the width \u201cb\u201d of the second port of the opening ) is satisfied, the cover hook  falls in the second port of the opening  while being elastically deformed and then restored. The falling continues until the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion as illustrated in .","When the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion , the cover hook  rotates counterclockwise in the figures by using an end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook  located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R as a pivot on the opposite surface . Subsequently, as illustrated in , an end S defined by the inclined portion and the upper surface of the cover hook  passes by the end S of the second port of the opening  located on the downstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. At this time, because the relation of (the thickness \u201cd\u201d of the cover hook )\u2266(the interval \u201ct\u201d of the opening ) is satisfied, the end S of the cover hook  comes in contact with the opening inclined portion and the cover hook  passes through the opening  as illustrated in . At this time, the cover hook  rotates clockwise by using the contact portion between the opening inclined portion and the end S as a pivot. As illustrated in , the end S of the bottom surface of the cover hook passes by the end S of the first port located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R. Accordingly, the side surface of the cover hook  rotating clockwise passes through the first port , and the upper surface of the cover hook  and the end surface face each other as illustrated in . At this time, if the length of an interval SP between the end surface and a component of the container body  located on the downstream side in the detachment direction Q is set such that the cover hook  can sufficiently rotate and the end S can pass by the first port , rotational displacement of the cover hook  in the opening  is smoothly performed, which is preferable.","That is, the opening  is configured such that the inclined portion of the protrusion comes in contact with the opening inclined portion , the cover hook  passes through the opening .","When the cover hook  passes through the opening  that is provided in an inclined manner on the cover hook stopper  as described above, an engaged state is obtained, in which the upper surface of the cover hook  and the end surface of the cover hook stopper  face each other while maintaining the state of being hooked with each other. Therefore, it is possible to ensure the attached state between the container body  and the container front end cover , and simplify the assembly and attachment.","Further, the width \u201ca\u201d of the first port of the opening  is smaller than the width \u201ce\u201d of the upper surface of the cover hook , so that even when the opening  and the cover hook  face each other, the cover hook  does not easily pass through the opening . Therefore, for example, when the toner container  is attached to and detached from the toner replenishing device , and even if a stress (restoring force) for compressing the container shutter spring  and a stress caused by the compression of the nozzle shutter spring  are applied to the toner container , the container body  and the container front end cover  are not detached from each other. Consequently, it is possible to improve the operability when the toner container  is attached and detached.","Further, in the eleventh example, because the relation of (the width \u201cc\u201d of the bottom surface of the cover hook )<(the width \u201cb\u201d of the second port of the opening ) is satisfied, an angle at which the cover hook  passes through the opening  with respect to the rotation direction is smaller than that of the fourth example. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the interval SP as compared to the fourth example.","In the fourth to the eleventh examples, the attachment rotation direction R of the container front end cover  with respect to the container body  and the rotation direction A of the container body  with respect to the container front end cover  in the toner container  attached to the image forming apparatus are opposite to each other. Therefore, even when the toner container  is attached to the toner replenishing device  and the container body  is rotated, if each of the cover hooks has passed through each of the openings in the detachment direction Q and is maintained in the engaged state, each of the cover hooks is prevented from coming off from the cover hook stopper . For example, with reference to , if the container body  rotates in the rotation direction A relative to the container front end cover , the cover hook stopper  moves from the left to the right in the figure. In this case, even if a bottom end of the opening inclined portion comes in contact with the inclined portion of the protrusion, the cover hook stopper  moves upward with the aid of the inclined surface of the opening inclined portion . Therefore, rotation of the container body  relative to the container front end cover  is not restricted.","Further, when the container body  and the container front end cover  are rotated in the direction opposite to the assembly direction, and if the container body  is rotated in the rotation direction while being pressed toward the attachment direction Q, it is possible to easily guide each of the cover hooks to the inside of each of the openings from the end surface side. Therefore, the container body  and the container front end cover  can easily be detached when they are separated from each other. Consequently, the recyclability can be improved.","In the fourth to the eleventh examples, the end surface of the cover hook stopper  is assumed as the same plane except for the openings. However, a portion of the end surface on the upstream side in the rotation direction relative to the opening inclined portion may be provided so as to be lower in height than an end of the opening inclined portion on an insertion side in the detachment direction. In other words, when the cover hook stopper  is viewed with the second port of the opening facing upward, a portion of the cover stopper  on the upstream side in the rotation direction relative to the opening is lower in height than the end of the opening inclined portion on the second port side. In , in the configuration of the fourth example, an end surface  located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R relative to the opening  is provided such that the height thereof in the detachment direction Q is lower than that of the opening inclined portion side.","As described above, if the end surface  located on the upstream side in the attachment rotation direction R relative to the opening  is provided such that the height thereof in the detachment direction Q is lower than that of the opening inclined portion side, the inclined portion of the cover hook  and the opening inclined portion face each other when the container front end cover  is rotated. Therefore, it becomes not necessary to press the cover hook  in the detachment direction Q when the container body  and the container front end cover  are assembled, enabling to improve the operability.","The cover hooks ,  to  and the opening  to  described in the above described examples can be used in various combinations. For example, the combination of the opening  illustrated in  and the cover hooks  illustrated in  can be used.","In the above described, examples, the container body  and the container gear  are integrally formed. However, the container body  and the container gear  may be separately formed depending on the resin material used for the container body . In this case, as illustrated in , the cover hook stopper  is provided on the container gear , any of the above described openings is provided on the cover hook stopper  on the container gear , and the container gear  is attached to the container body  in an integrated manner.","In the above described examples, the restrictor and the opening are provided on the container body , and the cover hook is provided on the container front end cover . However, an arrangement opposite to those of the examples may be employed by providing the restrictor and the opening on the container front end cover  and providing the cover hook on the container body . In , the single opening  is provided on the front surface in the attachment direction so as to face the hole of the container front end cover , the cover hook stopper  is provided on the outer surface of the container opening of the container body  in the rotation direction (circumferential direction), and the single cover hook  is provided on the cover hook stopper .","In the above described examples, the powder container of the image forming apparatus has been explained as an application example of the configuration, which includes the protrusion of the embodiments, the restrictor that extends in the rotation direction and that is hooked on the protrusion, and the opening provided on the restrictor through which the protrusion can pass in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction.","However, the present invention is not limited to the image forming apparatus and the powder container used in the image forming apparatus. For example, in a supporting device  as illustrated in , a through hole  is provided on a plate-shaped frame  serving as a first member, and a restrictor  is provided on a bearing  serving as a second member that is detachably attached to the through hole  of the frame  and that rotatably supports a shaft  on which a gear  is mounted. The restrictor  also functions as a mounting flange of the bearing . A hook  serving as a protrusion is provided on the restrictor , and an opening , through which the hook  can pass in a direction perpendicular to the rotation direction, is provided on the through hole .","With this configuration, as illustrated in , the restrictor  of the bearing  is inserted in the through hole  from a surface on one side of the frame  and is then rotated. Accordingly, the hook  passes through the opening  from the surface to a surface on the other side of the frame , and the hook  is engaged with and attached to the other surface of the frame , so that the hooked state is maintained. Therefore, it is possible to ensure the attached state of the frame  and the bearing .","While the preferred embodiments of the present invention are described above, the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments.
