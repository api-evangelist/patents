{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","GOVERNMENT INTERESTS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of patent application 10\/979,017, which claims priority benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60\/515,779 filed on Oct. 30, 2003.","This invention was made with government support under contract number DAAD19-01-C-0073, awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to solid oxide fuel cells and more particularly, to solid oxide fuel cells of lightweight design.","A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFCs) is a type of fuel cell which reacts a fuel gas with an oxidant to generate DC electric current. SOFCs comprises an anode, an electrolyte and a cathode, and have been made from a variety of materials and in a variety of geometries. Fuel processing is required to render hydrocarbon fuels (such as propane, butane, etc.) suitable for SOFCs. For example, known designs for fuel processors include those done with a separate external reactor where a catalytic substrate processes a hydrocarbon fuel such as butane (CH), propane (CHs) or diesel fuel (JP-8 or JET-A) to a suitable fuel gas such containing carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H). CO and Hydrogen gas are then oxidized at an active area of a SOFC to carbon dioxide and water, with DC current generated. Non hydrocarbon fuels such as ammonia (NH) can also be transformed into SOFC fuel using one or more catalytic reactions.","It has become desirable to make solid oxide fuel cells as light as possible so that they may serve as a portable power source. An external reactor is bulky and is accompanied with significant inefficiencies in transfer of hot processed fuel gas from the reactor to the active area of the fuel cell. U.S. Patent Publication 10 2003\/0054215 to Doshi et al discloses a stack of fuel cell plates where a catalytic substrate is positioned within the plates and within a thermal enclosure. However, such stack designs are known to have problems with thermal cycling, they cannot be heated and cooled quickly, and extensive seals have to be used, including seals subjected to high thermal loading. Further, hot seals have to be used at locations inside the thermal enclosure, and hot seals are expensive. Addressing all of these problems makes such stacked plate designs relatively expensive. It would be desirable to provide a solid oxide fuel cell of a simple, and lightweight design which is also robust in construction and capable of withstanding thermal cycling.","In accordance with exemplary embodiment, a solid oxide fuel cell includes a tube, a spacer element, a catalytic substrate and an anode current collector. The tube includes an inlet opening, an exhaust opening, an electrolyte, an anode positioned interiorly from the electrolyte, and a cathode positioned exteriorly from the electrolyte. The solid oxide fuel cell further includes a spacer element disposed within the tube. The solid oxide fuel cell further includes a catalytic substrate disposed within the spacer element, the catalytic substrate being configured to receive unreformed fuel and to convert the unreformed fuel to reformed fuel. The solid oxide fuel cell still further includes an anode current collector contacting the anode of the tube and providing an electrical current path inside the tube past the catalytic substrate to the inlet opening.","It should be understood that the appended drawings are not necessarily to scale, presenting a somewhat simplified representation of various preferred features illustrative of the basic principles of the invention. The specific design features of the solid fuel cell as disclosed here, including, for example, specific dimensions of the catalytic substrate will be determined in part by the particular intended application and use environment. Certain features of the illustrated embodiments have been enlarged or distorted relative to others for visualization and clear understanding. In particular, thin features may be thickened, for example, for clarity of illustration. All references to direction and position, unless otherwise indicated, refer to the orientation of the solid state electrochemical device illustrated in the drawings.","It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, to those who have knowledge or experience in this area of technology, that many uses and design variations are possible for the fuel cells disclosed herein. The following detailed discussion of various alternative and preferred features and embodiments will illustrate the general principles of the invention with reference to an internal reformer suitable for use with a solid oxide fuel cell (\u201cSOFC\u201d). Other embodiments suitable for other applications will be apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","30","28","24","26","20","22","12","10","14","36","16","38","32","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","45","40","41","43","47","40","43","41","48","43","40","44","45","44","36","16","58","44","32","97","60","16","36","38","60","40","32","32"]},"The catalytic substrate  can comprise, for example, particles of a suitable metal such as platinum or other noble metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, or their alloys. Other suitable materials for use as a catalytic substrate can comprise oxides, carbides, and nitrides. The catalytic substrate may comprise a wire, a porous bulk insert of a catalytically active material, or a thin \u201cribbon\u201d which would have the effect of increasing the ratio of surface area to volume. In the preferred embodiment shown in , the catalytic substrate  comprises a supported catalyst. Supported catalysts consist of very fine scale catalyst particles supported on a substrate made of, for example a ceramic such as aluminum oxide. Preferably the catalytic substrate is honeycomb shaped, provided with a series of openings  which the fuel gas passes through as it is processed. The outer diameter of the honeycomb catalytic substrate is smaller than the inner diameter of the of SOFC tube . The honeycombed catalytic substrate may also be provided with spaces through which any current collector wires may pass. Other materials suitable for use as a catalytic substrate will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure.","The catalytic substrate  is shown in  positioned inside the thermal enclosure defined by the insulation .  shows the insulation  removed showing tubes  of the SOFC bundled together by manifold . In this manner, a series of tubes can be assembled together into a close fitting compartment surrounded by insulation . In this manner, cold hydrocarbon fuel and oxygen advantageously can be introduced to the SOFC through tubes closed off at the manifold with conventional or \u201ccold seals\u201d such as adhesives and sealants.","Current collectors may be mounted within and around the tubes , preferably at or near the active area  to capture electric current generated when the fuel gases are completely oxidized.  shows an alternate preferred embodiment of a tube-shaped catalytic substrate  where an opening  may be provided to receive a current collector. Alternatively, a packed bed of catalytic substrate beads may be used, with the beads either arranged in an orderly fashion or randomly packed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["40","40","43","44","32","46","32","40","40","46"]},"Advantageously, the internal catalytic substrates can be combined with different compositions in series to effect controlled ignition, thermal distribution and reaction, as desired. A fuel mixture consisting of one or more of water vapor, fuel, and oxygen can first pass over a catalytic substrate which partially oxidizes a portion of the fuel to create a hot mixture of the remaining fuel, and one or more of partially reformed fuel, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and water. The heated fuel-water from the partial oxidation reaction could then undergo endothermic steam reforming in a downstream internal reactor or across the same reactor (tube) to produce a desired reformed fuel.","This type of fuel processing is known as autothermal reforming. Alternatively, a suitable mixture of fuel and water vapor used in combination with one or more catalytic substrates may be used to transform a hydrocarbon into a desired reformed fuel. Additional catalytic materials may be applied to promote a \u2018water gas shift\u2019 reaction which would enrich the hydrogen content of a fuel gas stream.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8A","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8C"],"b":["132","61","70","40","49","47","48","47","44","80","44","140","170","140","240","170","240"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["40","70","72","74","72","132","46"]},"The exemplary brush portion  comprises a wire brush having an inner core  and a plurality of loop members  extending therefrom. The inner core  functions as an arterial electrical conduit providing current conduction the length of the brush portion . The loop members have resilient properties and overall diameter of the anode current collector  can be set so that the loop members  are compressed against an inner wall of the fuel cell tube  proximate the active portion . Continuous lengths of compressed loop members  contact the anode  of the fuel cell tube  to promote electrical contact with the anode . The anode current collector  remains mechanically complaint allowing the anode current collector  to distribute forces created by mechanical and thermal expansion stresses so that the brush portion  maintains contact with the anode layer .","The loop members route electrons relatively short distances between the anode layer  and the inner core . The loop members  have space therebetween to allow fuel to pass between the loop members. In one embodiment, the loop members provide a calibrated cross section to provide a selected amount of backpressure. The anode current collector  comprises an electrically conductive metal. Since the anode current collector  brush members is positioned in fuel gas and in processed fuel gas, the anode current collector  is formed from material that maintains conductivity in the operating environment of the inner chamber of the fuel cell tube . In alternate embodiments, other current collector designs can be utilized including current collectors with a brush member comprising bristle members or other shapes contacting the anode . Exemplary materials for the anode current collector include stainless steel, copper and copper alloys, silver and silver alloys, and nickel and nickel alloys.","The tubes  have the current collectors  extending from active areas  of tubes  through the substrate , through the spacer elements  and exiting a fuel inlet (\u2018FUEL\u2019) of the spacer element .
