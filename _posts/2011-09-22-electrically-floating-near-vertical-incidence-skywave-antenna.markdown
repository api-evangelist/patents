Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an Electrically Floating, Near Vertical Incidence, Skywave (NVIS) Antenna.","2. Background of the Invention","Radio transmission and reception is an important technology for any modern civilization, particularly in times of emergency or war. Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) is a radio-wave propagation technique in which a radio signal is transmitted straight-up into the ionosphere. The signal refracts off the ionosphere downward around the area surrounding the transmitter. This method is particularly useful in situations where surrounding structures (e.g. mountains, walls, buildings, etc.) may block line-of-site radio-waves.","Generally, a Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) Antenna NVIS antenna configuration has an antenna wire about five feet above ground running parallel with the ground. The proximity to the ground forces the majority of the radiation emitting out of the antenna to emit in the upward direction into the ionosphere. A ground wire slightly longer than the antenna, running parallel to, and positioned directly underneath the antenna is used to increase the efficiency of the antenna by about 3 dB to 6 dB. The ground wire is electrically connected to the ground at all frequencies by one or more electrically conductive stakes in the ground.","Improved antenna efficiency allows for longer range transmissions, lower power consumption, small\/lighter components, combinations thereof etc. Therefore, the prospect of an improved antenna design offering increased efficiency and range is highly desirable.","An Electrically Floating, Near Vertical Incidence, Skywave (NVIS) Antenna comprising an antenna element, a floating ground element, and a grounding element. The floating ground element is electrically insulated from electrical ground at least at one or more communications frequencies. The grounding element is electrical ground or electrically connected to electrical ground at least at one or more communications frequencies, preferably at all frequencies. At least part of the floating ground element is positioned between the antenna element and the grounding element. Preferably, the floating ground element has a surface area larger than the surface area of the antenna element. The antenna element is separated from the floating ground element and the grounding element by one or more electrical insulators. The floating ground element is separated from the antenna and the grounding element by one or more electrical insulators.","An Electrically Floating, Near Vertical Incidence, Skywave (NVIS) Antenna comprising an antenna element, a floating ground element, and a grounding element.

The floating ground element is separated from the antenna and the grounding element by one or more electrical insulators.","The floating ground element is any electrically conductive device electrically insulated from ground at least at one or more communications frequencies. For example, at a preferred one or more communications frequencies, between 1-60 Mhz, the floating ground element is electrically insulated from ground.","Preferably, the floating ground element is designed to have a resonant frequency about 5% lower than the antenna element, thereby allowing the floating ground element to aid in reflecting the RF energy into the sky.
