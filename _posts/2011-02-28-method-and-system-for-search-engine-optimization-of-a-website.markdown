{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The Internet is composed of hundreds of millions of websites. For a consumer of websites, in order to identify new websites or websites relevant to the consumer's interest, the consumer often uses third party sources. One of the most prevalently used third party sources is a search engine. A search engine is a tool that presents a list of web pages to a consumer based on a particular search term or phrase submitted by the consumer.","In general, a search engine has a web crawler, a ranking algorithm, and a user interface. The web crawler is a computer program that visits and gathers information from websites in an automated fashion. Specifically, the function of the web crawler is to obtain information from all websites on the Internet.","When the consumer submits search terms to the search engine, the ranking algorithm and the user interface are used. The ranking algorithm is an algorithm that decides, for a particular set of search terms, the order in which to present websites relevant to the search terms. Typically, the ranking algorithm is based on the relevancy of each web page. The user interface presents a listing of the websites in the order identified by the ranking algorithm. Specifically, for each website in the listing, the user interface presents a portion of the information gathered by the web crawler. For example, the user interface may display the title of the website with a portion of the text gathered from the website.","Websites compete for the consumer's selection of the website in the user interface of the search engine. Whether a consumer selects a particular website can be based on a number of factors, such as the information presented, the rank or position of the particular website in the listing, and the information presented by surrounding websites in the listing. In view of the factors and the automation of the search engine, a website should be optimized for the different components of the search engine. Search engine optimization is a process by which user updates the user's website to compete effectively with other websites for the consumer's selection.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for search engine optimization of a website. The method includes analyzing a website component of the website, making a determination that the website component lacks the search engine optimization, obtaining, from a financial application of a user, a first attribute specific to the user specified by a rule for search engine optimization, generating, using the rule, a suggestion comprising the first attribute based on the determination that the website component lacks search engine optimization, and presenting the suggestion to the user. The method further includes receiving an acceptance of the suggestion from the user, and updating the website component with the suggestion in response to the acceptance.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a system for search engine optimization of a website of a user. The system includes a user data repository for storing a user data catalog comprising attributes obtained from a financial application and specific to the user, a website analysis tool repository for storing a rule for a website component of the website, and a website analysis system operatively connected to the user data repository and the website analysis tool repository. The website analysis system executes on a processor and is configured to analyze, using the rule, the website component, make a determination that the website component lacks the search engine optimization, obtain, from the user data catalog, an attribute of the plurality of attributes based on the attribute being specified by the rule, and generate, using the rule, a suggestion comprising the attribute based on the determination that the website component lacks search engine optimization. The website analysis system is further configured to present the suggestion to the user, receive an acceptance of the suggestion from the user, and update the website component with the suggestion in response to the acceptance.","In general, in one aspect, the invention relates to a computer readable storage medium comprising computer readable program code embodied therein for causing a computer system to perform a method for search engine optimization of a website of a user. The method includes analyzing a website component of the website, making a determination that the website component lacks the search engine optimization, obtaining, from a financial application of a user, a first attribute specific to the user specified by a rule for search engine optimization, generating, using the rule, a suggestion comprising the first attribute based on the determination that the website component lacks search engine optimization, and presenting the suggestion to the user. The method further includes receiving an acceptance of the suggestion from the user, and updating the website component with the suggestion in response to the acceptance.","Other aspects of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.","Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying figures. Like elements in the various figures are denoted by like reference numerals for consistency.","In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.","In general, embodiments of the invention provide a method and system for search engine optimization based on information gathered about a user from a financial application. Specifically, embodiments of the invention determine whether a particular component of the website is optimized for the user based on attributes of the user. When the website component is not optimized for the user, embodiments of the invention present a suggestion for the website component that may be used to replace the website component. The suggestion is generated based on the attributes of the user and based on search engine optimization rules.","The user is any individual or group that has a website. Specifically, the user controls the content of the website in one or more embodiments of the invention. The user may be a business entity, such as a merchant, a distributor, a non-profit organization, a family, a partnership, or any other group. Accordingly, the website is any type of website owned by the user. For example, if the user is a merchant, the website may be an e-commerce website for selling products of the merchant. As another example, if the user is a non-profit organization, then the website may be an informational website for providing information about the non-profit organization.","As used herein, a user is deemed to perform an action when an individual, group of individuals, or agent of the user performs an action or receives information on behalf of the user. For example, if the user is a company, the user receives information when the information is presented to a website administrator of the company.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["102","104","106"]},"A user system () corresponds to any collection of hardware and\/or software used by a user.

Specifically, each type of website component has one or more corresponding guidance () and one or more corresponding rules (). Both of these components is discussed below.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, guidance () provides background information about optimizing the website component. In particular, the guidance () may specify how the search engine uses the website component. Further, the guidance () may specify ideal characteristics of an optimized website component. For example, the guidance for the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) may disclose, \u201cSearch engines give greater weight to the words in a URL than other words on the web page when ranking pages. Accordingly, the URL should include keywords about the website in order to be ranked higher.\u201d In one or more embodiments of the invention, the guidance is generic to multiple users.","Continuing with the website analysis tool repository (), the rules () specify the set of characteristics of a website component that indicates that the website component is optimized. Specifically, the rule () defines when to trigger optimization of the website component. If the website component does not comply with the rule () corresponding to the website component, then the website component is deemed non-optimized and optimization is triggered.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the rule () may include attribute identifiers for attributes of the user. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the rules () may be non-structured with the respect to the order of the attribute identifiers. For example, the rule () may specify that as long as attributes corresponding to the specified attribute identifiers are present in the website component, then the website component is optimized.","By way of an example, consider the scenario in which the website component is the keyword meta-tag. In the example, the rule may specify the percentage of categories of the user's products and the products in relation to the total number of categories that should be in the keyword meta-tag. As another example, if the website component is the heading, the rule may specify that the user name should appear in the heading.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, a rule may be used to create a user specific suggestion in one or more embodiments of the invention. For example, consider the scenario in which the rule is used to provide a suggestion for the title tag of the website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)). The rule may specify that the name of the user should be followed by the goods or services sold by the user which is followed by the geographic location of the user. In the example, if the user is a Los Angeles store called Smith's Surf Shop and sells water sports equipment, the rule may be used to create the title tag: \u201cSmith's Surf Shop, water sports equipment, Los Angeles.\u201d In the example, if the user is a Texas store called Buffalo Bill's BBQ House and sells grills, sauces, and barbeque tools, the rule may be used to create the title tag: \u201cBuffalo Bill's BBQ House, grills, sauces, and barbeque tools, Texas.\u201d As shown in the example, the rule may be used by the system to generate a user specific suggestion that may be used to update the user's title tag in the user's website.","The website analysis tool repository (), user data repository (), and website hosting system () are operatively connected to the website analysis system (). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the website analysis system () includes functionality to analyze the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) and determine whether the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) is optimized for search engines. Specifically, the website analysis system () includes functionality to obtain a website component from the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) at the website hosting system (), access the user data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)) to obtain attributes, and access the website analysis tool repository () to obtain guidance () and rules (), and optimize the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)).","In one or more embodiments of the invention, the website analysis system () includes an attribute extraction engine (), user interface (), and an analysis tool (). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the attribute extraction engine () includes functionality to extract attributes of the user from the user data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)). The extraction may include identification of attributes and normalization of the attributes.","With regards to identification of attributes, in one or more embodiments of the invention, at least a portion of the attributes in the user data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)) are not associated with the attribute identifier. For example, when an advisor stores information about the user, the information may be stored in the form of notes. The attribute extraction engine () includes functionality to parse the notes and extract attributes in the notes. By way of another example, the attribute extraction engine () may include functionality to perform a screen scrape of documents or images associated with the user. By way of another example, the attribute extraction engine may include functionality to perform a web crawl of the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) to identify attributes of the user from the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)). In alternative embodiments of the invention, each attribute in the user data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)) and used by the website analysis system is associated with an attribute identifier for the attribute.","With regards to normalization, the attribute extraction engine () includes functionality to transform attributes in the user data catalog into a normalized format. For example, the attribute extraction engine () may include functionality to change attributes from plural form to singular form, change verbs to present tense, and perform other normalization functions.","The analysis tool () includes functionality to analyze the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) and determine, based on the extracted attributes of the user, whether the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) is optimized for the user. Further, the analysis tool () includes functionality to formulate a suggestion to present to the user. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the analysis tool () includes functionality to modify the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)).","The user interface () provides the user with an interface to manage the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) using the analysis tool (). Specifically, the user interface () includes functionality to present suggestions to the user and receive acceptance, rejection, and\/or modification of the suggestions from the user. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user interface () further includes functionality to assist the user in the creation of the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)). An example of the user interface () is discussed below and in .","Continuing with , in one or more embodiments of the invention, the business management system () includes functionality to secure the components of the business management system (). Specifically, entities external to the business management system () may be required to be authenticated and have sufficient security authorization to manage and modify users' websites (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) on the website hosting system (). For example, using the user's authentication parameters, the user may access and modify the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)). However, other entities that do not have the security authorization are prohibited from administering the user's website (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)). Similarly, using the same or different authentication parameters, the user may access and modify the user's data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)) using the financial application (). However, other entities that do not have the security authorization are prohibited from accessing the user's data catalog (e.g., user X data catalog (X), user Y data catalog (Y)). In one or more embodiments of the invention, the level of security may be that applications within the business management system () may access and manipulate the users' websites (e.g., user X website (X), user Y website (Y)) without requiring additional security credentials.","While  shows a configuration of components, other configurations may be used without departing from the scope of the invention. Specifically, various components of  may be combined such that the functionality of the various components is performed by a single component. Further, the functionality performed by a single component may be performed by two or more components.","For example, although  shows the financial application () as located on the business management system (), the financial application () may be located in whole or in part on the user system () in one or more embodiments of the invention. Specifically, the financial application () may be a lightweight application that is located on a user's mobile device. In such embodiments, the financial application () may be configured to transmit information to the user data repository () in one or more embodiments of the invention. Other variations of the execution location of the financial application () may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["150","150","152","154","156"]},"In one or more embodiments of the invention, the user's website rendering () shows a web page of the user's website. Specifically, the user's website rendering () is a rendering of what would be displayed to a consumer of the web page when the consumer requests the web page of the user's website in one or more embodiments of the invention. If the user's website includes multiple web pages, then the user's website rendering () may include a collection of user's web page renderings. Each web page rendering may be in a separate window or tab of the user interface.

Additional configuration parameters may be included without departing from the scope of the invention.","The above are only a few of the events that may trigger the website analysis system to perform the search engine optimization analysis. Other events and\/or a combination of events may trigger the website analysis system to perform the search engine optimization analysis.","When the search engine optimization analysis is triggered, the website analysis system may identify and analyze each website component. Specifically, in Step , a website component is identified. The identified website component may be a displayed component or a metadata component of the user's website.","In Step , attributes specific to the user and corresponding to the website component are obtained from a financial application of the user. Specifically, the financial application may directly or indirectly provide the attributes of the user to the website analysis system. For example, the attributes may be provided via an application programming interface of the financial application. By way of another example, the attributes may be provided indirectly, such as by way of a user data catalog stored at the user data repository. In such embodiments, the attribute extraction engine may extract the attributes in a format required by the website analysis system. Although not shown in , attributes specific to the user may be obtained from other sources and stored in the user data catalog. Thus, the attributes from the other source may be used to analyze the website component and generate a suggestion in one or more embodiments of the invention.","In Step , the website analysis system analyzes the website component using the attributes of the user in one or more embodiments of the invention. Specifically, the analysis determines whether the website component is optimized for the user.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, Steps  and  may be performed using rules. Each rule may identify the website component, identify an attribute of the website component (e.g., name, value, size, associated tags, and other attributes), identify relevant attributes specific to the user, and define a relationship between the attribute of the website component and the attributes specific to the user. The website analysis system may determine whether the website component conforms to the requirements of the rule.","For example, consider the scenario in which the website component is keywords metadata. The rule may identify the value of the keywords metadata (i.e., which keywords are included the keywords metadata of the website), the categories and product names of products sold by the user, the geographic location of the user, and the relationship between the value of the keywords metadata and the attributes of the user. In the example, the relationship may be that each category, product name, and the geographic location of the user must be included in the value of the keywords metadata. Alternatively, the relationship may be that if at least 95% of each category, product name, and the geographic location of the user is included in the value of the keywords metadata, then the keywords metadata complies with the rule.","By way of another example, consider the scenario in which the website component is the user's logo as an image. The rule may identify the alt attribute for the user's logo, the company name of the user, and the relationship that the company name must be included in the alt attribute of the image in order for the website component to be optimized for search engines.","By way of another example, consider the scenario in which the website component is a site map. The rule may identify that the site map must match the layout of the user's website.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, multiple rules may be associated with a single website component. In such embodiments, the website analysis system may iterate through each rule to determine whether the website component complies with the rule. Thus, the website may perform the steps of  for each rule corresponding to each website component of the user's website.","In Step , a determination is made whether to optimize the website component. Specifically, the results of the analysis of Step  are checked to determine whether the website component is already optimized for the user. If the website component is already optimized for the user, then the method proceeds to checking the next website component in Step . If the website component lacks search engine optimization, then the method proceeds to Step  to optimize the website component.","In Step , guidance corresponding to the website component is obtained. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the guidance that is obtained is specific to the particular attribute of the website component identified in the rule with which the website component does not comply. For example, if the website component does not comply with the rule corresponding to the alt attribute, then the obtained guidance corresponds to the alt attribute of the website component. By way of another example, if the website component does not comply with a rule corresponding to the value attribute, then the obtained guidance corresponds to the value attribute of the website component.","In one or more embodiments of the invention, each rule may include a unique identifier of the guidance. Thus, to obtain the guidance, the rule with which the website component does not comply is accessed to obtain the unique identifier. The website analysis tool repository may be searched for the guidance corresponding to the unique identifier.","In Step , a suggestion having attributes specific to the user is generated using the rule. Specifically, the rule may specify the order of attributes and which attributes to include in the website component. Based on the rule, the corresponding attributes specific to the user are obtained. The corresponding attributes may include one or more of the previously obtained attributes and\/or newly obtained attributes from the user data catalog. The corresponding attributes may be ordered according to the rule. Additionally, the rule may specify delimiters to add between attributes. The result of obtaining the attributes and ordering the attributes is the creation of a user specific suggestion for modifying the website component.","In Step , the suggestion and the guidance corresponding to the website component is presented to the user in one or more embodiments of the invention. In one or more embodiments of the invention, presenting the suggestion and the guidance may include appending the suggestion and the guidance to an email or other electronic communication to the user, displaying a user interface element with the suggestion and the guidance, or performing another act for allowing the user to view the suggestion and the guidance.","Although not shown in , when the user reviews the suggestion, the user may amend the suggestion with revised text. For example, the user may change the attributes, the static text, or the displayed format of the suggestion. When the user provides revised text, the suggestion is amended accordingly.","In Step , a determination is made whether user acceptance of the suggestion in received in one or more embodiments of the invention. If user acceptance of the suggestion is received, then the website component is updated with the suggestion in Step . Specifically, the suggestion replaces the attribute of the website component in one or more embodiments of the invention. If the user acceptance of the suggestion is not received, then the suggestion may be rejected and the method may proceed to Step .","Continuing with , a determination is made whether another website component exists in Step . Specifically, the determination is made whether another website component that has not been analyzed exists. If another website component exists, then the method repeats in Step  with the next website component. If another website component does not exist, then the method may end and the website is deemed optimized for search engines.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4C"},"In the example, consider the scenario where a company Logo Technologies is creating a website for selling Logo Technologies technological products.  shows an example of the website analysis system user interface (). As shown in , the user interface () includes a menu bar () and a rendering of the user's website () in one or more embodiments of the invention. When the user is ready, the user may select the search engine optimization menu option () to have the website analyzed to account for how the search engine would view the website.","Continuing with the example,  shows a schematic diagram of the website analysis system user interface () with a user interface element () showing a suggestion. As shown in , the user interface element () includes guidance stating \u201cAdd an Alt Tag for your logo image. Search engines cannot read the image.\u201d Thus, the guidance provides information to the user about how the search engine would use the website component and a general statement about what should be in the website component. In the scenario shown, the guidance states that the search engine is incapable of reading an image and, therefore, would ignore the image.","Additionally, the user interface element () includes a suggestion of \u201cLogo Technologies, Inc.\u201d for the Alt tag. The suggestion uses information gathered about the user from a financial application of the user. Thus, even though the formal name of Logo Technologies may not appear on the website, the website analysis system is able to provide a user specific suggestion that includes the full name of the user's business. The user may modify the suggestion, \u201cLogo Technologies, Inc.\u201d, with revised text to change the suggestion.","As shown in , the website analysis system user interface () may further show attributes of the website component () to which the user interface element () applies. Specifically, as shown in , the attributes of the Logo Image are displayed. Thus, the user may view all of the attributes of the website component before determining whether to accept or reject the suggestion in one or more embodiments of the invention.","If the user selects the accept button (labeled \u201cFix-it!\u201d) to accept the suggestion, then the website component is updated to have an Alt tag of \u201cLogo Technologies, Inc.\u201d If the user selects the reject button (labeled \u201cIgnore\u201d) to reject the suggestion, then the website analysis system continues the analysis with the next website component.","Continuing with the example, the website analysis system may additionally analyze the website metadata.  shows a schematic diagram of the website analysis system user interface () with a user interface element () showing a suggestion for a particular web page of the user's website. In , the website analysis system identifies that the web page metadata () for one of the web pages of the user's website lacks search engine optimization.
