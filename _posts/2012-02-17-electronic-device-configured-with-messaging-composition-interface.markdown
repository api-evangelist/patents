Display  can comprise one or more light emitters such as an array of light emitting diodes (LED), liquid crystals, plasma cells, or organic light emitting diodes (OLED). Other types of light emitters are contemplated. A touch membrane  is overlaid on display  to thereby provide an input device for device . As a non-limiting example, device  can be configured to selectively show or hide a virtual keyboard . Other types of input devices, other than touch membrane , or in addition to touch membrane , are contemplated. For example, a physical keyboard, or touch-pad, or joystick or trackball or track-wheel, a microphone, or optical camera or any one or more of them can be provided, in addition to or in lieu of touch membrane . Such other components may, if desired, be \u201cslide-out\u201d components. In a present implementation, device  also comprises a speaker  for generating audio output, but speaker  is optional.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["50","50","62","62","100","100","100","100","104","108","50","104","100","108"]},"Processor  in turn is also configured to control display  and speaker  and any other output devices that may be provided in device , also in accordance with different programming instructions and responsive to different input receive from the input devices.","Processor  also connects to a network interface , which can be implemented in a present embodiment as a radio configured to communicate over a wireless link, although in variants device  can also include a network interface for communicating over a wired link. Network interface  can thus be generalized as a further input\/output device that can be utilized by processor  to fulfill various programming instructions which involve communicating over a network via the link. It will be understood that interface  is configured to correspond with the network architecture that defines such a link. Present, commonly employed network architectures for such a link include, but are not limited to, Global System for Mobile communication (\u201cGSM\u201d), General Packet Relay Service (\u201cGPRS\u201d), Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (\u201cEDGE\u201d), 3G, High Speed Packet Access (\u201cHSPA\u201d), Code Division Multiple Access (\u201cCDMA\u201d), Evolution-Data Optimized (\u201cEVDO\u201d), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (\u201cIEEE\u201d) standard 802.11, Bluetooth\u2122 or any of their variants or successors. It is also contemplated each network interface  can include multiple radios to accommodate the different protocols that may be used to simultaneously or individually communicate over different types of links.","As will become apparent further below, device  can be implemented with different configurations than described, omitting certain input devices or including extra input devices, and likewise omitting certain output devices or including extra input devices.","In a present embodiment, device  is also configured to maintain, within non-volatile storage , a messaging composition interface (\u201cMCI\u201d) application  and one or more messaging applications -, - . . . -. (Collectively these are referred to as messaging applications , and generically each are referred to as messaging application . This nomenclature is used elsewhere herein.) While MCI application  contains the term \u201capplication\u201d, it is to be understood that MCI application  can be implemented in a variety of different types of software objects, such as, for example, a software function or a software process or a software environment. Non-volatile storage  may also maintain one or more additional applications , such as a calendar, a phone application, or any \u201capp\u201d. Application , applications  and applications  can be pre-stored in non-volatile storage  upon manufacture of device , or downloaded via network interface  and saved on non-volatile storage  at any time subsequent to manufacture of device .","As will be explained further below, MCI application  can be integrated with existing messaging applications , such as Email, Instant Messaging, Short Message Service (SMS), and internal messaging applications within social messaging environments such as Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, and Google+. MCI application  can be used to interact with other devices that are also configured to execute their own messaging applications , and such devices can include their own instance of MCI application .","Processor  is configured to execute MCI application , messaging applications  and other applications , accessing non-volatile storage  and volatile storage  as needed.","A plurality of ways to implement MCI application  is contemplated. Referring now to , however, an example configuration for MCI application  and messaging applications , during execution on processor , are shown in greater detail. MCI application  comprises a graphical engine , a processing engine  and a plurality of programming interfaces . Graphical engine  comprises programming instructions for controlling display  and for receiving input from touch membrane . Processing engine  comprises, amongst other things, an intermediation layer between graphical engine  and programming interfaces . Graphical engine  therefore operates under the control of processing engine  and is generally agnostic to the particular messaging applications  that can connect to MCI application . Programming interfaces  are each configured to communicate with processing engine  and messaging applications . Each programming interface  is uniquely configured, on the one hand, to communicate with each unique messaging application , and on the other hand each programming interface  is commonly configured to communicate with processing engine . It is contemplated that an integrated development environment (or other programming tool) or for device  can include a development tool for creating additional programming interfaces , such that as new messaging services are conceived, and as new messaging applications  corresponding to those new messaging services are deployed, then MCI application  can remain the basis for the common graphical interface on device .","In one implementation it is also contemplated that, because of MCI application , each messaging application  can be provided on device  without including its own native graphical interface for both entering messaging content and also reading messaging content, as is the current common practice. In this manner, programming resources are conserved on device  without sacrificing the ability to access the broadly available range of messaging services via messaging applications . In another implementation, one or more messaging applications  can be provided with its own native graphical interface, but processing and memory resources can still be conserved by not executing two or more of them in favour of using the single interface offered by MCI application .","Referring now to , a flowchart depicting a method for messaging on an electronic device is indicated generally at . Method  is one way in which MCI application  can be implemented. It is to be emphasized, however, that method  can be performed on variations of device  and MCI application , and need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown, hence the elements of method  are referred to herein as \u201cblocks\u201d rather than \u201csteps\u201d.","Block  comprises loading a messaging composition interface. Example performance of block  is represented in , wherein the graphical interface of graphical engine  of MCI application  is shown as being generated on display  under the control of processor . In the non-limiting example of , graphical engine  shows a virtual keyboard , a plurality of recipient fields , a subject field  and a composition field .","At this point it is to be highlighted that the contents of display  are generated under the control of processor . However, for convenience, in the subsequent Figures only the contents of display  are shown in isolation from display , processor  and device  in general, but it is to be understood such components are contemplated as being used to generate the contents shown in these subsequent Figures.","Block  thus comprises loading programming interfaces. In the context of the specific example discussed in relation to , block  contemplates loading of programming interfaces  into processor  for execution. Block  comprises establishing a connection with messaging applications. In the context of the specific example discussed in relation to , block  contemplates establishing a communication pathway between each programming interface  and its respective message application .","As a result of performance of block  and block , processing engine  dynamically configures graphical engine  to generate a menu of choices of various messaging services associated with various message applications .  shows this example, as graphical engine  is shown as generating a plurality of choices of messaging services . The view in  can be achieved in a variety of ways that can be decided upon implementation of these teachings, but as a non-limiting example, a swipe gesture from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen in the view of  could be used to invoke the view shown in . In , each shown messaging service  is associated with a particular message application . In the example of , six message services  are shown. Message service - is labeled \u201cDesktop\u201d to represent desktop email service. Message service - is labeled \u201cTwitter\u201d to represent a link to a Twitter account for broadcasting short text messages to followers of the Twitter account linked to message service -. Facebook service - is labeled \u201cFacebook\u201d to represent a link to a Facebook account for broadcasting status messages to \u201cfriends\u201d of the Facebook account linked to message service -. (In a variation, Facebook service - can represent a link to the electronic mail messaging service offered within each Facebook account, whereby the Facebook account holder can use the Facebook account to send personal and unique electronic mail messages to other Facebook users). SMS\/MMS service - is labeled \u201cSMS\/MMS\u201d to represent a link to an SMS\/MMS account for sending either short messages or multimedia messages via the SMS\/MMS service associated with a telephone number that is typically associated with device . BBM\u2122 service - is labeled \u201cBBM\u201d to represent a link to a BlackBerry\u2122 Message account for sending instant messages via a BlackBerry\u2122 service. However, it is to be understood that other types of instant message services could be provided in lieu of or in addition to the BBM service. Gmail service - is labeled \u201cGmail\u201d to represent a link to a Google Email Message account for sending email messages via a email servers hosted by Google Inc. However, it is to be understood that other types of email message accounts could be provided in lieu of or in addition to the Gmail service, such as Hotmail, or Yahoo mail, or the like.","At this point it can be noted that while six example message services are shown in , any number of possible message services are possible, and this fact is illustrated by the use of \u201cn\u201d to denote message application -. To keep with the example in , the example mapping in Table I will be used between services  and applications .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE I"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example Message Applications and Services"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Message application","Message Service"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Desktop email message application","Desktop email service 160-1"]},{"entry":"128-1"},{"entry":["Twitter message application 128-2","Twitter message service 160-2"]},{"entry":["Facebook message application 128-3","Facebook message service 160-3"]},{"entry":["SMS\/MMS message application 128-4","SMS\/MMS message service"]},{"entry":[{},"160-4"]},{"entry":["BBM Message application 128-5","BBM Message service 160-5"]},{"entry":["Gmail message application 128-6","Gmail message service 160-6"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Block  comprises selecting messaging service(s). In one implementation, a single messaging service is selected at block  by depressing a region of display  adjacent to a desired one of the messaging services  shown in .","(In other implementations of block , a plurality of messaging services  can be selected whereby received content, discussed further below, is eventually sent via one or more of the selected messaging services . In such other implementations, device  can be configured to send over all of the selected messaging services , or to only send to recipients that have accounts associated with the selected messaging services . This will be discussed in greater detail below. In other embodiments still, device  can be configured to determine a subset of available messaging services available to the addressee and only permit the selection of the available messaging services.)","Block  comprises adjusting the MCI to conform with the selected messaging services from block . Block  is optional, but can be included where the different messaging services rely on different graphical interfaces. For example, an SMS or BBM interface contemplates a chat interface with a composition frame, as well as a sent frame and a received frame. This example will be discussed further below.","Block  comprises receiving content via the MCI. Block  thus contemplates receiving text input, or the like (e.g. a voice note, or an attachment), that reflects the actual content which will be delivered to addressees that will be specified in recipients fields . Such text input or other content can be placed within composition field . Block  also contemplates receiving data that populates the subject field .","Block  comprises receiving input indicative of a destination for the message. In the present embodiment, the input indicative of a destination for the message is represented by an addressee. Block  thus contemplates populating of recipient fields  with addresses for intended recipients of the content received at block . In certain implementations, it is contemplated that block  contemplates an interface or other linkage between a contact management application that is also maintained on device . Such a linkage can be configured to only offer addressee recipients that have addresses that match the type of service selected at block . Alternatively, such a linkage can make all addressees available, but either prevent their selection, or if they are selected, an exception, warning, or other error message can be generated on display  indicating that the selected recipient has no address that matches the selected service. In still further variations, the selection of multiple recipients can lead to generation of a message that suggests which service should be selected at block  to maximize the number of recipients that have addresses corresponding to suggested service.","Block  comprises determining if all message composing is done. If \u201cno\u201d, then method  returns to block . It is to be appreciated that if content received via the MCI from block  or received an addressee via the MCI from block , a return to block  will select a messaging service again. It is contemplated that the content and the addressee can be preserved or deleted. For example, if a different service is selected, block  (if present) can adjust the MCI. However, it is contemplated that in some embodiments, the content is preserved and re-presented in a second graphical interface. Similarly, it is also contemplated that in some embodiments, the addressee is preserved and re-presented in a second graphical interface. It is also contemplated that in some embodiments, the addresses in the recipient fields  can be automatically updated to correspond with the address of the addressee in the other service.","Furthermore, block  and block  can receive further content and addressees using the second graphical interface as well as allow the content and addressees to be edited. For example, an addressed message may be changed to a broadcast message. In another example, an email service composed can be changed to a status update to BBM or Facebook\u2122, or a broadcasted tweet. In other examples, the change can be within a particular service, such as a direct BBM message can become a status update within BBM, or vice-versa.","If \u201cyes\u201d then at block  the composed message is sent through the service selected at block .","In certain implementations, a \u201cyes\u201d determination can be made at block  when a \u201csend\u201d command is received, such as by depressing a virtual button on display  by graphical engine  that is labeled \u201cSend\u201d. Such a virtual button can be configured to be available only upon satisfaction of a validation sequence, such as to verify that selected messaging services at block  conform with selected recipients at block .","A \u201cno\u201d determination can be made in any instance where a \u201cyes\u201d determination is not satisfied at block . For example, a \u201cno\u201d determination can include receiving further input indicating that the message is not to be sent. In another example, a \u201cno\u201d determination can be made after the expiration of a period of time without activity.","At this point it can be emphasized that the exact sequence of blocks in method  is not by any means limited to the sequence shown. By way of a specific, non-limiting, example on this point, it is contemplated that inputs received at block , block , block  and block  can all be effected in any sequence during interaction with graphical engine . In this manner, a message can be iteratively composed to ultimately facilitate reception of a fully composed message, its recipients and desired message service. Furthermore, although the present embodiment returns to block  upon a \u201cno\u201d determination, it is also contemplated that the method can return to any one of block , block , block , and block .","The person skilled in the art will now recognize that method , device  and their variants can have many different implementations. For example,  shows an example of how block  can be implemented. In , four screens  are shown, in an example sequence, that can be generated by graphical engine  in response to input are shown. Screen - is generally analogous to the view shown in . Screen - also shows a screen-press  on virtual keyboard  representing entering of the text \u201cKar\u201d in the recipient field representing a portion of the name of the addressee. Based on the portion of the name, the MCI can be configured to recommend possible recipients. For example, screen - shows a list of possible recipients matching the text \u201cKar\u201d, and a screen-press  beside the contact \u201cKarla Jones\u201d. In other embodiments, the list of possible recipients can also include additional contacts based on a history of associated recipients. Screen - shows \u201cKarla Jones\u201d as an added recipient. Screen - shows the addition of another recipient, \u201cRob Lee\u201d to illustrate that multiple recipients can be added.","As another example,  shows an example of how block  can be implemented. In , four additional screens  are shown, in an example sequence that can be generated by graphical engine  in response to input. Screen - contemplates a screen-press  over the subject field bringing the cursor focus to the subject field. Screen - also shows a screen-press  on virtual keyboard  representing entering of the text \u201cMeeting with cust\u201d in the subject field . Screen - also shows a screen-press  on virtual keyboard  representing entering of the text into the composition field . Screen - also shows a screen-press  on virtual keyboard  and an instruction to hide the virtual keyboard so the full body of the message is visible.","It can be noted that screen - omits inclusion of a \u201cSend\u201d virtual button, but screen -, screen -, and screen - all include a \u201cSend\u201d Button. It will now be understood that the omission of the \u201cSend\u201d button in screen - leads to an automatic \u201cno\u201d determination at block . Likewise, a \u201cno\u201d determination is made on screen -, screen -, and screen - unless the \u201cSend\u201d button is actually depressed.","As another example,  shows another example of how block , block , block  and block  can be implemented. In , four additional screens  are shown, in an example sequence that can be generated by graphical engine  in response to input. Screen - corresponds to block  and contemplates a screen-press  to select \u201cBBM\u201d as the message service, which in this case represents BlackBerry\u2122 Messenger instant message service, but can also represent SMS, MMS or any other similar instant message or text message or chat service. Screen - corresponds to block  and contemplates the selection of \u201cAdam Jones\u201d as an addressee. Screen - corresponds to block  and contemplates the reception of content, and screen-press  on screen - represents pressing \u201cSend\u201d to thereby satisfy the \u201cyes\u201d condition at block  and leading to block  at which point the instant message is sent. Screen - represents modification of the MCI to a format consistent with instant message service to thereby show chat history and to show the dialogue between the sender and recipient. In other embodiments, screen - can include a history of previous message, such as a chat history, if the history is available for the addressee.","At this point it can be noted that the example in  also contemplates invocation of block  whereby the appearance of the MCI is modified to correspond with the type of selected messaging service. It can also be noted that in one implementation, the entire performance of the example in  is performed entirely within MCI application , but that in another implementation, screen -, screen - and screen - can be performed within MCI application , but that screen - can be performed within BBM application -, whereby an the BBM message application -, and its corresponding graphical interface, is automatically invoked after or as part of block , such that the data received at block , block  and block  is passed through to the BBM message application - and thereafter BBM message application - is fully invoked and the graphical interface of BBM message application - is used thereafter for the remainder of the chat session.","Referring now to , a flowchart depicting a method for adjusting the graphical interface on an electronic device is indicated generally at . Method  is one way in which a MCI application  can change the graphical interface, such as in block . In addition, method  can also be used to provide data to the MCI such as the addressee data or content. It is to be emphasized, however, that method  can be performed on variations of device  and MCI application , and need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown, hence the elements of method  are referred to herein as \u201cblocks\u201d rather than \u201csteps\u201d.","Block  comprises generating a graphical interface. In the present embodiment a graphical interface is generated on display . Graphical interfaces can be stored on non-volatile storage unit  and loaded depending on the messaging service selected.","Block  comprises receiving recipients via the graphical interface. In the present embodiment, the recipients are identified and correspond to the addressee. Block  comprises receiving content via the graphical interface.","Block  comprises selecting an interface based on the messaging service. For example, an SMS or BBM interface contemplates a chat interface with a composition frame, as well as a sent frame and a received frame. This chat set of screens allows for efficient rendering of a large number of short messages simulating a two-way conversation which is typical for these types of messaging services. For other services, such as email, one-way screens may be used. Furthermore, it is also contemplated that in some embodiments, the graphical interface for a service can be modified to adjust preferences associated with the graphical interface.","Block  comprises selecting a second service associated with a second graphical interface. Subsequently, block  comprises adjusting the graphical interface to conform with the selected messaging services from block .","While the foregoing provides certain non-limiting example embodiments, it should be understood that combinations, subsets, and variations of the foregoing are contemplated. For example, it is contemplated that method  can be modified to ultimately send the same content via multiple different message services according to message services that are actually available for a selected addressee. For example, if \u201cAndrew\u201d and \u201cDolly\u201d are selected as addresses, but \u201cAndrew\u201d only has an email account, and \u201cDolly\u201d only has a Facebook account, then method  can be modified to send content at block  to Andrew via email, and to Dolly via Facebook.","While specific embodiments have been described and illustrated, such embodiments should be considered illustrative only and should not serve to limit the accompanying claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
