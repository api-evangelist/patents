title: Optical beam steering using small angle beam steering device
abstract: In one aspect the system serves as a transmitter and comprises an optics system; a plurality of source elements positioned on the focal plane; and, a small angle beam steerer. The plurality of source elements are each capable of providing a point source of radiation to the optics system. The optics system provides a collimated output. The small angle beam steerer receives the collimated output and redirects the collimated output through a small angular deviation. The redirected output is thus transmitted in a desired direction without a need for mechanical gimbals and is capable of covering a large angular range with respect to the optical axis of the optics system. The system can also be implemented as a receiver.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was reduced to practice with Government support under Contract No. AAH01-01-C-0026 awarded by Defense Advanced Products Research Agency (DARPA). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to the steering of optical beams and more particularly to the steering thereof without the need for mechanical gimbals.","2. Description of the Related Art","Present methods for steering optical beams in laser radar of laser communication systems utilize mechanical gimbals to point a telescope assembly or a mirror in the appropriate direction for beam transmission or reception. Recent developments in liquid crystal optical phase shifting devices enable electronic steering of coherent optical beams. However, these devices permit steering only over small angles (approximately four degrees, one dimension) with efficiencies exceeding 50 percent. Since coverage angles in excess of 90 degrees in two dimensions are typically needed for laser communication and laser radar systems, these devices alone are insufficient in themselves to build a complex system without gimbals.","The article entitled Optical Phased Array Technology, Proceedings of the IEEE. VOL. 84, NO. 2, February 1996, pages 268-298, discloses an optical phased array beam steerer suitable for small angle beam steering. Section II, Overview of Liquid Crystal Optical Phased Array Concepts, shows that with current liquid crystal materials high efficiencies can only be achieved for small steering angles. As a specific example, a phased array with center-to-center spacing of 2 \u03bcm, a liquid crystal layer thickness of 5 \u03bcm, and operating at a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm will have an efficiency greater than 50% only for steering angles less than 5 degrees, based on the equations presented in this reference.","The present invention is an optical beam steering system for steering an optical beam. In one broad aspect, the system serves as a transmitter and comprises an optics system; a plurality of source elements positioned on the focal plane; and, a small angle beam steerer. The plurality of source elements are each capable of providing a point source of radiation to the optics system. The optics system provides a collimated output. The small angle beam steerer receives the collimated output and redirects the collimated output through a small angular deviation. The redirected output is thus transmitted in a desired direction without a need for mechanical gimbals and is capable of covering a large angular range with respect to the optical axis of the optics system.","In another broad aspect the optical beam steering system serves as a receiver. In this aspect the optical beam steering system includes a small angle beam steerer; an optics system; and, a plurality of detector elements. The small angle beam steerer receives a collimated laser beam and redirects the collimated laser beam through a small angular deviation. The optics system has a focal plane and an optical axis. The redirected laser beam is focused onto the focal plane. The detector elements are positioned on the focal plane. Each detector element is capable of receiving the focused laser beam from a desired direction without a need for mechanical gimbals, the desired direction capable of covering a large angular range with respect to the optical axis.","Obviating the need for mechanical gimbals provides substantial cost savings. Precision mechanical gimbals are costly to fabricate and bulky to package. Embodiments of the present invention may allow for utilization of automated techniques developed in the electronics industry for packaging sources and detectors on electronics boards. These techniques enable fabrication of the invention at a much lower cost than of a precision mechanical system.","Referring to the drawings and the characters of reference marked thereon  illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention, designated generally as . The optical beam steering system  includes an optics system , a plurality of source elements  and a small angle beam steerer . The source elements  are positioned on a focal plane  of the optics system .","The optics system  may comprise a wide angle lens such as a conventional 20 mm focal length wide angle lens as used in 35 mm photography or less conventional designs such as used in hemispherical projection systems. Alternatively, reflective optics may be used.","The small angle beam steerer  may be an optical phased array such as a transmission mode optical phased array beam steerer formed of a 1-D array of equi-spaced liquid crystal phase shifters. An example of such an optical phased array is described in the article entitled Optical Phased Array Technology, Proceedings of the IEEE. VOL. 84, NO. 2, February 1996, page 274. The inner surface of one transparent substrate is photo-lithographically patterned with transparent, conducting, striped electrodes having the desired spacing for the phase shifters in the array. The active aperture of the array is so patterned. The inside of another substrate is coated with a uniform, transparent, conducting ground plane. Both substrates have inner surfaces prepared to effect quiescent liquid crystal alignment. Application of a voltage between any given striped electrode and the underlying ground plane creates a 1-D phase shifter in the liquid crystal volume underlying the patterned electrode. The optical phased array has an efficiency that depends on the number of phase levels available and the thickness of the liquid crystal. For current liquid crystal materials and a wavelength of 1550 nm, an efficiency of 0.7 may be achieved with a steering angle of approximately three degrees in one dimension.","Other small angle beam steerers  may be, for example, acousto-optic devices or electro optic crystal devices. Commercial 2-D acousto-optic beam steering devices are available with apertures in the 5 to 7 mm range and steering angles of approximately three degrees. Electro-optic steering devices consisting of, for example, a lithium niobate crystal with a quadrapole electrode configuration may be used. While these devices have similar aperture and beam steering range, their large size and high voltage requirements make them less suitable than the optical phased array or acousto-optic devices.","As herein, the term \u201csmall\u201d angle beam steerer refers to steering in a range of between about 0-5 degrees.","In a first broad aspect, the optical beam steering system  operates as a transmitter. The source elements  are positioned on the focal plane  and are each capable of providing a point source of radiation to the optics system . The optics system  provides a collimated output . This collimated output of the optics system  may have a relatively large angular deviation, \u0394. The small angle beam steerer  receives the collimated output  and redirects the collimated output through a small angular deviation, \u0394. The redirected output  is thus being transmitted in a desired direction without a need for mechanical gimbals. This desired direction is capable of covering a large angular range with respect to the optical axis .","In a second broad aspect, the optical beam steering system  operates as a receiver. The small angle beam steerer  receives a collimated laser beam  and redirects the collimated laser beam through a small angular deviation, \u0394. The optics system  focuses the redirected laser beam  onto the focal plane . In this broad aspect, a plurality of detector elements  are positioned on the focal plane . Each detector element  is capable of receiving the focused laser beam from a desired direction without a need for mechanical gimbals. The desired direction is capable of covering a large angular range with respect to said optical axis.","Referring now to , an embodiment of source elements is illustrated in which these source elements comprise a 2-dimensional optical fiber array, designated generally as . The optical fiber array  comprises a plurality of laser diodes  in conjunction with optical fibers . A perforated metal or ceramic plate  is used to support the end of each optical fiber . Conventional telecom laser diodes of up to 1 watt (typically about 10-100 mW) such as manufactured by Nortel or Alcatel may be used. The optical fibers may be of the single mode type. Use of this type of source element provides a high power implementation of the optical beam steering system being implemented as a transmitter.","Referring now to , an embodiment is illustrated in which the source elements comprise an optical switching network, designated generally as . The switching network  illustrated is shown by way of illustration and not limitation. A single laser diode is connected via an optical fiber  to an optical switching device . Device  is, in turn, connected to a plurality of optical switching devices  that have optical fibers supported on the focal plane , as described above. The optical switching devices , may be, for example, binary waveguide devices, such as 1\u00d72 lithium niobate electro-optic devices; 1\u00d7N lithium niobate electro-optic devices; 1\u00d7N MEMS devices, such as manufactured by Lucent technologies; or, 1\u00d7N mechanical switches such as used in the telephone fiber industry.","Referring now to , an embodiment is illustrated in which vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL's)  are positioned on a focal plane  and are utilized as source elements for the optical beam steering system being implemented as a transmitter. Such VCSEL's  are manufactured by, for example, Honeywell.","Referring now to , a plurality of detectors  are positioned on a focal plane  so that the optical beam steering system is implemented as a receiver. The detectors  may be, for example, PIN's or APD's or other standard telecom detectors manufactured, for example, by Nortel or Alcatel.","Utilization of the present invention as a transmitter will be illustrated in the following example. Suppose a 20 mm focal length optical element is selected. Then, to cover a 90\u00d790 degree field of regard, the sources will have to span 40\u00d740 mm area in the focal plane. If the small angle steering device can steer through 5 degrees, then 18\u00d718 point sources in the focal plane will be required to fully cover the field of regard. This focal plane can be assembled using individual VCSEL chips mounted on a circuit board utilizing automated electronics assembly equipment. The fine steering system is fabricated using commercial techniques developed for liquid crystal displays. Thus, a large angle beam steering system can be built without precision mechanical gimbals.","Thus, while the preferred embodiments of the devices and methods have been described in reference to the environment in which they were developed, they are merely illustrative of the principles of the inventions. Other embodiments and configurations may be devised without departing from the spirit of the inventions and the scope of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
