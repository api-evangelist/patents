{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["This invention relates to digital content, and particularly to notification of activity around documents.","A wide variety of content is currently available in digital form, such as articles, papers, other publications, images, video, audio, combinations thereof, etc. As digital content has become increasingly popular, mechanisms have been developed to allow actions normally associated with content in more traditional forms (e.g., paper) to be performed on digital content. An example of such is the annotation of content. A reader of a traditional paper-copy of an article is able to use a pen or pencil to jot down notes in the margins, underline or circle sections of the article, use a highlighter to highlight portions of the article, etc. Systems are being developed that allow such actions to be performed on digital forms of content as well.","Annotating of digital content can provide numerous benefits, such as allowing multiple individuals to view (or hear) and annotate the content concurrently. However, one problem faced with annotating such digital content is how users are made aware of the annotations. One solution is to require the user to re-view the content in order to view the annotations, however this is burdensome on the part of the user. Another solution is for the annotation author to send an electronic mail (email) message to a certain user(s) whenever he or she adds a new annotation to the document. However, this is also burdensome on the user as it requires the annotation author to identify the user(s) to receive the electronic mail messages, and can result in numerous electronic mail messages being sent to the user. Thus, improvements are needed in how users are made aware of annotations.","Digital content also allows certain actions to be taken that cannot be easily taken with non-digital content. For example, content can be more easily edited by multiple persons, and can even be edited by multiple persons concurrently. However, as with annotating content, there is a problem faced in how users are notified of changes to the content.","Notification of activity around documents described herein helps solve these and other problems.","Notification of activity around documents is described herein.","Users are able to subscribe to notifications regarding activity around a document(s). Different embodiments allow different ones of multiple notification parameters to be set by the user.","Notification of activity around documents is described herein. Users are able to subscribe to notifications regarding activity around particular documents (e.g., changes to and\/or annotations to the documents). A variety of different notification parameters can be set by the user, allowing him or her to request the type(s) of notifications he or she would like to receive, as well as how frequently notifications are to be received.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","1","102","2","102","104","102","104","104","102","102","104"],"i":"n"},"Computing devices  can be any of a variety of devices, including desktop PCs, workstations, notebook or laptop computers, handheld or portable PCs, personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular phones, Internet appliances, gaming consoles, and so forth. Multiple different types of computing devices  can be communicating with document discussion system  concurrently.","Document discussion system  includes an activity monitoring and notification module , a document record , an activity record , and a subscription record . Document discussion system  manages documents that can be viewed, changed, and\/or annotated by users of computing devices . The documents themselves may be stored as part of system , or alternatively documents may be stored on other devices external to system  and references to the documents stored in system . Although illustrated as a single module, activity monitoring and notification module  may alternatively be separated into multiple components and\/or modules. Additionally, module  and records , , and  may be maintained by the same device, or alternatively may be separated over two or more devices.","A document refers to any type of digital content, such as text, graphics, images, video, audio, and so forth. A document may also be a combination of multiple types of digital content, such as articles, papers, or other publications including both text content and image content. A document can optionally be separated into multiple pieces or portions (e.g., different images can be different portions, different paragraphs can be different portions, sections with different headings can be different portions, etc.) Activity around the document refers to changes to the document (e.g., adding content, deleting content, moving sections, changing fonts, etc.) as well as annotations made to the document. Activity around the document may also refer to other actions, such as viewing or playing back the content, moving the content, copying the content, and so forth.","An annotation made on a document annotates the document and\/or another annotation. An annotation that annotates another annotation is also referred to as a \u201creply\u201d to that other annotation. An annotation that is replied to (whether it annotates the document or another annotation) is also referred to as a \u201cbase\u201d annotation. Thus, an annotation can be both a base annotation and a reply annotation.","Annotations can be stored with the document they annotate, or alternatively can be stored separately. The content of the annotation can be anything the user creating the annotation (the annotator) desires. For example, the content of the annotation may be a question about the document, a note or point for the document author or annotator to follow up on, a highlighting of a portion of the document, a note for additional data to be added to the document, a note for a change to be made to the document, and so forth. An annotation can refer to a particular portion of the document (e.g., a certain sentence, paragraph, word, etc.) or can refer to the entire document. An annotation may be the same type of digital content as the document, or alternatively a different type.","Document record  is a record of documents managed by document discussion system . Document record  can be maintained using a table or alternatively other data structures. A document managed by document discussion system  can be viewed, changed, and\/or annotated by a user of any of computing devices . Document discussion system  may optionally impose security restrictions on access to documents managed by system , such as restricting access to only particular users (e.g., based on a user id and password), particular computing devices (e.g., based on computing device identifiers), and so forth. The manner in which document record  is maintained can vary. In one implementation, document discussion system  is based on the Microsoft\u00ae Office Web Discussions features, and document record  is maintained in accordance with Microsoft\u00ae Office Web Discussions. Additional information regarding the Microsoft\u00ae Office Web Discussions features is available from Microsoft\u00ae Corporation of Redmond, Wash.","Activity record  is a record of activity that has occurred around the document(s) managed by document discussion system . Activity record  can be maintained using a table or alternatively other data structures. Module  monitors the activity around the documents managed by document discussion system , and any such activity is logged in activity record . For example, any changes made to a document managed by document discussion system  are recorded in activity record  (e.g., the actual changes made may be recorded, statistics regarding the changes (e.g., how many words were deleted, how many were added, etc.) may be recorded, etc.). By way of another example, any annotations made to a document are recorded in activity record . Activity record  also maintains a record of information about the activity, such as the author of the activity (e.g., a user identifier of the user that made an annotation or added content), the date and time of the activity, a subject line for the activity if any (e.g., typically entered by the author of an annotation), whether an annotation is a reply to another annotation, and so forth.","Activity monitoring and notification module  records activity around document(s) managed by system  in activity record . Information describing activity around a document (e.g., changes to a document and\/or annotations to a document) is stored in activity record  along with an indication (e.g., time and date) of when the activity occurred. Activity record  can thus be subsequently queried and any activity around a document since the user last accessed the document readily determined (e.g., any activity with a time and date after the time and date the user last accessed the document). The actual activity (e.g., the actual changes to a document) may be stored in activity record  or alternatively a metric of the changes (e.g., an indication that \u201ca lot has changed\u201d or \u201ca little has changed\u201d) may be stored.","Activity monitoring and notification module  can detect activity around a document in a variety of different manners. In one implementation, all activity passes through module  (e.g., the commands to add text to a document, delete a portion of a document, add an annotation, etc.), allowing module  to observe this activity and store it to activity record . In another implementation, module  is given (or otherwise has access to) both a current version of a document and the newly modified version. Module  compares the two versions to detect any changes and records those changes (or a metric of the changes) in activity record . In yet another implementation, when activity around a document occurs, the user supplies an indication to module  of the amount of activity (e.g., when the user is adding and deleting text, the user can state (e.g., by selection of a particular button or menu option) whether the changes are a \u201csmall change\u201d, \u201cmedium change\u201d, or \u201cbig change\u201d).","Subscription record  is a record of user subscriptions to document activity. A user of a computing device  can register with document discussion system  and request that the user be notified of activity around particular document(s) managed by system  in accordance with notification parameters selected by the user. These notification parameters are then stored in subscription record . The user is thus viewed as subscribing-to particular document(s) (or subscribing-to notifications regarding particular document(s)) managed by document discussion system . Multiple subscriptions to multiple documents by multiple users can be maintained concurrently using subscription record .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["150","150","150","102","104"]},"Initially, a user enters a subscription to document activity (act ). This user subscription includes one or more notification parameters selected by the user. The user subscription is received at the discussion system (act ), which maintains a record of the subscription (act ). The discussion system monitors the subscribed-to documents (act ) for activity, and sends notification(s) of the activity to the user's computing device in accordance with the user's subscription (act ). Where the notifications are sent (e.g., an electronic mail address, a computing device name or other identifier, etc.) can be selected by the user as a notification parameter. The computing device receives the notification(s) of activity around the document (act ) and displays the notification(s) of activity around the document to the user (act ).","Returning to , users of computing devices  can generate documents for management by document discussion system , and can also view, change, and annotate documents managed by document discussion system . A user that subscribes to a document can be the document author or alternatively another individual(s) interested in the document (e.g., the author's supervisor or co-worker). A user can receive notifications on any computing device , and need not use the same computing device  as was used to generate the document.","A variety of different notification parameters can be selected by the user when subscribing to a document. A single parameter or multiple parameters can be selected, and these can be changed by the user after subscribing. Numerous notification parameters are discussed herein. It is to be appreciated that a particular document discussion system may support all of these notification parameters, or alternatively a subset of one or more of the parameters. The discussions herein refer to users subscribing to documents, and allowing the notification parameters for different documents to be different. Alternatively, subscriptions may be per-user, with the notification parameters being the same for all documents subscribed-to by the user.","Notification parameters can be selected in a variety of different manners. In one implementation, a selection window or box is presented to the user allowing him or her to enter his or her selections via radio buttons, check boxes, text entry fields, drop down menus, combinations thereof, etc. This selection window or box may be presented, for example, as a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) document via a conventional browser application, or an interactive ASP (Active Server Page) web page displayed via a conventional browser application. Such an HTML document or ASP document can be hosted by the document discussion system  copied to the client device  as appropriate for entry of the user selections. Alternatively, the user may make his or her selections from an application installed on a computing device  (e.g., using drop-down menus from a menu bar, inputs to text entry fields, etc.).","One notification parameter that can be selected by the user is electronic mail (email) notification and\/or peripheral awareness notification (the user can select either type of notification or both types of notification). Electronic mail notification refers to notification by electronic mail. Document discussion system  generates an electronic mail message (or alternatively forwards data to be included in an electronic mail message to another device which in turn generates the message) and sends the message (or has the message sent) to the user. The message sent to the user includes information about the activity, and optionally may include the content of annotations made to the document(s).","Peripheral awareness notification refers to notification via a peripheral awareness mechanism on the computing device  being used by the user. The peripheral awareness mechanism is at least a portion of a display of the computing device  on which a persistent window is maintained. Within this persistent window is included one or more annotation tickets, each of which is a typically small (relative to the size of the entire display) indication of information regarding the annotations of a particular document(s) (or portion(s) of a document(s)). Peripheral awareness and annotation tickets are discussed in more detail below.","When a user subscribes to a document and selects electronic mail notification, the user receives electronic mail messages including information identifying the activity that has occurred around the document. The electronic mail messages are sent to the user at an electronic mail address(es) specified by the user when subscribing to the document.  illustrates exemplary content that can be included in an electronic mail message notifying a user of activity that has occurred around a document.","An exemplary message  received by a user of a computing device  of  is illustrated in . Additional header information (not shown in  ), such as the sender and recipient electronic mail addresses, the date and time the message was sent, etc. may also be displayed as part of message . This additional header information has not been included in  so as to avoid cluttering the drawings. Message  includes an identification portion  that identifies message  as an automatically generated (e.g., by document discussion system  of ) notification message and allows the user to obtain additional information about the document discussion system by selecting the \u201cMore information . . . \u201d link. Selection of the \u201cMore information . . . \u201d link causes a viewer, such as a conventional web browser, to be loaded and executed on the user's computing device (if not already executing) and the additional information regarding the document discussion system displayed to the user via the browser.","Two update portions  are included in message  that allow the user to modify his or her notification settings (e.g., the notification parameters he or she has selected). A source portion  identifies the document that the activity is around, and includes a link to the document. Selection of the link in source portion  causes the document to be retrieved and displayed to the user on the computing device (e.g., via a conventional web browser). Source portion  is optionally tied to the specific location in the document that the annotation is associated with (that is, the portion of the document being annotated by the annotation), and selection of the link causes the document to be scrolled to the location that the annotation is associated with. Thus, by selecting the link in source portion , the user can readily view the portion of the document that the annotation corresponds to.","Annotation portion  identifies the user identifier (\u201cemalb\u201d in this example) of the author of the annotation that the user is being notified of, the date and time of the annotation, and also an indication of whether the annotation is in reply to another annotation (in this example, the annotation is in reply to an annotation previously made by the user with user identifier \u201cduncanbb\u201d). Annotation portion  also includes the content of the annotation (which is text in message ). Annotation portion  also includes the content of the base annotation that the reply annotation is in reply to. The reply annotation is offset (e.g., indented) in order to differentiate the reply from the base annotation.","Message  of  is exemplary only. Various modifications may be made to message , and electronic mail message notifications may not include all of the information illustrated in message . For example, notification of a change to a document would not include the annotation information illustrated in .","Returning to , a user may select, as notification parameters, particular times that the user desires to receive electronic mail notifications. The particular time can include how frequently the user desires to receive electronic mail notifications, such as immediate (e.g., as soon as the activity occurs), hourly, daily, twice weekly, weekly, etc. The electronic mail notification sent includes all of the activity that has occurred around the document since the last notification was sent to the user. The user can also specify a particular time when notifications should be sent (e.g., 9:00. am, 5:00. pm, etc.), as well as a particular date to use as a basis for the frequency of the notifications (e.g., every other day starting on June 21).","A user can also select a plurality of conditions for sending electronic mail notifications, the occurrence of any one of which results in sending of an electronic mail message notification to the user. For example, the user may specify that he or she would like to receive notifications weekly or if the activity on a document since the last notification exceeds a threshold amount. The activity on the document can be measured in a variety of different ways, such as a number of new annotations on the document, a number of new reply annotations on the document, a number of new users annotating the document, a number of different users annotating the content, combinations thereof, etc. The threshold value(s) may be static (e.g., two new users annotating the document, five different users annotating the document, etc.) or dynamic (e.g., relative to a normal amount of activity around the document, such as 10% more different users than were annotating the document during the preceding two weeks, 25% more annotations than were entered during the intervals between the three preceding notifications, etc.).","A user can also select notification parameters to cause activity monitoring and notification module  to batch together the annotation information for multiple different documents into a single electronic mail notification. The user can specify a notification parameter to group together multiple documents. When module  determines it is time to send an electronic mail notification to the user (based on the user's selected time and\/or frequency, discussed above), module  identifies all the new activity around the documents in the group and combines the information for the new activity into a single electronic mail message. The single electronic mail message can be formatted in different ways, such as a header identifying each document and then the annotation for each document below that header. By grouping the activity information for a group of documents into a single electronic mail message, the number of electronic mail notifications sent to the user can be reduced.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["220","220","200","202","204","206","222"]},"An abstract summarizing the annotations made to a document may also be generated and included in the electronic mail notifications. The summary may be used with a group of one document or a group of multiple documents. The summary includes information summarizing the activity that has taken place with regard to the document(s) in the group. The summary can include, for example, an indication of how many total annotations have been made on each document in the group, an indication of how many new annotations have been made on each document in the group since the last electronic mail notification was sent, an indication of how many total base annotations have been made on each document in the group, an indication of how many new base annotations have been made on each document in the group since the last electronic mail notification was sent, an indication of how many total reply annotations have been made on each document in the group, an indication of how many new reply annotations have been made on each document in the group since the last electronic mail notification was sent, an indication of how many different users have made annotations on the document, an indication of how many different users have made changes to the document, an indication of when the last annotation or change was made to the document, and so forth.","A user can also select notification parameters to cause activity monitoring and notification module  to send a notification to the user whenever another user enters a reply to an annotation made by the user. This selection may be for immediate notification (as soon as the activity is detected), or alternatively may be for some other interval (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, etc. analogous to the discussion above). The user may also specify particular other users that he or she does (or does not) want to receive notifications in the event the user replies to one of his or her annotations. For example, the user may specify that if user A replies then send a notification immediately, if user B replies then ignore it (send no notification of it, optionally unless some other user also replies), and send notification of any other users' replies daily.","A user can also select notification parameters to cause activity monitoring and notification module  to send a notification to the user regarding changes to the document. This notification can be included with notifications of annotations, or alternatively can be a separate notification. This notification can also include the time and\/or date when the most recent change was made to the document. In one implementation, a general indication is given as to the amount of change (e.g., no changes, minor changes, or significant changes). The general indication can be determined in a variety of manners, such as: based on a number of edits performed (e.g., additions and deletions of text); based on an amount of content added and\/or deleted; based on an indication, supplied by the user making the changes, of the amount of changes (e.g., a comment supplied by the user, a selection of one of \u201csmall\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201clarge\u201d options, etc.); and so forth. The determination can be static (e.g., if changes are made and if fewer than five edits are performed or fewer than ten words are added and\/or deleted then the changes are minor, and if five or more edits are performed or ten or more words are added and\/or deleted then the changes are significant). The determination can alternatively be dynamic (e.g., if changes are made but fewer than 3% of the words are changed then the changes are minor, if 3% or more of the words are changed then the changes are significant).","A more specific indication may also be given, in addition to or in place of the general indication. Such a specific indication may include, for example, how many words were added or deleted, how many edits were performed, how much time users spent time changing the document, how many different users changed the document, whether any changes were flagged as important, etc.","Peripheral awareness notifications may also be selected by the user, in addition to or in place of electronic mail notifications. A peripheral awareness notification causes an annotation ticket to be displayed on the computing device being used by the user. Notification of activity is sent from the document discussion system  to the computing device, which displays the appropriate information in the annotation ticket. The information displayed in the annotation ticket typically includes an identification of the document and an indication of activity around the document (such as a total number of annotations made on the document and a number of new annotations made on the document). An annotation ticket may also differentiate between base annotations and reply annotations, thus including an identification of the document, a total number of base annotations made on the document, a number of new base annotations made on the document, a total number of reply annotations made on the document, and a number of new reply annotations made on the document.","A new annotation is an annotation that has been made since some particular reference point (e.g., an event or a time). The definition of a new annotation on the document can be user-specified (e.g., as a notification parameter). A new annotation may be, for example: an annotation entered since midnight, an annotation entered since 9:00. pm last night, an annotation entered during the preceding 24. hours, an annotation entered during the, preceding week, an annotation entered yesterday or today, an annotation entered since a particular date (e.g., since Apr. 15, 2002), an annotation entered since the document was created, an annotation entered since the user last opened the document, an annotation entered since the document was last modified, an annotation entered since last Monday, an annotation entered since the last fiscal quarter, and so forth.","In one implementation, a peripheral awareness counter is included on client device  that maintains a record of the new annotations for displaying of the appropriate number in the annotation ticket. This peripheral awareness counter is reset each time the document is opened (this may be sensed by the counter on device , the server storing the document may notify the counter on device , or the document discussion system  of  may notify the counter on device ). In one implementation, the document viewer (e.g., Microsoft\u00ae Word, Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer, etc.) sends a notification (e.g., a message or command) to the counter that identifies when a particular document is opened. This counter can then be used as a basis for defining a new annotation (e.g., if the definition is any annotation entered since the user last opened the document).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["250","102","252","252","254","256","254","256"]},"A ticket tooltip window  is also shown in . Ticket tooltip window  is opened when a pointer is dragged over annotation ticket . Ticket tooltip window  includes additional information regarding the annotations made on the document. For example, as illustrated in , the tooltip window  identifies the subject line, annotation content, author, and date of the new annotations.","A variety of different information can be included in tooltip window . In one implementation, any of the information discussed above with reference to electronic mail message notifications can be included in the tooltip window, including links to the document being annotated, links to allow notification parameters to be set, offsetting replies to indicate which base annotations they are in reply to, etc.","In one implementation, each annotation ticket corresponds to a single document. Alternatively, multiple documents may be referenced in a single annotation ticket. The multiple documents and their activity may be identified separately (e.g., an indication of total annotations and new annotations for each document) or alternatively combined (e.g., an indication of total annotations and new annotations for all the documents combined). Multiple documents can be selected in a variety of different manners. For example, a notification parameter selection window may be displayed to the user where he or she can enter document names or drag and drop ticket icons. By way of another example, a user may, drag and drop a ticket icon on an annotation ticket being displayed in persistent window  to cause the document corresponding to the ticket icon to be grouped together with the document(s) already corresponding to the annotation ticket.","In another alternative, a document may be separated into multiple portions (e.g., paragraphs, sections with different headers, pages, chapters, etc.). Each of these multiple portions can be identified in the annotation ticket rather than the entire document. A particular portion can be selected in a variety of different manners, such as entry of portion names in a notification parameter selection window. By way of another example, each portion may have its own ticket icon that can be dragged and dropped to cause an annotation ticket for the corresponding section to be added to the persistent window.","Various other notification parameters may also be set by the user and apply for both electronic mail message notifications and peripheral awareness notifications. Activity monitoring and notification module  can have a set of pre-defined roles from which the user can choose. These roles can be pre-defined by the designer of module , by a system administrator of document discussion system , etc. Each of these roles has a set of one or more notification parameters associated with the role. When the user selects a particular role for a x document, he or she is selecting all of the notification parameters associated with that role. Optionally, the user may be allowed to subsequently modify those notification parameters on a per-document basis. For example, a \u201cmanager\u201d role may be defined with notification parameters indicating peripheral awareness notifications and weekly electronic mail message notifications with abstracts. By way of another example, an \u201cauthor\u201d role may be defined with immediate electronic mail message notifications.","In one implementation, a user is also able to define his or her own sets of pre-defined notification parameters and assign those sets a name or identifier. These user-defined sets can be viewed as user-defined roles, and selected by the user in the same manner as other roles.","In another implementation, a user is able to copy the notification parameters from one document to another. When subscribing to a particular document, the user identifies another document (e.g., by name, by link, by dragging and dropping an icon representing the file, etc.) that is to be used as a basis for the subscription to the particular document. Activity monitoring and notification module  copies the notification parameters from the other document for use with the particular document.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},"It should be noted that the boxes and interconnections between boxes that are represented by broken or dashed lines in  represent alternate embodiments, and that any or all of these alternate embodiments may be used in combination. In general, specifying, tracking or receiving, and providing the status of information of interest, such as activity around a document as described above, can be accomplished through the use of at least one customizable dynamic encapsulated object referred to as a ticket  that when paired with a viewer , provides peripheral awareness of information of interest to a user via a container  for implementing the peripheral awareness interface on any conventional display device .","A system and process includes four basic components: 1) One or more tickets  which describe what is to be tracked or watched, where and how the data or contact information can be found, and what type of viewer  is appropriate for viewing whatever is to be tracked or watched; 2) Zero or more services  representing the means, i.e., where and how, by which information or contacts are tracked or otherwise watched; 3) One or more viewers  from a predefined or user definable or editable library of viewers, each viewer having the capability to display particular tickets  within a container ; and 4) one or more containers  for hosting ticket\/viewer pairs, i.e., \u201citems\u201d , the containers representing peripheral awareness interfaces residing on one or more display devices .","In particular, as illustrated by , \u201citems\u201d  comprising pairs of \u201ctickets\u201d  and \u201cviewers\u201d  optionally make use one or more \u201cservices\u201d  to dynamically track, interact with, and\/or watch one or more particular information sources . It should be noted that as described below the viewers  comprising a portion of the items  may contain ActiveX\u00ae or other types of controls that directly make HTTP or other communication calls without the need for using services . Consequently, the items  optionally use one or more \u201cservices\u201d . By dynamically tracking or watching particular sources of information , a current status of any particular information or communications contact is provided to the user. This information is provided graphically, textually, or via some combination thereof, by hosting one or items  within one or more containers  for providing peripheral awareness interfaces on one or more display devices .","In general, a ticket  is a combination of the information that a user desires to keep track of along with a definition of how the user desires to view that particular information or contact. The term \u201cticket\u201d  describes an extensible markup language (XML) structure, or similar language structure that defines the content of an item  within the container , such as a \u201csidebar\u201d. In particular, a ticket  consists of two portions: one that is common to all types of items, including, for example, a control name, CLSID of an ActiveX\u00ae (or other scripting language) control associated with the ticket, a URL or file path for where to obtain the code or script control if it is not locally installed, etc.; and one that varies based on the type of the ticket, including parameters specific to that ticket type, such as, for example, what type of viewer  is required to display the information defined by the ticket. While tickets  can use ActiveX\u00ae controls, it should be appreciated that many other scripting languages may be used to create controls or instructions in place of ActiveX\u00ae controls.","In particular, tickets  can be described as the individual controls hosted with a viewer  in the container or sidebar . These tickets  can be created using any one of a number of conventional programming or scripting languages, including, for example, ActiveX\u00ae, C++, Visual Basic, and DHTML plus JavaScript. However, as described below with respect to containers , regardless of which language is used to create the tickets , the tickets preferably support specific interfaces or specifications required by the container so that the container can successfully manage the items  comprised of the ticket\/viewer pairs. Exemplary ticket  types include, for example, annotation tickets.","Ticket  can include instructions for using conventional electronic communications methods for dynamically collecting statistical information relative to a document as it becomes available. Further, the ticket  also includes instructions for how to display particular information, as well as what type of viewer  is to be used for displaying that information within the container . One example of such instructions includes instructions to change the color of the displayed information when greater than a particular number of new annotations have been added to the document. Additionally, such display instructions can be user configurable (e.g., set as notification parameters) so that a user can display the desired information in a format of the user's choice.","Another useful feature of tickets  is that, in certain embodiments, tickets are shareable between users. Consequently, tickets  may be shared via email, or via any other means for transferring electronic files. For example, tickets  may be copied, cut, pasted, stored, saved, transferred, transmitted, etc., like any other electronic file using conventional techniques. In a related embodiment, tickets  can be posted on web sites then copied and pasted or dragged and dropped to the container , or to any other location on the display device .","Further, also as described in further detail below, tickets  can be stored in user profiles or databases or any other computer readable media to be accessed via any of the user's Internet or network enabled devices, or shared by colleagues, customers, friends and family, etc. of the user by simply copying or manually or automatically transmitting the ticket or, tickets to whatever computing device a user wishes the ticket to be hosted on. In addition, users can manage the tickets  such as by adding, editing, or deleting tickets via a user interface.","Services are automatically or manually selected from a predefined or user definable library of services. Zero or more \u201cservices\u201d  are used for interacting with particular information of interest. Current information or status is automatically either retrieved or received, i.e., either by \u201cpulling\u201d or \u201cpushing\u201d such information, from any one or more of a number of conventional communications sources  by using the functionality associated with one or more services . By way of example, such information sources include local file servers, email servers, MAPI servers, file transfer services, electronic databases, electronic files, instant messaging or other peer-to-peer communications schemes, or any other possible source of electronic data. However, as noted above, services  are not limited to merely providing communications to one or more sources of information.","In particular, the different services  represent shared code or functions that provide functionality for accessing, receiving, retrieving, and\/or otherwise interacting with any conventional information, source of information, or communications contact. These services  are shared in the sense that they are used either alone, or in combination, and may be used simultaneously by one or more tickets. Consequently, it should be noted that in certain embodiments multiple services  are used in combination for providing complex interactions with any conventional information, source of information, or communications contact.","One example of a \u201cservice\u201d  is, the functionality necessary for monitoring an email folder by connecting to a conventional MAPI server. Another example of a service  is functionality for sending or receiving email messages. Related services  provide functionality for communicating with contacts or transferring information via any number of conventional methods, such as, for example instant messaging or peer-to-peer communications schemes. Another example of a service  is functionality to convert a text file from one language to another. A further example of a service  is functionality necessary for monitoring a database. Still other examples of services  include functionality for receiving or retrieving data from a web site or a remote server. Any conventional method for interacting with information or source of information can be implemented as a shared service  for use by one or more tickets .","Each ticket  independently specifies which services , if any, i.e., which particular methods, protocols, communications channels or devices, are to be used for connecting with, and\/or interacting with, the information source or sources . The services  can be any conventional method or protocol for completing communications between two or more electronic devices.","Each of the tickets  is paired with a \u201cviewer\u201d . These viewers  graphically and\/or textually display the ticket  within the container  as a resizable thumbnail or icon-sized window that includes the information retrieved in accordance with the aforementioned ticket instructions. In particular, the viewer  is capable of dynamically displaying a ticket  having textual, audible, or graphical information, including still or live images, or any combination of textual, audible, or graphical information.","Each ticket  includes instructions as to which viewer is to be used for displaying the information represented by the ticket. For example, one viewer type is capable of displaying annotation information. In one embodiment, the viewer  is one of a set or library of specialized viewers that are each designed to display particular types of data, contacts, or information. However, in another embodiment, the viewer  is implemented as a \u201cmulti-viewer\u201d which is in essence an aggregation of individual viewers. These \u201cmulti-viewers\u201d are useful for displaying information relating to an aggregation or grouping of tickets  in a single thumbnail type view within the container .","The viewer  typically includes the following functions: first, the viewer shows the most relevant states of the contact or information being observed in accordance with the ticket  instructions (e.g., the most current information, and\/or the most important parts of the information that can be displayed within the ticket thumbnail); and second the viewer automatically displays the information within the thumbnail in such a way as to make good use of the space allotted to the thumbnail. Further, as noted below, the container , and the thumbnail contained therein is resizable in one embodiment. Consequently, in one embodiment, as the thumbnail is resized, the viewer automatically detects the size or available area of the thumbnail and dynamically provides whatever information can fit into the thumbnail on a priority basis, i.e., the most important parts of the information are displayed first, with less important information being displayed as space permits.","Further, in the spirit of providing peripheral awareness as described herein, one embodiment of the viewer  is capable of automatically changing the appearance of graphically displayed tickets  over time in order to unobtrusively alert a user as to changing information or communications state or status. For example, in one embodiment, where a ticket  has new or current information, retrieved from one or more information sources  via one or more services , that new or current information can be represented in color, or in gray scale, by using high contrast or brightness levels, or by using any conventional type or style of shading or transparency. However, as time passes, and the information becomes less current, the graphically represented ticket  may slowly fade to gray scale, or alternately, the contrast or brightness levels may slowly fade to indicate aging of the information. In other embodiments, the viewer  may also provide audible alerts, visible alerts, or any desired combination of audible and visible alerts. In related embodiments, the user may discontinue or otherwise edit or change individual alerts or types of alerts via the user interface described below.","Simply stated, the container  hosts peripheral-awareness items , i.e., ticket\/viewer pairs (\/). The container  is implemented in one embodiment as a persistent \u201csidebar\u201d for displaying items  along either a portion of the display device , or the entire display device. This sidebar is persistent in the sense that it is always on top, while limiting the available display area on the display device  with respect to other open applications or windows such that it does not obscure portions of any other application windows. However, in other embodiments, the container  is not persistent, i.e., it can be covered by one or more application windows, nor does it limit the available display area. Further in another embodiment, a mixture of both persistent and non-persistent containers  may simultaneously reside on a given display . In still another embodiment, a conventional \u201cauto-hide\u201d function is associated with one or more containers , such that a particular container is not visible until a user moves a pointing device near one edge of a display device . In this embodiment, the container  is shown when the user moves the pointing device to an edge of the display  where the container resides. The container  is then automatically removed from the display when the user moves the mouse away from the container.","As described above, the items  represent ticket\/viewer pairs (\/). Consequently, the items  include ActiveX\u00ae or other scripting language controls which include the instructions as to what information or communications contact is to be tracked, acquired, etc., along with a specialized viewer  for displaying that information or communications contact in whatever manner is instructed by the ticket . In general, the container  specifies the screen area used for displaying items  on the display device , allows items  to be grouped, aggregated, and manipulated spatially via a user interface, as described below. Further, the container is capable of intercepting certain types of events, such as, for example, user interaction with the items, and of passing those events to the ticket  controls as appropriate.","There are many ways of implementing the container , such as by the use of various conventional scripting languages. For example, a container\/sidebar can be implemented via a dynamic scalable window composed of DHTML and JScript with the assistance of a core ActiveX\u00ae control. Consequently, in one embodiment, the sidebar uses conventional web browser-based techniques to support dynamic object creation, hosting, and manipulation. This serves to eliminate the need for extensive and complex proprietary code development each time a third party desires to implement a ticket .","Further, in another embodiment, the container\/sidebar  requires that the aforementioned container controls support predefined interfaces so that each container can manage the items  as required by predefined guidelines specified for a user interface. Implementing such guidelines serves to bring consistency to an end-user experience, while ensuring that all tickets  will work with any device capable of displaying such tickets when combined with the appropriate viewer . Consequently, support of such predefined interfaces serves to ensure compatibility with any third party tickets , regardless of the source of those tickets. In other words, the container  is designed in such a way as to support all tickets  provided to the container, from whatever source, so long as predefined guidelines are followed.","For example, one set of exemplary rules for implementing the tickets  is that: 1) the tickets should indicate how much display area or screen real estate they require; 2) the tickets should provide a configuration user interface; 3) the tickets should provide a pop-up window (tooltip window) for accessing detailed information; and 4) the tickets should also allow the container or sidebar  to pass them their context data, i.e. the information of interest.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["300","300","300","300"]},"Computer environment  includes a general-purpose computing device in the form of a computer .

The hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  are each connected to the system bus  by one or more data media interfaces . Alternatively, the hard disk drive , magnetic disk drive , and optical disk drive  can be connected to the system bus  by one or more interfaces (not shown).","The disk drives and their associated computer-readable media provide non-volatile storage of computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, and other data for computer .
