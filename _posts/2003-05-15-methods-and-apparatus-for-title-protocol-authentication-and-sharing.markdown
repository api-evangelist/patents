CONCLUSION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Ser. No. 10\/232,861 filed on Aug. 30, 2002.","This application claims priority to U.S. Prov. No. 60\/380,787 filed May 15, 2002, U.S. Prov. No. 60\/407,466 filed Aug. 30, 2002, and U.S. Prov. No. 60\/407,382 filed Aug. 30, 2002.","The invention relates to an advanced title and transaction network. In particular, the invention provides an architecture and operation for the facilitation of the creation, ownership, exchange, management, reselling, marketing, bartering, and auctioning of titles over an electronic network such as the Internet.","The Internet has become an efficient mechanism for globally distributing digital content, such as documents, pictures, music, and other types of digital content. Information can now be transmitted directly and instantly across the Internet from the content owner to the content buyer, without having to first convert it into physical form, such as paper documents, compact disks, photographs, etc.","However, the advantage of easy digital communication has also allowed digital content to be easily pirated by just about anyone with a computer and Internet access. The combination of high-speed broadband Internet access, digital content compression software (which reduces the size of digital content files), peer-to-peer file trading networks (which allows users to post content files), and lack of a viable digital rights standard, has caused the content owners to lose control of their content. Consequently, content owners are experiencing a loss of potential revenue.","The lack of a standardized and transparent digital rights management system, however, is preventing a commercially viable solution from emerging. In order for such a system to be commercially viable, the system should be secure both from the user's and the content owner's standpoint, universal so that electronic device manufactures are encouraged to engineer it into their products, and transparent so that users are not required to change their behavior.","Existing systems that attempt to provide confidence between buyers include escrow agreements, third party confirmations, third party appraisals and other similar techniques. These systems are slow and complex, and they do not provide the content user with sufficient confidence that the buyers and sellers are not illegally replicating the content or otherwise attempting to sell pirated copies of works.","In addition to the pirating aspects associated with sharing digital content, users are burdened with less than ideal methods for legally sharing digital content. These cumbersome methods include transferring entire files to other users via electronic mail, instant messenger, peer-to-peer and other applications, or sharing hyperlinks via electronic mail, instant messenger, and other applications. These methods can be viewed as counter productive, anti-social and even bothersome to the users that receive or attempt to share the content. Sharing of entire digital content such as music via electronic mail is a drain on resources and inefficient to the electronic mail servers, the network, and the receiving users. Sharing of hyperlinks can lead to broken links, complex URL (Universal Resource Locator) strings, and restrictions on the type of content that can be shared (i.e. linked to). Compatibility problems are widespread and create frustration when sharing digital content of a specific media type.","What is needed are advanced techniques for controlling the trading of digital rights so that the buyers are assured of an authentic copy, \u201cfair use\u201d is preserved for the copy, and content owners are fairly compensated. In addition, advanced techniques are employed to provide an easy, friendly, efficient, and adaptable method for users to share digital content.","The invention relates, in one embodiment, to a title management apparatus resident on a first computer including a memory for storing a control program and data, and a processor for executing the control program and for managing the data. The apparatus includes a title object resident in the memory including a title structure, the title structure further comprising a content element, a set of attributes, and a set of title object security indicia. The apparatus further includes an authorization structure configured to selectively redeem the content element based at least in part on the user security indicia, and further configured to use a set of protocols. The apparatus also includes a title management structure configured to associate a user with the title object based at least in part on the user data and the title attributes.","The invention relates, in another embodiment, to a title method of managing title objects in a first computer having a memory. The method includes configuring user data resident in the memory including a set of user security indicia. The method further includes configuring a title object resident in the memory including a title structure, the title structure further comprising a content element, a set of attributes, and a set of title object security indicia. The method also includes configuring an authorization structure configured to selectively redeem the content element based at least in part on the user security indicia, and further configured to use a set of protocols; and, configuring a title management structure configured to associate a user with the first title object based at least in part on the user data and the title attributes.","Advantages of the invention include the ability to easily and efficiently manage and share titles over a network such as the Internet.","The invention is directed to the creation, ownership, exchange, management, reselling, marketing, bartering, and auctioning of titles.","In this context, a title is an object that may have a number of elements and attributes including embedded digital content, ownership attributes, copy permissions, and others as described herein. A title can also represent the rights to a single piece of digital content or a single resource, or it can represent the rights to a multitude of digital content and resources and in a variety of formats. The digital content rights, such as the ability to exchange or copy, are determined by the content publisher. Furthermore, a title can also represent the rights to another title or multitude of titles, which in turn express rights to digital content or resources.","Users can initiate a variety of exchanges with each other depending on the type of title and the rules associated with that title. These exchanges can take the form of trades or transfers. In the case of trades, offers can be reviewed, and then subsequently accepted, canceled, or a counter-offer can be presented. The counter-offer process can continue until satisfaction, or until trade is canceled.","In order to help protect the integrity of the trade, a chained hash cryptographic technique is used to guarantee that only a single instance of the title is in circulation at any one point in time. The title management and publisher structure may perform verification on the chained hash to ensure its integrity. The chained hash technique may be implemented in such a way as to provide benefits typically associated with one-time password and digital cash systems. However this implementation may be modified to provide a high degree of integrity around the use of titles within the ecosystem.","The chained hash technique can be combined with additional controls that work in conjunction with the security classification element to provide varying degrees of security for the title and the digital content referred to by the title. These additional controls may include cryptographic key-splitting techniques as well as multi-user and multi-factor authentication. Security class is an element that resides in the title to convey the level of security appropriate for this title. Security class is set by the publisher based on the publisher's requirements and rules. Security class can be used within the ecosystem to determine appropriate handling of the title. For example, a title with a high-security rating of 5 can force strong authentication of the user as well as strong encryption of the digital content associated with the title. As an example, a multi-user authentication requirement can be used for parental controls, whereby a guardian must also provide authentication (and acceptance) on the purchase and use of a title where a minor is involved.","The content rating system can be used by publishers to determine appropriate ratings for their content, and these ratings can be enforced by title management and resolver apparatus to ensure guardian approval. Content rating is an element within the content element to convey a rating regarding the suitability of the content. The rating system is dependent on the type of content and the regulatory factors involved (e.g. music, video, movie, etc.).","The exchange structure, specification, and rules provide the ability for the title publisher and\/or the title owner to determine the exchange capabilities of subsequent owners of the title. For example, a title publisher could limit a title owner to only one trade, or even to deny trades but allow transfers. A title owner may transfer the title to another person for a limited period of time and deny that person any ability to trade or transfer. This ability to set limitations may operate in conjunction with the rules structure.","A trust structure is also implemented to provide users with a simple ability to validate the digital content they receive. The trust structure may convey that the digital content was (if applicable) rightfully issued by the content publisher. Content publishers are not bound to use the trust structure for the titles they issue but in doing so can provide assurances to the buyer.","The invention is described with reference to specific apparatus and embodiments. Those skilled in the art may recognize that the description is for illustration and to provide the best mode of practicing the invention. For example, references are made to computer servers and clients, but in a peer-to-peer network, any computer is capable of acting in either role. Likewise, reference is made to Internet protocol while any substantially comparable data transmission protocol can be used.","A.

A digital content file stored within a content publishing structure  is redeemed through a pointer stored within is respective title. This pointer indicates the location of the digital content file. However, since this location could have changed since the title was created, a resolver structure  substitutes the updated digital content file address, if needed.","Redemption can occur in various ways. For example, the digital content file could be downloaded in its entirety, or it could be streamed to one of the client computers - and then viewed or listened locally. If the digital content file is already stored locally, redemption could allow access or playability. In the case of an online game or chat application, redemption of the digital content file could authorize participation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["160","162","160","162"]},"In another embodiment,  depicts a title management apparatus , wherein a title management structure  and an authorization structure  are resident on computer , while the content publishing structure  and a resolver structure  are resident on computer .

For example, this functionality can be used by someone to easily create a business card title and distribute that title to their associates. The title in this case would be a tag that refers (that is, points) to their \u201cbusiness card\u201d profile elements containing (as an example) their name, title, business address, and business contact information. In an other example, some else could create an emergency profile card and distribute it to specific people so that in an emergency they would have access to certain personal information such as name, medical insurance number, allergies, health risks, and emergency contacts. In this particular case, the title could be a ticket. The title transaction system provides for close integration of profile information to provide significant value add for the user as they participate in a community where communication, purchasing, trading, auctioning, and bartering are common place.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"526","i":"b "},"As depicted in , the title object has at least one stub object associated with it in order to verify the integrity and valid instance of the title. In addition to identifiers, the stub object may contain security indicia, such as the indicia required by the chained hash technique, in order to validate the single instance and valid ownership of the title. This stub object may change state on every redemption, exchange, and revocation of the title.","The title object may have more than one stub object associated with it in order to convey additional information, controls, content, or other value-add not explicitly given in the original title. The stub object provides extensibility to the title without requiring a complete replacement to the title object. As an example, a value-add reseller such as a retail merchant may attach additional content or value to the original title in order to promote their product or even to make the original title more attractive for sale or trade. In another example, an additional control stub maybe attached to the original title in order to ensure appropriate handling of the title for use by minors, such as ensuring that only an edited version of the content is viewed. The use of the stub object is flexible to ensure extensibility of the title object.","As depicted in , the stub object can contain a digital signature element in order to verify the integrity of the stub. Although the stub is viewed as an extension to the title, the stub can be digitally signed by any participant in the ecosystem. This permits a flexible architecture where multiple participants can collaborate on adding value to a title object.","The system employs a set of specification and rules for structuring, creating, managing, handling and using titles. The specification and rules, as well as the format of the title, are extensible to support the needs of both the user and content publisher, as well as the needs of intermediary systems within the ecosystem that handle (or interact) with titles.","In the exemplary embodiment, a tag is a title object that can be copied among users, a token is a title object that cannot be copied like a tag, but can be transferred or exchanged between users, and a ticket is a title object that is issued to a specific user, and hence cannot be copied or transferred among users.","B. Logical Structure and Operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","610","650","680","610","650","680"]},"A channel support structure  is responsible for communicating with users and is associated with the communication procedures . The channel support  communicates over the network using a number of possible protocols including HTTP (hyper-text transfer protocol), SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol), SMS (short messaging service) and others.","The title protocol may define a standard set of protocol bindings to describe how title transactions are communicated across those protocols. However the title protocol specification may define extensions so that the title protocol can be bound to other underlying protocols as required within the ecosystem. When an inbound message is received by the channel support , the message is passed along to a number of other structures that decode, transform and interact with the message. For example a transform structure  performs a transform on the inbound data request to conform it to a normalized application interface for a core title transaction application. The use of the transform layer at this point provides standardized parsing of the transaction as it proceeds through the pipeline to the core title transaction application. A tracker  acts as a transaction filter to maintain a log of all the inbound messages and requests. A rule structure  then applies a number of possible rules to the message. The rule structure obtains its rule sets from several sources including the title itself (as defined in the title format), data storage through the data abstraction portion, and extensions that can support the retrieval of rules through other sources such as via the network. The rules include characteristics for each title, for example, whether it can be refunded, exchanged, played viewed, etc. Often, the functions that can be performed on a given title are related to the title type. For example, in the exemplary embodiment, titles of type tag can be freely distributed to all users, titles of type ticket are tied to a specific user and cannot be exchanged, and titles of type token can be exchanged with other users. When a title of type token is exchanged with another user, the user can no longer redeem that title, and the system may disable any offline content associated with the title.","For instance, the content element within a title can contain an encrypted password that is not known to the user. A program for viewing or playing the offline content, such as Windows Media Player, would read the title through an application program interface, check the rule sets, and then execute content, such as an MP3 file, using the encrypted password. Once a user exchanges the title with another user, the rule sets would be modified to reflect that that the user no longer has rights to the content, and the content itself could not be played or viewed.","The rules associated to the title are developed and applied by the content publisher and by the user (or someone acting on behalf of the user). The title management and title publisher modules may provide an application and interface to easily develop and apply rules to the titles. For example, a content publisher may apply usage rules applicable to the title and the digital content and\/or resource it provides evidence of rights to. In turn, a user may apply default rules within the title management module to assist in controlling and protecting their actions related to certain titles (for example, to prevent from accidentally trading a valuable title). In another example, a parent may establish restrictions on the type of content their child may access and use in their title management module.","Specialized rules, called triggers, may also be used. Triggers are rules that invoke actions that are external to the title management apparatus. For instance, a parent can be notified by email that a child wishes to redeem a digital content file for which there is some age restriction.","Specialized rules, called timers, may also be used. Timers are rules that invoke actions based on a specific time or based on a spent amount of time. For example a title may only be good for twenty four hours, or an exchange may only be valid for one week. Timers maybe combined with triggers in rule processing.","The core title transaction application  (core TTS) is the application that verifies the ownership of the titles by the users and that authenticates the titles and selectively permits the titles to be transferred if such rights are allowed. Among the modules that may be contained within the core TTS application are the following:\n\n","In the outbound stream from the core TTS, the rules structure  then performs certain functions on the outbound information according to rules stored in the data  and\/or embedded in the title. The tracker  checks to ensure that the outbound information matches the inbound requests so that no inbound messages are dropped or ignored and that outbound message are responding to legitimate inbound messages. The tracker may log transactions in accordance with the configuration. The transform  converts the outbound information from a normalized format into a format that conforms to a user profile or preference, as well as based on incoming requests for particular transforms. For example, the data can be transformed into WML for display on a WAP enabled phone, or into HTML for display on a web browser. Certain transforms can be executed based on rules established within the system. The profile or preference data as well as the transform templates are retrieved from the data portion  in order to perform the transform. Finally, the channel support  communicates with the user of the network in a native protocol format.","In another embodiment,  depicts a logical structure of the invention as deployed in an ecosystem according to an embodiment of the invention. The ecosystem  is comprised of a number of entities, each providing a service of benefit to the overall system, and each connected to the other using some type of network protocol.","The title manager , content publisher , transaction maker , content creator , and hosting provider  are coupled to each other using a network protocol  such as TCPIP over the Internet. The client device  can be coupled to title manager , content publisher  and transaction maker  using any one of a number of network protocols. Among these are HTTP , E-Mail (SMTP) , and SMS .","Initially, the content creator  creates a digital content file, such as an MP3 song, as well as a title associated with the digital content file. The creating user interacts with a display as shown in  and described in detail below. The digital content file is transmitted across the network protocol  to hosting provider , where it is stored until a content publisher  desires to make it available to users with a client device . The content creator also transmits the title to the title manager  using network protocol .","Users desiring the digital content file may access the transaction maker  using the client device . Transaction maker  functions as a marketplace where digital content buyers and sellers can transact with each other in a secure environment. When a user agrees to buy the digital content file from a seller, in this case the content publisher , the transaction maker  communicates this to the title manager , which in turn, modifies the title of the digital content file with the new rights just purchased by the user. The user can now redeem the digital content file from the content publisher  and download it to the client device .","If the user desires to transfer the title to a new user, and the title's security indicia allows it, the user can become a digital content seller and post an offer to transfer the title on transaction maker . As before, when a new user agrees to buy the digital content file from the user, the transaction maker  communicates this to the title manager , which in turn, modifies the title of the digital content file with the new rights just purchased by the new user. The buyer can now redeem the digital content file from the content publisher  and download it to the client device . The seller can no longer access the digital content file on the content publisher .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":["800","806","802","806","802","808","806","804"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0121"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 8A"],"b":["810","806","802","812","802","813","814","815"]},"In this example, the user selected mySongArtist#3  in the title folder pane , and is displayed the owned titles to mySongArtist#3 songs .

The title manager  located in the DCE provides title management services to the consumer such as adding, viewing, and trading titles. Additionally, the title manager  provides wallet-functionality for viewing accounts, currencies, and receipts as well as handling payment processing on behalf of the consumer. Optionally, the functionality offered by both the consumer's device and the DCE can be packaged in a number of ways including a completely integrated application to be run on a consumer's device such as a desktop computer.","The merchant site  is an online merchant system that provides both web-based and e-commerce functionality such as catalog, product information, product configurators, shopping pages, shopping cart, and payment services. While only one merchant site is shown in the diagram, the invention can support any number of merchant sites. The merchant site  is further comprised of title-enabled components as shown in . As shown in , the merchant site can include a title manager , title publisher , digital lockbox , and title merchant plugin . All components are optionally operated by the merchant but are generally available to merchants that are title enabled. The title manager provides the merchant with management functions for titles that they own or potentially for customers. The title publisher allows the merchant to publish titles such as the titles that may be given to customers that reference customer's rights to digital content file s. The digital lockbox is an example where the merchant hosts the lockbox for trading purposes instead of a third party service. The title merchant plugin provides payment support services for the merchant including communication with digital lockboxes, title verification, and an interface with payment providers. While only one component of each type is shown, the invention can support any number of components to be hosted by the merchant.","The third party digital lockbox  in  is an application that provides a temporary and secure safe harbor for all transaction titles until title rights are established. While only one digital lockbox is shown, the invention can support any number of digital lockboxes. It is generally hosted somewhere in the network by the merchant, or a trusted third party escrow service. For instance, a title may be released to the consumer from lockbox  once the purchase is completed. As shown in  the merchant site can also host a digital lockbox to provide a mechanism for supporting the payment process, that is supporting exchange transactions, in lieu of a third party service.","The title enabled payment provider  is an online payment provider service that is title enabled, in that they can support title based transactions. While only one title enabled payment provider is shown, the invention can support any number of title enabled payment providers. In addition to supporting titles, a title enabled payment provider  would provide services typical of a payment provider such as payment processing, gateways to payment networks, and merchant accounts. As shown in  a title enabled payment provider  can operate title-enabled components such as title manager , title publisher and digital lockbox . These components would provide the same services to the payment provider as similar components provided to the merchant site .","Each of the system elements shown in , , and  are coupled to the other using a network protocol , such as TCP\/IP over the Internet. Furthermore, consumers can access online title manager functions directly within merchant sites  if they are permitted. For instance, payment options shown at the merchant site reflect those available in the online title manager , but other options can be added.","As previously described, a title is an object that may have a number of elements and attributes including embedded digital content, ownership attributes, and copy permissions. In this example, a consumer wishes to buy a product or service from a merchant using a title transaction. A purchasing transaction generally comprises two or more separate titles: a product title or titles being offered by the merchant; and a payment slip title or payment titles being offered by the consumer. The product title or titles give the title owner specific rights to the product, for instance, the ability to play a song. The payment slip title is a financial instrument that authorizes a payment provider to pay the merchant for any product titles purchased. Once the transaction is complete, the consumer would be in possession of the product title or titles and the merchant would be in possession of the payment slip title or payment titles.","For instance, a customer would use a web browser on customer's device  to access a merchant site  through online title manager . When the merchant site determines that the transaction is title-enabled, it presents the product title choices and displays the consumer's title payment options. Once items are selected for purchase, the merchant site places the product titles in a digital lockbox , generates a pre-filled sales order title comprising transaction details including a transaction number, product title information, purchase detail, and information on the digital lockbox . The sales order title functions as an electronic invoice or promise of payment for the merchant .","The sales order is transmitted back to title manager  and stored for the consumer to view, select payment type, and approve using the consumer device . Once approved by the consumer, the title publisher  may generate a payment slip title using the sales order title as a guide. The payment slip title is transmitted to the digital lockbox  and the merchant  is notified. The merchant  verifies the payment slip title in the digital lockbox  and completes the transaction by releasing the product titles to the customer. A receipt title can also be generated and included in the transaction if requested or required. The merchant  then captures payment from the customer by forwarding the completed payment slip title to the title payment provider  for payment. Alternatively, the merchant  can use a standard collection process such as that used for credit card processing, and deal directly with a traditional payment provider .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0128","num":"0148"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A","FIGS. 12A"],"b":["13","13","1204","1210","1214","12","12"],"i":["a","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0149"},"figref":"FIG. 13A","b":["1301","1301","1301","1302","1303","1303","1302","1304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0150"},"figref":"FIG. 13B","b":["1310","1310","1310","1311","1313","1310","1312"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0131","num":"0151"},"figref":["FIG. 13C","FIG. 12A"],"b":["1320","1320","1321","1206","1321","1321","1214","1216"]},"As described previously, a sales order title is created by the title publisher operated by the merchant site  as shown in .

A title object can be represented in a number of formats including XML, ASN.1, or other proprietary formats including textual and binary structures.","Although certain examples of the title structure are presented, the structure is intended to represent any number of digital and physical assets such as digital content, including music, images, video, and text, as well as physical goods such as computers, cameras, vehicles, and appliances. Furthermore, a title can be used to represent virtual assets such as an online experience created through a series of activities and events, and can also represent currencies such as cash. In one an embodiment, a title structure can be used to represent both a digital and physical asset such as the identity of a person, whereby the person has physical assets associated with their identity and also digital assets associated with their identity.","Referring now to , title object  is displayed in which a set of stub elements  are advantageously employed to optimize titles. Although several stub elements are displayed within the title object, in other embodiments, a title object may have no stub elements or may just have one stub element.","In one aspect of the invention, a set of stub elements can be coupled to a specific title, to further optimize a title's content, attributes, and security indicia. In another aspect of the invention, a stub element can be created and coupled to the title, after the title is created. In yet another aspect of the invention, a stub element can be coupled to a set or group of titles as specified in the stubs binding information. This permits efficient coupling of stubs to titles.","Title element  comprises a structure used to describe the title and the content (or asset), and express the rights associated with title object . Title object  can be issued for a specified period of time or can be left infinite. The integrity of title object  can be further protected by the use of cryptographic algorithms. In one embodiment, a digital signature is used. In another embodiment a chained hash is used. Information within title element  can be overridden by information contained within stub element , as long as stub element  was issued by the same entity as title object , and further specifies what information is being overridden.

Content component  can further comprise additional information such as ID, name, creator, rating, etc. A single title object , as shown in , can express rights to multiple digital content files, with the information regarding each in separate content components . For example, a title object  can express rights to a music album where the album is comprised of multiple songs, sheet music, pictures, and lyrics. Each content piece such as a song or lyrics in this case can be described in multiple content components . In one embodiment, the content component  can provide detailed information relating to a physical asset instead of a digital asset. In this case, sufficient information is contained within the title content component to identify the physical asset such as SIC, manufacturer, manufacturer ID, model number, serial number, etc. In another embodiment, the content component can contain industry or technology specific identifiers such as that used by the IANA, Rosettanet or even technologies specifications such as RDF.","Rules component  comprises statements specifying the specific rules that are applied to the use of the title, as well as procedures for monitoring events associated with title object , as shown in .

In another embodiment, the rules can be expressed through pointers, references, and links such as the rules component  containing a set of URI references to rule logic contained within a dictionary. The rules component can contain business logic associated with the title and are not exclusively used for access control, authentication, or rights expression. Business logic rules can be incorporated for additional processing, pre-processing, event processing, triggers, callbacks and other business logic that maybe associated with the title. For example, rules can be implemented to perform event processing based on a certain action being taken, or a specific state of the title. The rules expressed within this component can trigger off certain state information that maybe contained within stub components along with information contained within the title. The rules can even be used to query information on other systems in order to perform a certain event.

Tickets and tokens within the title ecosystem will have authenticator stubs associated with the title in order to properly authenticate the title object, and validate that it is the correct instance of the title object. In another embodiment, a tag or shadow title may not have an authenticator stub as it may not be required for authentication and validation. In this example, a shadow title would be a title that is a \u201ccopy\u201d of the valid and authenticate title, although by itself is not valid. Shadow titles, in this instance, are valuable techniques for sharing content, such that a shared title can still give the recipient access to sample information, or limited content such as a restriction for one time only use, or access to a low quality version of a song. In an embodiment, the authenticator stub contains the security indicia associated with the title, and the structure of the security indicia would be dependent on the authentication technique applied by the publisher of the title.","In one embodiment of authenticator component , a chained hash technique can be employed to authenticate the title. Authenticator component  would contain the encrypted seed for the hash, a copy of the current valid hash in the hash chain, and an algorithm identifier, all of which would be used by a state server to authenticate the title in conjunction with an index that the state server maintains. In another embodiment, a hash tree can be implemented within the authenticator stub to support divisible titles. The hash tree technique can be employed by titles that represent cash or some form of currency that can be divided.","In another embodiment, stub content  comprises embeddedcontent , which can further include a digital content file. Embeddedcontent  can be also be used by issuers who wish to provide an option to their customers for embedding content directly into title object . Advantages includes additional functionality in processing title object  (for example, while executing a trade only title objects are included in the lockbox, therefore eliminating any potential security exposure by having embedded content directly inside the title object ). In another embodiment, the embeddedcontent can contain textual information or even XML structured information.","In another embodiment, stub content  comprises rules component . In another embodiment, a rules component  procedure can override rules component  procedure, as shown in . The structure of the rules would be similar to that of the rules component  in the title element.","Other component  comprises other functionality that may be included in stub content  and defined by the publisher of the title and understood, interpreted, and processed by applications involved in the title transaction ecosystem.","Referring now to , descriptor component  as shown in  is further described. Descriptor component can function as a \u201cheader\u201d element for title object , as shown if , and provides descriptive information related to the title. The descriptor can be used by system applications used in processing the title, and can be used by system applications involved in generic processing of titles such that they only interpret and act upon title specific information regardless of the content they contain, reference, or express rights to. For example, a system application may only be concerned with the type of title that is being processed such as tag, ticket, or token. Likewise, another system application may only be concerned with the security classification and the priority setting associated with the title.","Titleid component  comprises the unique identifier associated with the title. In one embodiment the titleid is a GUID (globally unique identifier). In another embodiment, the titleid is a unique identifier within all titles created by a single issuer. The identifier used in title id can be formal or informal, registered or not registered. Titletype component  comprises the type of the title object  such as tag, ticket, or token and states the type in this component. The type can be specified as a textual string element such as \u201cTag\u201d, \u201cTicket\u201d, or \u201cToken\u201d, or in another embodiment can be specified through formal or informal identifiers such as a registered OID (object identifier). In another embodiment, titletype can provide a formal structural hierarchy to the title such that title can be associated with a family of titles, and can be used to describe how the title was formed based on a type of inheritance. The titletype would contain specific title-typing indicia such that the processing applications can retrieve, understand, interpret, and process properties associated with ancestor titles. In another embodiment, the titletype can be used to reference the template that was used to create the title.","Titlename component  is a short text string used to name the title object , and is similar to a file name. Titledescription  comprises a longer text string, and can be used to contain primary descriptive information regarding title object , including ID, type, name, description, and technical elements used for processing. Typeofcontent  comprises the type of content referred to by title object . In one embodiment, Typeofcontent  can include terms such as \u201cmixed\u201d, \u201cmusic\u201d or other descriptive term. In another embodiment, typeofcontent can contain more formal definitions such as MIME type classifications or industry standard codes such as that used in Rosettanet and EDI systems. Additionally, typeofcontent can be used to specify a title content such that other titles may be embedded within or specified by this title. In this example, a title can refer to other titles and convey additional rules or taxonomy regarding the referred to or contained titles.","Securityclass component  comprises security classification identifiers that can be used by processing applications. In one embodiment, the classification can be as simple as a numerically ordered scheme that identifies the security processing level required of this title from an range of low to high. In another embodiment, the classification scheme can be a registered scheme or even a more technically descriptive classification such as that used in ASN.1 encoding schemes for X.509 certificates. Priorityflag component  comprises a priority indicator to be used by processing applications to apply appropriate levels of processing such is the case for service level agreements, or quality of service guarantees. For example, a high priority setting can indicate to processing applications that this titles requires priority processing (that is, preferred status) and can be placed at the front of the queue. In an embodiment, the priorityflag can be textual, numerical, or structured information to be used by processing applications. In another embodiment, the priorityflag can provide or reference technically descriptive service level agreement detail that can be directly processed by applications, such as that used in Policy Based Networks or Directory Enabled Networks.","Trackit component  comprises indicators for the level tracking information that should be maintained by processing applications, such as if title object  must be tracked on every event. In another example, the trackit component can specify that both the transaction request and response information be tracked in the log. In another embodiment, the trackit component can specify that every action must be tracked in a stub element  of the title object . By tracking transactions and events in the stub, the title can maintain a journal of activities and provide a self contained log. The logging activity within a single stub or multiple stubs can be used as a record of the activities that comprise the titles experience. This can be used as an effective tool for analysis and reporting, and is also an essential aspect for titles creating and representing an experience, whereby the title maintains its own state. For example, a title can be used to create a digital treasure hunt, where the owner of the title redeems it for each step in the treasure hunt. Completing each step requires that the title maintain its state and also record the activities completed by the owner. When the treasure hunt is complete, the owner is entitled to receive a prize. The trackit component , along with the recording ability of stubs, permits the title to create this experience. The title also becomes a record that can prove a sequence of steps. The tracking ability enabled by the trackit component  and stubs can be used by rules components for fine-grained control over a title and for event processing. For example, based on a specific step within an experience, the title can initiate certain actions. This would require understanding of the current state and the sequence of steps that led up to the event.","The membership component  comprises title membership information such as the group or family that a title may belong. In one embodiment this could be implemented as a group identifier and in another embodiment this could be implemented through references.","Referring now to , content component  as shown in  is further described.

In this case, the shortform provides quick and immediate access to information, whereas the title provides access to the entire contact information. Shortform and shortformpointer and useful components when titles are traded and shared.","Redeem  component comprises methods for the redemption of the title object. Redemption of the title object can be obtaining the digital content that the title refers to, or can also be the trading of the title or the sharing of the title. The redeem component is a structured component that has one to many methods describing in detail how the title may be redeemed. This structure is flexible to accommodate a variety of redemption processes and procedures that are required by publishers and consumers of title objects.","Rating component  comprises a content rating for the digital content file, such as the MPAA rating of \u201cG\u201d, \u201cPG\u201d, etc. The detail within the rating component is context specific according to the content or asset referred to by the title object. Contentintegrity  comprises a cryptographic message digest which is used for verification of digital content integrity.

Redeem component further comprises a set of methods , including a query component , a rules component , a pointer component , and other component . As mentioned, the redeem component can include from one to many methods, with each method describing how the title object can be redeemed. In one embodiment, a method can describe how the digital content maybe obtained. In another embodiment, a method may describe how digital content maybe obtained in a streaming version. In yet another embodiment, a method can describe how the title object can be shared, traded, sampled, archived, destroyed, communicated, or processed depending on the specific requirements of the publisher and the consumer application. In another embodiment, a redemption method can be used to specify how a new title can created based on the current title object being redeemed. A redeem method may include one, some, or all of the components identified in .","In another embodiment, a query component  comprises searching procedures for the digital content file. This component has attributes to identify the query mechanism being described. In one embodiment, the query component can contain SQL queries in order to obtain dynamic information from a database. In another embodiment, the query component can contain an XQuery statement to obtain data from an XML data set or document collection. In another embodiment, the query component can contain computer executable statements to process some query business logic in order to calculate or process the results. The rules component  comprises statements specifying the specific rules that are applied before, during, and after redemption. The structure and statements contained within the rules component is similar to that described for the rules component  in the title object, in that it can contain and describe any type of rules statement such as XSLT, XrML, BRML; and can also contain pointers or references to external rules. However, this rules component is specifically associated with a redemption method.","The pointer component  specifies a pointer to the content or asset being referenced by the title object. The pointer structure is specified in the component and in one embodiment can be a simple URL. In another embodiment this may be a URI, XPointer, XLink, coordinates or other pointer description to the content or asset.","Other component  comprises additional functionality that may be added to the set of methods . The other component accommodates proprietary or custom information to be used during redemption and should be understood, interpreted, and processed by applications.","Referring now to , issuer component of title element  as shown in  is further described. Issuedate  comprises the date that title object  was issued. In one embodiment, name component  comprises a textual name string for the issuer of title object . As described earlier, the name component can be a formal name for the issuer of the title such as a registered Internet Domain Name or X.500 Distinguished Name.

The date can be specified in the UTC date\/time format.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram displaying title object  lifecycle and management steps is displayed, according to one embodiment of the invention. Initially, a title is designed at step . The design process would take into consideration the source content or asset and identify properties that should be included in the title. The design process must also carefully consider the redemption methods that are appropriate for the content (or asset) and clearly specify the redemption processes that will be described in each method. All taxonomy, security, rule processing, business logic, and descriptive information will be identified, described, and documented during the design phase of a title object. As an output to the design phase, a title object template will generally be created and identified. The template is used as a technical guideline, script or set of instructions that can be used during the creation process to generate a title object. Templates can be stored for re-use. An application that assists or implements the design aspects of a title can provide typical design functions such as collaboration, planning, scheduling, and reporting. Collaboration in title design can be an effective tool for creating complex title objects that consist of multiple elements. As an example, a digital album can involve several parties for design of covers, images, audio, text, and sheet music elements. Scheduling aspects maybe required to schedule the creation of titles. For instance, titles can be created on demand on created in batch.","The next step in the lifecycle and management is the production or creation stage, as shown in create title . The create title  stage involves a \u201cfactory\u201d or similar process to produce titles. Production can be on-demand, in bulk, or as scheduled depending on the requirements of publishers. Implementations of the create title  process can consider request, complexity, reporting, control, and performance factors to ensure that production demands are satisfied. Additional functionality supported by the create title  process can include warehousing and distribution of titles that are created. Warehousing and distribution functions can be used to service requests by several parties involved in the title object lifecycle such as in syndication and content distribution networks. The creation process is described further in . The output from this stage would be title object instances.","The next stage in lifecycle and management is the storage of titles as depicted in . This stage would include typical title object storage and management functions including securing title objects as they are stored, properly authenticating owner's access to title objects, and viewing title objects that maybe stored. Storage functions can be implemented as server applications or incorporated directly into client applications that run directly on consumer computing devices such as desktop computers and mobile devices. Server applications can be implemented to support a community of users. Storage of title objects can be a critical stage in the lifecycle as a title object may tend to spend a majority of its life in storage. Therefore, it will be essential for applications involved in this stage to provide proper handling such as ensuring that security requirements are satisfied.","The next stage in the lifecycle and management is the consuming of titles as depicted in . Consuming of titles primarily involves the use of titles in order to experience the content. This is accomplished by redeeming the title using the Variety of redemption methods defined within a title object. Applications that are involved in this stage can be complex as they must effectively process the title object, including rule processing, business logic processing, interpretation of descriptive information, resolution of references and pointers, and most importantly the authentication of titles and owners. In an embodiment of the lifecycle there would also be the communication, interpretation and processing of fine-grained trust between all parties involved in the lifecycle. In one embodiment, the title manager, resolver, state server, content proxy, and content server would all be involved in the consumption of a title object.","Consume title  component can tie back to the design title  and create title  components to complete the lifecycle. In one embodiment, the detail obtained through the consumption and use of title objects will be essential information used in the design of subsequent and additional titles. In another more direct embodiment, the consumption of title can be effectively tracked and directly used by one title object to create a new or enhanced title object template. In this instance, as a title is consumed it will progressively track and update various properties within its stub element structure. These properties will combine to represent the experience of the title object, and on a particular redemption method will generate either a new title object template or an enhanced title object template. The new or enhanced template can then be used to create additional title objects. In this embodiment, a title can be an effective tool and mechanism for use in expert systems or artificial intelligence engines. In another embodiment, a title can be used as a data source into the create title  process to create new titles, and this can be triggered by one of the redemption methods in the original title. This embodiment can be an effective technique in using title objects for syndication or delegation. It can also be an effective technique for transforming a title object, enhancing a title object, evolving a title object, or morphing a title object.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0206","num":"0226"},"figref":["FIG. 37A","FIG. 36","FIG. 37A"],"b":["3604","3702","3704","3706","3704","3706","3704"]},"Title trading is supported by the title technology and the applications that process titles. Trading between parties can be accomplished in many different ways and involve any number of technologies and techniques. Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a digital lockbox component is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. In this example, digital lockbox component  is used as a secure container for the title objects that are being traded between party A and party B. Digital lockbox component  further comprises two secure areas that contain the title objects for trade, party A's title objects  are stored in drawer , while party B's title objects  are stored in drawer . Digital lockbox component  further permits inspection by either party into the contents of the lockbox in order for each to verify the title objects and approve or cancel the trade. Digital lockbox component  would not permit ownership to be transferred and only permits viewing of sample content, or of the content permitted by a redemption method (e.g. content legally shared). When both parties have confirmed the trade and approved of title objects  and , digital lockbox component  claims ownership over all title objects in the lockbox, and then transfers ownership to the respective party. Transferring ownership involves delivering title objects  and  to the appropriate title manager  and  and subsequently having title managers  and  claim ownership for their respective party. Digital lockbox component  in this case is similar to a 3party escrow system by providing a substantial level of guarantee to both parties involved in the trade. For instance, if any part of the trade failed during the claim process, digital lockbox  can rollback the entire trade. Digital lockbox  can also provide a legal record of the trade to all parties involved in the trade. As shown in the example, the contents of the trade can be one or multiple title objects.","In another embodiment, digital lockbox component  supports a transfer in which party A intends to give party B the title objects with nothing expected in return. For example, party B could sample the content and review it before accepting the transfer. The claim process for the title objects would remain the same and digital lockbox component  can provide a record of the transaction. In yet another embodiment, digital lockbox component  can support: multi-party, dependent trades, nested-trades. In yet another embodiment, digital lockbox component  may support complex trades involving service level agreements, insurance, legal recourse, guarantees, and content introspection. For example, a highly confidential trade can be implemented with special content inspection rights provided through digital lockbox component . This would provide both parties with the ability to view the confidential content for the duration of the trade negotiations under special circumstances, such as viewing directly using a controlled application similar to that provided by digital rights management software.","In another embodiment, a simplified trade can be executed directly between two parties by having title manager components  and  simply transfer title objects  and , and subsequently have the receiving title manager  and  claim ownership over the respective title objects  and . In yet another embodiment, a trade can be executed directly by title manager components  and  acting as secure agents. An established protocol can be used by title managers  and  to securely trade the title objects. For example, a Boolean circuit can be utilized by the title managers. In another embodiment, security ownership indicia associated with each title object can be updated according to specific title authentication techniques employed by each respective title objects  and .","Although the structure and management of titles as described herein may make specific or general references to certain technologies such as XML, other technologies may be available. Title structures can be represented in any number of formats, and management or lifecycle processes can be implemented in any number of ways. For example, a title object and its management maybe implemented directly in computer executable code. This type of title object can be an effective method for creating title enabled mobile code, self-executing title objects, digital robots, and crawlers. In this example, using the title object can provide significant benefits in that trust and integrity can be transmitted with the mobile code. In the example where the title object is self-executing code, the title object can implement title creation functions to morph or transform itself. In another embodiment, a title object can be described in a scripting language and executed as required. For example, a title object can be described and implemented as a Javascript program and embedded within a web page. The Javascript program would comprise not only the title structure, but also the logic to process the titles such as implementing the rules and redemption methods. The Javascript code can be used to embed titles in a web page and participate in the title transaction ecosystem.","In another embodiment, title objects and management components are directly embedded into hardware. For example, a title object can be stored on a smartcard device along with a secure management component that is responsible for processing and updating the title object's security indicia. A user would subsequently insert the smartcard into a terminal in order, among other things, to guarantee transaction validity. The title object's security indicia would be securely updated directly on the smartcard, as a security precaution. In another example, management components are implemented as firmware in hardware computing appliances (i.e., firewalls, consumer set-top boxes, etc.), or in portable hardware tokens that can be attached to computing devices through direct interfaces, cables or wireless connections.","F. Title Protocol and Authentication","In another embodiment, a title protocol is employed for communication between systems participating in a title based transaction. Referring now to , a simplified title transaction flow is shown, such as the redemption of a title to obtain content. In one embodiment, the title transaction components operate on separate computing devices. In another embodiment, the title transaction components operate on the same device. For example, the functionality of title manager  can be operated directly on consumer device  as a complete application. Likewise, the functionality of content proxy  can be operated directly on content server . Furthermore, this transaction flow can be used to assist in the description of the protocol requirements, and additional transaction flows are intended to be supported by the protocol.","The components depicted in  may communicate using protocol . In one embodiment, protocol  is a layered protocol whereby a title specific protocol must operate on top of another underlying protocol, which may also run on top of another protocol. For example, protocol  may comprise a SOAP message which uses the HTTP protocol for communication over a TCP\/IP network. In another embodiment, protocol  can be the title protocol expressed in a format communicated directly over a TCP\/IP network. In this embodiment, the protocol  can be implemented with a complete set of specifications in a similar fashion to HTTP. This implementation can include protocol message structures, choreography, standard command languages, and extensible constructs. As and example, protocol  can be implemented as another standard Uniform Resource Locator (URL) such that it can be specified in a format similar to DAXP:\/\/transaction.example.com where DAXP is the protocol reference. In this case DAXP is only used as an example and could refer to the Digital Asset exchange Protocol. In another embodiment, protocol  comprises a mixture of protocols as required for communication between the various components. For example, consumer device  can be a mobile device that uses a binary representation of protocol  and communicates using an RF protocol to title manager  and content proxy . In the same transaction flow, the remaining components can communicate using protocol  expressed as a SOAP message. In one embodiment, protocol  can be used for establishing dynamic and policy controlled connections in existing network infrastructures, such as control signals for packet switching networks, content distribution networks, load balancing systems, and also for establishing security associations in secure protocols such as IPSec and IPv6.","Protocol  can be used in other circumstances and not just for communication between devices over an external network such as the Internet. In another embodiment, the protocol can be implemented within a device for communication between components. For example, in an embedded implementation such as an electronically controlled machine in a manufacturing application, the protocol  can be implemented for communication between discretely operating components. This can include retrieving control sequences and operating independent machine apparatus. The protocol can accommodate both synchronous and asynchronous messaging processes such that sequences of events can be triggered as required as well as on-demand, or as available.","In one embodiment, consumer device  is used to communicate the redemption request to title manager . Title manager  performs title processing and returns a title command to the consumer device redirecting the consumer to the content. Consumer device  communicates the title directly to content proxy , which subsequently makes a request to a trusted resolver  in order to validate and authenticate the title. In this embodiment, resolver  is a separate component. In another embodiment, the resolver functionality may be incorporated directly into the content proxy.","Resolver  both validates the title (by ensuring that rules are properly executed) and also to authenticate the title. In one embodiment, in order to properly authenticate the title, resolver  communicates the title object to the state server . State server  subsequently authenticates the title object using an authentication technique specified by the title and supported by state server . The authentication process may further involve security indicia included with the title object. The endorsement process is responsible for placing the security indicia in the title object. In one embodiment, state server  returns the authentication response to resolver  along with updated security indicia for the title. If the title is authentic and valid, resolver  communicates the updated security indicia to title manager  and responds to the original request by content proxy .","Upon successful authentication, content proxy  permits the request through to content  which is then returned to consumer device . If the transaction should substantially fail, and consumer device  cannot communicate with content , an error message may be returned. In one embodiment, the error message is substantially communicated to all participating parties to insure an orderly rollback of the transaction, if needed.","In another embodiment, multiple titles may be involved in a transaction. For example, a consumer may want to redeem multiple content objects, each comprising a separate title object, or redeem only one title object requiring the presentation of another title object for identity and authorization. In yet another embodiment, the intermediary parties and systems involved in a transaction may also be required to present titles to other systems with which they communicate with during the transaction flow. These titles can be used to authenticate the intermediaries and systems involved. For example, resolver  in  may be required to present a ticket to state server  in order to authenticate it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0219","num":"0239"},"figref":["FIG. 39","FIG. 38"],"b":["3801","3902","3904","3906","3902","3801","3902","3904","3906","3902","3801"]},"Header component  may be used to contain transaction and system specific information that will be processed by some or all of the parties involved in the transaction flow. The header information can be items such as action identifiers, transaction type specifications, routing information, remote commands, and security classifications. Body component  may be used to contain the transaction detail such as titles involved in the transaction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0221","num":"0241"},"figref":["FIG. 40A","FIG. 39"],"b":["3904","4002","4012","4014","4016","4018","4020","4022","4002","4004","4005","4006","4007","4008","4009","4010","4011"]},"Descriptor component  may be used to describe system related properties associated with the transaction. Transactionid component  may provide an identifier for the transaction that can be used for tracking purposes, and can also be used to maintain state of the transaction. The identifier can be a GUID or some other form of identifier supported by the applications in the ecosystem. Actiontype component  may identify the action that the protocol is initiating and can be a textual label specifying an action such as \u2018redeem\u2019, \u2018delete\u2019, or can be a formal identifier used within the title transaction ecosystem such as an object identifier or URI. Actiontype component  identifies the type of action being performed by the requesting application and may also be used as an identifier in order to initiate particular actions in applications such as triggering tracking and routing. Transactiontype component  may specify the type of transaction that is being conducted, such as identifying this transaction as an ACID transaction. By indicating an ACID transaction all participating applications in the transaction flow must maintain a record of the transaction and also provide the ability to rollback the transaction if required. Transactiontype can comprise a simple indicator of the nature of the transaction and it can also include granular control instructions over the transaction. For example, the transactiontype component can reference transaction processes that must complete before the transaction is successful and if any process fails to complete, the entire transaction is rolled back. In another example, certain processes can be required to complete where other processes can be optional. In this example, a transaction process such as an asynchronous notification message need not complete for the transaction to complete successfully.","Sequenceid component  may provide an identifier for a transaction sequence that this particular transaction object is a member of in set or chain of transactions. In one embodiment, sequenceid component  specifies a numerical order for the processing of this transaction, or provides a more sophisticated identifier such as a hierarchical technique. Securityclass component  may identify the security classification associated with the transaction. The classification may be understood, interpreted, and acted upon by all applications that process the transaction. In one embodiment, the classification is a numerical ordering specifying a security setting from low to high. In another embodiment the securityclass component  specifies a set of parameters or instructions for processing such as indicating the security classification of devices permitted to receive and\/or process the protocol message. For example, specifying a government security classification. Priority component  may indicate a priority or class of service that should be applied to the processing of this transaction. In yet another embodiment, priority component  is a textual label to indicate a priority level. This component can maintain service level agreements or providing quality of service guarantees. For example, a transaction object with a high priority level can be placed at the head of the queue for faster response or priority transmission.","Lifespan component  may specify how long a transaction should live. This comprises controls on the processing of the transaction, such that it must be completed within a specified time period, or must be completed within a specified number of steps. Lifespan component  can specify a time such as a UTC time, and\/or can specify a numerical number, or some other lifespan indicia that would be understood by applications in the title ecosystem. For example, the minimum and maximum number of devices that a protocol message must traverse in an automated fulfillment application. In this example, the fulfillment process can be automated by a title object traversing a network of fulfillment devices using the protocol  for communication. The title object traverses the network to each device in search of fulfillment offers. The depth of the traversal is controlled by lifespan component  before the title object discontinues its search. Titleaware component  may identify if the source device or application is title aware (such that they understand and process titles directly), allowing the initiation of certain processing. For instance, an application that is not title aware may require assistance from proxies in handling title based transactions.","Session component  may specify a session identifier to be associated with the transaction. The session identifier can be any type of identifier used by the processing applications to uniquely identify the session. For example, in web server applications a session identifier is created when a user logs into the web server. Session component  may permit a set of transactions to be related and tracked to a particular session.","Recipients component  may identify the parties that should receive and process the transaction. It further comprises identifiers for the recipients in compliance with the network protocols that are handling the transaction. In one embodiment, the recipients are identified through domain names. In another embodiment the recipients are identified through URLs. In another embodiment, the recipients are identified by using titles. The structure of recipients component  may be such that one or many recipients can be identified. Furthermore, a group of recipients can be identified such as in broadcast or multicast situations.","Responsemethod component  may specify the technique and address of where to direct the response to this transaction. This component allows the support of asynchronous message responses such that the response to a transaction can be directed through different channels. In one embodiment, the original transaction is received through a SOAP message over HTTP. Once the transaction is completed, the initiator of the transaction may require that the response be sent through another channel such as over SMTP. In another embodiment, the initiator may also indicate that the response be sent back through the original channel (such as HTTP) as well as through another channel (such as SMTP). Multiple response methods can be indicated in the responsemethod component . In another embodiment, the responsemethod can specify that no response is required and can be used to control one-way and two-way communication. In another example, the responsemethod  can specify a timed response, such that a response will not be initiated until required by the requesting device or application. Routing component  comprises instructions on how the transaction is to be routed through intermediary or participating parties. The routing instructions should be understood, interpreted, and processed by all devices and applications that receive the transaction.","Commands component  may specify commands to the receiving application or applications of the transaction object. These commands will be formatted in a manner consistent with the command language understood by the receiving application, or applications, or devices. For example, scripts may be included such as XSLT, Javascript, or other scripts and command languages. This component allows additional instructions to accompany the transaction. In another embodiment, the commands component  can be used to implement callbacks. In one embodiment, the commands component  can be combined with the routing component  for flexible and powerful network control. Referring again to , an example can comprise routing instructions in routing component  that specifies a path through a network, and the command component  can relay commands to devices in the path. In this example, the commands can be used to apply network configuration changes in support of dynamic quality of service parameters. This embodiment can be used to effectively support a policy based network. Likewise, this embodiment can also be used to reconfigure tools in automated machinery and perform re-tooling duties on a scheduled basis.","In another embodiment, protocol  can be combined with title objects to create efficient and effective robots or remote control objects to automate tasks and implement intelligent networks. Routing and command structures along with protocol  can be combined with title object rules and redemption methods for smart network traversal, instruction relays, dynamic communications, information gathering and logic processing. For example, title objects are provided with a mechanism and language for communication and collaboration with other title objects on the network. In another embodiment, title objects and protocol  can also utilize dictionaries and dictionary components as containers and servers for logic that the title objects and protocol messages require. This permits the title object and protocol message to remain small while providing the ability for the object and\/or message to retrieve logic as required and in the format necessary for the processing environment. For example, a protocol message  contains command references to a remote dictionary component  as depicted in , as the message arrives on device c ; the dictionary is queried to obtain the command logic. The logic is then executed on device c . In another embodiment, the title object and\/or protocol message can utilize the dictionary to transform into processing instructions or code that is compatible with the current device.","Transactionintegrity component , as shown in , may provide security indicia to verify the integrity of the transaction. The security indicia can be the result of a cryptographic computation such as a SHA-1 hash result. Transactionintegrity component  may indicate the technique used to render the security indicia, and may further comprise options, or be used in conjunction with or instead of the integrity checking capabilities of the underlying protocols. For example, the SSL protocol provides integrity checking as the transaction is transported over the network. However, transactionintegrity component  may further provide end-to-end integrity checking between the communicating applications and even through intermediaries, whereas the SSL protocol cannot. In one embodiment, transactionintegrity component  would indicate the specifics of the integrity checking such as an integrity check on the entire message , or on the header , or on the body , or separately on the header  and the body .","Referring now to , the routing of protocol messages between devices is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. For example, a message originating on device A , is routed to device C  as required in the routing instructions. The protocol message is processed at device C , routed to device B , then routed to device D , subsequently routed back to device B, and then finally back to the originating device A .","At each step in the network traversal the protocol message can be processed by devices, including the title objects that may be contained in the message. In another embodiment, the processing can be intelligent in that protocol messages and title objects may execute a learning process. That is, they gather information and properties from each device in order to make smart decisions on the routing method and path. The protocol messages as they are executed on processing devices can contain routing instructions that are triggered on events. For example, as the protocol message arrived at device B , its processing can include information gathering, such as identifying additional devices in the proximity that meet the order fulfillment requirements and service level agreements. Based on the information gathered and the routing instructions, a decision can be made to route to device D .","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a body component, as shown in  is shown. Body component  is further comprised of transactiontitles component , transactionparameters component , and transactioncontents component . Transactiontitles component  may comprise titles of transaction participants. For example, it may contain the tag of a consumer who has initiated the transaction using consumer device , as shown in . Transactiontitles component  can comprise authenticating material for the title owner. For example, if a title involved in the transaction is a ticket, then the owner of the ticket may need to be authenticated. The transactiontitles component  can relay the necessary security indicium that resulted from the owner authentication process. In this example, the recipient of the protocol message can rely on the authenticating indicia based on a pre-established trust relationship thereby eliminating the need to re-authenticate the owner through a separate challenge-response process. In another embodiment, the owner of the title may need to be directly verified in order to redeem the title. For example, if a resolver component  receives a title object such as a ticket, it may be required to directly authenticate the owner. This can result in a set of protocol messages being sent in a challenge-response conversation so that the owner can properly authenticate them self. Authentication can occur within the constraints specified by the title object, such as username and password, public key cryptography, biometrics, etc.","In another embodiment, transactiontitles component  may only contain stubs that reference titles. This method is supported by the title object in that the stub can reference the title to which it is bound\/attached and that may be stored remotely on another device. This technique can be effective in reducing the size and verbosity of the protocol . As an example, an owner may have many titles that represent the same currency and denomination in their wallet. The only differentiating factor between the titles is the authenticator stub. For communication purposes it could be inefficient to transport all titles over a network such as a wireless RF network. In this instance, the stubs could be sent rather than the entire title. The stub elements reference a title using their binding components. In another instance, a single copy of the title can be sent along with all the stubs necessary for the transaction.","Transactionparameters component  may specify all the arbitrary parameters or properties associated with the transaction. For example, parameters can specify a particular transform that should be applied to the result of a query transaction to title manager , as shown in . Transactioncontent component  may contain all the content associated with the transaction that the applications need to communicate.","Communication channels and discovery are essential elements for support of the protocol . As mentioned previously, the protocol  can be implemented on top of existing protocols and existing communication channels such as TCP\/IP, RF networks, and the Internet. Discovery is the process whereby devices, applications, and title objects can find and locate each other using various identity, naming, and locator schemes. The discovery mechanism can be implemented using a variety of techniques depending on the environment where the protocol  is operating. For example, the discovery technique can differ significantly between the Internet, embedded devices, and locator systems such as GPS.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a discovery process that can be implemented on various networks is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Naming and registry host  identifies various devices by resolving names to network addresses. Title publisher  locates the address of the state server  by communicating with the naming host . Once the title publisher  has obtained the address, it can then communicate directly with state server  using the network channel supported by the computing devices on which the title publisher and state server operate. Likewise, title manager  can locate a remote lockbox  by communicating with naming host . In another embodiment, naming and registry host  can be a network of naming devices that communicate and propagate address resolution tables.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a discovery and channel technique is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, all communication takes place through a central host or central host network . Title publisher  starts the communication and originates a protocol message to state server  using the state server's name which is then sent to central host  for resolution and delivery. Central host network  would be responsible for resolving the state server's name to a network address and delivering the protocol message. In this example, the address of state server  can be static or dynamic depending on the network implementation. In this embodiment, the protocol can be implemented over networks such as instant messaging and electronic mail.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a dynamic discovery and channel technique is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. In this example, the process whereby the title publisher  discovers the state server  is accomplished dynamically through a broadcast or multicast query, initiated by the title publisher , on the network. Responses are returned, including a response from the state server . Title publisher  analyzes the responses and then initiates communication with the state server . This embodiment is representative of a peering relationship between all devices on the network such as on a peer-to-peer network. Discovery in the peering relationships is established through network queries and responses. In another embodiment of the peering relationships, discovery can be accomplished through physical proximity, such as in the case of wireless networks. In this example, discovery would occur through standard wireless protocols, transmitters, and receivers whereby devices would discover other devices within close proximity such as in IEEE 802.3b wireless local area networks, Bluetooth personal area networks, and infrared transceivers. Protocol  can take advantage of roaming capabilities within these types of networks to discover and utilize the capabilities of a distributed and diverse network. Trust can be an important element in the network and is described later in the document and also as an aspect of the authentication process.","The transaction flow and protocol may rely on authentication of titles to properly identify parties involved in a transaction, as well as evaluate the trust that should be placed on a transaction. As illustrated in , a title is redeemed and authenticated by state server . The authentication technique employed by state server  can enable transaction processing, as well as maintain the authentic, valid, and unique properties of titles. For example, state server  is substantially responsible for endorsing and authenticating titles, and can also participate in the transaction flow by preserving state between transactions, as well as implementing guarantees, or other transaction logic such as notification and callbacks. The endorsement process provides a title or set of titles to state server  for certification (i.e., proper identification and authorization for circulation). State server  may then apply an endorsement process in order to create unique security indicia that may be applied to the title being endorsed. State server  may also apply an authentication process in order to both authenticate and update the security indicia.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of an endorsement and authentication process is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. New titles generated by title publisher  are not generally certified or recognized in the title ecosystem, since they lack authenticator stubs. In general, new titles are sent to state server  for endorsement using protocol . State server  performs the endorsement process and creates the unique security indicia for all the titles being endorsed. State server  then stores the state of the current security indicia in state collection , and subsequently returns the endorsed titles to the title publisher  for further processing, such as distribution to a title manager. In one embodiment, content within the protocol message comprises a copy of the title or titles to be endorsed. In another embodiment, state collection  is a database of current security indicia for each title in circulation.","In another embodiment, when a title is used (for example, during a redeem action), the title is presented to state server  for authentication by resolver . State server  performs the authentication process and verifies the security indicia contained within the title to that of the current state maintained in the state collection . The security indicium for a title is contained in the titles authenticator stub.","State server  may also perform endorsement and authentication as supported by the title transaction ecosystem. A variety of techniques and algorithms can be supported by the title technology, and the technique and algorithm employed on a particular title can be subsequently conveyed to state server  for authentication. In one embodiment, a chained hash mechanism, similar to Pay Word, is used for title authentication. In another embodiment, the chained hash may be generated by repeatedly hashing an initial value v which may include title information combined with a random number or other appropriate data using a cryptographically strong hash function H such as MD5 or SHA-1. The first iteration of the chained hash algorithm gives h0=H(v). The second iteration gives h1=H(h0). The nth iteration gives hn=H(hn\u22121) where n represents the desired length of the hash chain. This hash chain of length n may represent any value within the system from the maximum number of redemptions allowed by a title to the maximum number of users connected to a system, or any other value required by the system. In another embodiment, v may be composed of a random value and a hash of the title to later be used for title integrity verification.","In another embodiment, the state server component may generate hn and securely store n and the value v that was used as the initial hash value for h0. The value hn may then be set in the authenticator stub for the title along with the name of the hash algorithm used to create hn. In one instance, the client may then later present the title upon redemption where the state server may extract the value hn from the authenticator stub along with the hash algorithm name specified by that stub. The state server may then look up its stored values v and n and compute hi=Hi(hi\u22121) where h0=H0(v) and i={1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. The value hn would be checked for equality with hi and if equal, the title would be authenticated. The server may then store n-1 in place of n, generate a new authenticator stub containing hn-1 and the name of the algorithm used, and return that stub back to the client where the title may be authenticated again using the above process as long as n>0.","In yet another embodiment, state server  generates the hash as defined above and set the values hn, and ve along with the name of the hash algorithm used in the authenticator stub, where ve is the encrypted value v. The state server would only need to store n in this embodiment. Upon redemption, the client would present the title with the authenticator stub containing ve, hn, and the name of the hash algorithm to use. The state server component may then decrypt ve to get vd and compute hi=Hi(hi\u22121) where h0=H0(vd) and i={1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. The state server component would then verify hi=hn and if true, the title would be authenticated. The server may then store n-1 in place of n, generate a new authenticator stub containing hn-1, ve, and the name of the hash algorithm used, and return that stub back to the client where the title may be authenticated again using the above process as long as n>0.","In yet another embodiment, the client is responsible for generating the hash chain. In one instance, the client generates the value v using the techniques described above or another appropriate method. The client then computes the hash chain hi=Hi(hi\u22121) where h0=H0(v) and i={1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. The resulting hash chain={h0, h1, h2, . . . , hn}. The client sends its credentials, h0, and the name of the hash algorithm used, to the state server component. The state server component verifies the client's credentials and stores h0 in its secure data store. Upon title redemption, the client sends the title with h1 and the name of the hash algorithm embedded in the authenticator stub to the state server component for verification. The state server component retrieves h0 from its secure data store and hashes h0 using the algorithm indicated to produce h1*. The title is authenticated if and only if h1=h1*. The state server component then replaces h0 with h1 in its secure data store. The client can no longer use h1. Note that in this embodiment the client will always supply hi and the state server component will always store hi1. The ith redemption consists of the value hi supplied by the client which the state server component can verify using hi\u22121. Each such redemption requires no calculations from the client and only a single hash operation by the state server component.","In another embodiment, when a chain of hashes expires, such as n=0, the state server  can automatically perform a re-endorsement of the title and create a new chain. The re-endorsement can occur selectively and as permitted on the particular title.","In another embodiment, a random value technique is applied to authenticate a title. A random value is generated by the state server  and placed in the authenticator stub. The state server  also maintains a record of the random value in its state collection . The random value would be changed by the state server every time the title is authenticated and only the title object with the correct random value would be valid.","Referring now to , a simplified diagram of a hash authentication scheme for divisible cash is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, a title's value is represented by a tree where each node represents a denomination of the title and the root node is the sum of all its child nodes equal to the total value of the title. For example, in , a title representing a twenty dollar bill in US currency is shown. The value of the root node is $20 as represented by , and has two immediate child nodes each valued at $10 as represented by . Each of the $10 nodes would have two $5 nodes as represented by . Each parent node is a hash of its immediate child nodes such that each $5 node is hashed with some initial random values and its parent node, the $10 node, is a hash of its two $5 child nodes. If customer A wishes to pay merchant B with part of a title, then A would present B with the hash of the nodes A wishes to spend.","Referring now to , if A wishes to spend $15 of a $20 node, then the hashes of the nodes for $10  and $5  would be given to B. When a node is spent, it and its forefathers may not be spent again. In this example, A would be left with a single valid $5 node  representing the amount remaining after payment. When B deposits the payment into the bank C, C only needs to verify that the $10 and $5 nodes can be hashed back to the root $20 node. If true, C may record the nodes as spent and issue payment to B","In another embodiment of the authentication technique and process, the authenticating security indicia can be separated across multiple title objects. In this instance, two or more title objects would need to be presented in order to authenticate any one, some or all of the title objects. For example, a split-key technique can be applied such that the security indicia is securely broken into multiple parts and correctly applied to a set of title objects in the endorsement process. The title objects can be distributed normally to various parties. In this embodiment all of the parties would need to present their title objects in order to redeem content or gain access to an asset. In one variation of this method, the security indicia can be securely split among various title objects such that only some of those title objects need to be presented and not all. For example, the security indicia can be split across three title objects, but only two title objects need to be presented for authentication. In another variation, the technique applied for authenticating a title can be dependent upon another title or set of titles. For example, the security indicium that authenticates a title can be generated based upon direct references to another title or set of titles. The state server  in this case would reference the other titles and perform a serialized authentication process. These methods can be effective for implementing secondary authentication policies such that two parties must be present before access is granted.","In another embodiment of the authentication technique and process, several layers of security indicia can be applied to a title object. In this instance, a title object can be authenticated at various levels using different security indicia, and can in turn implement different authenticating techniques for each level. For example, in a three stage authentication process, a title object can be endorsed three separate times using different techniques with each technique applying more strict guidelines and stronger security. In this example, the third stage endorsement can be utilized for insecure network traversal; the second stage for more secure network traversal and for limited redemption of the title; the first stage for confidential processing and full access to title redemption methods. This multi-stage endorsement and authentication process can be effective in mixed environments where the title object can be routed and authenticated in an insecure public environment without comprising the security indicia that is used for authentication and verification in secure environments.","In another embodiment, a title object can be endorsed by multiple and independent state servers. This permits a single title object to be endorsed (i.e. certified) by separate parties, domains, entities, etc. thereby permitting use of the title object in a particular environment. In one example, the multiple endorsements can relay a particular trust about the title object. For instance, an ecosystem of computing devices that implement title enabled applications may be configured such that they trust only state servers that are identified and reside in the ecosystem; as well as trusting only titles endorsed by these state servers. In order for these applications to trust a title that originated outside the ecosystem it can be re-endorsed by the state servers inside the ecosystem. In this example, the title object would have two endorsements and two authenticator stubs: one from the originating state server; and the other from the state server operating in the ecosystem. For authentication, applications in the current ecosystem would rely on their state server for authentication. In another variation, the state server inside the ecosystem can authenticate the title object itself, and also request authentication from the originating state server outside the ecosystem.","In yet another embodiment, state server  supports a revocation and suspension process, whereby titles in circulation can be revoked for various reasons. For example, if a title has been reported stolen it can be revoked. Or, if a consumer has not met the requirements for the continued use of a title it can be suspended until the requirements are met. In this example, a revocation or suspension protocol message is sent to state server  from a valid and trusted source. State server  will then revoke or suspend the title in question and maintain this in the state collection . In one example, revocation can be requested by the owner of the title and in this case the title can be presented for revocation. The state server  will authenticate the title before revoking.","The establishment of trust within the title transaction ecosystem can occur in several ways. In one embodiment, the participants in a title transaction establish trust implicitly by trusting the authentication of titles used in a transaction that have been endorsed and authenticated by known and configured state servers. For example, as applications and devices communicate using the title protocol, the titles conveyed within the protocol will be authenticated by known and trusted state servers. In another embodiment, trust is established by using trust titles configured on title enabled applications and devices. The trust titles provide fine-grained descriptions and instructions on what title objects are to be trusted and under what circumstances. Trust titles can be created and endorsed by administrative applications and configured on title-enabled applications. The title-enabled applications can then refer to trust titles to execute instructions and filters on transactions that they process to ensure that the titles can be trusted. Trust within a title transaction ecosystem can be established on an implicit or explicit basis, in a peer-to-peer matrix relationship, in a formal hierarchical manner, or in a hybrid fashion depending on the requirements of applications involved in title transactions. In another embodiment, trust can be established through the title object authentication process as described previously. In another embodiment, trust can be established by utilizing a public key infrastructure or similar method such as X.509 and PGP digital certificates. This can operate in conjunction with digitally signed title objects and digitally signed stubs. In another embodiment, trust can be explicitly specified by a user on a title by title basis, or by configuring a set of parameters within their profile.","H. File Sharing and Distribution","In another embodiment of the title system, titles can be used to manage the access to, sharing and distribution of digital asset. A digital asset comprises anything that may be stored in digital format (i.e., documents, pictures, audio, and web based asset). Previous approaches to file access control are normally based upon the concept of the name and password which can easily be propagated among multiple users. In this embodiment the title is used to easily refer to and control access to that digital asset.","Referring now to , an example of a system that manages the distribution and access to digital asset architecture is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Although the diagram shows separate components that maybe operated on separate computing devices, in another embodiment these components can be operated on the same device. In one embodiment, the functionality of title manager  can be operated directly on consumer device  as a complete application. Likewise the functionality of the title redemption system  may exist on the title publishing system . Also the term network refers to any mechanism that allows the transfer of data between computing devices.","Referring now to , a high level mechanism for retrieving the asset is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. The user selects the title object that represents the asset that the user wishes to access . From the user's perspective it may not be known that a title object is involved, only that an asset is being selected.","The user's title manager will then present the title to the appropriate title resolver . The title resolver will reject the title if the authentication stub is invalid . The system can have an optional rejection mechanism which can offer a range of responses and possible actions depending upon the requirements and needs of the asset owner or provider.","If the authentication stub is valid, then the authentication stub is updated  and the title object is re-issued to the user . This update and re-issue process ensures that any copies of the title that were made by the user will now be invalid. This means that it is not possible to copy and distribute a title object among a group of people as the first person to redeem the title object will make the other copies of the title object invalid and thus the other members of the group will have no access to the asset.","In another embodiment this ability of the title to manage and control access to the asset can be further enhanced through other mechanisms of the title object which for example limit the access of the title to the asset based upon number of uses, time period, time of days and other appropriate mechanisms that support the business model of the asset owner.","In yet another embodiment the mechanism within a title that supports different redeem methods enables users who use multiple devices to access asset, to have the asset presented to them in the most appropriate format for the device that the user is using at that particular point in time. For example if the user is accessing the asset from a mobile phone then the asset could be text based, while if the access device is a computer then the asset could be multimedia based.","Referring now to , a process to search for digital asset using the title system is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Because a title contains a metadata description that describes the asset it is possible to search for asset effectively across a wide domain and find valid asset. This compares to search systems today that are based upon text matching systems that do no take account of the context in which the text exists. Thus for example a search for a piece of music based upon artist name using the title system will result in titles that point to asset rather than pure text based systems which will list text whenever that artist is mentioned, resulting in a search results that is too broad for the user to utilize.","In this embodiment of the search process the user selects the title search option . The user is then prompted for the type of asset that the user wishes to search for . Based upon the asset type a dedicated search form will be displayed , which the user enters the criteria in . The title search engine will then search for titles that meet those criteria  across a single domain or multiple domains. There is an option to check the digital signature  within the titles to ensure that they have been published by a valid entity. The title search engine will then return a list of valid titles , and the user has the option of refining the search further , or selecting and previewing the titles of interest .","The multiple redemption methods that titles supports means that the preview methods used in  can be extremely flexible ranging from a simple description to the ability to access the actual asset with a set of constraints such as view once or only valid for a number of days. Once the consumer has found the asset of interest then a title transaction can occur  between the user and the owner of the title object. Once a user posses a title, which gives them a certain set of rights to the digital asset, depending upon those rights the user can carry out a number of transactions with those titles that they own. These transactions being to share the title, to give the title, or to trade the title.","Referring now to , a simplified process for sharing a title object is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Because a title cannot be copied and used by two people, the sharing mechanism allows a title object holder to share access to a version of that asset based upon the rules that the asset holder implements through the title mechanism.","The mechanism for sharing between user and user is very simple, user  has an asset that they wish to share , user  selects the title, and selects the share option . Users  title manager creates a shadow title  if the original title object allows the sharing mode, which user  sends to user  using an appropriate mechanism  such as email, instant messaging or another digital transport mechanism. The shadow title is a modified version of the original title object in that a mechanism such as removing the authentication stub is used to indicate that this shadow title has no rights. In other embodiments the user interaction could be different, and the functionality to create the shadow title may exist within other elements of the system for example the client device or the title publishing system.","Once user receives the shadow title, it is stored in title manager , and it can now be redeemed by presenting it to the title resolver system . When the title resolver detects that the title object is a shadow , then using the business rules indicated within the title itself, or through the asset system, a preview version  of the asset will be presented to user . This preview version of the asset can take many forms including a simple description, a lower quality version, an online version rather than a downloaded version, or a limited use version based upon time, number of uses or other appropriate mechanisms. It should be noted that in this embodiment it was a one to one transaction, but in fact could be a one to many transaction were multiple shadow titles are generated. In another embodiment, the shadow title can be stored in title manager  on behalf of the recipient user who may not have a title manager or title-enabled application. In this instance, the recipient would have no method or apparatus for redeeming the title. Instead, the title manager  in this example maintains the shadow copy and presents an encoded URL to user that refers to the shadow copy. User then sends the encoded URL to user using a standard communication mechanism such as electronic mail or instant messaging. Upon receiving the encoded URL, user  clicks on it thereby initiating a redemption with title manager .","This approach to sharing of asset meets the needs of asset owners and providers to have their legal rights to that asset to be fully respected, while providing an easy to use mechanism for the users of asset to make other users aware of this asset and for them to use this asset in some restricted form. If the recipients feel that the asset is of value to them then they can purchase the asset.","Referring now to , a simplified process for giving an asset to another user is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. With previous mechanisms of purchasing and giving digital asset, there was always the possible issue that the purchaser would in effect be making a copy of the asset, or the name and password to access the asset. With a title based approach it enables asset to be purchased and given with no residual copy existing for the purchaser.","In this embodiment of the gift scenario user purchases a title object to give as gift . Once user has received the title object into the title manager, user selects the title  and selects the gift option , user selects the recipient and has the option to create a gift message. User's title manager presents the title object to the resolver in gift mode . The resolver will validate that this title can be given as a gift and that optional criteria have been met . These optional criteria can include such features as the asset must have never been accessed by user. If the title object cannot be given as gift the title is rejected and an optional rejection mechanism can occur.","The title resolver will update the authentication stub to invalidate any copies of the title object that user may have , and the updated title object is sent to the user's title manger which will automatically send the title object and the associated message to user's title manger . On receipt of the title user's title manager can optionally refresh the authentication stub of the title object for added security. It should be noted that other embodiments of the gift mechanism could be implemented, for example using a lockbox for extra security, or getting the title publishing system to send the title direct to user . An enhanced version of the gift mechanism would be to allow user to build an album or collection of digital asset that could be given as a gift, in this case the systems would handle the multiple titles. A further embodiment would be the ability to give the title objects to multiple people where the payment for the multiple copies would be handled automatically as part of the gift process.","Referring now to , a simplified process for trading titles without valid copies of the title object being left on the parties' machines, according to one embodiment of the invention. In this process the two users have two titles to trade  & . User places their title on a title market place , and user finds that title is available for trade . User offers user title as a trade , and user accepts the offer . It should be noted that this is one possible embodiment of the mechanism for establishing the trade. There is a wide range of embodiments for establishing the trade including automatic trading boards, trading bots and simple communication between the parties involved in the trade.","Once a trade has been agreed upon, a mechanism must be provided for the trade to occur. In this embodiment, a digital lock box is used but there a wide range of options for providing the actual trading mechanism. User places title into the digital lockbox  and user places title into the digital lockbox . A mechanism then verifies and authenticates the titles to be traded. Examples include using digital signatures, presenting the titles to the issuing site, or giving the users the ability to view the titles.","Once the titles are verified, they are presented to their respected title resolvers for their authentication stubs to be updated at  & . This ensures that any copy of the titles kept by users is now invalid for redemption. The titles are now traded  &  and delivered to the title managers  & .","In another embodiment, the trading mechanism comprises digital trading cards. In general, the collection and trading of physical trading cards is very popular. However, implementing a corresponding digital trading card system has generally been impractical. One reason may have been concerns of piracy. That is, a complex centralized digital rights system would be required to log all ownership and securely manage trades. Through the use of the present invention, however, a secure scalable digital trading card system can be implemented.","Referring now to , a digital trading card architecture is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Title object  includes embedded content  comprising a digital trading card. Embedded content  may be displayed through a browser or a dedicated application for displaying the digital trading card. Digital trading card  may also use reference content , such that the digital trading card can present updated or fresh information. Embodiments of this information could include updated sports statistics for sports based cards, updated information for game cards or updated multimedia. For example, a digital trading card could be used in conjunction with a physical trading card. A consumer, buying a physical card , would also be given a unique ID . Upon presentation to digital trading card generator system , a digital trading card based upon the corresponding title is generated.","The mechanisms for generating titles that refer to digital assets can be divided into two classes, automated systems and user driven systems. Automated systems that interact with established web based systems such content management systems would use dedicated interfaces and such embodiments of this approach to title generation have been covered by other descriptions. There are a wide range of embodiments for user driven systems that deliver a functionality that systems deployed to day cannot deliver. In one embodiment, a file sharing system allows users to distribute content easily among their contacts.","Referring now to , a user interface is shown allowing users to share and manage digital assets sharing, according to one embodiment of the invention. My contacts  comprises a list of contacts with which the user interacts. For example, the contact list could be a simple address book application or the contact system is a title based system. Contacts may be individuals  or groups of individuals . In order to share a digital asset, a user would identify a contact, determine appropriate digital asset rights , and generate the title . A title object would subsequently be sent to the contact. A preview version of the asset can be shown in window .","Referring now to , an example of the management of titles and the associated rights is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. Digital asset sharing allows users to easily share digital assets with contacts while not have to worry about names and passwords or the underlying file structure. For example, it is possible to click on contacts , such as a friend or business associate , or groups , to discover the assets to which they have access. For each asset, a list of contacts with corresponding rights can also be displayed. In this way, it is possible to select a contact  and manage the rights and title for that contact , subsequently generating a new title if required.","Referring now to , an example of an abstraction layer allowing different groups of digital assets to be presented to different groups of people is shown, according to one embodiment of the invention. For example, if a user has to support multiple web pages for different groups such as family, friends, colleagues etc then it can be very laborious to manage those multiple pages especially if there are shared assets.  shows how this would be done at an abstract layer. There is a collection of digital assets and these assets could be managed in the title domain or they could exist in other domains such as files, web page content, emails, bloggers and other forms. Using the title manager or an assistant program the user collects the group of digital assets and can use a template  to control how they will be displayed. A digital asset group  has now been created which takes the individual digital assets and displays them in a formatted way. Titles are then created  using previously described mechanism for contacts (individuals or groups)  to access particular digital asset groups. This layer of abstraction combined with the title mechanism provides an efficient and easy way to way to mange multiple digital assets and how they are accessed by multiple contacts.","Advantages of the invention include the ability to easily and efficiently manage and share titles over a network such as the Internet.
