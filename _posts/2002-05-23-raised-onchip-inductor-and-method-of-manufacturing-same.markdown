title: Raised on-chip inductor and method of manufacturing same
abstract: A raised on-chip planar inductor. An inductor is fabricated on a substrate. The inductor, except for an anchoring extremity, is lifted from the substrate, preferably by application of a magnetic field to a magnetic layer formed on the inductor. The lifting of the inductor deforms a plastic bending region. After the magnetic field is removed, the inductor remains raised with respect to the substrate.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/292,963, filed May 23, 2001, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119.","This invention was made with government assistance from the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency (DARPA) under Grant No. F30602-97-2-2038. The government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates generally to the field of fabrication of on-chip components for integrated circuits.","High-performance on-chip inductors are increasingly needed for a wide range of environments, such as wireless communication systems and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). Planar coil inductors with moderate quality factor (Q) can be integrated with other radio frequency (RF) circuits by using standard integrated circuit (IC) fabrication processes. The effectiveness of these on-chip inductors in RF systems and other environments depends upon, among other parameters, loss, and parasitics due to the substrate on which the inductor is formed.","Typically, planar coil inductors are directly fabricated onto a dielectric layer on top of an electrically-lossy semiconductor substrate, such as silicon. This lowers the quality factor and degrades the performance of planar coil inductors by introducing extra loss, noise, and parasitic capacitance. In addition, the conventional planar coil inductor requires a significant footprint to achieve a required inductance. This reduces the overall density of integration and increases the cost of finished devices, as the semiconductor substrates are expensive.","Recently, fabrication techniques have been employed to reduce the adverse influence of the substrate, such as using a high resistivity substrate, coating organic dielectric materials such as polyimide to increase thickness of the dielectric layer underneath the inductor, and\/or partially or completely removing the substrate underneath the inductor. More recently, surface micromachining technology has been applied in the fabrication of planar coil inductors to create an air gap between the inductor and the substrate. However, all of these procedures require additional fabrication steps, and many of these steps may not be compatible with standard IC fabrication processes. In other words, the chances for such processes to be accepted by standard IC foundry are minimal. Furthermore, none of these conventional methods addresses the problem of the large footprint of typical planar coil inductors.","The present invention provides an integrated circuit having a raised on-chip inductor. In a preferred method of producing the inductor according to the invention, an inductor is fabricated on a substrate. The inductor is lifted from the substrate after the fabrication process. The inductor is rotated with respect to an anchored extremity that anchors the inductor to the substrate. The anchoring extremity also may constitute one or more electrical leads. A plastic bending region of the inductor undergoes plastic deformation as the inductor is lifted with respect to the substrate into a raised position.","Because such inductors are small (on the manner of 100-1000 \u03bcm on each side), it is preferred to raise them by using methods other than manual manipulation. The inductor, according to a preferred method of the present invention, is raised by using an externally applied magnetic field. A layer of magnetic materials (for example, electroplated nickel-iron alloy) is deposited on a surface of the inductor. By applying a magnetic field, the magnetic material on the inductor will develop internal magnetization and interact with the external magnetic field. This creates a bending torque on the magnetic layer. The magnetic field is applied to the magnetic material at sufficient strength and for at least a sufficient time to induce plastic deformation in the plastic bending region, as the inductor rotates while the anchoring extremity anchors the inductor to the substrate. This plastic deformation allows the inductor to remain at a raised rest angle after the magnetic field is removed.","The raised on-chip inductor formed by the inventive method is preferably much less susceptible to loss and parasitic effects from the substrate. In addition, the raised on-chip inductor preferably has a significantly smaller footprint than conventional inductors.","The inventive method for raising the inductor may also be used to raise other microfabricated components. By forming the components on a sacrificial layer, except for an anchoring extremity, and removing the sacrificial layer, the anchored component can be fabricated. Depositing a layer of magnetic material on the component and applying a magnetic field for the magnetic layer raises the component, except for the anchoring extremity, to a raised position with respect to a surface hosting the component.","The present invention provides a raised inductor arranged at an angle with respect to the substrate that hosts it, and methods for producing the inductor. A preferred embodiment of the inductor includes at least a first conductor. The first conductor is raised with respect to the substrate, and supported by an anchoring extremity, which is preferably disposed at a foot of the inductor. As used herein, the term \u201craised\u201d means that the inductor is anchored to the substrate, or supported, by the anchoring extremity but is otherwise lifted, standing, or angled with respect to the surface of the substrate.","According to a preferred process of fabricating the inductor, a planar inductor that is made of a ductile material is fabricated onto a substrate of a chip. Preferably, the ductile material can be, but is not limited to, gold, aluminum, or copper. The planar inductor includes at least a first conductor. As fabricated, the first conductor, except for the anchoring extremity, is fixed to the substrate by a sacrificial layer. Preferably, a second conductor is also fabricated, connecting an inner end of the first conductor to its periphery. The second conductor may also include a part of the anchoring extremity that anchors the inductor. Next, a layer of magnetic material is formed on a surface of the inductor, and the sacrificial layer is selectively removed. The first conductor and second conductor, except for the anchoring extremity, are detached from the substrate, preferably by removal of the sacrificial layer, so that the anchoring extremity anchors the conductor.","The planar inductor, anchored by the anchoring extremity, is lifted as one piece by application of a magnetic field. The magnetic field magnetizes the layer of magnetic materials overlapping with the inductor. The induced magnetic field then interacts with the external magnetic field. A mechanical bending torque is produced. The inductor then tends to bend in a direction that favors the alignment of the internal induced magnetic field to the external field. The inductor rotates from a distal, free end, with respect to an axis formed by the anchoring extremity. The magnetic field is applied for a sufficient time so that a plastic bending region near the anchoring extremity undergoes plastic deformation as the inductor lifts from the free end. The cantilevered inductor is lifted into a raised position with respect to the substrate.","The above method may also be used with other microfabricated objects. Generally, a magnetic field is used to interact with microfabricated objects that are connected to the substrate using cantilevers made of ductile materials, such as metal films made of gold, aluminum, or copper. The resultant mechanical torque is sufficient to cause permanent bending, or plastic bending, of the cantilever beam.","The raised on-chip inductor preferably has a much smaller footprint than conventional on-chip inductors. The inventive inductor preferably suffers significantly lower substrate parasitic loss effects than conventional on-chip inductors.","The invention will now be illustrated with respect to preferred embodiments of raised on-chip inductors and preferred methods for producing the inductors. Dimensions and illustrated devices may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration and understanding of the invention.","Referring now to the drawings,  shows an integrated circuit (IC)  having a raised on-chip inductor  extending from a preferably silicon planar substrate  of the IC according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. The inductor  shown in the exemplary embodiment of  is a planar inductor of a coplanar waveguide configuration. As shown in , the exemplary inductor  includes a first conductor  with a pair of grounding conductors  surrounding a center, spiral-shaped conductor . The grounding conductors  meet at an outer end  of the spiral conductor , near a distal end  of the inductor . The first conductor  is mechanically anchored to the substrate  by an anchoring extremity , which includes a pair of conductive pads  at ends (feet) of the grounding conductors . The pair of conductive pads  together forms a first terminal for the coplanar waveguide inductor. The anchoring extremity  of the first conductor  anchors the raised inductor  to the substrate , and provides electrical leads. The first conductor  is preferably fabricated from a ductile, plastically-deformable material, for example, gold, aluminum, or copper. Most preferably, the first conductor  is formed of gold, a good ductile material for plastic deformation.","A second conductor , which may be made of a conductive, ductile material, such as a suitable metal, electrically connects an inner end  of the spiral conductor  to the substrate  without electrically contacting the remainder of the first conductor . The second conductor , in the coplanar waveguide configuration shown, carries a signal from the chip . The second conductor  extends between the inner end  and a conductive pad , which forms another part of the anchoring extremity  that mechanically anchors the inductor  to the substrate . The conductive pad  also forms a second terminal for the coplanar waveguide inductor. A dielectric bridge  is disposed between the first and second conductors ,  to electrically separate the first and second conductors. The dielectric bridge  in the preferred embodiment shown is formed from CYTOP, an organic material.","As can be seen in , the inductor  is anchored by the anchoring extremity  of the inductor , but is otherwise raised with respect to the substrate . The anchoring extremity  of the exemplary inductor  shown in  includes the conductive pads  of the first conductor  (part of the grounding conductors ) and the conductive pad  of the second conductor . A plastic bending region  disposed near the anchoring extremity  cantilevers the inductor  and provides one or more (as shown in , three) conductive paths to the substrate . Again, preferably, the first conductor  and second conductor  are formed of a ductile, conductive material. However, it is also contemplated that, alternatively, only the plastic bending region  may be ductile and plastically deformable, while the remainder of the first and second conductors ,  may be formed from a different, less ductile material.","Folds  are formed within the plastic bending region  at or near points of detachment between the first and second conductors ,  and the substrate , near an edge of the anchoring extremity . The portion of the first conductor  detached from the substrate  extends from an edge of the anchoring extremity  and the plastic bending region , to the distal end  of the inductor extending across the top of the first conductor (portions of the grounding conductors ) in the configuration shown in FIG. .","Preferably, the inductor  (including the first and second conductors , ) except for the anchoring extremity  is oriented between 30 and 90 degrees, with respect to a plane formed by the substrate. It is preferred that the inductor  be oriented at least at a minimum angle \u03b8so that plastic deformation occurs in the plastic bending region  during lifting of the inductor, and so that loss from the electrically-lossy substrate  is reduced. Most preferably, the inductor  is in a standing position, at or near 80-90 degrees with respect to the substrate . When the inductor  is angled within this preferred range, both losses from the substrate  and the footprint of the inductor are substantially minimized. However, this range of orientation angles is not required. Furthermore, the inductor  may be angled greater than 90 degrees with respect to the substrate , measured from an initial (horizontal) position of the inductor. For example, the inductor  may be considered raised with respect to the substrate  when it is angled anywhere between 30 and 150 degrees, and considered vertically-oriented (standing) at between 80 and 100 degrees.","Referring now to FIGS. ()-() and ()-(), a preferred process is shown for producing the raised inductor  on the chip . As shown in FIGS. ()-(), the substrate , for example, a semiconductor such as an IC chip with or without circuit elements already present, is provided having a chip surface , preferably of silicon nitride. A sacrificial layer , preferably of silicon oxide, is formed on the chip surface . The sacrificial layer  is deposited onto the chip surface , using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for example, and is patterned. In a possible following step, a thin (200 \u212b, for example) chromium film (not shown) may be deposited using thermal evaporation to improve the adhesion of the first conductor  (especially the anchoring extremity ) on the silicon nitride chip surface , particularly if the first conductor is gold.","Next, as shown in FIG. (), the planar inductor , including (in the exemplary embodiment shown) the first conductor , the second conductor , and the dielectric bridge , is fabricated primarily on the sacrificial layer , using any suitable process. However, the area of the inductor  forming the anchoring extremity , e.g. the conductive pads , , is not formed on the sacrificial layer , but instead is formed on the chip surface , (or the chromium film) so that it anchors the inductor after the sacrificial layer is removed. In one preferred method for fabricating the inductor , a gold film is deposited on the sacrificial layer  and on the chip surface  by using thermal evaporation, and the film is patterned to form the first conductor . The dielectric bridge  and the second conductor  are formed in any suitable manner. The planar inductor  as shown in this step of the process is oriented horizontally with respect to the chip surface .","After fabrication of the inductor , and as shown in FIGS. () and (), a magnetic layer  is formed on an inductor surface . The magnetic layer  is any suitable magnetic material piece that is deposited or otherwise formed on the inductor . Preferably, the material for the magnetic layer  is Permalloy (Ni\u2014Fe), which is electroplated onto the gold first conductor . Alternatively, many other permanent magnetic materials or ferromagnetic materials can be used. The magnetic layer  preferably has a substantially greater thickness tthan the thickness tof the inductor , particularly the first conductor . For example, the first conductor  thickness tmay be 0.5 \u03bcm thick, while the thickness tof the magnetic layer  may be 4-7 \u03bcm thick. As shown in FIG. (), the magnetic layer  covers most of the exposed inductor surface  after fabrication, including most of the first conductor  (except for the portion covered by the second conductor ) and the surface of the second conductor, but the magnetic layer preferably does not cover the plastic bending region  or the anchoring extremity .","In this way, the plastic bending region  is defined by portions of the first conductor  and the second conductor  that are disposed on the sacrificial layer  and substantially uncovered by the magnetic layer . The length of the plastic bending region  is short compared to the overall length of the inductor surface  extending from the anchoring extremity  to the distal end . This substantially facilitates the plastic deformation of the plastic bending region  when the inductor  is raised. In addition, by directly attaching the magnetic layer  to the inductor , additional substrate space on the chip  is not required for a microactuator or similar device.","As shown in FIGS. () and (), the sacrificial layer  is removed to release the inductor , including the distal end  but not including the anchoring extremity , from the substrate . The inductor  is then anchored to the substrate  by the anchoring extremity . In a preferred embodiment, the sacrificial layer  is etched in a liquid solution, such as HF or water solutions, to release the inductor . The chip  and the inductor  may be dried after the sacrificial layer  is removed, using a super critical carbon dioxide dryer, for example. If the drying step is included, the inductor  is raised in air. However, the drying step is not necessary, or preferred. Instead, it is preferred that the inductor  is raised while the chip  is in liquid.","After the sacrificial layer  is removed, and as shown in FIG. (), a magnetic field His applied to the magnetic layer  on the inductor surface  to lift the cantilevered inductor  from the substrate , producing the raised inductor. The inductor  lifts from the distal end  as the anchoring extremity  anchors the inductor  to the substrate . The plastic bending region  disposed near the point of detachment from the substrate  (near the anchoring extremity ) initially undergoes elastic deformation, and then plastic deformation. The magnetic field Hmay be applied immediately after the sacrificial layer  is etched and rinsed, which allows the anchored inductor  to stay out of the substrate surface  thereafter. This prevents stiction between the inductor  and the substrate surface , which otherwise may interfere with the lifting of the inductor .","In a preferred embodiment, an electromagnet, such as an industrial strength electromagnet powered by a suitable power supply, generates the magnetic field H. In a process performed by the present inventors, the electromagnet was powered by an HP\u00ae 6200B DC (direct current) power supply. Preferably, the electromagnet is configured and disposed with respect to the chip  to generate a magnetic field Hthat is substantially uniform and perpendicular to the upper surface of the substrate, as shown in FIG. (). The electromagnet is preferably disposed underneath the chip  so that the magnetic field Hcontains a vector component that lies in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate , though the direction of the Hmay be changed to, for example, further alter a bending angle of the inductor .","The magnetic layer  on the inductor surface  is internally magnetized in the external magnetic field Hand interacts with the magnetic field, as the magnetic force tries to align the cantilevered inductor  to the magnetic field. As a result, a torque Tis generated in the magnetic layer  to bend the inductor , particularly the plastic bending region , and lift the inductor off the substrate . The inductor , from the distal end , rotates with respect to an axis formed by the anchoring extremity , bending at the plastic bending region , and creating a bending angle \u03b8, as shown by example in FIG. (). The bending angle \u03b8 of the inductor  increases with H. The magnetic field His applied at least a sufficient time so that the plastic bending region  is bent into the plastic deformation regime. This allows the inductor  to remain at a particular rest angle \u03c6 (shown in FIG. ()) after the magnetic field His removed. The final rest angle \u03c6 is typically smaller than the maximum value of the bending angle \u03b8 due to bending relaxation caused by the release of the elastic energy stored during the application of the magnetic field H.","Both the bending angle \u03b8 and the rest angle \u03c6 are related to the geometry and properties of the plastic bending region  and the magnetic layer , as well as the applied magnetic field H. Thus, a ductile material such as gold, aluminum, or copper having a short relative length, is preferred for facilitating plastic deformation. In addition, the magnetic field Hshould be applied globally so that, if more than one structure is being assembled, they can be assembled in parallel.","As shown in FIG. (), the length of the raised inductor surface  extending from the point of detachment to the substrate  to the distal end  includes the length lof the gold (for example) plastic bending region  and the length lof the Permalloy-covered inductor surface . The height h of the raised inductor  is measured from the chip surface  to the distal end . Thus, the bending angle \u03b8 of the raised inductor  can be obtained by \n\n","Because the thickness of the magnetic layer  is preferably significantly greater than the thickness of the inductor , nearly all of the bending of the inductor caused by the torque Tgenerated in the magnetic layer  occurs within the uncovered plastic bending region , and the bending behavior of the inductor is mainly determined by the plastic bending region. More particularly, the length lof the gold plastic bending region  is a determinative factor of \u03c6. Inductors  with smaller lexhibit larger \u03c6.","The torque Tcan be estimated by\n\nT=MVHcos \u03b8,\n","where M is the magnetization of the magnetic layer , and Vis the volume of the magnetic layer. M increases with \u03b8 until it reaches a saturation value M. The Mfor Permalloy Ni\u2014Feis about 1 Tesla. Assuming the inductor  (particularly the first conductor  and second conductor ) has ideal plastic and elastic behaviors, as Tincreases, the bending of the plastic bending region  is first in the elastic regime and then changes into the plastic regime. This transition occurs when the maximum stress of the plastic bending region  exceeds the yield stress of the plastic bending region.","In the elastic bending regime, the relationship between the bending angle \u03b8 and the torque Tdepends upon the Young's modulus and the moment of inertia of the inductor , as well as the geometry of the magnetic layer . An equation can thus be derived for estimating the magnetic field Hfor a particular bending angle \u03b8 for a certain inductor or other component. Furthermore, the bending angle \u03b8 as a function of the magnetic field Hcan be estimated. By determining a relationship between the amount of plastic deformation and a particular magnetic field H, a plastic deformation process can be designed and implemented for a particular microstructure to achieve a desired rest angle \u03c6.","The bending process of the inductor  can be divided into three general phases. In Phase I (for example, \u03b8<30\u00b0), the bending angle \u03b8 increases slowly with Hbecause the magnetic layer  is not fully magnetized (M<M) when \u03b8 is small. In Phase II (such as 30\u00b0<\u03b8<60\u00b0), \u03b8 increases faster with Hthan in Phase I because the magnetic layer  has been fully magnetized (M=M). In Phase III (for example, \u03b8>60\u00b0), the \u201c cos \u03b8\u201d term in the Tequation begins to dominate and \u03b8 starts to saturate. The bending angle \u03b8 eventually reaches its maximum value. In the same magnetic field H, a larger magnetic layer  can generate a larger torque, resulting in a larger saturation value of \u03b8.","After His removed, the raised inductor  will relax to the rest angle \u03c6, as shown in FIG. (), since the elastic energy stored during the bending will be released. The rest angle \u03c6 is related to bending occurring in the plastic regime. Thus, \u03b8 can be determined by the difference between the maximum bending angle and the bending angle occurring at the yielding point.","Preferably, the current supplied to the electromagnet is increased slowly so that the loading can be considered being increased in a quasi-static state. If so, the maximum bending angle \u03b8 and the maximum rest angle \u03c6 are smaller than the angle of the magnetic field H(preferably 90 degrees). However, the rest angle \u03c6 can be increased, and approach 90 degrees (a completely vertical inductor ), by using a very short plastic bending region  (for example, l=10 \u03bcm), and\/or by changing the direction of the magnetic field H, as shown in FIGS. () and (). In FIG. (), the magnetic field His moved to a second angle greater than 90 degrees so that the bending angle \u03b8 of the raised inductor  increases to an angle greater than 90 degrees. Preferably, a portion of the bending angle \u03b8 greater than 90 degrees is due to the elastic deformation of the bending inductor . When the magnetic field His removed, the stored elastic energy causes the raised inductor  to return to a resting angle \u03c6 of about 90 degrees, as shown in FIG. () as well as FIG. ().","Once the inductor  is raised to a raised position, the magnetic layer  may be removed, if desired. The assembled inductor  may also be coated with a Parylene gas-phase coating, for example, to strengthen the assembled structure. However, this step is not required.","Instead of, or in addition to, bending deformation, other types of deformation, such as torsion, may be used to lift the inductor  to a raised position. In addition, the process described above may be modified to produce other types of raised and\/or three-dimensional components. Also, though the description herein primarily describes production of the raised inductor , the present invention contemplate raising a variety of microfabricated components by fabricating the components on a sacrificial layer except for an anchoring extremity, forming a layer of magnetic material on the component, removing the sacrificial layer to release the (anchored) component, and lifting the component by application of a magnetic field to induce plastic deformation in a plastic bending region of the component. The process can be tailored to meet the requirements of a specific fabrication process.","Because the raised on-chip inductor  preferably has a footprint only in the area of the anchoring extremity  of the inductor, additional room is created for additional components on the integrated circuit . A resting angle \u03c6 at or near 90 degrees maximizes a number of additional components that can be formed on a particular substrate.","In addition, because the inductor surface  preferably does not face the substrate , but instead is raised with respect to the substrate, the inductor is much less vulnerable to substrate loss effects. This increases the quality factor (Q) of the inductor , among other benefits, making the raised inductor well-suited for wireless communication, MEMS, and other uses. If the inductor  is oriented at or near 90 degrees, which is preferred, the loss effects from the substrate  are minimized.","The preferred plastic deformation process used to lift the inductor  to a raised, and preferably, vertical position uses one structural layer and one sacrificial layer , as opposed to some prior art microassembly processes that require multiple structural and sacrificial layers. In addition, if a conductive metal is used for the plastic bending region , good electrical connection results between the cantilevered, raised inductor  and the substrate . Furthermore, the preferred plastic deformation process can be performed at room temperature, and without mechanical slacks. The preferred process is compatible with IC fabrication processes, and can be used for batch-scale assembly to produce novel micro-devices and micro-components with high yield, good controllability, and good repeatability.","While specific embodiments of the present invention has been shown and described, it should be understood that other modifications, substitutions, and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications, substitutions, and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, which should be determined from the appended claims.","Various features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"FIGS.
