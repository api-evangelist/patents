{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT\/JP2013\/082889 filed 6 Dec. 2013 which designated the U.S. and claims priority to JP Patent Application No. 2012-268396 filed 7 Dec. 2012, JP Patent Application No. 2013-133480 filed 26 Jun. 2013 and JP Patent Application No. 2013-156294 filed 29 Jul. 2013, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to a ruthenium complex useful as a raw material for the production of a semiconductor element, a production method thereof, and a method for producing a ruthenium-containing thin film using the ruthenium complex.","Ruthenium has features, e.g., exhibiting high electrical conductivity, permitting the formation of an electrically conductive oxide, having a high work function, and ensuring excellent etching characteristics and excellent lattice matching with copper and therefore, is attracting attention as a material for a memory electrode such as DRAM, a gate electrode, a copper-wiring seed layer\/adhesion layer, etc. In the next-generation semiconductor device, a highly miniaturized and highly three-dimensional design is employed for the purpose of more enhancing the memory capacity or responsiveness. Accordingly, in order to use ruthenium as a material constituting the next-generation semiconductor device, it is required to establish a technique of uniformly forming a ruthenium-containing thin film with a thickness of approximately from a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers on a three-dimensioned substrate. As the technique for producing a metal thin film on a three-dimensioned substrate, use of a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction, such as atomic layer deposition method (ALD method) and chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method), is believed promising. For example, in the case of depositing metallic ruthenium as a next-generation DRAM upper electrode by using this vapor deposition method, a metal oxide such as ZrOis used as a capacitor insulating film for the underlying base and therefore, the deposition may be performed under the conditions using an oxidizing gas. In the case of using ruthenium as a next-generation DRAM lower electrode or a copper-wiring seed layer\/adhesion layer, titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, etc. is expected to be employed as a barrier metal for the underlying base. When a barrier metal is oxidized at the time of production of a ruthenium-containing thin film, there arises a problem such as deterioration of the barrier performance, defective conduction to a transistor due to rise in the resistance value, and reduction in the responsiveness resulting from an increased interconnection capacity. For the purpose of avoiding such a problem, a material enabling the production of a ruthenium-containing thin film even under the conditions without using an oxidizing gas such as oxygen and ozone is demanded.","In Non-Patent Document 1 and Non-Patent Document 2, (\u03b7-2,4-dimethyl-1-oxa-2,4-pentadienyl)(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium and (\u03b7-2,4-di-tert-butyl-1-oxa-2,4-pentadienyl)(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium are described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex (1a) of the present invention. However, the compounds described in those documents are limited to a complex having an \u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. In addition, the synthesis methods described in those documents are based on a reaction of chloro(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium with lithium enolate or a reaction of chloro(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium with an enone derivative and potassium carbonate and are different from the production method of the present invention. Furthermore, those documents are absolutely silent as to using such a complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium-containing thin film.","A cationic ruthenium complex [(\u03b7-cyclopentadienyl)tris(nitrile)ruthenium] is useful as a raw material for synthesis of various ruthenium complexes including the ruthenium complex of the present invention. Non-Patent Document 3 describes a method for producing [Ru(\u03b7-CH)(MeCN)][PF] by irradiating [Ru(\u03b7-CH)(\u03b7-CH)][PF] with light in acetonitrile. In addition, Non-Patent Document 4 describes a method for producing [Ru(\u03b7-CH)(MeCN)][PF] by reacting ruthenocene with aluminum chloride, aluminum, titanium chloride, naphthalene and potassium borofluoride to prepare an \u03b7-naphthalene complex and further reacting acetonitrile therewith.","However, the synthesis methods of a cationic tris(nitrile) complex described in Non-Patent Document 3 and Non-Patent Document 4 have a problem, for example, that equipment for intense ultraviolet irradiation is necessary or an expensive raw material or a large amount of a reactive agent is used, and these methods can hardly be a practical production method excellent in the cost benefit.","As a cationic tris(nitrile)ruthenium complex having a monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, [(\u03b7-methylcyclopentadienyl)tris(acetonitrile)ruthenium] is described in Non-Patent Document 5. In addition, as a cationic ruthenium complex having a pentasubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand, [(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)tris(acetonitrile)ruthenium] is described in Non-Patent Document 6. However, there is no report on a cationic tris(nitrile)ruthenium complex having a monosubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligand containing an alkyl group having a carbon number of 2 to 6.","In Non-Patent Document 7, tricarbonyl(\u03b7-1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene)ruthenium (Ru(\u03b7-CH)(CO)), tricarbonyl(\u03b7-methyl-1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene)ruthenium (Ru(\u03b7-CHMe)(CO)), and tricarbonyl(\u03b7-ethyl-1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene)ruthenium (Ru(\u03b7-CHEt)(CO)) are described as a compound capable of producing a metallic ruthenium thin film under the conditions using a reducing gas as the reaction gas. However, the metallic ruthenium thin films produced using these compounds have a high resistivity of 93, 152 and 125 \u03bc\u03a9\u00b7cm, respectively, and can be hardly a practical material.","In Non-Patent Document 8, (1-3:5-6-\u03b7-cyclooctadienyl)(\u03b7-2,3,4,5-tetramethylpyrrolyl)ruthenium (Ru(1-3:5-6-\u03b7-CH)(\u03b7-NCMe)) is described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex (2) of the present invention. However, the compound described in this document is limited to a complex having a 1-3:5-6-\u03b7-cyclooctadienyl ligand. In addition, the synthesis method described in the document is based on a reaction of di-\u03bc-chloro-(\u03b7-1,5-cyclooctadiene)ruthenium ([Ru(\u03b7-CH)Cl]) with 2,3,4,5-tetramethylpyrrolyl-lithium and is different from the production method of the present invention. Furthermore, the document is absolutely silent as to using this complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium-containing thin film.","In Non-Patent Document 9, (\u03b7-6-exo-methylcyclohexadienyl)(\u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium is described as a compound having a structure similar to that of the ruthenium complex (3) of the present invention, but the compound described in this document is limited to a complex having an \u03b7-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligand. Furthermore, the document is absolutely silent as to using this complex as a material for the production of a ruthenium-containing thin film.","Non-Patent Document 1: Organometallics, Vol. 11, page 1686 (1992)","Non-Patent Document 2: Organometallics, Vol. 21, page 592 (2002)","Non-Patent Document 3: Organometallics, Vol. 21, page 2544 (2002)","Non-Patent Document 4: Advanced Synthesis & Catalysis, Vol. 346, page 901 (2004)","Non-Patent Document 5: Dalton Transactions, page 449 (2003)","Non-Patent Document 6: Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 25, page 3501 (1986)","Non-Patent Document 7: Dalton Transactions, Vol. 41, page 1678 (2012)","Non-Patent Document 8: Organometallics, Vol. 19, page 2853 (2000)","Non-Patent Document 9: Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 122, page 2784 (2000)","An object of the present invention is to provide a production method capable of producing a ruthenium-containing thin film both under the conditions using an oxidizing gas as the reaction gas and under the conditions using a reducing gas as the reaction gas, a ruthenium complex useful as a material for the production method, and a method for producing the ruthenium complex.","As a result of intensive studies to attain the above-described object, the present inventors have found that a specific ruthenium complex is useful as a material for producing a ruthenium-containing thin film both under the conditions using an oxidizing gas as the reaction gas and under the conditions using a reducing gas as the reaction gas.

In view of a high cost benefit and a high yield, any one of ammonium tetrafluoroborate, sodium tetrafluoroborate and ammonium hexafluorophosphate is preferably mixed with sulfuric acid and used.","Furthermore, as the protonic acid for use in production method 4, a fluoro complex acid produced in a reaction system by reacting boron trifluoride with a strong acid may also be used. In this case, examples of the strong acid that can be used include sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen bromide.","The molar ratio between the (cyclooctadiene)(cyclooctatriene) complex (15) and the protonic acid used in production method 4 is described below. The preferable amount of the protonic acid used varies depending on the kind of the protonic acid. For example, in the case where the protonic acid is a monobasic acid, in view of a high yield, 1 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the (cyclooctadiene)(cyclooctatriene) complex (15), and in the case of a dibasic acid, 0.5 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the (cyclooctadiene)(cyclooctatriene) complex (15). In the case where a mixture of a fluoro complex anion-containing salt and a strong acid is used as the protonic acid, 1 mol or more of the fluoro complex anion-containing salt and from 0.5 to 2.0 mol of the strong acid are appropriately used per mol of the (cyclooctadiene)(cyclooctatriene) complex (15), whereby the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) can be efficiently obtained.","For the reason that the yield of the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) is high, production method 4 is preferably performed in an inert gas. Specific examples of the inert gas include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and nitrogen gas, with argon or nitrogen gas being preferred.","For the reason that the yield of the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) is high, production method 4 is preferably performed in an organic solvent. In the case of performing production method 4 in an organic solvent, specific examples of the organic solvent include an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane and petroleum ether, a halogen-based aliphatic hydrocarbon such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dibromomethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, an ether such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, cyclopentyl ethyl ether, methyl-tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, 3-pentanone, cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, and an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol and ethylene glycol. Of these organic solvents, one kind may be used alone, or a plurality of kinds may be mixed in an arbitrary ratio and used. In view of a high yield of the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8), chloroform, dichloromethane, cyclopentyl methyl ether, methyl-tert-butyl ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, etc. are preferred. In production method 4, the reaction temperature and the reaction time are not particularly limited, and general conditions employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal complex may be used. As a specific example, a reaction temperature appropriately selected from a temperature range of \u221280\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. and a reaction time appropriately selected from the range of 10 minutes to 120 hours are employed, whereby the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) can be efficiently produced.","The cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) produced by production method 4 may be purified by appropriately selecting and using a general purification method employed by one skilled in the art when purifying a metal complex. The purification method specifically includes filtration, extraction, centrifugation, decantation, distillation, crystallization, etc.","The ruthenium complex (2) can also be produced by production method 5 of continuously performing production method 4 and production method 3. In this case, the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) produced by production method 4 may be used as a raw material for production in production method 3 without purifying it, or the cationic bis(cyclooctadienyl) complex (8) that is purified by appropriately selecting and using a general purification method employed by one skilled in the art when purifying a metal complex may be used as a raw material for production in production method 3. Examples of the purification method include filtration, extraction, centrifugation, decantation, and crystallization.","Definitions of R, R, R, R, R, R, R, Rand Rin formula (3) are described below.","The alkyl group having a carbon number of 1 to 6 represented by R, R, R, Rand Rmay be any of a linear alkyl group, a branched alkyl group and a cyclic alkyl group, and specific examples thereof include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, an isopropyl group, a cyclopropyl group, a butyl group, an isobutyl group, a sec-butyl group, a tert-butyl group, a cyclobutyl group, a pentyl group, a 1-methylbutyl group, a 2-methylbutyl group, an isopentyl group, a neopentyl group, a tert-pentyl group, a cyclopentyl group, a cyclobutylmethyl group, a hexyl group, a 1-methylpentyl group, a 2-methylpentyl group, a 3-methylpentyl group, a 4-methylpentyl group, a 1,1-dimethylbutyl group, a 1,2-dimethylbutyl group, a 1,3-dimethylbutyl group, a 2,2-dimethylbutyl group, a 2,3-dimethylbutyl group, a 3,3-dimethylbutyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a cyclopentylmethyl group, a 1-cyclobutylethyl group, and a 2-cyclobutylethyl group.

The method for obtaining the ruthenocene derivative (12) includes the methods described, for example, in Organic Syntheses, Vol. 41, page 96 (1961), Organometallics, Vol. 8, page 298 (1989), and JP-A-2003-342286, other than the purchase of a commercial product. The method for obtaining the benzene derivative (14) includes the methods described, for example, in Tetrahedron, Vol. 68, page 6535 (2012), other than the purchase of a commercial product.","The molar ratio among the ruthenocene derivative (12), the benzene derivative (14) and the protonic acid used in production method 7 is described below. In view of a high yield of the cationic arene complex (10), 1 mol or more of the benzene derivative is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative. The preferable amount of the protonic acid used varies depending on the kind of the protonic acid. For example, in the case where the protonic acid is a monobasic acid, in view of a high yield, 1 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative, and in the case of a dibasic acid, 0.5 mol or more of the protonic acid is preferably used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative. In the case where a mixture of a fluoro complex anion-containing salt and a strong acid is used as the protonic acid, 1 mol or more of the fluoro complex anion-containing salt and from 0.5 to 2.0 mol of the strong acid are appropriately used per mol of the ruthenocene derivative, whereby the cationic arene complex (10) can be efficiently obtained.","For the reason that the yield of the cationic arene complex (10) is high, production method 7 is preferably performed in an inert gas. Specific examples of the inert gas include helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and nitrogen gas, with argon or nitrogen gas being preferred.","For the reason that the yield of the cationic arene complex (10) is high, production method 7 is preferably performed in an organic solvent. In the case of performing production method 7 in an organic solvent, specific examples of the organic solvent include an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane and petroleum ether, an ether such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, cyclopentyl ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a ketone such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, 3-pentanone, cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone, an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol and ethylene glycol, and a nitrile such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, cyclopropanecarbonitrile, pentylonitrile isopentylonitrile, 3-methylbutanenitrile, 2-methylbutanenitrile, pivalonitrile and cyclobutanecarbonitrile.

In view of a high yield of the cationic arene complex (10), as the organic solvent, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, methanol and acetonitrile are preferred.","In production method 7, the reaction temperature and the reaction time are not particularly limited, and general conditions employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal complex may be used. As a specific example, a reaction temperature appropriately selected from a temperature range of \u221280\u00b0 C. to 150\u00b0 C. and a reaction time appropriately selected from the range of 10 minutes to 120 hours are employed, whereby the cationic arene complex (10) can be efficiently produced.","The cationic arene complex (10) produced by production method 7 may be purified by appropriately selecting and using a general purification method employed by one skilled in the art when purifying a metal complex. The purification method specifically includes filtration, extraction, centrifugation, decantation, crystallization, etc.","The ruthenium complex (3) can also be produced by production method 8 of continuously performing production method 7 and production method 6. In this case, the cationic arene complex (10) produced by production method 7 may be used as a raw material for production in production method 6 without purifying it, or the cationic arene complex (10) that is purified by appropriately selecting and using a general purification method employed by one skilled in the art when purifying a metal complex may be used as a raw material for production in production method 6. Examples of the purification method include filtration, extraction, centrifugation, decantation, and crystallization.","The production method of a ruthenium-containing thin film characterized by using a ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) is described in detail below.","The method for producing a ruthenium-containing thin film of the present invention is a method of vaporizing a ruthenium complex represented by formula (1), (2) or (3a) and decomposing the ruthenium complex on a substrate and includes normal technical means employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal-containing thin film. Specific examples thereof include a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction, such as CVD method and ALD method, and a solution method such as dip coating method, spin coating method and inkjet method. In the description of the present invention, the vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction encompasses technical means usually employed by one skilled in the art, for example, a CVD method such as thermal CVD method, plasma CVD method and optical CVD method, and an ALD method. In the case of producing a ruthenium-containing thin film by a vapor deposition method based on a chemical reaction, for the reason that a thin film is likely to be uniformly formed even on a substrate surface having a three-dimensioned structure, a chemical vapor deposition method is preferred, and a CVD method or an ALD method is more preferred. The CVD method is more preferred in that the deposition rate is high, and the ALD method is more preferred in that the step coverage is good. For example, in the case of producing a ruthenium-containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method, the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) is vaporized and supplied to a reaction chamber, and the ruthenium complex (1) is decomposed on a substrate provided in the reaction chamber, whereby a ruthenium-containing thin film can be produced on the substrate. The method for decomposing the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) include normal technical means employed by one skilled in the art when producing a metal-containing thin film. Specifically, examples thereof include a method of reacting the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) with a reaction gas, and a method of causing heat, plasma, light, etc. to act on the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a). By appropriately selecting and using such a decomposition method, a ruthenium-containing thin film can be produced. It is also possible to use a plurality of decomposition methods in combination. The method for supplying the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) to a reaction chamber includes, for example, bubbling and a liquid vaporization supply system but is not particularly limited.","The carrier gas and diluent gas when producing a ruthenium-containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method are preferably a rare gas such as helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon, or a nitrogen gas, and among others, a nitrogen gas, helium, neon or argon is preferred for the economical reason. The flow rate of the carrier gas and diluent gas is appropriately adjusted according to the capacity of the reaction chamber, and the like. For example, in the case where the capacity of the reaction chamber is from 1 to 10 L, the flow rate of the carrier gas is not particularly limited and is preferably from 1 to 10,000 sccm for the economical reason. Here, sccm is a unit representing the flow rate of a gas, and in terms of an ideal gas, 1 sccm indicates that the gas is moving at a speed of 2.68 mmol\/h.","The reaction gas when producing a ruthenium-containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method includes, for example, a reducing gas such as ammonia, hydrogen, monosilane and hydrazine, and an oxidizing gas such as oxygen, ozone, water vapor, hydrogen peroxide, laughter gas, hydrogen chloride, nitric acid gas, formic acid and acetic acid. From the standpoint that the restriction on the specification of a deposition apparatus is little and handling is easy, ammonia, hydrogen, oxygen, ozone and water vapor are preferred. In the case of producing a ruthenium-containing thin film under the conditions using, as the reaction gas, a reducing gas but not an oxidizing gas, ammonia is preferred in that the deposition rate of the ruthenium-containing thin film is high. The flow rate of the reaction gas is appropriately adjusted according to the reactivity of the material and the volume of the reaction chamber. For example, when the volume of the reaction chamber is from 1 to 10 L, the flow rate of the reaction gas is not particularly limited and is preferably from 1 to 10,000 sccm for the economical reason.","The substrate temperature when producing a ruthenium-containing thin film by a CVD method or an ALD method is appropriately selected according to use or non-use of heat, plasma, light, etc., the kind of the reaction gas, or the like. For example, in the case of using ammonia as the reaction gas without using light or plasma in combination, the substrate temperature is not particularly limited and is preferably from 200 to 1,000\u00b0 C. for the economical reason. In view of a high deposition rate, the substrate temperature is preferably from 300 to 750\u00b0 C., more preferably from 350 to 700\u00b0 C. In addition, by appropriately using light, plasma, ozone, hydrogen peroxide, etc., the ruthenium-containing thin film can be produced in a temperature region of 200\u00b0 C. or less.","As the ruthenium-containing thin film obtained by the production method of the present invention, for example, in the case of the ruthenium complex alone, a metallic ruthenium thin film, a ruthenium oxide thin film, a ruthenium nitride thin film, a ruthenium oxynitride thin film, etc. are obtained, and in the case of using the ruthenium complex in combination with other metallic materials, a ruthenium-containing composite thin film is obtained. For example, when the ruthenium complex is used in combination with a strontium material, an SrRuOthin film is obtained. The strontium material includes, for example, strontium bis(dipivaloylmethanate), diethoxystrontium, strontium bis(1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionate). In addition, when producing a ruthenium-containing composite thin oxide by a CVD method or an ALD method, the ruthenium complex (1), (2) or (3a) and other metallic materials may be supplied separately to the reaction chamber or may be mixed and then supplied.","The ruthenium complex (1a) may be formed into a ruthenium-containing thin film, similarly to the ruthenium complex (1).","By using the ruthenium-containing thin film of the present invention as a constituent member, a high-performance semiconductor device enhanced in the memory capacity or responsiveness can be produced. Examples of the semiconductor device includes a semiconductor memory device such as DRAM, FeRAM and ReRAM, and a field-effect transistor. Examples of the constituent member thereof include a capacitor electrode, a gate electrode, and copper wiring liner.","The present invention is described in greater detail below by referring to Examples, but the present invention is not limited thereto.
