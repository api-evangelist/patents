title: Method and system for processing a transaction
abstract: A method of, and system for, processing payment for a transaction is provided. The method includes providing a user with an option to select payment for the transaction from an account associated with a communication line via which an electronic terminal is connected to a communication network. The communication line is typically a subscriber line and, accordingly, the account is a telephone account associated with the subscriber line. When a user transacts with a vendor for goods and/or services, the user may request to process payment using the telephone account instead of using a credit or debit card. The method includes investigating data using the telephone number associated with the subscriber line and, selectively approving the transaction dependent upon an outcome of the investigation. The invention extends to a transaction processor interface and to and a transaction validation module. The invention also extends to computer program products including the invention.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Validation Table Maintenance"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to transaction processing and, more specifically, to processing a transaction between a vendor and a user via an electronic terminal connected by a communication line to a communication network.","An increasing number of vendors are offering goods and\/or services which may be purchased via a communication network such as a telecommunication network. For example, a purchaser may conduct a transaction via a subscriber line using a landline telephone or a personal computer via the Internet. Conventionally, credit or debit card details are furnished by the purchaser to the vendor to effect payment for the goods and\/or services. As many purchasers are hesitant to supply credit or debit card details over a communication network, an alternate method of payment would be advantageous. However, if an alternate method is used, verification of the payment method should preferably take place prior to concluding the transaction.","In accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of processing payment for a transaction, the method including:","providing a user with an option, via an electronic terminal, to select payment for the transaction from an account associated with a communication line to which the electronic terminal is connected;","receiving a user request entered into the terminal to process payment from the account;","investigating data associated with the communication line; and selectively approving the transaction dependent upon an outcome of the investigation.","Further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of modifying a financial instrument record, the method including:","receiving transaction data entered into an electronic terminal connected via a communication line to a communication network;","obtaining a unique identifier associated with the communication line; and","combining the unique identifier and the transaction data to form a financial instrument record.","Still further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of validating a transaction conducted using an electronic terminal connected via a subscriber line to an electronic network, the method including:","receiving a financial instrument record associated with the transaction;","extracting a unique identifier from the financial instrument record, the unique identifier being associated with the communication line; and","interrogating at least one database based on the unique identifier to obtain data associated with the subscriber line and selectively generating a validation status.","The invention extends to a transaction processing system for processing a transaction between a vendor and an electronic terminal connected via a communication line to a communication network, the system including:","an application interface for providing a user, via the electronic terminal, with an option to select payment for the transaction from an account associated with the communication line, and receiving a user request entered into the terminal to process payment from the account; and","a modification module connected to the application interface, the modification module generating a record which includes a unique identifier associated with the communication line and communicating the record to a validation module which validates the transaction based on data associated with the unique identifier.","The invention also extends to a transaction processor interface for processing payment of a transaction, the interface including:","an application interface for providing a user with an option, via an electronic terminal, to select payment for the transaction from an account associated with a communication line to which the electronic terminal is connected, and for receiving a user request entered into the electronic terminal to process payment from the account; and","a modification module for creating a financial instrument record which includes a unique identifier associated with the communication line.","The invention extends further to a transaction validation module for validating a transaction conducted using an electronic terminal connected via a communication line to an electronic network, the module including:","an extraction module for extracting a unique identifier from a financial instrument record associated with a transaction, the unique identifier being associated with the communication line; and","a processor module for interrogating at least one database based on the unique identifier to obtain data associated with the communication line and selectively generating a validation status.","Further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a computer program product including a medium readable by a processor, the medium carrying instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:","provide a user with an option, via an electronic terminal, to select payment for a transaction from an account associated with a communication line to which the electronic terminal is connected;","receive a user request entered into the terminal to process payment from the account;","investigate data associated with the communication line; and","selectively approve the transaction dependent upon an outcome of the investigation.","Still further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a computer program product including a medium readable by a processor, the medium carrying instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:","receive transaction data entered into an electronic terminal connected via a communication line to a communication network;","obtain a unique identifier associated with the communication line; and","combine the unique identifier and the transaction data to form a financial instrument record.","Still further in accordance with the invention, there is provided a computer program product including a medium readable by a processor, the medium carrying instructions which, when executed by the processor, cause the processor to:","receive a financial instrument record associated with a transaction conducted using an electronic terminal connected via a subscriber line connected to a communication network;","extract a unique identifier from the financial instrument record, the unique identifier being associated with the communication line; and","interrogate at least one database based on the unique identifier to obtain data associated with the unique identifier and selectively generate a validation status.","Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description which follows.","Referring to the drawings, reference numeral  general indicates a system for processing payment of a transaction. The system  includes a merchant or vendor , a plurality of client interfaces in the form of electronic terminals  (only 1 of which is shown in the drawings), a plurality of telephone companies (Telcos)  (only 1 of which is shown in the drawings), and a transaction validation and processing facility  including a transaction validation and processing module  (see FIG. ), also in accordance to the invention. The vendor  includes a transaction processor interface defined by an application interface and modification module  (see ) and, as will be described in more detail below, the system  with its transaction validation and processing module  allows a user to purchase goods and\/or services from the vendor  via the electronic terminal  in such a fashion so that charges for the transaction are included in a telephone account  (see ) of the user.","The system  is typically configured for use in an Internet environment in which a plurality of vendors  offer goods and\/or services for sale on the Internet via the electronic terminals  which are typically personal computers (PCs). It is important to appreciate that the modules ,  describe functional modules or capabilities which may be implemented by a variety of different hardware and software combinations.","Conventionally, and as shown in , in order to procure payment for goods and\/or services, a user or purchaser using the electronic terminal  enters financial card details, e.g., credit card, debit card, or any other financial instrument details, which are then communicated (see line  in ) to a vendor, as shown at , which then communicates with a credit card gateway . The credit card gateway  may then either accept or reject the transaction. However, many users are unwilling to submit financial card information to vendors, inter alia, for security reasons. Further, many users who have access to the Internet do not in fact possess financial cards (hereinafter referred to as credit cards) and are thus unable to transact via the Internet.","Referring in particular to  of the drawings, in one embodiment of the invention the system  receives transaction data  which is then formatted substantially to resemble a conventional credit card transaction  which is then converted or modified and payment for the transaction is included in a telephone bill or account as shown at block . As will be described in more detail below, each particular transaction or billing event is not immediately included in the telephone account  at the Telco , but during a billing cycle (see ) which occurs periodically, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly or at any other interval. Accordingly, communications  take place during billing events between the transaction validation and processing facility  and the vendor  and a record of each transaction is kept at the facility  as shown by block  in FIG. . The facility , with its transaction validation and processing module , in an automated fashion at the end of a billing cycle, processes the transactions into the relevant telephone accounts at the relevant Telcos  as shown at block .","Referring in particular to  of the drawings, the vendor  uses the application interface and modification module  to interface to the communication network, typically the Internet, so that the user may communicate with the vendor  via the electronic terminal . The module  includes an application interface (API) , a customer management system (CMS) , an automatic number identification (ANI) module , a modification module , and a communication module . The communication module  is configured to communicate with the transaction validation and processing module , which is typically located offsite. In use, the API  provides the electronic terminal  with a user interface whereby the user can purchase goods and\/or services and this may be provided in a conventional fashion. Once the user has selected the goods and\/or services he or she wishes to purchase, the API  communicates a display screen or form  to the electronic terminal  as shown in FIG. . Typically, the API  requests the user to enter into the form  name, address, city, state, zip, day time phone number, evening phone number, or the like information. Typically, the evening phone number defines a billing telephone number (BTN) which is associated with the telephone account . Thereafter, the various terms and or conditions of the transaction are communicated to the user in the form of a display screen  as shown in FIG. . The user is then compelled either to accept or decline the terms by activating buttons ,  respectively, typically by means of a mouse or pointing device in a conventional fashion.","Once the user has accepted the terms, the API  then provides the user with a display screen  which allows the user to select various different methods of payment for the transaction. For example, the display screen  includes a \u201cVisa\u201d button , a \u201cMasterCard\u201d button , \u201cAmerican Express\u201d button , and a \u201cbank account\u201d button . However, unlike conventional systems, the system  provides the user with a \u201cphone bill\u201d button  whereby the user can charge the transaction to the telephone account  (see FIG. ).","If the user selects the option to pay via the telephone account  by activating the \u201cphone bill\u201d button , the API  then provides the user with a screen display  (see ) which requests the user to confirm the BTN associated with the telephone account . The screen display  includes a \u201cyes\u201d button  for the user to confirm the telephone number which is shown at , and a \u201cno\u201d button  which is activated in the event of the telephone number being incorrect. If the telephone number shown at  is incorrect, the user then is prompted to re-enter a corrected telephone number. Once the user has activated the \u201cyes\u201d button , the API  then communicates a display screen  to the electronic terminal  to advise the user that he or she should wait while the request is authorized. It is to be appreciated however that the description above is merely an example of how a user may be provided with various interfaces to allow the user to select a mode or method of payment associated with the telephone account . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that user data may be obtained in a variety of different ways. For example, an application may be downloaded to the electronic terminal  which requests and obtains the relevant data from the user and which is then subsequently communicated to the vendor .","The BTN which the user enters into the form  should correspond with the subscriber line  (see ) via which the electronic terminal  is connected to the communication network. Accordingly, the ANI module  automatically identifies or determines the telephone number of the subscriber line  so that a comparison between the two can be made. The BTN thus defines a unique identifier associated with the communication line and with which the telephone account  corresponds.","The user's request, via the electronic terminal  and via the subscriber line  (which may be any communication line associated with the account ), is then communicated to the CMS  which then formats the request to form a request record with information provided by the user via the electronic terminal  (see block  in FIG. ). As shown at decision step , the module  checks to determine whether or not a credit card number is present in the record and, if so, the record is communicated to a credit card gateway for processing in a conventional fashion and the procedure terminates as shown at step . This situation typically arises when the user has not selected the telephone account option by activating the \u201cphone bill\u201d button  but, instead, selected one of the other methods of payment, e.g., the \u201cVisa\u201d button , the \u201cMasterCard\u201d button , the \u201cAmerican Express\u201d button , or the \u201cbank account\u201d button .","However, if the \u201cphone bill\u201d button  has been activated and a credit card number is not present in the record, the CMS , in combination with the modification module , modifies the credit card record to include the telephone number identified by the ANI module . Accordingly, the credit card or financial record communicated from the vendor  to the transaction validation and processing facility  substantially resembles a conventional or industry standard credit card record except that, instead of a credit card number, the telephone number associated with the subscriber line  is included (see step ). In the embodiment of the invention in which the credit card number has been replaced with the telephone number, and as the record substantially resembles and industry standard credit card record, existing or conventional customer management systems may be used to process the transaction. Thus, the CMS  may be a conventional customer management system.","The application interface and modification module  of the vendor , communicates the transaction record to the transaction validation and processing module  of the facility  via the communication module . The module  then receives the record as shown at step  whereafter it is processed. The transaction validation and processing module  (see ) includes a line number extraction module , a processor module , and an OBF exchange interface . It is important to appreciate that the application interface and modification module  and the transaction validation and processing module  may be defined by one or more servers which are programmed appropriately. Thus, the blocks or modules may represent functional components of software running on the server. Typically, each vendor  has a server programmed and configured to implement the application interface and modification module  and the vendors  are connected via a communications network to a central transaction processing and validation facility . Accordingly the servers at the facility  may receive validation and processing requests from a plurality of different offsite servers provided at different vendors .","The processor module  first checks, at step , if all the information required for validation has been furnished by the vendor  and, if not, the request is returned to vendor  as shown in step . If, however, all the information required by the module  is present in the record, the credit card record received is then parsed and the billing telephone number (BTN) is extracted from the credit card record and formatted into a validation request as shown at step . Thereafter, as described more detail in , the module  performs various checks during which the subscriber line  is validated (see step ). If the BTN progresses to a LIDB interrogation step (as described in more detail below with reference to steps  to  in FIG. ), the request is then reformatted into a LIDB request to obtain LIDB response information (see step ). The LIDB database  (see ) is then interrogated and the LIDB response is received and parsed for relevant information whereafter it is reformatted into a BTN validation request as shown at step . Thereafter, and as described in more detail below with reference to , the processor module  performs further validation checks (see step  in FIG.  and steps  to  in FIGS.  and ). Once the request has been investigated, the various databases have been interrogated, and the results retrieved therefrom processed, the processor module  then translates the validation response in to a credit card authorization response format, which is typically a conventional or industry standard format so that an industry standard or conventional CMS  can process the response. The response is then communicated from the facility  to the vendor  (see step ). The CMS  then receives the reformatted response, updates purchase data, and creates an account for the user as shown in step . Thereafter, the API  communicates a display screen  to the electronic terminal  which thanks the user for ordering the good and\/or services. Each transaction defines a billing event which is recorded at the vendor  and, together with other billing events, is communicated to the facility  at the end of a billing cycle (see block ). Typically, this marks the end of the BTN validation procedure from the credit card authorization record translation as shown at block .","The method described above broadly translates a record requiring validation from an existing financial instrument form, e.g., a credit card form, to a form that is suitable to be validated based on a unique identifier associated with the subscriber line . Although the description above, and the more detailed description below, describe the translation from a credit card record to an appropriate record to validate a ANI\/BTN, it is to be appreciated that any data associated with a financial instrument may be translated into a BTN format and, in response to validation of the BTN, the transaction may be processed. Further, the validation of the BTN may take place one or more times during the life cycle of a transaction. For example, the validation process may be executed when the user or customer request the transaction to be included in the telephone account  as described above and, when the facility  receives a plurality of billing events or transactions at the end of a bill cycle, the facility  may once again validate the transaction.","In certain embodiments, the user or purchaser drives an authorization event in order to establish whether or not the transaction can be billed to the telephone account . In this case, the Billing Telephone Number (BTN) defines the credit instrument requiring authorization for billing. The CMS  may then drive the request to the facility  in the same format as it would to a Credit Card Authorization System. An example of the conversion of a credit card billing request to a BTN validation record is described in more detail below.","1.

Each event in the transaction file includes an indicator to indicate that the event is a phone billing transaction for inclusion in the telephone account . The module  of the facility  then receives the billing request file as shown at step , whereafter the request file is parsed, as shown at step , and the processor module  checks to see whether or not all the required information is present in the file (see step ). If not, a code is appended to the record as show at step . If all the information is present in the file, the process then proceeds to step  where the credit card authorization to BTN validation steps -, as described above, are executed. Once the validation procedure has been completed, the BTN billing response is formatted into a industry standard credit card billing response with a response code appended to the end of each record and, the records are then returned to the CMS  (see step ).","At the same time, transactions or billing events which have been validated as billable and thus capable of being included in the relevant telephone account , are translated into an electronic message interface (EMI) format appropriate for the Telco with which the telephone account  is associated (see step ). The EMI formatted file is then transferred to the Telco for billing as shown in step  whereafter the Telco call places each billing event on telephone account  associated with the subscriber line . Typically, the Telco returns any records that can not be billed to the telephone account  or that have already been billed and credited, or written off because of non payment to the facility  as shown at step . The records received by the facility  are in the EMI format and the facility  translates the record to a credit card return record including a reason code appended to the record, as shown at step , whereafter record is returned to the CMS  at the vendor .","An example of the billing event record conversion in which a credit card billing request is translated into a BTN billing request is set out below.","1.

In the module , the line number extraction module  and the OBF exchange interface  are integrated into the processor module  which is in the form of a server.","The module  includes an application program interface (API)  which is connected to the vendor  or service provider (see also ) of goods and\/or services which require validation of a subscriber account. The vendor , which could for example be an Internet Service Provider, may request the validation of the subscriber line  prior to concluding an electronic transaction with a subscriber via the subscriber line . It is, however, to be appreciated that the API  may be connected to a variety of different hosts or clients which require validation of a subscriber line  via which the vendor  may carry out transactions for goods and\/or services.","The vendor  typically communicates a request to the module  and forwards the subscriber line number, determined by the ANI service, to the module  via its API . The module  then processes the information received from the vendor  and provides a validation status, e.g. a code indicating a valid billable number or a code indicating that the line number is not a valid billable number (unbillable or non-billable). In particular, a plurality of codes associated with various statuses of the subscriber line  are communicated to the vendor  as described in more detail below.","The module  includes hardware and software to implement the invention. In particular, the module  includes a comparator module , a threshold database , an OFFNET database , an ONNET database , a competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) database , a  BLOCK database , a block and cancel database , an unbilled and\/or unpaid bills database , line identification database (LIDB) short term cache , a validity check module , a regional account office (RAO) database , an operating company number (OCN) database , an ONNET database , an address verification database , customer account record exchange (CARE) results database , an ANI watch database , and an NPA (Numbering Plan Area) exchange database . It is to be appreciated that, in less sophisticated embodiments of the invention, all of the above databases need not be included. However, for enhanced accuracy, all of the above databases are preferably included. Further databases may also be included further to increase the reliability of the validation process.","In addition to any one or more of the above databases, the module  is in communication via a conventional communication channel with an offsite or, in some embodiments, on-site line identification database (LIDB) host . The LIDB host  may include a line number portability (LNP) database. Typically, the LNP database may front end access to a plurality of industry standard LIDBs (e.g. 13 different LIDBs). The LNP database may however be a separate database. As described in more detail below, the module  communicates the subscriber line number to the LIDB host  which, in turn, communicates reference subscriber data in the form of industry standard LIDB codes back to the module  for processing. The module  then processes the LIDB codes to provide the vendor  with validation data relating to the subscriber line . Unlike conventional LIDB applications which use a LIDB to make decisions regarding destination subscriber lines or call completion decisions, e.g. decisions for calling cards, collect and third party toll services or the like, the module  is used to identify telephone numbers of originating subscriber lines.","Broadly, the module  includes a communication module formed by the application program interface (API)  which communicates with the communication module  (see ) of the vendor , a processor module  which includes the various databases  to  as well as the comparator module  and the validity check module , and an interrogation module  for interrogating the LIDB host . It is to be appreciated that the modules may be defined by one or more servers with associated databases. Further, in the example illustrated, the LIDB host  is shown as a single database but may comprise many different LIDB databases maintained by various LECs and, accordingly, may be located at various different geographic locations.","Referring in particular to  to  of the drawings, various sections of a flow chart describing the method of operation of the module  are shown. As described above, the vendor  initiates a request to the module  to validate a transaction to be included in the account  associated with the subscriber line . As shown at step , the module  first checks to see if the BTN number is present in the request from the vendor  and, if no number is present, a return code  is generated and communicated to the vendor as shown at step . The code  indicates to the vendor  that the module  is unable to process the request. If, however, the number is present in the request from the vendor , the module  then checks if the line number captured (hereinafter also referred to as the ANI) by the ANI module , and the BTN entered on the form  (see ) match, as shown at step  (see also the comparator module  in FIG. ). If, however, the ANI and the BTN do not match, then the processor module  generates a code  (see step ) to indicate that the caller and the owner of the line number are not the same person (e.g. the user enters his or her BTN in the form  and uses an electronic terminal connected to a different subscriber line and is thus calling from a different ANI) and the relevant modified code is then returned to the vendor .","If the ANI and the BTN do match, the processor module  interrogates the threshold database  (see step ) to ascertain whether or not the line number has reached its threshold (e.g., a predefined client threshold parameter such as an account threshold). If the line number has reached its threshold, the processor module  then generates a code , as shown at step , which is then communicated to the vendor  to indicate that the line number may not be granted service. In other words, the subscriber account cannot be billed for the goods and\/or services requested by the user from the vendor .","If the threshold has not been reached, the module  then interrogates its OFFNET database  (see step ) to check if the industry standard NPA\/NXX and operating company number (OCN) of the subscriber line  is present in the OFFNET database . The OFFNET database  includes NPA\/NXX and OCN combinations of operating companies with which the proprietor or user of the module  does not have billing and collections agreements to bill into the Telco's bill page associated with the subscriber line . Accordingly, the facility  is unable to include a charge in the account associated with the subscriber line  on behalf of the vendor  for the transaction.","If the line number is in the OFFNET database , then the processor module  generates codes  to  (see step ) and communicates these codes to the vendor . The codes  to  indicate that the NPA\/NXX and OCN for the particular line number  are not billable and, accordingly, charges for goods and\/or services requested by the user cannot be included in the monthly telephone account  by the module . As shown in Table 2 below, the codes  to  provide an indication to the vendor  why the subscriber line  is not billable or deliverable. If the subscriber line number is not included in the OFFNET database , a check is conducted to see whether or not the subscriber line number is included in the ONNET database . This check is however optional in the embodiment depicted in the drawings, but may be mandatory if the module  does not include the OFFNET database .","Thereafter, as shown in step , the processor module  checks to see if the line number is found in a known CLEC table in the CLEC database . CLEC numbers are those line numbers that are known to have ported to a CLEC and, accordingly, the proprietor of the module  is thus unable to route these line numbers to the correct billing entities. If the line number is found in the CLEC database , then the processor module  generates a code  (see step ) which is communicated to the vendor . The code  indicates that the BTN provided by the user is not billable for the CLEC and the module  can thus not charge the transaction to the subscriber account associated with the subscriber line .","If the line number is not found in the CLEC database , then the module  checks to see if the subscriber of the subscriber line  has requested a 4250 billing block as shown at step . In particular, the processor module  interrogates the 42 BLOCK database  and, if the number is located in the database , which indicates that monthly recurring charges (4250) charges are prevented from being billed to that line number, the processor module  generates a code  (see step ) which is communicated to the vendor  to indicate that billing to the particular subscriber line  has been blocked.","If, however, the subscriber line  has not been blocked, the module  then checks at step  if the line number is located in the block and cancel database  and, if so, the processor module  generates codes  and  which are then communicated to the vendor as shown at step . The block and cancel database  includes requests from owners of subscriber lines, agencies, businesses, or the like that a service be canceled or blocked from further billing. Thereafter, the module  interrogates the unbilled and\/or unpaid bills database , as shown at step , to check if there is a history of any unpaid bills and\/or unbillable bills associated with the subscriber line . Unbillable bills relate to those subscriber line numbers where previous attempts have been made to bill charges to the subscriber account associated with the line number, and which have been returned as unbillable. If the processor module  locates the line number in the unbillable and\/or unpaid bills database  then, as shown at step , a code  is generated and communicated to the vendor  to indicate that the line number was previously found to be unbillable and is still considered to be unbillable.","The processing described above conducts a preliminary investigation into the subscriber line number or ANI\/BTN to provide an initial indication of whether or not the ANI\/BTN corresponds with a billable subscriber line. Once the initial investigation has been conducted, the module  then uses the ANI to obtain reference subscriber line data in the form of LIDB codes from one or more industry standard databases in the form of the LIDB host or database . Examples of the LIDB codes used in the module  are shown in Table 3 below.","As shown at step , if the ANI is not found in the LIDB database , the module  cannot provide any validation data to the vendor  on this subscriber line and an appropriate code is then communicated to the vendor  as shown at block .","Once the LIDB database or host  has been interrogated, it returns industry standard LIDB codes and line number portability (LNP) data to the module  as shown in step  (see FIG. ). The LIDB codes are then mapped or translated by the processor module  into modified validation codes (see Table 3) which provide relevant validation information to the vendor . As can be seen from Table 3, the same modified validation code can be generated from a plurality of different LIDB codes. Once the LIDB information codes have been returned to the processor module , the LIDB codes, including OCN and RAO response codes, are fed into the validity check module  (see ) as shown at step .","As mentioned above, the LIDB host  may also provide LNP data to the module . The LNP data is used to identify subscriber line numbers that have ported to a CLEC. If a subscriber line has been ported to a CLEC, the billing ONNET status of the CLEC is verified in the CLEC database . The LNP identifies the facilities based CLECs which are CLECs that have been assigned all the line numbers for an NPA\/NXX in a specific geographic territory. This type of CLEC would be in control of the cable, dial tone and billing envelope for that number. Typically, the LNP cannot be used to identify CLEC sellers which have resold the subscriber line under their brand, but still lease the cable and tone from an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC). Accordingly the facility  may be unable to process transaction data onto a bill page or telephone account  of the CLEC reseller bill page. In order to identify reseller CLECs, the module  compares RAO and OCN information, returned from the LIDB host , to data in the ONNET database . The OCN is the local Telco that owns the subscriber line number and the RAO is the office of the Telco that is responsible from a billing standpoint for the subscriber line number.","If the validity check module  determines that the response codes are invalid, the module  generates modified codes  to  (see step  and Table 2) which are communicated to the requester or vendor  to indicate that the mapping of the LIDB codes to the modified codes concluded that the line is an unbillable subscriber line.","If the validity check module  confirms the validity of the LIDB codes and, in the event of the line number being a billable line number, the processor module  then checks the RAO database  to ascertain whether or not the RAO is billable, as shown at step . If the RAO is not billable, then the processor module  generates and communicates a return code  (see step ) to indicate to the vendor  that the line number belongs to a CLEC which is not billable by the module .","In a similar fashion, at step  the processor module  checks to see if the OCN returned from the LIDB host  corresponds with a known CLEC or if the OCN corresponds with an OFFNET OCN and is therefore also unbillable. If the line number corresponds to an OCN that is not billable, a return code  is generated by the processor module  and communicated to the vendor  (see step ).","If the subscriber line number has passed the RAO and OCN checks and, accordingly, it appears that the number is billable, the processor module  then checks to see if a new NPA \/NXX and OCN combination for this line number is guidable to the correct local Telco for billing (see step ). If the line number is not guidable, then the module  generates a code  at step  which is communicated to the vendor  to indicate that, even though the line number is billable, the facility  is unable to guide the billing information to the new Telco for billing. Accordingly, the telephone number is in fact non-billable insofar as the facility  is concerned and a decline status is therefore communicated to the vendor .","The abovementioned steps are carried out to ascertain whether or not the subscriber line  can be billed for the goods and\/or services requested. However, to enhance the accuracy or reliability of the module , further checks or verification are conducted as described below.","In the event that the subscriber line number has passed or complied with the abovementioned checks, and has thus not yet been rejected, the module  performs address verification procedures at step . The module  then interrogates an address verification database  to compare the address or location data (e.g. a ZIP code) supplied by the user via the form  (see ) with reference address data as shown at step . If, however, the address supplied by the user does not match with the address in the verification database  or, the addresses are not within a predefined range or area, the processor module , as shown at step , generates codes  to  which are then communicated to the vendor  to indicate the level of likelihood that the caller (ANI) and the account owner are the same person.","During the address verification step , the module  interrogates a customer account record exchange (CARE) database (which can be an on-site database which is regularly updated), to provide enhanced reliability. In particular, the CARE database or information site is typically one or more industry standard offsite databases which allow consumers to select or change their long distance service provider. Local Telcos forward specific customer information to the LEC associated with the subscriber. The information communicated typically includes a new phone number, billing address, installation date, the person or organization responsible for the account, or the like.","As shown at step , the module  interrogates the CARE database or information site and CARE data is then loaded into CLEC and new line databases to perform certain fraud and billing checks. The CARE information investigation occurs after a successful validation event. Once the module  has validated the subscriber line , the subscriber line number data is sent to a CARE database provider hosting the CARE database  to obtain the BNA and age of the account. The information is typically returned within 48 hours and then processed. Care records that are returned without BNA and CLEC ACCOUNT codes are inserted into the CLEC database  for future reference. Accordingly, if the BTN is presented again at a later date, it will fail the CLEC check step (see step  in FIG. ).","The ANI watch database , which includes historical and adjusted information, is used by the module  to determine if the account has previously been adjusted (see step ). Typically, this step includes ascertaining previous requests by the subscriber for credit, obtaining data on any written off amounts for charges that were billed to a bill page, or the like.","If adjustments have previously been made to the account associated with the subscriber line , the processor module  generates codes  to  (see step ) to indicate to the vendor  that the adjustments have been made. If no adjustments have been made, the processor module  checks to see whether or not the line number has a business line indicator as shown at step . If the business line indicator is active, the module  generates a code  (see step ) which is communicated to the vendor  to advise that the line is a business line. Thereafter, as shown in step , the processor module  checks to see if the subscriber line number has been in service for less than about 90 days and, if so, a return code  (see step ) is generated to advise the vendor  who may then selectively decide whether or not to conclude the transaction. A database of new numbers may be updated with the new number.","Thereafter, the module  interrogates the ANI watch database  (see step ) to ascertain whether or not the area code of the line number has been changed or is scheduled to change. This interrogation is typically for billing purposes only and is not used to decide upon the validity of the request. In this step, the vendor  requesting the validation typically updates the billing file with the new area code number, and the processor module  generates a code  (see step ) to advise the vendor  of the scheduled change to the area code.","Once the line number has passed all the aforementioned checks, the module  then concludes that the subscriber line  obtained using ANI techniques is in fact a billable line and, accordingly, the transaction may be charged directly to the account of the subscriber. Accordingly, the module  then generates a code 000 (see step ) which is communicated to the vendor . The code 000 defines an approved status following both a billable line number inquiry as well as several fraud checks which are carried out by the fraud control module . If the line number has passed the abovementioned checks and the return code 000 is generated, the process terminates at block step . Thus, step  defines the end of the process during which the various checks have been conducted on the subscriber line  to assess whether or not it is a billable subscriber line that charges may be billed to. Step  defines the last step to which the process jumps when, at any point during the abovementioned process, the line number is found not to be billable (e.g., a creditworthy decision was requested by the vendor ) and the inquiry is accordingly terminated and the relevant code is communicated to the vendor .","The abovementioned steps are typically executed in real time. However, information sources that do not allow checks on the line number in real time may be are carried out subsequently on the line number. Typically, once the real time evaluation is carried out and the return code 000 is communicated to the vendor, and the vendor  decide to proceed with the transaction, transaction data is then periodically returned to the module  by the vendor  for a pre-billing validation check or actual billing. During actual billing the module  accesses an account folder of the subscriber line at the Telco  and inserts the charges due to the vendor  into the telephone account . As shown at step , line numbers are sent to the CARE database  to determine if the BNA is available at the local Telco . If the folder or telephone account  is not available, the local Telco  typically sends the BNA and codes as to why the number is unavailable to the facility .

Thus, the facility  may customize is validation procedures to suit a specific client or vendor.","For the both the validation events, the client profile check is typically performed in facility  prior to carrying out the validity checks. For example, the customer profile check may be included in step  (see ) and step  (see FIG. ). The customer profile includes client specific information which may determine the nature and extent of the validation process. Accordingly, the profile may be checked as soon as the record is received from a registration module or the customer management system . In use, a profile table is queried to identify the validation checks to be performed by the module  and the checks may differ between an initial purchase event or transaction and an associated subsequent billing event at the end of a bill cycle. These checks may, dependent on the client profile, include checking if the ANI is the same as the BTN, if the subscriber line is listed in OFFNET database , in the UNBILLS database , in the Blocking databases ,, in the CLEC database , in the LIDB database , in the address verification database , or in databases including data on previous credits, new lines, business lines area codes, area code changes, or the like.","Additionally, the client profile is typically checked to see which billing record should be written for inclusion on the phone bill for that particular purchase. This may occur as the first part of step  in FIG.  and step  in FIG. .","The client profile can also be used to determine the type of billing record to convert from and the type to convert to for inclusion the telephone account  for the purchase or transaction. For example, the types of billing records may include a 425001 record for a monthly recurring charge; 010101, 010105, 010102, 010116 type records for detailed, usage-based events; and 415001, 410101, 410105, 410102, 410116 records for the credit records.","An example of software tables for implementing the steps in the method set out in the flow diagrams shown in  to  are shown below.","The first table shows the steps in the BTN test descriptions process.

the LIDB data to obtain information on a destination\/termination or recipient location or subscriber unit, the module , in accordance with the invention, uses the industry standard LIDB database to obtain relevant information on the initiating subscriber line . The subscriber line reference data obtained from the LIDB database is then processed to generate modified validity codes, which provide a vendor with data to facilitate deciding whether or not a transaction should be processed. The LIDB\/LNP database is queried as if a collect call event is occurring and a call is thus mimicked. The processing of the transaction typically involves communicating the relevant transaction data to a folder of the subscriber's account with a relevant Telco. The method of, and module  for, validating the billing account associated with the subscriber line allows, for example, a subscriber line to be used to validate and conclude a transaction instead of using a conventional payment techniques such as a credit card, debit card, bank account details or the like.","A current industry-wide problem is the lack of ability of a service provider to identify when a line subscriber has switched his service to a CLEC since the service provider may not have an existing billing arrangement with such a CLEC and may also not have a source for the BNA to allow for a direct billing solution. LNP databases were originally established for the purpose of directing call routing activities among facilities-based carriers and most telephone numbers ported to a CLEC do not involve a facility change (the CLEC may be simply reselling the incumbent LEC's facilities). This means that, for billing decision purposes, LNP queries usually provide an incorrect response.","The LNP queries are enhanced by analyzing and interpreting other field elements included within the query response. Specifically, certain values or, in some cases, the absence of certain values, in the Operating Company Number (\u201cOCN\u201d) and\/or the Regional Accounting Office (\u201cRAO\u201d) fields, allows further accuracy in the validation response. While the definitions of the OCN and RAO field elements can be obtained from industry sources, their interpreted use in the validation process is unique to the present invention. Use of these additional data elements can improve the reliability of the validation event.","LNP results may be supplemented with CARE queries in LEC regions where LNP results are inadequate and CARE costs are not otherwise prohibitive based on the retail price of the underlying service. CARE provides a reliable result on CLEC-ported numbers since its basic purpose is to provide subscriber account information (such as billing name and address). Once a number is ported to a CLEC, the incumbent LEC no longer has subscriber responsibility and will, therefore, return an \u201cunavailable\u201d response, even if the LEC's dial-tone facility is still being utilized. This negative response is then used to generate a \u201cdeny\u201d status on the subscriber based on the current lack of CLEC billing support.","The validation process is also supplemented through the use of internal databases built from information gathered throughout the billing and collection process.","It is important to appreciate that all of the steps in the method executed by the module  need not be executed in real time. Typically, after the approval code 000 has been generated by the module  at step  the module  terminates its pre-validation check routine as shown at step . At this point the module  may merely provide pre-validation data or verification data to indicate to the vendor  if the subscriber line  is billable. Thus the module  may, in a first interaction with the vendor  provide pre-validation data, and in a second interaction process billing information. During the processing of billing information the validation process may once again be executed. In certain embodiments, the first interaction may be in the form of a registration process during which the validation procedure is carried out to register a subscriber line . The vendor  may then conduct numerous transactions with subscriber and subsequent validation checks on the subscriber line may then only be carried out on a periodic basis as described above.","After the validation code has been sent to the vendor , and the pre-validation procedure has been complete, the module  then carries out the fraud checks on a non-real time basis (usually during the next 48 to 72 hours) as shown in steps  to . The information obtained during the fraud control checks, if necessary, is used to update the various databases. In particular, after a BTN has been successfully validated but before a billing event takes place, the CARE investigation steps  to  are executed. The module  is typically arranged to interrogate offsite CARE databases and the results of the enquiry are stored in the CARE database . Checks on the data received from the CARE databases are then performed whereafter one or more of the other databases may be updated with the results. For example, the CARE database  may be updated, new within 90 days information, business indicator information, or the like. CARE codes  and  typically indicate that the BNA is not available and that the LEC no longer owns the account.","The updating of the databases following the CARE investigation allows enhanced future checks by the module  in a subsequent pre-validation procedure or subsequent registration event validation event. The updated information may be provided to the vendor . However, if the BTN information returned from the CARE database  does not meet predefined criteria, the other databases of the module  are not updated.","When a purchase validation event or billing event is declined, fails, unbillable or is negative event for any reason, the purchaser is preferably apprised. The manner in which the failure is treated depends upon the point in time and the reason the transaction validation or billing event fails.","In certain embodiments, a business rule table drives the treatment method and course based on when the failed event occurred during the validation process and the reason for the failure.

However, in other embodiments of the invention, the consumer or user may call the module  directly, as shown by line  in , and the ANI may then be obtained by the module  directly from the terminal  and not indirectly from the vendor . Further subscriber line data, e.g. BTN, address of the user and so on, may then also be obtained directly from the user. For example, the user may have appropriate software installed on his\/her PC which allows the user to dial into the module  in an automated fashion should he\/she wish to charge any requested goods or services to his\/her subscriber account. The module  would then validate the subscriber line  using the method describer above. The module  then typically communicates a validation code (e.g. corresponding to approval or non-approval) to the vendor  as shown by line . The vendor  would then conclude the transaction with the user if the subscriber line has been validated.","In the first iteration of the validation process in which a validation request is received from the vendor , the ANI of the subscriber line  is captured to identify the subscriber line to which the terminal  is connected so that the validation process can be executed and the transaction or purchase can be approved and the billing process can be effected. It is to be appreciated however that the validation process and further prosecution of the transaction may take place based on the BTN which the user enters but that the capturing of the ANI may reduce the likelihood of fraud. Thus, if the ANI is captured, it may be done during an initial enquiry, purchase event, or at any other time during the process.","In other embodiments of the invention, in addition to or instead of capturing the ANI, the system  may request a user to enter the unique number associated with every phone billing account that Telcos currently issue. These additional digits are typically found at the end of the account number on a conventional telephone bill. These digits, sometimes called customer codes, identify the account associated with that particular assignment of the phone number. These codes provide a way to avoid capturing the ANI because typically only the account holder has access to this number thereby reducing the chance of fraud. Thus, the display screen  of  optionally includes the field  in which a user can enter the customer codes. An appropriate database would then be interrogated to validate the subscriber line. In one embodiment of the invention, the interrogation is included in the LIDB step, and includes details on the account to the customer code level.","The customer codes may thus eliminate the need to capture the ANI by the module  (see ) and, customer code data may be compared by the comparator module  (see ) and as shown in step  in FIG. . As described above, the display screen  then includes the field  to accommodate this facility. Likewise, if the phone number is not confirmed, then the input screen would be provided with the customer code field.","When the customer code is used to validate the subscriber line , a step to interrogate the information is included in which additional information is sent to the LIDB database  (see ) in step  of , and step  in FIG. . Additionally, steps relating to the return of LIDB data are updated to include the results of the interrogation of this piece of information.","The facility  may function as a type of clearing house. In particular, the facility  may be responsible or accountable for payment of the goods or services for each transaction to the service provider or vendor  and, in turn, receive payment from the Telco. As mentioned above, the module  updates the telephone bill or account  of the subscriber in an automated fashion (see line) and the bill  that the user receives (see ) includes the charges for the goods and\/or services provided by the vendor . The user pays the Telco  (see line ), the Telco  pays the facility  (see line ), and the facility  pays the vendor  (see line ). It is important to appreciate that these payments need not take place at the same time. Typically, the payments between the Telco  and the facility , and the facility  and vendor , take place periodically in a batch fashion the PC , and modules ,  are exemplary forms of computer systems or machines within which a set of instructions, for causing the machine to perform any one of the methodologies discussed above, may be executed. In alternative embodiments, the machine may comprise a network router, a network switch, a network bridge, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a web appliance or any machine capable of executing a sequence of instructions that specify actions to be taken by that machine.","Each machines includes a processor, a main memory and a static memory, which communicate with each other via a bus. The machines may further include a video display unit (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD) or a cathode ray tube (CRT)).
