{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","EXAMPLES "],"p":["The present invention was developed with Government support under contract number N39997-99-C-3761 awarded by the United States Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","The present invention relates to microelectronic devices and more particularly to high power semiconductor devices.","Electrical circuits requiring high power handling capability (>20 watts) while operating at high frequencies such as radio frequencies (500 MHz), S-band (3 GHz) and X-band (10 GHz) have in recent years become more prevalent. Because of the increase in high power, high frequency circuits there has been a corresponding increase in demand for transistors which are capable of reliably operating at radio frequencies and above while still being capable of handling higher power loads.","To provide increased power handling capabilities, transistors with a larger effective area have been developed. However, as the area of a transistor increases, the transistor, typically, becomes less suitable for high frequency operations. One technique for increasing the area of a transistor while still providing for high frequency operations is to use a plurality of transistor cells that are connected in parallel. Such may be provided using a plurality of gate fingers, thus, the source to drain distance may be kept relatively small while still providing for increased power handling capability. Conventionally, when a plurality of parallel transistor cells are connected in parallel on a single chip, the cells are evenly spaced such that the gate-to-gate distance between adjacent cells (referred to herein as \u201cpitch\u201d or \u201cgate pitch\u201d) is uniform.","When such multi-cell transistors are used in high frequency operations, they may generate a large amount of heat. As a device heats up, performance of the device typically degrades. Such degradation may be seen in gain, linearity and\/or reliability. Thus, efforts have been made to keep junction temperatures of the transistors below a peak operating temperature. Typically, heatsinks and\/or fans have been used to keep the devices cool so as to ensure proper function and reliability. However, cooling systems may be increase size, electrical consumption, costs and\/or operating costs of systems employing such transistors.","With uniform pitch multi-cell transistors, the temperature of cells near the center of the array are typically greater than those of the cells at the periphery. This is generally the case because the cells at the periphery have a larger area and\/or a greater thermal gradient to areas surrounding the cells. Thus, for example, adjacent cells near the center of the multi-cell array will each generate heat and thus, each side of the cells will be at an elevated temperature with respect to cells farther from the center. This results in a thermal profile that is roughly a bell curve with center junction temperatures being the hottest and with the outer most junctions having a substantially reduced operating temperature compared to the center junctions.","An uneven temperature distribution among the junctions of a device may reduce device linearity. For example, for a device with a plurality of evenly spaced gate fingers connected by a manifold, RF phasing errors may occur along both the gate manifold and the individual gate fingers as a result of differing gate resistance as a function of temperature. Conventionally, to address these issues the spacing between the gate fingers is widened and\/or the length of the fingers are shortened and additional fingers added to achieve the same net active area. Both of these solutions may result in spreading the heat load generated in the center of the device over a wider area. These solutions also may result in a larger area for the multi-cell transistor that may reduce the number of die per wafer.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a high frequency, high power semiconductor device having a plurality of unit cells connected in parallel. The unit cells each having a controlling electrode and first and second controlled electrodes. A first thermal spacer divides at least one of the unit cells into a first active portion and a second active portion, spaced apart from the first potion by the thermal spacer. The controlling electrode and the first and second controlled electrodes of the unit cell are provided on the first thermal spacer.","In further embodiments of the present invention, a second thermal spacer divides the unit cell into a third active portion. The third active portion is spaced apart from the first and second active portions. The controlling electrode and the first and second controlled electrodes of the unit cell are also provided on the second thermal spacer.","In additional embodiments of the present invention, a third thermal spacer divides an adjacent unit cell into a first active portion and a second active portion. The controlling electrode and the first and second controlled electrodes of the adjacent unit cell are provided on the third thermal spacer. The third thermal spacer is offset from the first and second thermal spacers.","In yet other embodiments of the present invention, the first and second active portions of the unit cell include mesas and the first thermal spacer includes a region between the mesas. Furthermore, the first and\/or second controlled electrodes of the unit cell may include an air bridge across the region between the mesas. The controlling electrode of the unit cell may be provided on sidewalls of the mesas and extend onto a floor of the region between the mesas. The mesas may include epitaxial layers on a substrate and the region between the mesas may include an exposed region of the substrate.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the first thermal spacer is provided by an electrically inactive implanted region and\/or an insulator region between the first and second active portions of the unit cell. Furthermore, a cross-sectional area of the controlling electrode may be greater where the controlling electrode crosses the first thermal spacer than a cross-sectional area of the controlling electrode on the first and second active portions of the at least one unit cell. Also, the thermal spacer may provide a lower peak junction temperature than a corresponding unitary gate device for a particular set of operating conditions.","In particular embodiments of the present invention, the unit cells are a plurality of unit cells arranged in a linear array. Also, the controlling electrode may be a gate finger and the first and second controlled electrodes may be source and drain electrodes. The unit cells may be unit cells of a silicon carbide MESFET. The unit cells may also be unit cells of a GaN transistor.","In other embodiments of the present invention, a high power, high frequency field effect transistor includes a plurality of unit cells electrically connected in parallel. A plurality of gate electrodes of the unit cells are electrically connected in parallel. A plurality of source electrodes of the unit cells and a plurality of drain electrodes of the unit cells are also electrically connected in parallel. A plurality of thermal spacers divide corresponding ones of the plurality of unit cells into at least a first active portion and a second active portion. The gate electrodes, source electrodes and drain electrodes of the unit cells cross over the corresponding thermal spacers.","In certain embodiments of the present invention, the plurality of unit cells comprise a linear array of unit cells. The plurality of thermal spacers may provide a checkerboard pattern. The plurality of thermal spacers may be substantially uniform in size or may be non-uniform in size. The plurality of thermal spacers could also be aligned between adjacent unit cells.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the plurality of unit cells are a plurality of silicon carbide unit cells. The plurality of unit cells could also be a plurality of gallium nitride based unit cells.","In yet other embodiments of the present invention, the first and second active portions of the unit cells include mesas and the plurality of thermal spacers include regions between the mesas. Furthermore, the first and\/or second controlled electrodes of the unit cells may include an air bridge across the corresponding regions between the mesas. The controlling electrodes of the unit cells may be provided on sidewalls of the mesas and extend onto a floor of the regions between the mesas. The mesas may include epitaxial layers on a substrate and the region between the mesas may include an exposed region of the substrate.","In further embodiments of the present invention, the thermal spacers are provided by an electrically inactive implanted region and\/or an insulator region between the first and second active portions of the unit cells. Furthermore, a cross-sectional area of the controlling electrodes may be greater where the controlling electrodes cross the thermal spacers than a cross-sectional area of the controlling electrodes on the first and second active portions of the unit cells. Also, the thermal spacers may provide a lower peak junction temperature than a corresponding unitary gate device for a particular set of operating conditions.","The present invention will now be described with reference to the Figures that illustrate various embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in the Figures, the sizes of layers or regions are exaggerated for illustrative purposes and, thus, are provided to illustrate the general structures or the present invention. Furthermore, various aspects of the present invention are described with reference to a layer being formed on a substrate or other layer.

These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer, or section from another region, layer, or section. Thus, a first region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second region, layer, or section, and similarly, a second without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to  where  is top view of exemplary devices according to embodiments of the present invention.  is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the devices of  taken along the lines \u2013\u2032.  is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the devices of  taken along the lines \u2013\u2032.  is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the devices of  taken along the lines \u2013\u2032",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As illustrated in , an exemplary portion of a MESFET incorporating embodiments of the present invention may include a first epitaxial layer  of p-type  conductivity is grown on a single crystal bulk silicon carbide substrate  of either p-type or n-type conductivity or semi-insulating. The first epitaxial layer of silicon carbide  is disposed between the substrate  and an n-type epitaxial layer . An optional metallization layer  may be formed on the opposite side of the substrate from the first epitaxial layer .","The first epitaxial layer  may be a p-type conductivity silicon carbide epitaxial layer, an undoped silicon carbide epitaxial layer or a very low doped n-type conductivity silicon carbide epitaxial layer. If a low doped silicon carbide epitaxial layer is utilized, then in certain embodiments, the doping concentration of the first epitaxial layer  is less than about 5\u00d710cm. If an undoped or n-type first epitaxial layer  is utilized, then in certain embodiments, the substrate  is a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate. If an undoped or n-type first epitaxial layer  is utilized, a high quality channel layer may be formed without the buffer layer having any significant electrical effect on the transistor.","Ohmic contacts  and  may be formed on the second epitaxial layer  and are spaced apart so as to provide a source contacts  and a drain contacts . A series of Schottky gate contacts , also referred to as gate fingers, are formed on the second epitaxial layer  between corresponding ones of the source contacts  and the drain contacts . As illustrated, optional metal overlayers ,  and  are formed on the source and drain contacts  and  and the Schottky gate contacts . A passivation layer  may also be provided. As illustrated in , certain embodiments of the present invention provide a linear array of cells that are connected in parallel. Thus, the gate contacts  may be connected in parallel in a third dimension. In still other embodiments of the present invention a two dimensional array of cells may be provided.","While two gate fingers  are illustrated in , other numbers of gate fingers may be utilized. Furthermore, other MESFET or semiconductor device configurations may also be utilized. For example, devices such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,762,806; 4,757,028, 5,270,554; and 5,925,895, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein as if set forth fully, may be utilized in embodiments of the present invention.

Such an electrically inactive region may, for example, be provided by removing all or part of one or more of the epitaxial layers  and  to expose the underlying layers and\/or substrate . In particular embodiments of the present invention, the thermal spacers  comprise a portion of a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate without the epitaxial layers  and . In other embodiments, the thermal spacers  comprise a portion of a semi-insulating silicon carbide substrate without the epitaxial layer  and with only a portion of the semiconductor layer . The thermal spacers  could also be provided by counterdoping, a local oxidation process or other such techniques to make the regions of the thermal spacers electrically inactive. For example, the division of the active region by a thermal spacer may be accomplished by an etched mesa, an ion implanted region, addition of a dielctric, or other mechanisms of providing electrical isolation. As used herein, the term \u201celectrically inactive\u201d refers to a region where a substantial current does not flow between controlled electrodes, if present, irrespective of a voltage or current applied to a controlling electrode. Thus, for example, in the thermal spacer regions  no current would flow from the source electrode  to the drain electrode  irrespective of the voltage of the gate finger  such that heat is not generated.","The thermal spacers  may provide an electrically inactive region with a length of each spacer, for example, of from about 50 \u03bcm to about 200 \u03bcm in length for silicon carbide. The particular length of the thermal spacer may depend on the gate width (i.e. the length of the gate finger). The number of thermal spacers per gate finger may be uniform or non-uniform. For example, for a 500 \u03bcm active area gate finger may be divided into three equal segments by two 100 \u03bcm thermal spacers. Alternatively, a 500 \u03bcm active area gate finger may be divided into two equal segments by a single 200 \u03bcm thermal spacer.","In the design of RF transistors, parasitic resistance, inductance and capacitance along each gate finger may be important. The length of each gate finger is, typically, limited by both thermal considerations and frequency response. As the desired operating frequency increases, typically the length of the gate fingers is reduced because reducing the series resistance and inductance along the gate finer increases the maximum frequency of operation (f) of the transistor. Therefore, in some applications, it may be desirable that the addition of the thermal spacer not have an adverse affect on the frequency performance of the transistor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 and 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["40","12","14","60","24","12","14","20","22","60","40","20","22","24"]},"Parasitics may also be reduced and\/or minimized as a result of the inclusion of the thermal spacers by flaring out the gate over the thermal spacers so that the increases in series resistance and inductance are minimized. Such a flared gate structure is illustrated in  as the regions  of the gate fingers . The gate finger  in the flared region  may have a width of from about 1 \u03bcm to about 20 \u03bcm. Thus, the regions  of the gate fingers  may have an increased width, which may provide an increased cross-sectional area over the portions of the gate fingers  in the active regions .","While embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated with reference to a non-uniform width of the gate conductor and an air bridge of the source and drain conductors, the present invention should not be construed as limited to such embodiments. For example, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the conductor of gate fingers may be substantially uniform in width. Furthermore, the conductors of the source and drain contacts may be in contact with an underlying region, such as the substrate  and\/or an otherwise electrically inactive region of a thermal spacer. For example, the region between the mesas in  may be filled in with an insulator, such as an oxide, and the gate conductor and source and drain regions provided on the insulator.","Furthermore, while the thermal spacers of  are illustrated as having the same number of spacers in each gate finger, differing numbers of spacers may be provided in different fingers. For example, as illustrated in , a checkerboard pattern  of spacers may be provided where adjacent fingers having differing numbers of spacers. Thus, a first gate finger A may have a single spacer A at approximately the center of the finger A and an adjacent finger B may have two spacers B1, B2 centered at about \u2153 and \u2154 the length of the finger B. Such a checkerboard pattern  may be beneficial in providing a more uniform thermal profile as active portions of adjacent fingers A, B will be spaced apart from each other in two dimensions. The checkerboard pattern  may also reduce the mutual coupling between air bridges.","Furthermore, in addition to the incorporation of thermal spacers, the pitch between the gate fingers  may be non-uniform. For example, the pitch may vary from a small pitch to a larger pitch toward the center of the device. By increasing the pitch at the center of the device, the increased heat dissipation area may compensate for the decreased thermal gradient at the center of the device such that the junction temperature associated with the respective gate fingers may be moderated. A more uniform junction temperature may provided for a decreased peak junction temperature which may result in improved reliability over a conventional uniform spaced device under the same operating conditions. Furthermore, the more uniform thermal profile may reduce impedance differences between the fingers and, thereby, improve linearity of an RF device. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may include a non-uniform gate pitch as described in U. S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/734,398, entitled \u201cNON-UNIFORM GATE PITCH SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES,\u201d the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.","The following examples are illustrative of certain embodiments of the present invention and shall not be construed as limiting the present invention.","A SiC MESFET MMIC with 30-mm of active gate periphery designed for continuous wave (CW) operation was thermally modeled for both a unitary gate finger device () and a divided gate finger device (). For frequencies less than 4 GHz, each finger can be 500 \u03bcm long. The thermal model, including the effects of a CuW package and a AuSn solder attach shows that with the backside of the package maintained at a temperature of 90\u00b0 C. The fingers were spaced 80 \u03bcm apart. The model indicated that the maximum junction is about 180\u00b0 C. for a unitary gate finger device (). The model also shows that by dividing each gate finger into two 250-\u03bcm segments and incorporating a 200 \u03bcm thermal spacer between them, the maximum junction temperature is reduced to about 158\u00b0 C. (). The maximum difference in temperature along each finger is also reduced by about 28% from about 39\u00b0 C. to about 28\u00b0 C., thereby potentially improving the linearity of the response. To achieve this same reduction in maximum junction temperature without including the thermal spacer would require increasing the gate pitch from 80 \u03bcm to 100 \u03bcm.","Potential benefits from the use of the thermal spacers can be seen by comparing the MMIC chip area for the two cases. As a specific example, assume that for the initial design with the 80-\u03bcm pitch, the MMIC chip was 5.0 mm\u00d75.0 mm. By increasing the gate pitch to 100 \u03bcm, the MMIC chip is enlarged to 6.0 mm\u00d75.0 mm, an increase in area of 20%. In contrast, by incorporating the 200 \u03bcm thermal spacer to achieve the same reduction in maximum junction temperature, the chip size becomes 5.0 mm\u00d75.2 mm, an increase in area of only 4%.","In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color.
