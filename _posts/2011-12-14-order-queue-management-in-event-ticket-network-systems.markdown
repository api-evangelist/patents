{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure generally relates to online event management systems and methods for managing ticket sales.","Many websites allow users to conduct a variety of actions online, such as view content, write reviews, order items, organize events, etc. These websites often present the user with a plurality of actions to choose from and allow the user to select the type of action he would like to perform. Once the action is selected, the website typically redirects the client system of the user to a webpage where the action can be completed. For example, some websites allow users to purchase tickets for an event. An online ticket purchasing system may allow an event organizer to sell a greater number of tickets in an efficient manner, such as, for example, issuing electronic tickets that are instantly delivered to the purchaser and handling high-volume purchase transactions. An online ticket purchasing system may also allow users to view event listings, register for events, and purchase additional event-related services and\/or products. Online systems, such as online ticket purchasing systems, can typically be accessed using suitable browser clients (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer).","Online ticket purchasing systems may strive to maximize tickets sales while also providing a favorable user experience. Meeting these demands while attempting to process a high volume of ticket sales (e.g., for a popular event) can be problematic if the system has processing limitations. Particular users attempting to register for an event or purchase tickets for an event may be forced to wait while the system processes orders from other users. Some of these users may be unable to purchase tickets after waiting because the event sells out. Alternatively, particular users may be turned away when the system incorrectly determines that an event has sold out or will sell out based on the current requests to purchase tickets or register for an event the system is processing. Practical computer system limitations may also make it necessary to limit the number of user sessions entering a workflow to purchase tickets because sessions in a workflow to purchase tickets typically consume a significant amount of computing resources. These situations may cause an unfavorable user experience that the operator of the online ticket purchasing system may want to avoid.","System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","101","130","170","110","101","130","170","110","101","130","170","110","130","170","110","130","170","101","130","170","110","101","130","170","110","100","101","130","170","110"]},"In particular embodiments, an event management system  may be a network-addressable computing system that can host one or more event organization and management systems. An event management system  may generate, store, receive, and transmit event-related data, such as, for example, event listings, event details, event history details, event registration details, event organizer details, event attendee details, ticket purchase details, attendee check-in details, and event displays. An event management system  may be accessed by the other components of system , either directly or via network . In particular embodiments, one or more users  may use one or more client systems  to access, send data to, and receive data from an event management system . A client system  may access an event management system  directly, via network , or via a third-party system. A client system  may be any suitable computing device, such as, for example, a personal computer, a laptop, a cellular phone, a smartphone, a personal digital assistant, an ultra-mobile PC, or a computing tablet.","Network  may be any suitable communications network. As an example and not by way of limitation, one or more portions of network  may include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a virtual private network (VPN), a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless WAN (WWAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a portion of the Internet, a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), a cellular telephone network, or a combination of two or more of these. Network  may include one or more networks .","Connections  may connect client system  and event management system  to communication network  or to each other. This disclosure contemplates any suitable connections . In particular embodiments, one or more connections  include one or more wireline (such as for example Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)), wireless (such as for example Wi-Fi or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)) or optical (such as for example Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)) connections. In particular embodiments, one or more connections  each include an ad hoc network, an intranet, an extranet, a VPN, a LAN, a WLAN, a WAN, a WWAN, a MAN, a portion of the Internet, a portion of the PSTN, a cellular telephone network, another connection , or a combination of two or more such connections . Connections  need not necessarily be the same throughout system . One or more first connections  may differ in one or more respects from one or more second connections .","Event Management Systems","In particular embodiments, an event management system  may allow users  to organize and manage events. An event may be, for example, a party, a concert, a conference, a sporting event, a fundraiser, a networking event, or a live performance. Events may occur online (such as, for example, a web-based seminar) and offline (such as, for example, a live seminar in a lecture hall). An event management system  may allow an event organizer (e.g., user ) to organize and manage various aspects of an event, such as, for example, managing attendee registrations and selling tickets, managing funds from ticket sales, promoting the event, or managing attendee check-in at the event. An event management system  may also allow event attendees (e.g., users ) to view and manage various aspects of registering for an event, such as, for example, viewing event listings, viewing event information, viewing event history information, registering for events, or purchasing tickets for events. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first user may use event management system  to organize an event. The first user may input event information associated with the event to create an event listing on event management system . One or more second users may then use event management system  to view the event listing and register for the event, such as, for example, by purchasing tickets for the event. As used herein, the terms \u201cregistering for an event\u201d and \u201cpurchasing tickets for an event\u201d may be used interchangeably. Although this disclosure describes particular types of events, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of events. Moreover, although this disclosure describes organizing and managing particular aspects of an event, this disclosure contemplates organizing and managing any suitable aspects of an event.","In particular embodiments, an event management system  may have an event listing associated with each event managed by the system. An event listing may be hosted on event management system , such as, for example, on a particular webpage associated with the event listing. An event listing may be accessed and displayed by any suitable client system , such as, for example, by accessing the particular webpage associated with the event listing. An event listing may have an event information associated with the event listing. Event information may include information describing the event date, type, cost, organizer, promoter, geographic location, venue, performer, tickets, ticket identifiers, attendees, attendee check-in status, and other suitable event information. Although this disclosure describes particular types of event information, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of event information. An event listing may also have a payment information associated with the event listing. Payment information may include the address verification system score for the payments for the event, the credit cards used to pay for the event, the locations of payers, the IP addresses of the payers, the number and amount of prior payouts to the event organizer, and other suitable payment information. Although this disclosure describes particular types of payment information, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of payment information. An event listing may also have a purchase information associated with the event listing. Purchase information may include any billing information, shipping information, or other suitable information needed from user  to register for an event or purchase tickets for an event. Although this disclosure describes particular types of purchase information, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of purchase information.","In particular embodiments, the event information associated with an event listing may include an event attendee list. The event attendee list may include information describing one or more of the attendees registered to attend the event, include the attendee's name, phone number, mailing address, email address, payment information, ticket order information, ticket information, check-in status, and other suitable attendee information. Each attendee may be assigned one or more tickets, and each ticket may have a unique ticket identifier. A ticket identifier may be an identification number, a barcode, a 2D barcode, a QR code, or another suitable unique identifier. The event attendee list may also include information describing the check-in status of an attendee. Check-in status may indicate whether an attendee is or is not checked-in at the event. As an example and not by way of limitation, the check-in status of an attendee may indicate the attendee is checked-in after the attendee arrives at the event and provides a ticket to an event organizer. Although this disclosure describes particular types of information associated with an event attendee list, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of information associated with an event attendee list.","In particular embodiments, each user  of event management system  may have an event history information associated with the user . Event history information may include event information and payment information associated with one or more events a user  has attended or has registered to attend, as well as purchase history information associated with the event. Event history information may also include event information and payment information associated with one or more event listings a user  has created, organized, and managed. Although this disclosure describes particular event history information, this disclosure contemplates any suitable event history information.","In particular embodiments, the event management system  may use unique client identifiers to identify a user . As an example and not by way of limitation, the event management system  may assign a unique client identifier to each client system . The event management system  may assign each client system  with an unique client identifier based on the IP address of the client system , tracking cookies on the client system  (which may be appended to HTTP requests transmitted by the client system ), the serial number or asset tag of the client system , or other suitable identifying information. As another example and not by way of limitation, the event management system  may assign a unique client identifier to each user , which the user must provide to the event management system  via a client system . The event management system  may assign each user  with a username and password that the user  can input into client system , which then transmits the username and password to the event management system . In particular embodiments, the event management system  can use the unique client identifier to determine that the user  is accessing the system.","In particular embodiments, the event management system  may maintain an event management account for a user . The event management account may contain a variety of user information about the user . As an example and not by way of limitation, user information may include personal information (such as, for example, name, sex, location, and interests), social network information (such as, for example, friend connections), financial information (such as, for example, income and credit history), event history information (such as, for example, the type, data, cost, venue, performers, and geographic location of the events a user  has organize, registered for, or attended), user account information (such as, for example, preferred status, temporary trial status, free status, and paid status), and other suitable information related to the user . User information may also include information related to the funds collected by event management system  from ticket sales for event listings created by the user , and information related to funds paid out to the user . Although this disclosure describes event management accounts containing particular types of information about a user , this disclosure contemplates event management accounts containing any suitable information about a user . Moreover, although this disclosure describes user information including particular types of information about a user , this disclosure contemplates user information containing any suitable information about a user .","In particular embodiments, an event management system  may use a \u201cshopping cart\u201d model to facilitate registering for an event. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may present a user  with a plurality of event listings. The user  may select one or more of the events to register for. For each event, the user  may also select the number of attendees the user is registering for the event. When the user  selects an event listing on event management system , the event management system  metaphorically adds that item to a shopping cart. When the user  is done selecting event listings, then all the items in the shopping cart may be \u201cchecked out\u201d (i.e., ordered) when the user  provides billing information (and possibly shipment information). Billing information may include the user 's name, address, credit card information, bank account number, PayPal username, and other suitable billing or payment information. In some embodiments, when a user  selects an event listing, then that event listing is \u201cchecked out\u201d by automatically prompting the user for the billing and shipment information. The user  then may be presented with a registration webpage that prompts the user for the user-specific registration information to complete the registration. That webpage may be prefilled with information that was provided by the user  when registering for another event or when establishing a user account on event management system . The information may then be validated by event management system , and the registration may be completed. At this point, the user  may be presented with a registration confirmation webpage that displays the details of the event and registration details. Event management system  may also charge or withdraw funds from a financial account associated with user  based on the billing information provided by the user . Although this disclosure describes particular means for registering for events, this disclosure contemplates any suitable means for registering for events. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may use any suitable electronic commerce model to facilitate registering for an event.","In particular embodiments, a user  may register for an event by purchasing a ticket for the event. A user  may purchase tickets for an event for himself or others. Each ticket purchase order may be associated with a particular order identifier, which may be any suitable identifying information. A user  may purchase one or more tickets to an event for one or more attendees. Each ticket may be associated with a particular attendee. Each attendee may be associated with a particular attendee identifier, which may be any suitable identifying information. Therefore, each order identifier may be associated with one or more attendee identifiers. Each attendee may be associated with one or more tickets. Therefore, each attendee identifier may be associated with one or more ticket identifiers. In particular embodiments, the ticket identifier is a particular barcode number. A user  may select particular number and type of tickets to purchase for an event. As an example and not by way of limitation, the user  may request to purchase n tickets to an event. The user may also select particular types of tickets to purchase, such as, for example, premium tickets, general admission tickets, reserved seating tickets, another suitable type of tickets, or two or more such types of tickets. Although this disclosure describe a user  purchasing tickets for an event in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates a user  purchasing tickets for an event in any suitable manner.","Order Queue Management","In particular embodiments, event management system  may use an order queue management system to facilitate registering for an event or purchasing tickets for an event. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may use an order queue management system when a high number of users are requesting to register for an event or to purchase tickets for an event. An event organizer or operator of event management system  may want to maximize ticket sales or the rate of ticket sales by allowing event management system  to process as many requests to purchase tickets as possible by associating as many requests as possible with an in-process workflow where the users  can purchase tickets. This may result in a volume of requests to purchase tickets that is greater than the processing capacity of system . As an example and not by way of limitation, the volume of request to purchase tickets may be greater than the processing limit of event management system , network , another suitable system, or two or more such systems. When system  has reached its processing capacity for processing requests to purchase tickets for an event, additional requests may be queued to a queue workflow until additional processing resources are available on system . However, this may result in particular users  waiting long periods of time with an expectation to purchase tickets. Although some users  may have their requests to purchase tickets for the event moved from a queue workflow to an in-process workflow, other users  may have their request denied because the event has sold out. Thus, it may be undesirable to have users  placed in queue workflows and then have those same users  be unable to purchase tickets after a long wait because of the resulting negative shopping experience. In particular embodiments, event management system  may avoid associating requests to purchase tickets with a queue workflow when it determines that it is unlikely that tickets will be available for the event by the time a request is transferred from the queue workflow to the in-process workflow. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may apply a probabilistic model to determine whether a request to purchase tickets for an event from a user  should be associated with an in-process workflow, a queue workflow, a termination workflow, or another suitable workflow based on the probability of success that tickets will be available for the user  to purchase. One goal of system  may be to minimize the number of users  admitted into a queue workflow while still allowing enough users  to access an in-process workflow so that an event may sellout. The system  may determine whether to place another user  in a queue workflow based on the probability that the event will sellout without admitting additional users  into the queue workflow. The threshold probability may be based on a user-defined value. If more users  are needed to reach the desired probability of selling out then additional users  may be admitted to the queue workflow. The system  may periodically or continually reevaluate the probability of selling out the event as time passes and some users  successfully purchase tickets while other users  let their sessions expire without completing a successful order. If the number of users  who are in the queue workflows and in-process workflows who complete successful orders is lower than estimated by a probabilistic model, then the system  may admit additional users  into the queue workflow. If the number of successful orders is greater than expected and the event sells out while some users  are still in the queue workflow, the users  remaining in the queue workflow may be removed from the queue workflow and directed to a termination workflow, where the user  may receive an appropriate message. Although this disclosure describes using a particular order queue management system to facilitate registering for an event or purchasing tickets for an event in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates using any suitable order queue management system to facilitate registering for an event or purchasing tickets for an event in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets for an event with an in-process workflow. An in-process workflow may allow a user  to register for an event or purchase tickets for an event. Once a request from a user  is associated with an in-process workflow, the user  may purchase one or more tickets by successfully completing on order, or the user  may not purchase tickets if the user  cancels the request, or allows the session in the in-process workflow to expire or time-out. In particular embodiments, an in-process workflow may comprise registering one or more attendees for an event using a shopping cart model or another suitable electronic commerce model. As an example and not by way of limitation, once a request to purchase tickets for an event from a user  has been associated with an in-process workflow, the user  may input billing information for user  or one or more other attendees. The event management system  may also access event history information associated with the user , event information associated with the event, user information associated with the user , or other suitable information. After the user  has completed registering for the event or purchasing tickets for the event, event management system  may update the event attendee list associated with the event to include user  or one or more other attendees. In particular embodiments, event management system  may only be able to simultaneously process a number of requests to purchase tickets equal to the process limit of the system. The process limit for event management system  may be based on the processing capacity of event management system , the transmission capacity of network , or another suitable processing capacity. In particular embodiment, event management system  may have a process limit of L requests to purchase tickets. If event management system  is currently processing L requests to purchase tickets from L users , then event management system  may have zero open in-process workflows and therefore be unable to process any additional requests to purchase tickets until one or more of the L request to purchase tickets is completed. In this case, newly receive requests to purchase tickets may be associated with a different workflow (such as, for example, a queue workflow or a termination workflow) until there is an open in-process workflow available. However, if event management system  is currently processing q<L request to purchase tickets from q users , then event management system  may have one or more open in-process workflows (in this case, the number of open in-process workflows would be equal to L\u2212q) and therefore be able to associate one or more newly received requests to purchase tickets with an open in-process workflow. Event management system  may decrement the number of open in-process workflows in response to the request being associated with an open in-process workflow. Although this disclosure describes a particular in-process workflow comprising particular steps, this disclosure contemplates any suitable in-process workflow comprising any suitable steps. Moreover, although this disclosure describes implementing an in-process workflow in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates implementing an in-process workflow in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets for an event with a queue workflow. A queue workflow may allow a user  to wait to register for an event or purchase tickets for an event while event management system  is processing other requests to register for an event or purchase tickets for an event (such as, for example, requests received prior to the user 's request). Thus, the queue workflow allows a user  to wait to enter an in-process workflow. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets to an event from a user  to a queue workflow if there are no open in-process workflows available. In particular embodiments, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets for an event from a user  to a queue workflow if the request has an order success probability above a threshold determined by applying a probabilistic model. The order success probability for a particular user  is the probability that the user  will be able to successfully purchase tickets for an event, such as, for example, being able to purchase tickets for an event before it sells out. As an example and not by way of limitation, a request to purchase tickets from a user  may remain associated with a queue workflow until an open in-process workflow is available, until the user 's session expires, until no further tickets are available for sale, or as long as the order success probability for the request to purchase tickets from the user  is above a threshold determined by applying a probabilistic model. In particular embodiments, event management system  may periodically update the number of open in-process workflows or the order success probability for a request to purchase tickets and then reevaluate whether to transfer the request to another workflow. As an example and not by way of limitation, if event management system  determines that an open in-process workflow becomes available, the system may transfer a request to purchase tickets to an event from a queue workflow to an open in-process workflow. As another example and not by way of limitation, if event management system  determines that the order success probability for a request to purchase tickets has dropped below a threshold determined by applying a probabilistic model, the system may transfer the request to purchase tickets to an event from the queue workflow to a termination workflow. Event management system  may update the number of open in-process workflows or the order success probability for a request to purchase tickets based on a variety of factors, such as, for example, the number of new requests to purchase tickets received by the system, the duration that each pending request has been associated with a queue workflow or an in-process workflow, event information for the event, user information for one or more users  that transmitted the requests, other suitable factors, or two or more such factors. Although this disclosure describes a particular queue workflow comprising particular steps, this disclosure contemplates any suitable queue workflow comprising any suitable steps. Moreover, although this disclosure describes implementing a queue workflow in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates implementing a queue workflow in any suitable manner.","In particular embodiments, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets for an event with a termination workflow. A termination workflow may terminate, cancel, or deny a request to purchase tickets for an event and inform a user  that his request to purchase tickets to an event has been terminated, cancelled, or denied. As an example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets to an event from a user  with a termination workflow if there are no available tickets to the event. As another example and not by way of limitation, event management system  may associate a request to purchase tickets to an event from a user  with a termination workflow if the order success probability for the request is below a threshold determined by applying a probabilistic model. In particular embodiments, after associating a request to purchase tickets from a user  with a termination workflow, event management system  may transmit information to the user  that the event is sold out, that the user should submit a new request at a later time, that the number or type of tickets the request are not available, or other suitable information.

At step , event management system  may also decrement the current number of tickets available for the event in response to the first request being associated with an open in-process workflow. At step , event management system  may transmit ticket purchase information to the first user. The ticket purchase information may be received at a client system .
