{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation of International Application No. PCT\/CN2012\/079017, filed Jul. 23, 2012 and titled \u201cUSER STATUS DISPLAYING METHOD, DISPLAYING TERMINAL, AND SERVER\u201d, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201210004380.7, filed with the Chinese Patent Office on Jan. 9, 2012 and titled \u201cUSER STATUS DISPLAYING METHOD, DISPLAYING TERMINAL, AND SERVER\u201d, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.","The present disclosure relates to the communication field, and in particular, to a user status displaying method, a virtual image displaying terminal, and a virtual image server.","With the development of Internet services, people communicate with each other by using more and more diversified modes, from the conventional telephone, short message, and Email to recent instant messaging, micro-blogging, social networking services (SNS), and so on. The diversified communication modes provide more communication opportunities, but the communication effect is poorer than that of face-to-face communication.","To enhance interactivity, all network applications in the prior art provide user status displaying, including displaying a user mood and a virtual image. The user status is usually displayed in an address book, for example, in the address book on a mobile phone, in the address book of instant messaging software, in the user information of SNS, and in the user information of micro-blogging. The displaying is displaying of an image or a paragraph of texts, where the image includes a self-shot photo, a cartoon image, a scene, and so on, and the texts include the description about the user status. A user may manually replace the image or modify texts to adjust the user status. However, using the image and text content is far insufficient for displaying the particular mood and status of the user.","Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for displaying a user status and a server.","In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for displaying user status. The method includes: obtaining original information of a user from an information source which is an application, by calling an application programming interface (API) of the information source, wherein the original information comprises an identifier of the user in the information source, contents posted by the user in the original source; parsing the original information of the user, and obtaining user status information of the user; obtaining a virtual image of the user which matches the user status information from a virtual image database according to the user status information; and notifying a virtual image displaying terminal to display the virtual image of the user.","In another aspect, the present invention provides a virtual image server, which includes: an obtaining unit, configured to obtain original information of a user from an information source which is an application, by calling an application programming interface (API) of the information source, wherein the original information comprises an identifier of the user in the information source, contents posted by the user in the original source; a parsing unit, configured to parse the original information of the user, and obtain user status information of the user; a matching unit, configured to obtain a virtual image of the user which matches the user status information from a virtual image database according to the user status information obtained by the parsing unit; and a notifying unit, configured to notify a virtual image displaying terminal to display the virtual image of the user.","With the method for displaying user status according to some embodiments of the present invention, the virtual image reflects the mood and status of the real user to some extent, and provides a new means of self-expression for the user. In addition, in the tense modern life, friends can contact each other without using real-time phones or short messages, thereby saving communication time.","The following clearly and completely describes the technical solutions according to the embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of the present invention. Apparently, the embodiments in the following description are merely a part rather than all of the embodiments of the present invention. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the present invention without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"b":"101"},"Specifically, this step involves an original information obtaining unit and an information source. The original information obtaining unit is responsible for obtaining user related information from different information sources, and needs to adapt to the interface of the information source. For example, to obtain the speech content of a particular user from Sina micro-blogging, it is necessary to obtain the user original information according to the interface provided by Sina micro-blogging.","Optionally, the original information obtaining unit may be a part of the virtual image server, or a separate apparatus. The information source is an application in the Internet or a terminal. Any application which is open and from which user original information can be obtained may serve as an information source. The information source may be classified into two types: a passive type, which requires that the original information obtaining unit should perform active search and analysis to obtain the user status, and an active type, which actively reports the user original information to the original information obtaining unit after a user or a friend of the user actively updates the status.","As shown in , this step includes the following steps:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"b":"201"},"A timer may be set to start the collection task at an interval.

Examples of the user status information are the user ID, operation type (such as posting a topic on micro-blogging or posting a topic on a forum and commenting), and operation content keyword (for example, Dongmen, shopping, and happy). The structured user status information is sent to the virtual image server, so that the virtual image server matches a suitable virtual image according to the user status information. It should be noted that the structured user status information may be designed according to the requirement, and is not limited to the above structures. In addition, the used content extraction algorithm may also be other algorithms, and other text analysis technologies are used to improve accuracy of the analyzed content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"b":"103"},"The virtual image complies with the HTML5 standard, and includes three parts: multimedia content, for example, background image, multiple-layer foreground image, video, interactive image, and audio; JavaScript script and CSS script controlling the above multimedia content; and description (a group of tags) about the virtual image. The use of the above multimedia content by different virtual images varies. For example, only a picture is used, or a snow effect is added on the picture; a video is used; a picture and background music are used; or a cartoon segment is used.","The virtual image provides an uniform resource identifier (URI) for the user to access on the Internet, that is, if the above address is input in the browser, the content of the address can be played. Each URI corresponds to the minimum unit of the virtual image, which is called an image segment; each image segment expresses a certain topic (the topic is described by tags), and each segment can last a period.","Multiple segments of the same topic or similar topics constitute a group of virtual images, for example, in a group of virtual images whose topic is the cartoon character pleasant goat, some segments express the happy state, the angry state, or the sleeping state, and so on, which can be initially defined by the producer by using tags (the user may also modify the tags after subscription). Whether multiple image segments are within a group is specified by the producer or the user. Each group has a group ID. Therefore, when a subscriber to the virtual image shares the virtual image with friends, sharing can be performed in units of groups.","Different virtual images have different expressive force. For example, the facial emotion of a virtual person is suitable for displaying the happy, angry, and surprised states; the action of a virtual person is suitable for displaying the busy state; a picture of a rural scene is suitable for displaying the idle state; a cartoon animal image is suitable for displaying the lovely and amusing states.","The following table is an example of virtual image tags, where the number in brackets indicates the degree of matching between the tag and the content, and 1 indicates completely matching:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Virtual Image A","Virtual Image B","Virtual Image C"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Happy (0.9)","Running (1) and exercising (0.9)","Amusing (0.8)"]},{"entry":["Eating (0.8)","Sleeping (0.9), dreaming (0.6)","Angry (0.6)"]},{"entry":["Resting (0.9)","Busy (0.7)","Evening (0.8)"]},{"entry":["Sad (0.6), crying (0.7)","Affectionate (0.5)","Tour scene (0.4)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Optionally, the developer of virtual images packages and uploads the developed virtual images to the virtual image server. The virtual image server manages the uploaded virtual images, and establishes an index for tags of the virtual images for search.","Optionally, a user subscription step is also included. The user views and subscribes to virtual images by using the list, tags, and indexes of virtual images. Because each virtual image segment has special features, if the user wants to obtain a virtual image with strong expressive force, the user needs to subscribe to multiple virtual images. The virtual image server groups the virtual images subscribed to by the user. Each group includes one or more virtual images. Certainly, the user may intervene in the grouping process, and in this way, the virtual image server generates a URI for each group of virtual images. And the virtual image server returns the generated URI to the user for use. Optionally, the user may manage the virtual images, and the management includes: adding a tag, adjusting the displaying priority, adjusting the displaying time period, unsubscribing, manually modifying the user status, and so on. The user may send the virtual image URI to friends, and notify the friends of using the images, where a URI represents a group of virtual images. Thereby, the friends of the user can browse the user virtual images after inputting the URI in the browser. For example, the address book of the terminal of a friend integrates the virtual image displaying function; the URI is added to the address book of the terminal of the friend, and the specific user in the address book is bound with the group of virtual images. In this way, the user terminal may dynamically display the update of the user virtual images. After the user status information is updated, the virtual image server selects a suitable virtual image according to the correspondence and matching between the user status information and the virtual image tag.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"b":"104"},"After the user status information is updated, the virtual image server notifies, in a push mode, the virtual image displaying terminal of the change of the user status, matches the suitable virtual image according to the updated user status information, and notifies the virtual image displaying terminal of displaying the updated virtual image. Optionally, the virtual image displaying terminal may edit the user status information or affect the user status information by interacting with the interactive virtual image, and trigger the virtual image server to update the user virtual image. For example, when the virtual image is displayed on the terminal, the friend may touch or hit the virtual image, speak to the microphone, or throw the mobile phone (supported by a sensor), input a text, and so on. The interactive information of the friend is transferred to the server, and the server makes analysis and obtains a group of keywords, where the keywords further affect the status of the virtual image. For example, if the virtual image is a cartoon character and the friend \u201chits\u201d the face of the virtual image, the server analyzes the obtained touch screen action to obtain the \u201chit\u201d operation, and then drives the virtual image to play the crying voice.","Optionally, the terminal of the friend may actively query the current user status information from the virtual server, so as to trigger the virtual server to update the virtual image, or may also review the historical virtual image by inputting parameters such as a virtual image user ID and query time range.","With the user status displaying method according to the embodiment of the present invention, the virtual image reflects the mood and status of the real user to some extent, and provides a new means of self-expression for the user.

Optionally, the virtual image server may also allocate a group of virtual images to the user according to the user virtual image subscription request; after receiving the user virtual image update request, the virtual image server may select, according to the user status information, a virtual image matching the user status information from the group of virtual images as the current user virtual image, and return the virtual image to the receiving unit , so that the displaying unit  displays the virtual image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["501","502","503","504"]},"Specifically, the obtaining unit  is configured to obtain user original information from an information source; the parsing unit  is configured to parse the user original information obtained by the obtaining unit  and obtain user status information; and the matching unit  is configured to obtain a user virtual image matching the user status information from the virtual image database according to the user status information obtained by the parsing unit . The notifying unit  is configured to notify a virtual image displaying terminal so that the virtual image displaying terminal displays the user virtual image.","Optionally, a sending unit  is included, and configured to send a user identifier list to the obtaining unit , so that the obtaining unit  obtains the user original information from the information source according to the user identifier list.","Specifically, the sending unit  sends the user identifier list including an information source ID and the user ID registered on the information source by the user to the obtaining unit , and the obtaining unit  may be a separate apparatus or may also be a part of the virtual image server. The obtaining unit  calls, according to the obtained information source ID, the open application programming interface (API) of the information source, and inputs specific parameters according to API requirements of the information source, and thereby obtains the user original information from the information source through the API interface. The user original information may include the information such as the user identifier of the user on the information source, published article or contents, and publishing time. After obtaining the user original information from the information source, the obtaining unit  may send the original information to the parsing unit , so that the parsing unit  parses the user original information to obtain the user status information. Optionally, the obtaining unit  may also parse the obtained user original information to obtain the user status information and then return the user status information to the parsing unit .","Optionally, a subscribing unit  is included, and configured to subscribe to user virtual images. A user may perform virtual image search, subscribing, grouping, and so on through the subscribing unit ; the subscribing unit  performs grouping management for the virtual images subscribed to by the user and provides the images for the user to use. The matching unit  selects, according to the user status information, a virtual image matching the user status information from the group of virtual images allocated by the subscribing unit to the user as the current user virtual image, and notifies, through the notifying unit , the virtual image displaying terminal of displaying the current user virtual image.","The virtual image server in the embodiment of the present invention may provide virtual image management, subscribing, and matching. The virtual image reflects the mood and status of the real user to some extent, and provides a new means of self-expression for the user. In addition, in the tense modern life, friends can contact each other without using real-time phones or short messages, thereby saving communication time. Meanwhile, as the Internet has a deeper impact on people's life, people's online life becomes an increasingly important part of their life apart from the offline life. Facing different friend groups, people require different incarnations to represent themselves, and multiple virtual images of a person meet the requirement.","Persons of ordinary skill in the art should understand that all or a part of the processes of the methods in the embodiments may be implemented by a computer program instructing relevant hardware.
