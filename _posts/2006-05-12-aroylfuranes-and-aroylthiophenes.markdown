Although a variety of drugs against neoplastic diseases have been developed and techniques are available such as surgery and radiation therapy, there is still a need for alternative and improved methods of treatment of neoplastic diseases.","Autoimmune diseases are associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often, such diseases are associated with inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and the like. The treatment of such diseases is focused on anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs which in numerous cases show severe side effects. Hence, there is a need for alternative drugs with a new mode of action showing less side effects.","Apoptosis is a term used to describe a series of cellular events which occur to bring about programmed cell death. There are various apoptotic pathways, some of which have been characterized, whereas others remain to be elucidated. If the balance between cell division and apoptosis is disturbed, life-threatening diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases may occur.","In recent years it has become evident that programmed cell death (apoptosis) is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair, surplus or even harmful cells are generated. In order to maintain tissue homeostasis these cells have to be removed or killed. The delicate interplay between cell growth and apoptosis in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division, arrests in the cell cycle or commits to programmed cell death.","Dysregulation of cell proliferation, or lack of appropriate cell death, has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation, inflammation, tissue remodeling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers, restenosis, neointimal hyperplasia, angiogenesis, endometriosis, lymphoproliferative disorders, transplantation related pathologies (graft rejection), polyposis, loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodeling and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division, and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.","As apoptosis is inhibited or delayed in most types of proliferative, neoplastic diseases, induction of apoptosis is an option for treatment of cancer, especially in cancer types which show resistance to classic chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy (Apoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy, Hickman and Dive, eds., Blackwell Publishing, 1999). Also in autoimmune and transplantation related diseases and pathologies compounds inducing apoptosis may be used to restore normal cell death processes and therefore can eradicate the symptoms and might cure the diseases. Further applications of compounds inducing apoptosis may be in restenosis, i.e. accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries, and in persistent infections caused by a failure to eradicate bacteria- and virus-infected cells. Furthermore, apoptosis can be induced or re-established in epithelial cells, in endothelial cells, in muscle cells, and in others which have lost contact with extracellular matrix. These cells are potentially able to colonize other organs and therefore can develop into pathologies like neoplasias, endometriosis and the like.","Substituted 2-(phenyl-, pyridyl- or pyrimidyl-carbonyl)-furanes and -thiophenes of formula (I) and related phenoxy\/phenylthio-acetophenones and corresponding heterocyclic compounds of formula (II) are selectively inducing apoptosis in cancer cells, and can be used for the treatment of neoplastic and autoimmune diseases.

Suitable tumor cell lines are A20.2J, a BALB\/c B cell lymphoma, PB-3c, an IL-3 dependent, non tumorigenic mastocyte line isolated from the bone marrow of a DBA\/2 mouse, Jurkat, a human acute T cell leukemia cell line, K562, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL60, a human acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, Ramos and Raji, human B-cell lymphoma cell lines, Hg and Hut78, human T-cell lymphoma cell lines, HeLa and KB, human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, MCF7, SK-BR-3, PC3, HBL-100, SW480, H460 and H1792, human adenocarcinoma cell lines and HT-1080, a human fibrosarcoma cell line.","Preferred standard drugs as compounds for comparisons are: a) antimetabolites such as 5-fluorouracil (ICN), gemcitabine HCl (Gemzar\u2122, Eli Lilly), b) alkylating agents such as oxaliplatin (Eloxantin\u2122, Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo), dacarbazin (Detimedac\u2122, Medac), cyclo-phosphamide (Endoxan\u2122, Asta) and carboplatin (Paraplatin\u2122, Bristol-Meyers Squibb), c) cell-cycle inhibitor such as vinorelbine (Navelbine\u2122, Robapharm), vinblastine (Velbe\u2122, Eli Lilly), docetaxel (Taxotere\u2122, Aventis), d) DNA breaker (topo-isomerase inhibitor, intercalator, strand breaker) such as doxorubicin HCl (Adriblastin\u2122, Pharmacia-Upjohn), bleomycin (Asta-Medica), irinotecan (Campto\u2122, Aventis), etoposide phosphate (Etopophos\u2122, Bristol-Meyers Squibb), topotecan HCl, (Hycamtin\u2122, GlaxoSmithKline), e) mixtures thereof, f) compounds interfering with the signal transduction pathway, such as caspase activity modifiers, agonists and antagonists of cell death receptors, modifiers of nucleases, phosphatases and kinases such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec\u2122, Novartis), dexamethasone, phorbol myristate acetate, cyclosporin A, quercetin, tamoxifen (Alexis Corporation, Switzerland).","Apoptosis is determined in a primary screen using a fluorescence plate reader and then in a secondary screen using FACS (fluorescence activated cell scanning). Compounds causing apoptosis without substantial cytotoxic side effects are chosen for further testing and characterization by using a combination of the following well established assays:","A) Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 dye providing information about nuclear morphology and DNA fragmentation which are hallmarks of apoptosis. B) MTS proliferation assay measuring the metabolic activity of cells. Viable cells are metabolically active whereas cells with compromised respiratory chain show a reduced activity in this test. C) AnnexinV binding assay which reflects the phosphatidylserine content of the outer lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. This event is considered an early hallmark of apoptosis. D) PI staining for cell cycle distribution which shows any alterations in the distribution among the different phases of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arresting points can be determined. E) Proliferation assay monitoring DNA synthesis by incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Inhibitory effects on growth\/proliferation can be directly determined. F) Cystein proteinase dependency, respectively caspase dependency are determined by using specific inhibitors. This provides information about possible involvement of specific proteases in the mechanisms.","On the basis of these studies, a compound of formula (I) and of formula (II) according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against neoplastic diseases and autoimmune diseases.

It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.","The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference books for peptide synthesis and in special books on protective groups such as J. F. W. McOmie, \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in \u201cMethoden der organischen Chemie\u201d (Methods of organic chemistry), Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15\/I, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, and in T. W. Greene, \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d, Wiley, New York.","In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned hereinabove under \u201cprotecting groups\u201d. The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.","In the conversion of an obtainable compound of formula (I) or of formula (II) into another compound of formula (I) or of formula (II), an amino group may be alkylated or acylated to give the correspondingly substituted compounds. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation, diazomethane may be used. Alkylation may also be performed with an aldehyde under reducing conditions. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride is preferred. Alternatively, an acid anhydride may be used, or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry, e.g. with activating agents for the carboxy group, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co-reagents. Furthermore amine may be transformed into heteroaryl and heterocyclyl under reaction conditions typical for such cyclizations.","A hydroxy group, e.g. a hydroxy group R, a hydroxy group in the ring A or a hydroxy group as the substituent R, may be alkylated (etherified) or acylated (esterified) to give the correspondingly substituted compounds in a procedure related to the one described for an amino group. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation, diazomethane may be used. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride or acid anhydride may be used, or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid and a suitable activating agent.","Reduction of a nitro group in a nitro-substituted aryl or heteroaryl group to give the corresponding amino group is done, e.g., with iron powder in alcohol or with other reducing agents.","A carboxy group in a carboxy-substituted aryl or heteroaryl group may be amidated under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry, e.g. with the corresponding amine and an activating agent for the carboxy group, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co-reagents.","A chloro, bromo or iodo substitutent in an aryl or heteroaryl group may be replaced by phenyl or a phenyl derivative by reaction with a suitable phenylboronic acid in a Suzuki reaction as described under method Cd).","In the conversion of a compound of formula (II) into another compound of formula (II) using the aforementioned reaction conditions, care must be taken not to submit the compounds to basic conditions, because otherwise the compound of formula (II) will cyclize to give a corresponding compound of formula (I) in a reaction corresponding to process A), D) or G).","Salts of a compound of formula (I) or of formula (II) with a salt-forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula (I) or of formula (II) may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.","Salts can usually be converted to free compounds, e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents, for example with alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal hydrogencarbonates, or alkali metal hydroxides, typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.","It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.","All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralising agents, for example ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, for example in the H form, depending on the type of reaction and\/or reactants at reduced, normal, or elevated temperature, for example in the range from \u2212100\u00b0 C. to about 190\u00b0 C., preferably from about \u221280\u00b0 C. to about 150\u00b0 C., for example at \u221280 to +60\u00b0 C., at \u221220 to +40\u00b0 C., at room temperature, or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where appropriate under pressure, and\/or in an inert atmosphere, for example under argon or nitrogen.","Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients, if these contain salt-forming groups.

The assays are being performed in commercially available 96 or 384 well flat bottom clear microtiter plates (Greiner, Germany) respectively, which are suitable for tissue culture techniques. A defined number of EGFP transfected adherent test cells (96 well plates: 10-10, 384 well plates: 1500-2*10) are plated out 24 h before treatment either in 75 \u03bcl (96 well plates) or 60 \u03bcl (384 well plates) complete medium per well in order to ensure appropriate cell spreading. For this purpose a peristaltic pump (e.g. Multidrop by Thermo-Labsystems, Finland) or another suitable device is used. Cells in suspension are plated out according to the same procedure but 1 h prior to treatment. Between seeding out and treatment or addition of compounds the cells are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. under 7.5% CO. Subsequently, the compounds under investigation are added at defined concentrations (40-80 \u03bcM in either 25 \u03bcl (96 well plates) or 20 \u03bcl (384 well plates) complete medium containing max 4% DMSO) with an appropriate device (e.g. liquid handling system, multi channel pipette etc.) resulting in a final concentration in the test well of 10-20 \u03bcM compound in max 1% DMSO.","Immediately after the addition of the compounds to the cells the zero fluorescence value (t=0 h) is determined by using a fluorescence microplate reader in order to be able to normalize the fluorescence activities. Afterwards, the test plates are further incubated for a total of 48 h at 37\u00b0 C. under 7.5% COand are shortly removed only for the purpose of measurement at 8 h, 24 h and 48 h, respectively.","Relative fluorescence activities of EGFP in compound treated test cells in relation to control cells and cells treated with standard drugs are measured by using a BMG Fluostar microplate fluorescence reader equipped with a filter pair for excitation\/emission at 485 nm\/520 nm. The optimum signal to noise ratio is detected by using the time-resolved mode of measurement with a delay of 20 \u03bcs and an integration time over 1 ms. The gain is adjusted in such a way that the control cells produce a fluorescence activity of 90% of the maximum. Kinetics is performed by measuring the relative fluorescence activities at t=0 h, 8 h, 24 h and 48 h. Crude fluorescence activities are individually normalized for different cell numbers and various optical activities of the test compounds\/plate-wells by dividing each value from t=8 h, 24 h and 48 h by the value of t=0 h resulting in E(8), E(24) and E(48) values. Subsequently, the E(x) values are further processed by forming the inverse (Q-value) of the products E(8)*E(24)*E(48) which result in numbers>1 for apoptotic\/necrotic activities of the compounds and numbers<1 for proliferative activities of the compounds. Controls (untreated) show values similar to 1. Compounds producing Q values>2 are being considered relevant in terms of apoptotic\/necrotic activity and are subsequently tested in the secondary screening setup.","All the manipulations are performed under sterile conditions. The assays are being performed in case of adherent cells in commercially available 24 well flat bottom tissue culture plates (Greiner, Germany) and in case of suspension cells in polypropylene tubes (P-tubes) 1.4 ml (Matrix, UK), respectively.","Adherent test cells: 2*10-4*10of EGFP transfected cells in 0.5 ml complete medium are plated out 24 h before treatment.

Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl complete medium containing the test compound in max. 5% DMSO is added resulting in final concentrations of 20 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 3 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM and 0.3 \u03bcM of the test compounds, respectively. After 48 h incubation the cells are harvested and analyzed with fluorescence activated cell scanning device (FACSCalibur\u2122, BD Biosciences) according to standard procedures.","Suspension cells: 10test cells in 450 \u03bcl complete medium are pipetted into P-tubes. 50 \u03bcl complete medium containing the compounds (see adherent cells) is added immediately. After 48 h of incubation the test cells are analyzed directly on a FACSCalibur\u2122.","By monitoring the EGFP fluorescence activity in FL1 on a FACSCalibur\u2122, it is possible to distinguish between proliferating cells, apoptotic cells and necrotic cells within the same cell population. The proliferating cells show a high GFP fluorescence activity, the apoptotic population shows an intermediate fluorescence activity whereas the necrotic cells demonstrate a residual fluorescence activity comparable to mock-transfected cells. Within the CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences) three regions are defined in the histogram: M1 comprising the proliferating cells, M2 comprising the apoptotic cell population and M3 comprising the necrotic cell population. As readout the relative abundance of the cells belonging either to M1, M2 or M3 are expressed. Compounds inducing M2 values>50% and M3 values<30% are being considered relevant and are further tested and characterized in the tertiary\/advanced screening setup.","A) Hoechst 33342 Nuclear Staining","This assay is performed in 96 well tissue culture plates. Appropriate number of cells (adherent cells: 3-5*10, suspension cells: 8-10*10) are being seeded out in 80 \u03bcl complete medium. Adherent cells are incubated for 24 h for proper spreading out before addition of test compounds while suspension cells are immediately treated with test compounds after seeding out. The test compounds are added in 20 \u03bcl complete medium containing max 5% DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are in the range of 0.001 \u03bcM-10 \u03bcM.

plates. The cells (range: 1.5*10-10) are seeded out in 80 \u03bcl complete medium 24 h prior to compound treatment. The test compounds are added in 20 \u03bcl complete medium containing max 5% DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are in the range of 0.001 \u03bcM-10 \u03bcM. The assay plates are incubated for 72 h at culture conditions. The MTS reagent is prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega G1111). 20 \u03bcl MTS reagent are added to each well; the assay plates are quickly spun and incubated for another 3 h at culture conditions. Subsequently, the plates are shortly shaked and absorption measured with a microplate-reader at 492 nm. ICvalues are determined by graphical analysis and are indicated in the Table 12.

plates and incubated for 24 h prior to compound addition. Compounds are added for 24 h in a final concentration of 3 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM. Adherent cells are harvested by trypsinization. The cell suspensions are fixed by adding 2 parts ice cold ethanol 100% while vortexing. Then the samples are stored for >2 h at \u221220\u00b0 C. Subsequently the cells are washed with PBS once and resuspended in 250 \u03bcl PBS containing 50 \u03bcg\/ml PI (Calbiochem #537059), then the samples are incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed on a FACSCalibur\u2122 monitoring linear PI fluorescence activity on FL2. The readout allows the detection of a possible direct or indirect influence of the tested compounds on the cell cycle. All active compounds of formula (I) and formula (II) arrest cell population in G2M phase. In this assay compounds have shown activity at concentrations as low as 20 nM.","D) Mitochondrial Membrane Potential","This assay is performed in 96 well tissue culture plates. Appropriate number of cells (adherent cells: 3-5*10, suspension cells: 8-10*10) are being seeded out in 80 \u03bcl complete medium. Adherent cells are incubated for 24 h for proper spreading out before addition of test compounds while suspension cells are immediately treated with test compounds after seeding out. The test compounds are added in 20 \u03bcl complete medium containing max 5% DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are in the range of 0.001 \u03bcM-10 \u03bcM dependent on the potency of the compounds under investigation. After 24 h or 48 h incubation at culture conditions, 10 \u03bcl medium containing JC-1 (Molecular Probes, T-3168) at 2-5 \u03bcg\/ml are added to each well. The assay plates are then further incubated for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed with a standard inverted fluorescence microscope by using the FITC and TRITC filters. Cells with an intact mitochondrial membrane potential (mmp) show an orange staining (visualized with the TRITC filter) while cells with a perturbed or missing mmp demonstrate a green staining (visualized with the FITC filter).","The readout allows the determination of the fraction of cells which show a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential strongly indicating an apoptotic cell death as a function of the treatment.
