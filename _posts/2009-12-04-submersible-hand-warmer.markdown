title: Submersible hand warmer
abstract: The invention is a submersible hand warmer apparatus for warming a diver's gloved hands. The apparatus includes a sleeve having a center portion with an elongate chamber with a right access port and a left access port; and right and left sleeve portions with elastic cuffs. The cuffs can be stretched allowing the diver's gloved hands access to the chamber, and then retract, forming a seal against the diver's arms. The chamber is sized for enough heat transfer fluid, such as water, so that the temperature of the diver's hands is raised to at least 54Â° F. upon immersion of his hands in the water. The apparatus also includes a heating component; an energy source, such as a battery; a housing which provides structural support; an insulation that slows the loss of heat to the cold ambient water; and a controller that controls the rate that energy is consumed.

Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to scuba diving equipment, and in particular to a submersible hand warmer, which is an apparatus that improves a diver's manual dexterity in underwater operations in frigid water.","2. Prior Art","Dry Suits, such as the variable volume dry suit (VVDS) have proven to be effective in keeping divers warm in near-freezing water. It is typically constructed of \u00bc-inch closed-cell neoprene with nylon backing on both sides. Boots are provided as an integral part of the suit, but the hood and three finger gloves are usually separate. The suit is entered by means of a water- and pressure-proof zipper. Inflation is controlled using inlet and outlet valves which are fitted into the suit. Air is supplied from a pressure reducer on an auxiliary cylinder or from the emergency gas supply or the scuba bottle. About 0.2 actual cubic foot of air is required for normal inflation. Because of this inflation, slightly more weight than would be used with a wet suit must be carried. Normally, thermal underwear is worn under the suit for insulation.","Gloves are an essential item of protective clothing. They can be made of leather, cloth, or rubber, depending upon the degree and type of protection required. Gloves shield the hands from cuts and chafing, and provide protection from cold water. Some styles are designed to have insulating properties but they limit the diver's dexterity. Wet or dry suits can be worn with hoods, gloves, boots, or hard-soled shoes depending upon conditions. If the diver will be working under conditions where the suit may be easily torn or punctured, the diver should be provided with additional protection such as coveralls or heavy canvas chafing gear.","While dry suits protect a diver's torso, arms, and legs in cold water diving, they don't provide adequate thermal protection for the diver's hands. A diver's hands are the first to be impacted during exposures in frigid water. Inevitably, the diver's ability to perform meaningful work is greatly reduced during the exposure to cold as the diver's tactile sensitivity diminishes.","An apparatus that enables a diver to warm his hands, therein restoring manual dexterity and preventing tissue damage would be very useful to the diver, both psychologically and physiologically.","The invention provides for a submersible hand warmer, which is an apparatus that enables a diver to warm his hands and gloves periodically during the dive. The submersible hand warmer has a sleeve covered chamber with a right access port and a left access port. The chamber contains a heat transfer fluid, usually water, that is relatively warmer than the cold ambient water, and the diver's hands and gloves are immersed in the warmer fluid when the diver positions them in the chamber. The diver's hands and gloves come into contact with other elements of the submersible hand warmer, but the heat transfer fluid provides almost all of the heat to the diver. The heat transfer fluid is substantially water, which is safe, effective as it has a high heat capacity, and it is readily available.","An aspect of the invention is that the submersible hand warmer has a sleeve with a center sleeve portion, a right sleeve portion with a right cuff and a left sleeve portion with a left cuff, where both the right cuff and the left cuff are elastic. The cuffs can stretch circumferentially to allow for the driver's hands and gloves to slide through the cuffs into the chamber through the access ports. The right cuff retracts forming a right seal between the diver's right arm and the right cuff, which serves to retain the warm water in the chamber. Likewise, the left cuff retracts forming a left seal between the diver's left arm and the left cuff.","Another aspect of the invention is that the submersible hand warmer has an insulation which insulates the chamber, a heating component that warms the water, and an energy source that provides the energy for the heating component. The submersible hand warmer is substantially adiabatic in that not only is the heat from the heating component captured, but also any incidental heat generated by the energy source is captured. For example, a battery generates a finite amount of incidental heat in the course of generating an electrical current. In most systems this incidental heat is dissipated. In the instant invention the heat is captured, therein improving the efficiency of the apparatus, approaching a system that is substantially adiabatic. The incidental heat and heat from the heating component warm the water in the chamber. The resulting warm heat transfer fluid is ultimately used to warm the diver's hands when they are immersed in the warm water. Upon warming the diver regains his manual dexterity.","Another aspect of the invention is that the chamber has a volume to hold a sufficient amount of water to warm the diver's hands and gloves to a temperature that is warm enough to provide immediate relief from the very cold ambient water. A target temperature for the warm water is at least about 54\u00b0 F., so as to avoid tissue damage during long exposures-non-freezing cold injury of the extremities, which can occur during cold water exposures below 54\u00b0 F. (12\u00b0 C.). A further aspect of the invention is that the volume is not so large as to require a wasteful amount of energy. Prior to use in the frigid water the submersible hand warmer can be pre-warmed utilizing an external energy source to warm the water in the chamber. Pre-warming eliminates any delay caused by starting the heating with frigid water, pre-warming warms all the elements of the submersible hand warmer, and pre-warming augments the energy source.","The invention provides for a submersible hand warmer, which is an apparatus that enables a diver to warm his hands and gloves while underwater. The hand warmer is portable, and can be easily carried by the diver.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","74","74","12","70","70","12","1","8","10","26","26","12","24","24","2","3","4","12"]},"The right sleeve portion  extends from the right access port  with a right elastic cuff , and the left sleeve portion \u2032 extends from the left access port \u2032 with a left elastic cuff \u2032. Both cuffs can stretch allowing the diver's gloved hands access to the chamber . After the diver has moved his gloved hands into the chamber the cuffs retract, forming at least a partial seal against the diver's right arm and left arm ,\u2032.","There is a heating component  which is in contact with the heat transfer fluid , and the heating component  warms the heat transfer fluid to at least 54\u00b0 F. There is an energy source  that can provide sufficient energy to the heating component  to heat the heat transfer fluid to at least 54\u00b0 F. in a matter of minutes.","The submersible hand warmer apparatus  typically includes a housing  which provides structural support for the apparatus, and a layer of insulation  (which can be a part of the sleeve ) that slows the loss of heat to cold ambient water, and a controller  (not shown in this figure) that controls the rate of'energy used by the heating component. The rate that energy is consumed is a factor that is determinative of the temperature of the heat transfer fluid.","Table 1 shown in  illustrates the time temperature relationship at various wattages to heat 0.85 liters of water. The water temperature can be elevated from 35\u00b0 F. to 60\u00b0 F. in as little as 6 minutes with a 150 watt heater, 8-9 minutes with a 100 watt heater, and 18 minutes with a 50 watt heater. The heating response is shortened as the energy, in this example\u2014wattage, is increased or the volume of water in the chamber is reduced. If allowed to continue, the water temperature inside the hand warmer would continue to rise to potentially unsafe temperatures unless cold ambient water is allowed to enter, for instance, by the diver removing his hands from the hand warmer or by employing a feedback controller that reduces the heat at a set-point.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","80"]},"The right end of the elliptical pipe serves as a right access port to the chamber, and the left end of the pipe serves as a left access port to the chamber. The elliptical housing is covered with the sleeve  forming the apparatus  illustrated in . Sleeve  has a center portion  covering the housing (flattened pipe); a right sleeve portion  extending from the right access port with a right elastic cuff ; and a left sleeve portion extending from the left access port with a left elastic cuff \u2032. The overall outside length of the sleeve  is the sum of lines \u2032++. The right elastic cuff  and the left elastic cuff \u2032 can stretch allowing the diver's gloved hands access to the chamber.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["82","8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","16","12","90","92"]},"The energy source  for the illustrated submersible hand warmer is a battery pack. Typically, the batteries are rechargeable. The energy source is selected in part because it must be able to function properly in a pressurized underwater environment. A battery may also be selected for tactical considerations, for instance how well it will store for long periods. A brief discussion of different batteries follows. Nickel Cadmium (NiCd)\u2014mature and well understood but relatively low in energy density. NiCd is used where long life, high discharge rate and economical price are important. Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH)\u2014has a higher energy density compared to the NiCd at the expense of reduced cycle life. NiMH contains no toxic metals. Lead Acid\u2014most economical for larger power applications where weight is of little concern. Lithium Ion (Li-ion)\u2014fastest growing battery system. Li-ion has high-energy density and light weight. Reusable Alkaline\u2014suitable for low-power applications, and limited cycle life. On the plus side they have low self-discharge, making this battery ideal for long storage applications. The selection of the appropriate battery for a specific application is well within the capabilities of one skilled in the art.","The housing is covered with a layer of insulation . The insulation may be built into the center sleeve . The illustrated version has a controller  that controls the rate of energy received by the heating component , and therein controls the temperature of the heat transfer fluid. The controller can be a feedback controller, such as an On\/Off Controller (controller switches On\/Off only when the temperature of the heat transfer fluid as measured by said temperature sensor crosses a setpoint), a Proportional Controller (controller decreases the average power supplied to the heater as the temperature of the heat transfer fluid approaches the setpoint), a PID controller (provides proportional with integral and derivative control\u2014sometimes referred to as autotune controllers), and other feedback controllers. The illustrated feedback controller  compares the temperature detected by the thermal sensor  with the setpoint, and adjusts the energy (current) appropriately. The setpoint is the desired value in a closed-loop feedback system. In the illustrated embodiment the thermal sensor  is located at the bottom of the chamber , where water would normally come into contact with the sensor first. The thermal sensor  includes thermocouples, thermistors, and the like.","The controller  is in electrical communication with a recharging jack . The recharging jack  enables the use of an external power source to recharge the batteries and to pre-condition (warm) the submersible hand warmer and the water in the chamber. Prior to use in frigid water, the submersible hand warmer would be pre-warmed utilizing an external energy source. Pre-warming eliminates any delay caused by starting the heating with frigid water. Pre-warming warms all the elements of the submersible hand warmer apparatus, and pre-warming supplements the energy source. The submersible hand warmer apparatus may also have an illuminated display  that provides a calculated estimate of a remaining operational percentage of energy or time, a projection based on the rate that energy is being consumed. The submersible hand warmer apparatus also has an on\/off switch  to activate or end heating.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["14","14","50","50"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["1","54","56","54","58","56","54","12","24","30","26","30","26","10","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["1","1","62","60","62","64"]},"Finally, any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations (for example, by using the term \u201cabout\u201d) that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention.
