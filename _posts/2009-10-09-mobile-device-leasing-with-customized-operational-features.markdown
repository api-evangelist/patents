{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject innovation relates to wireless communications and, more particularly, to supplying a mobile device under a lease agreement with utilization management and lessor's asset(s) protection.","As rapidly evolving multi-functional mobile devices such as smartphones become the dominant type of employed device in the wireless marketplace, both network operators and customers face similar difficult decisions. At the network operator end, a business determination is to be made as to whether cost of the user equipment is to be heavily subsidized under the expectation of recouping such cost over the term of a contracted service plan. At the customer end, an adoption threshold, or \u201cfear of commitment,\u201d is to be overcome in order for the customer to spend $200-400 for a mobile device which they must contractually commit to exclusively for a substantial contract term. The issue of \u201cfear of commitment\u201d can lead inevitably to a certain set of subscribers selecting lower-cost mobile devices with lesser functional features and thus being under-served, with ensuing low perceived quality of service or dissatisfaction with wireless experience and, by association, with the network operator that offers the service. As a corollary of such under-served subscribers, the network operator develops to a limited extent the actual potential for revenue generation of such subscribers. Moreover, dissatisfaction or even sub-optimal satisfaction with a subscribed mobile device can increase potential for detrimental subscriber attrition. It should be appreciated that in a service scenario arising from fear of commitment, not only is the under-served subscriber locked into a fixed term contract, e.g., two-year contract, but the operator is locked into the potential, or lack thereof, of the subscribed mobile device for the contract term thus limiting revenue potential of the served subscriber. Conventional strategies implemented by network operators such as user equipment upgrades during a contract term are merely palliative solutions that fail to avert fear of commitment and associated subscriber attrition and underdeveloped revenue generation potential, and have detrimental impact on profitability to the network operator due to costs associated with user equipment subsidies prior to contact expiration.","The following presents a simplified summary of the innovation in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the invention nor delineate the scope of the innovation. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter.","The subject innovation provides system(s), device(s), and method(s) to supply a device that accesses and utilizes resources in a wireless network under a lease agreement. A system functionally coupled to an access network configures the lease agreement and provisions the device accordingly. As part of lease configuration, the system collects generates service unit bank(s) that enable service utilization and provides a customized operational profile that enables custom configuration of service in the device. The device can receive lessee-specific operational profile(s) and lease agreement term(s), and can regulate a lease agreement through monitoring of service unit bank(s). If the lease agreement expires, the device can lock at least a portion of the functionality of the device and provide an environment to renew the lease agreement. In the absence of renewal and if the device is not returned, the system pursues various asset protection mechanism(s), which includes assessment of recovery fees and tracking location of the device. Returned device is commissioned for a new lease agreement, wherein commissioning includes removal of data, call records, and applications utilized by previous lessee. Synchronization of lessee-specific operational profiles amongst device and the system, or network external to the system, can be accomplished at least in part through at least one of a femtocell network or a macrocell network. The lease agreement can be provided with leasing incentives or customized to a specific subscriber.","It should be appreciated that aspects, features, or advantages of the subject innovation are network and technology agnostic, and can be exploited in substantially any network, mobile or otherwise, and through any wireless telecommunication, or radio, technology.

Data and signaling streams can be packetized or frame-based flows. It is noted that context in the subject specification generally distinguishes among a base station that provides outdoor wireless coverage and a home access point (e.g., femtocell AP) that provides indoor wireless coverage; explicit distinction between indoor-serving AP and outdoor-serving base station is made when context may be insufficient to distinguish the utilized terms.","Furthermore, the terms \u201cuser,\u201d \u201csubscriber,\u201d \u201ccustomer,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d \u201cprosumer,\u201d and the like are employed interchangeably throughout the subject specification, unless context warrants particular distinction(s) among the terms. The term \u201cactor\u201d can refer to a subscriber or a lessee of a network operator, or telecommunication carrier. It should be appreciated that such terms can refer to human entities or automated components supported through artificial intelligence (e.g., a capacity to make inference based on complex mathematical formalisms) which can provide simulated vision, sound recognition and so forth. When utilized herein, the term \u201cprosumer\u201d indicates one of the following contractions: professional-consumer and producer-consumer.","The term \u201cintelligence\u201d as utilized herein with respect to a network refers to substantially any, or any, information that characterizes a wireless network or non-mobile network such as for example, coverage area(s), operation marketplace(s), subscriber information, service offerings and associated promotional and advertising campaigns, commercial (e.g., sales, earnings, operational margins, costs) and non-commercial (e.g., community outreach, philanthropy . . . ) activities involving offered services or products, or the like. Similarly, when the term \u201cintelligence\u201d is applied to a lessee or subscriber, it refers to commercial and non-commercial information available for the subscriber.","As described in greater detail below, the subject innovation provides system(s), device(s), and method(s) that supply a device that accesses and utilizes resources in a wireless network under a lease agreement. A system functionally coupled to an access network configures the lease agreement and provisions the device accordingly. As part of lease configuration, the system collects generates service unit bank(s) that enable service utilization and provides a customized operational profile that enables custom configuration of service in the device. The device can receive lessee-specific operational profile(s) and lease agreement term(s), and can regulate a lease agreement through monitoring of service unit bank(s). If the lease agreement expires, the device can lock at least a portion of the functionality of the device and provide an environment to renew the lease agreement. In the absence of renewal and if the device is not returned, the system pursues various asset protection mechanism(s), which assessment of recovery fees and tracking location of the device. Returned device is commissioned for a new lease agreement, wherein commissioning includes removal of data, call records, and applications utilized by previous lessee. Synchronization of lessee-specific operational profiles amongst device and the system, or network external to the system, can be accomplished at least in part through at least one of a femtocell network or a macrocell network. The lease agreement can be provided with leasing incentives or customized to a specific subscriber.","Various aspects or features of the subject innovation are illustrated with reference to a leased mobile device, which can include refurbished or returned-after-purchase devices, and novelty devices that support new capabilities or services. Mobile devices can include multi-functional, programmable smartphones (e.g., Apple\u00ae iPhone, G1 running on Android operating system, BlackBerry\u00ae products . . . ), or portable computers (e.g., notebooks) with built-in communication platforms for telecommunication, such as third-generation (3G) or fourth-generation (4G) modems and other suitable circuitry. It is noted, however, that most any or any device that accesses and utilizes resources on a wireless network can be provisioned and operated under a lease agreement in accordance with aspects of the subject innovation. As an example, copier\/scanner or fax machine with wireless communication functionality can be provided under lease agreement; customized operational features included in operational profile associated with such device can include contact list(s) of users of the copier\/scanner or fax, preferences for toner or paper size, etc. As another example, industrial devices that can execute customized operations also can be provided under a lease agreement in accordance with aspects described herein.","Aspects and features of the subject innovation provides various advantages with respect to conventional contracted wireless service subscription, such as the following. From the lessee perspective.\u2014(i) Ability to test a mobile device before making a significant monetary purchase; thus, fear of commitment is substantially averted. (ii) Ability to lease a device from a competing telecommunication carrier to evaluate network reliability compared to a current network operator, while preserving substantially all custom features retained in operation profile(s) retained by lessee. (iii) Capacity to provide a leased mobile device as a courtesy for a predetermined period of time. (iv) Ability to access a device with capabilities beyond those of lessee's current device for a specific period of time, e.g., lessee travels on domestic vacation and desires or needs immediate access to personal mail account and configured calendar. (v) Substantive satisfaction of technophile segment of prospective lessees, to whom access to latest technology is deemed a necessity; such prospective lessee have access to a set of novelty devices on a temporary basis without long-term commitment; fear of commitment is thus circumvented. (vi) Transferability of mobile number provisioned to leased device during the term of a lease and recurrent renewals; a disparate mobile number also can be forwarded to leased device. (vi) Retention and automatic synchronization of lessee's custom operational profile(s); substantive reduction in adoption threshold for segment of prospective lessee with limited literacy related to mobile devices.","From the network operator perspective.\u2014(1) Unique service offering compared to competing telecommunication carrier, with ensuing increased operator reputation. (2) Upsell on higher feature content devices by lessees being able to test before purchase, with resulting increase in average revenue per user\/unit (ARPU.) (3) Opportunity to market to subscribers of competing network operators with lure of enhanced network reliability or unique device, with increased gross customer acquisitions. (4) Flexibility to offer device rentals as a courtesy of recurring gift, which can drive gross subscriber acquisitions. (5) Retention opportunity for subscribers unsatisfied with currently subscribed mobile device and either not yet out of current contract or out of contract and procuring alternative network operators; thus, subscriber attrition can be reduced. (6) Increased accessory sales from lessees changing\/trailing user equipment with increased frequency; thus, increased revenue. (7) Retention and automatic synchronization of custom device user profiles, or operational profiles, can differentiate various network operators offering similar services. Increased configuration versatility can attract wireless customers, who are generally more attracted, and likely loyal to, the network operator that delivers most simplified and user-friendly device rental experience. Leasing program described herein can promote real loyalty in a fashion that fixed-term contracts fail to accomplish. Lessee customized operational also can simplify subscriber adoption of novel product(s) or service(s), which increases revenue potential for network operator, rather than having subscribers spending time to re-configure new devices for old services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100"]},"Leasing platform  processes a request to lease a mobile device (e.g., ) and grants or declines a lease agreement. For a granted lease agreement, or rental, leasing platform  can configure the lease agreement and provision the leased mobile device. In addition, leasing platform  protects lessor's asset(s) through various mechanism(s), which can include financial safeguards and tracking of leased device location. Leasing platform  also facilitates or enables revenue retention and generation. Term(s) of a lease agreement and lessee information, such as a lessee account, lessee intelligence, or leased service units, can be retained in memory .","In the subject innovation, information or payload within signaling , and directive(s), request(s), or indication(s) conveyed therein, can be embodied, for example, in one or more reserved bits in a packet header, a light-payload (e.g., of the order of 1 byte) data packet, a predetermined multi-bit word conveyed in a control channel, a light-payload file (e.g., a cookie), an email communication, an instant message, or the like. In addition, request(s), as well as content(s) , described herein can be delivered in accordance with various protocols such as file transfer protocol (FTP), secure shell FTP (SFTP), FTP over secure socket layer (FTPS), short message service (SMS) protocol, multimedia messaging service (MMS) protocol, unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) standard, simple network management protocol (SNMP), or the like.","To process a request to lease a mobile device, leasing platform  includes a registration component  that receives the request, through signaling  via link(s) . In response to the request, registration component  can collect information from the prospective lessee; the information can be retained within lessee intelligence . To effect such collection, registration component  can deliver request(s) for specific information via signaling , and receive associated information as part of payload of signaling  or content(s) . In an aspect, the collected information can include at least one of selected model of mobile device to lease; selected volume of service units, e.g., airtime or data; billing information, which includes credit card records, banking account data such as checking account or saving account information; commercial identifier(s) such as, but not limited to, social security number, tax identification number, or the like; or other information conventionally requested in a commercial transaction. Moreover, collected information can include data on wireless services retained by the applicant; the services can include macrocellular wireless service, femtocell wireless service, high-speed internet, internet protocol television (IPTV), or the like, and can be provided by the network operator, or telecommunications carrier, that administers the lease of mobile device(s) or by a disparate network operator.","Based at least in part on the collected information, registration component  can classify the prospective lessee through application of a set of eligibility rules that evaluate the prospective lessee's eligibility to lease the mobile device. Eligibility rules are configurable and can be issued by a network operator, and can be retained in memory element . In an aspect, eligibility rules can include at least one of (i) cutoff thresholds for ratings of legacy applicants, e.g., applicants that previously engaged in leasing of a mobile device; (ii) merit or demerit points for subscription or lack thereof to mobile and non-mobile services provided by the telecommunications carrier that manages leasing of mobile device(s) or other network operators; (iii) asset risk classification of leased mobile device as determined at least in part through costs of purchase of mobile device from manufactures; (iv) availability of financial instruments directed to securing cost of leased mobile device, e.g., applicant that fails to provide a valid credit card can be barred, temporarily or permanently, from leasing a mobile device; or the like. It is noted that eligibility rules employed in the assessment of an applicant can avoid reliance on conventional creditworthiness ratings to establish applicant's eligibility or non-eligibility.","If the prospective lessee is ineligible, registration component  declines the request to lease the mobile device and implements a retention protocol, registration component  can deliver a notification or report that conveys one or more reasons the request is declined and corrective action(s) that may render the prospective lessee eligible. The notification or report can be delivered as part of content(s) . In addition or in the alternative, registration component  can supply a recommendation for a set of one or more mobile devices that the applicant is eligible to rent. Moreover, registration component  can deliver, via content(s) , promotional material that recommends a subscription to a non-lease wireless service program that qualifies for participation on leasing plan(s) of mobile devices.","Conversely, if the prospective lessee is classified as eligible, registration component  assigns a mobile number to the mobile device that is to be operated through a lease agreement, configures a lease agreement, and conveys an indication to provision the mobile device. The assigned mobile number is to be used by lessee for the duration of the rental period. As part of configuration of the lease agreement, registration component  generates a lessee account, retained in memory element . To increase storage efficiency, a lessee account associated with a subscriber of network operator that manages leasing program can be retained as a symbolic link to a storage location within a subscriber database (not shown) that can be part of mobile or non-mobile network(s) or the network operator. As another part of configuration of the lease agreement, registration component  creates one or more service unit \u201cbanks\u201d or \u201cbuckets,\u201d retained in service unit storage ; unit for voice service can be minute or other suitable unit, while unit for data can be megabyte (MB) or the like. In accordance with a lease agreement, lessee can consume voice or data service(s) if service unit banks contain available unit(s), or throughout an agreed lease period.","To further configuration of the lease agreement, registration component  can request additional information such as at least a portion of an operational profile of a non-leased mobile device available to the prospective lessee. In the absence of such additional information, registration component , via at least in part profile management component , can compose an initial operational profile that configures, at least in part, one or more services to be provided through the mobile device. The composed operational profile can be customized for the lessee based at least in part on at least one of leased mobile device and gathered information. As an alternative or in addition to composition of an operational profile, registration component  can direct synchronization component  to poll a set of service node(s)  to extract a set of one or more operational profiles, e.g., profile(s) , from memory  accessible to one or more service node(s) within the set. In an aspect, the service node(s)  exploits one or more of the extracted operational profiles to provide a service to the lessee, the service need not be supplied through a wireless network. The service node(s)  can be part of a network, mobile or otherwise, managed by the telecommunications carrier that supplies the leasing program or administered by an external operator; for instance, service node(s)  can include operation and maintenance server(s) or equipment; customer support server(s); network administration server(s); billing server(s); email server(s); application server(s); utility server(s); or the like. Operational profiles that are available to registration component , either composed are retained within the generated lessee account in lessee record storage , and delivered to the leased mobile device as part of content(s) . Delivery of operational profile can automate, at least in part, configuration of the leased mobile device; thus, simplifying leased mobile device configuration process through mitigation of lessee intervention.","With respect to the indication to provision the mobile device, such indication can include the assigned mobile number, and can be conveyed to a wireless service network platform (which can be part of access network(s) ), or component(s) therein, in order to accomplish at least one of the following. Commitment of the mobile number assigned to the mobile device; or initiation one or more services that enable operation of the mobile device\u2014e.g., call session establishment, authorization, authentication and accounting (AAA) services, access to add-on service(s) such as wireless IPTV broadcast(s), satellite-based radio content, web-browsing parental controls, etc.","Registration component  also can convey collected billing information of an eligible lessee to billing component , which can assess lease charges and broker a financial hold on one or more of the lessee's financial instruments, e.g., credit card, disclosed as part of the billing information. Billing component  can broker the financial hold with one or more financial institutions that manage such financial instruments. The financial hold provides asset protection since it is directed to guarantee monetary resources to cover costs of replacement of the leased mobile device, and can be placed at the time a lease agreement is acknowledged by the prospective lessee, and removed when the mobile device is returned undamaged and operational.","For a current lease, billing component  can monitor usage information received from at least one of a leased mobile device or a network management component, e.g., an Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) server or a home location register (HLR). Based at least in part on the monitored information, billing component  can update service unit bank(s) retained in service unit storage  and determine at least one of consumption of leased service units or expiration of lease terms. If usage information is received from both the leased device and the network management component, billing component  can carry out a reconciliation protocol to ensure integrity of reported usage. Additionally, if a lease is renewed, billing component  can implement rollover of service units unused throughout a rental period, wherein a service unit bank for a new lease is updated to include service units not used in a previously completed rental period. In an aspect, voice and data service units can be rolled over to a new lease period based at least in part on at least one of lessee rating, retained in lessee account within set , or lessee intelligence . Rollover of unused service units can be implemented on a promotional basis, as an incentive to mitigate lessee attrition and retain revenue. Generally, in one or more alternative or additional embodiments of example system , billing component  can update service unit storage in accordance with a promotional campaign directed to a specific lessee or segment of lessees.","With regard to asset protection, to limit exposure of the network operator to loss of user equipment (UE), or physical asset, tracking component  can poll leased mobile device current location or substantially current location in case the it is not returned after a predetermined period after lease term(s) expire. Thus, the network operator can actively pursue recovery of user equipment, for example, through dispatch of agents of a collection agency or law enforcement to an estimated location of the mobile device. In an aspect, registration component  can direct tracking component  to poll the location of mobile device, which can be accomplished through delivery of a request to generate a location estimate at the mobile device and transmit the location estimate to tracking component . The request can be conveyed as part of signaling , whereas the location estimate can be received as part of content(s) . For leased mobile device with global positioning system (GPS) navigation functionality, the leased mobile device can generate an estimate of the current or substantially current location based at least in part on GPS navigation data.","In scenarios in which GPS-based location fix is unavailable, a service wireless network, via, for example, a femtocell AP or a macrocell Node B, can produce the estimate of the current of substantially current location of leased mobile device. In such scenarios, tracking component  can deliver a request for a location estimate to a component within the service network, the component can either produce the estimate or operate as a proxy for a component that can generate the estimate. In an aspect, the macrocell Node B (not shown) can generate the estimate through, at least in part, time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, e.g., measurements of round trip time (RTT), DL or UL time of arrival (TOA), or DL or DL time difference of arrival (TDOA). In another aspect, estimate of the current or substantially current location of the leasing mobile device with pending return can be estimated through location of a femtocell AP to which the leased mobile device is attached. The location of the femtocell AP can be collected, for example, at the time of provisioning such AP for service, and is generally available through at least one of a subscriber database (e.g., a memory linked to a home subscriber server (HSS)), a provisioning database, or an external location server, e.g., serving mobile location center (SMLC). Such location server can embody one service node(s) .","It is noted that an alternative to the recovery of UE indicated supra is to direct the leased mobile device to render a notification of its estimated location and a request to return the UE to a predetermined retail location, leasing location, or drop-off box; registration component  can deliver a directive to render the foregoing notification and request. It should be appreciated that the drop-off box can be located in the predetermined retail location or leasing location, both of which can be, e.g., a store owned by the network operator or an affiliate. It should be further appreciated that network operator that manages leasing program can provide retail or leasing locations with protocol(s) (e.g., stoking procedures, delivery procedures to supply warehouse, or the like) to return leased mobile devices. The directive also can request to render an offer to renew the expired lease.","In an aspect of the subject innovation, tracking component  also can retain, as part of lessee intelligence , at least one of call session records or at least a portion of call session traffic for compliance with law enforcement regulation(s), such as the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA). In one or more embodiments, to improve storage efficiency tracking component  can compress the stored call session records or traffic through various conventional mechanisms.","Lessee intelligence  and lessee account(s) , and information therein, can be preserved according to a retention protocol (not shown) which dictates, at least in part, a time span to maintain such information in memory  subsequent to termination of a lease prior to at least a portion of the information being flushed, or compressed and stored as backup. The retention protocol (not shown) can be stored in memory  as code instructions (not shown); in an aspect, registration component  can carry out the retention protocol.","Mobile devices that are returned to a point of lease (e.g., POL terminal ), such as a retail location, a leasing location, or a drop-off box in a vending machine or kiosk that enables leasing of mobile devices, can be scheduled for commissioning for new lease. Such commissioning can include, for example, removal of at least one of all lessee data, call records, or application(s) that the lessee may have downloaded. In addition, the commissioning can include any necessary repairs and testing in order to provide the mobile device for further lease(s) in adequate, or optimal or nearly optimal, condition. Mobile devices available for lease in the point of lease (e.g., POL terminal ) can be audited periodically, e.g., by a network operator or a representative thereof, to ensure the mobile devices are in optimal or nearly optimal conditions. In an aspect, registration component  can receive, as part of signaling , an indication the mobile device has been returned, and can schedule the mobile device for commissioning for new lease. In case the mobile device is returned to a retail location, the commissioning can be implemented on location. Alternatively, a mobile device returned in a drop-off box can be picked up by a network operator representative, e.g., field technician, returned to a point of lease, and then commissioned for lease. It is noted that a rental device that is pseudo-stationary can be picked up by a network operator representative upon expiration of lease term(s) and returned to a point of lease to be scheduled for commissioning for lease or to be commissioned for lease.","The following example scenario illustrates an advantage of provision of a mobile device under lease agreement. A network operator offers a mobile device (e.g., a 3G Apple\u00ae iPhone) with 1000 min.\/month and unlimited data usage for $90 per month with a purchase price of the device of $200 with a two year contract. Assuming the mobile device actual cost to the network operator is $500 to buy the mobile device from its manufacturer, throughout the course of the 24-month contract (or device \u201clifetime\u201d), the mobile device yields the network operator a net revenue of 24.$90+$200-$500=$1,860. If the same device is leased in accordance with aspects described herein at a price point of $29.99 per week (wk.), in an rental interval of just 84 weeks out of a two year period, the device can produce 84\u00b7$29.99-$500=$2,020 in revenue. It should be appreciated that the 84-week rental interval can involve disparate lessees that rent the mobile device in disjointed periods. The lease program revenue for the mobile device is thus nearly 9% more than the $1,860 in revenue yielded in the conventionally offered, device-subsidized two-year contract. In addition, refurbished or returned devices can be used to stock the rental pool of devices, which can further increase the revenue yield by leasing a device. For instance, if cost to the network operator of a refurbished or returned device is $200 instead of $500, then the net revenue generated through rental over 84 weeks within a two-year period is $2,320; 25% in excess the revenue of the 2 year contract example.","In addition to increased revenue potential for the network operator that implements leasing program with respect to a normal handset subsidy and fixed term (e.g., 2 year) contract, a customer who leases device(s) frequently or on a regular basis benefits from the flexibility of rental program for a relatively modest cost difference with respect to conventional handset purchase and monthly contract pricing. For instance, while in the foregoing two-year contracted plan out of pocket cost to a subscriber can be 24\u00b7$90+$200=$2,360, if the subscriber rented the same device at $29.99\/wk, lease cost in a two-year interval would be 104\u00b7$29.99=$3,119. Thus, during a rental period, for example, to compare a set of specific devices, the subscriber pays a modest additional ($3,119-$2,360)\/104=$7.30\/wk. relative to the two-year contract price.","The lease platform described herein also allows a network operator to control usage and mitigate exposure to excessive usage on a leased mobile device for a rental period, while providing a lessee with a usage opportunity comparable to a subscriber in a two-year contract. For example, the network operator may offer 250 min\/wk and one-quarter of the typical data usage for the specific leased mobile device.","In one or more embodiments, example system  can include one or more processors (not shown) which can be configured to provide, or that provide, at least in part, the described functionality of the various components described herein. To provide such functionality, the processor(s) (not shown) can exploit a bus, which can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus, a system bus, or an address bus, or a message bus, for data or any other information exchange conduit, protocol, or mechanism among disclosed memory(ies) or component(s) or subcomponents.

For example, a service flag can be a logic variable linked to a predetermined service such as femtocell service, macrocell service, high-speed internet service, IPTV, cable content, or the like; for instance, a femtocell subscriber can have a variable \u201cfemto service\u201d set to \u201cTrue.\u201d Additionally or alternatively, service flag(s)  can be a multi-bit word(s) with a set of J bits, e.g., 4 bits, employed to code an available service, with the least significant bit employed to identify whether the network operator or a competing telecommunication carrier supplies the service; J is a natural number. As indicated supra, registration component  collects information on service(s) available to a lessee linked to lessee account .","(iii) Lessee rating  conveys at least one of a commercial or operational standing as appraised by the network operator that manages the leasing program. Commercial standing can reveal actual or potential revenue associated with the lessee account, whereas operational standing can rate network utilization and imposed limitations thereof. For instance lessee rating  can identify a low-revenue consumer subscriber that has been hotlined or suspended due to a late return of leased mobile device. Lessee rating  is time-dependent and can be updated by the network operator, through, e.g., leasing platform , at predetermined times throughout a lease. In an aspect, registration component  can determine lessee rating  based at least in part on lessee intelligence .","(iv) Equipment ID(s)  labels one or more leased mobile devices and can be one of international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI), a user identity module identifier (UIMID), an international mobile equipment identifier (IMEI), a mobile identification number (MIN), a Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) electronic serial number (ESN), a multi-bit identification number such as mobile equipment ID (MEID), or the like. For each equipment ID in lessee account , one or more operational profiles in can be retained in profile(s) .","(v) An operational profile in profile(s)  can include setting(s) that facilitate or enable operation of the leased mobile device; setting(s) include at least one of navigation shortcuts, hyperlinks, address book(s), web-browsing bookmarks or favorites, ringtones, email profiles, home screen photos; security credentials such as Wi-Fi logins, banking passwords, logins to credit reporting services, social networking sites logins, or the like; etc. Such setting(s) generally can change as a lessee becomes familiar with capabilities of a leased mobile device and serving network, and the end user's interests evolve. Operational profiles can be configured for various mobile devices linked to a single lessee; e.g., an operational profile for a personal mobile device and an operational profile for a business-related mobile device.","Profile(s)  can be configured at various stages of a lease. If a lease is initiated, a profile can be configured by a lessee and delivered to registration component  via a POL terminal , e.g., through a user interface therein, that allows leasing a mobile device. The user interface (not shown) enables a prospective lessee to convey substantially any leasing information. In an aspect, POL terminal  can be embodied in a vending machine, which through the user interface, which can be embodied in a touch-screen, can guide a prospective lessee through the rental process and collect payment or billing information. If the prospective lessee is deemed eligible, POL terminal  can dispense the leased mobile device. In an aspect, POL terminal  (e.g., a vending machine) can prompt the prospective lessee, via the user interface therein, to accept operational or physical condition(s) (e.g., level of wear and tear) of the dispensed leased mobile device. If operational or physical condition(s) are unacceptable to prospective lessee, POL terminal  can receive an indication to such end through the user interface in POL terminal , and prompt the prospective lessee to return the unacceptable mobile device, which is tagged as \u201con hold.\u201d POL terminal , or a processor therein, can report on-hold mobile devices to convey such devices require repair(s) or replacement. To mitigate fraud, and prevent a large number of mobile devices available for lease to be tagged as \u201con hold,\u201d a prospective lessee can be allowed a finite, small number of rejections (e.g., two or three rejections).","In another aspect, an accepted mobile device can attach to an access point (not shown) associated with the POL terminal  (e.g., a vending machine) to enable configuration of at least a portion of a lease agreement. Configuration of at least one or more features of a lease agreement, such as leased service units for voice or data or operation profile(s), can be triggered by the access point, which can be a femtocell AP deployed in the POL terminal, The AP can direct the mobile device to execute an application that allows configuration of features of a lease agreement. To at least that end, the AP can deliver an SMS communication or MMS communication towards the mobile device to cause the configuration application to be executed. Execution of the configuration application can render a configuration environment, e.g., one or more user interfaces that allow entry of information related to a lease agreement. Received information can be delivered to the access point, which can relay the information to leasing platform . It should be appreciated that, as part of lease configuration through the executed application, the mobile device can receive additional instructions to complete lease process of the mobile device. An advantage of such lease configuration at the accepted mobile device is that it reduces the time a prospective lessee interacts with POL terminal  or component(s) therein.","Upon return of the mobile device, POL  (e.g., the vending machine), or a processor (not shown) therein, can signal, via access network(s) , that the device has been returned and registration component  can schedule the device to be commissioned for next lease. Alternatively or additionally, if synchronization component  receives an indication a network-based update has been performed in a service consumed by a leased mobile device, synchronization component  can signal profile management component  to update appropriate operational profile retained within lessee record storage . As indicated supra, the service (e.g., email messaging) can be provided through a serving network or an external network operationally coupled thereto through, for example, middleware architecture.","(vi) Billing record(s)  encompass data on one or more financial instruments that cover expenses incurred with a leasing agreement and secure a leased mobile device against loss or damage. The financial instrument(s) can include at least one of credit card or banking account. However, other financial instrument(s) can be employed such as a revolving charging account associated with service(s) subscribed with the network operator that administers the leasing program, particularly for subscribers that lease a device. Additionally, billing record(s)  are associated with profile(s) . The association is represented with a double-headed segment and can be a one-to-one or a one-to-many relationship. Such association can facilitate or enable, at least in part, identification of available profile(s) for a lessee and synchronization of the profile(s) with a leased mobile device. In an illustrative scenario, for a legacy lessee (e.g., a lessee that has rented a mobile device in the past) that has a one-to-many relationship amongst a credit card employed in lease transaction and device user profiles, registration component  can request the lessee to choose an available device user profile.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4B","b":["400","450","200"]},"When a leased mobile device  enters a coverage area served through a femtocell AP, the leased mobile device  attempts to attach to the femtocell AP  through transmission and reception of attachment signaling.

Updated operational profiles can be retained in memory element .","To update an operational profile, profile manager  can collect updates to various lessee-specific settings and configured preferences of mobile device . For example, when changes to a Post Office Protocol (POP) email account configuration are recorded, e.g., in data storage , profile manager  can update one or more operational profiles retained in memory element  to reflect the revised email configuration. Likewise, changes effected to a calendar or schedule, which can be retained in data storage , can be collected and an operational profile updated accordingly.

In an aspect, actor-machine interface  can receive and render the utilization message(s); as an example, such message(s) are rendered as one of aural of visual indicia. In another aspect, utilization message(s) can be supplied via wireless communication, e.g., point-to-point (PTP) short-range telecommunication, to a wireless-enabled device such as a personal computer (PC) or a vehicular navigation system, which can render the utilization message(s). The PTP short-range telecommunication can utilize various radio protocols that do not rely on network infrastructure (e.g., Bluetooth\u00ae, infrared telecommunication protocol(s) such as Infrared Data Association\u00ae (IrDA) protocol(s) . . . ).","When service units (e.g., minutes and MBs) allotted to a current lease are exhausted, leasing client component  terminates the lease and renders a leased mobile device, (e.g., ) unable to make or receive calls, except E-911 calls, and send or receive data, with exception of data generated as part of renewal of the terminated lease.

Such customized leasing plan(s) can allow utilization of currently subscribed service units, e.g., voice and data units in service plan contracted with the network operator, towards rental of a mobile device for a specific lease period. To enable such utilization, in the illustrated example system , incentive generator component , also referred to as incentive generator , can determine a rate of conversion amongst subscribed and leased service units. Incentive generator  also can determine time interval through which the conversion is valid; the time interval can span a configured lease period. The subscriber-specific plan(s) can be offered through an enrollment fee or without enrollment charges for a predetermined grace period. A subscriber that engages in leasing program can opt to update a service subscription (which is not a lease agreement) with the leased device. The latter has at least the following advantages for the network operator: (1) collection of rental fee(s), (2) penetration of newer, more capable mobile devices with increased potential for add-on services and associated revenue, and (3) extension of contracted service subscriptions with asset protection based on collection of early termination fees.","To mitigate attrition of lessees or reward lessee loyalty, promotional planning component  can establish leasing incentive(s) based at least in part on at least one of lessee ratings, retained in lessee account(s)  (see, e.g., ), or lessee intelligence . The leasing incentives can include discounted rates or bonus service units, bonus service(s) such as free-of-charge Wi-Fi connectivity in network(s) managed by network operator that administers leasing program, lease grace periods, gratuitous UE accessories, or the like. In the illustrated example embodiment of promotional component , incentive generator  can issue and customize leasing incentive(s) for a particular lessee or a lessee segment; issuance and customization can be accomplished at least in part through machine-learning or artificial intelligence (AI) methods applied to at least one of the lessee ratings or lessee intelligence . Promotional planning component  can convey generated incentives for a lessee to registration component  (not shown in ) within leasing platform , which can notify the lessee of available or granted incentives.

Wireless communication environment  includes two wireless network platforms: (i) A macro network platform  which serves, or facilitates communication with user equipment  (e.g., mobile ) via a macro radio access network (RAN) . It should be appreciated that in cellular wireless technologies (e.g., 3GPP UMTS, HSPA, 3GPP LTE, 3GPP UMTS, 3GPP2 UMB), macro network platform  is embodied in a Core Network. (ii) A femto network platform , which can provide communication with mobile  through a femto RAN , which is linked to the femto network platform  via backhaul pipe(s)  (e.g., backhaul link(s) ).

Such application(s), for example can include add-on features to standard services provided by macro network platform . Data streams can be conveyed to PS gateway node(s)  for authorization\/authentication and initiation of a data session, and to serving node(s)  for communication thereafter. Server(s)  can also effect security (e.g., implement one or more firewalls) of macro network platform  to ensure network's operation and data integrity in addition to authorization and authentication procedures that CS gateway node(s)  and PS gateway node(s)  can enact. Moreover, server(s)  can provision services from external network(s), e.g., WAN , or Global Positioning System (GPS) network(s), which can be a part of enterprise NW(s) .
