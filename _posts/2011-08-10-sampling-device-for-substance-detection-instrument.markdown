{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with government support under W911SR-10-D-001 awarded by the United States Army. The government has certain rights in the invention.","Often it is important to quickly and accurately determine the level and type of chemical compounds present on the surface of a material. For example, it may be desirable to quickly and reliably test for the presence of toxic industrial compounds (TICs), illegal drugs, explosive compounds, or chemical or biological weapons or substances. Some substances have a fairly high volatility. Many TICs have ambient temperature vapor pressures greater than 0.5 T (mmHg). Others, for example various explosives such as nitroglycerin, trinitrotoluene (TNT) and ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), have ambient temperature vapor pressures below 0.05 T.","Various technologies have been proposed for surface contamination sampling. For example, mass spectrometry has long been used to accurately determine the presence of initially unknown chemical and biological samples. Usually a sample is vaporized for transport via gas phase flow to the analyzer and ionized, with the resulting ions being measured to determine a mass to charge ratio spectrum which is, in turn, used to identify the basic constituents of the original sample. Due to the large size and power requirements of most mass spectrometers, they have typically been housed in a dedicated laboratory. As such, samples were collected at a potentially contaminated site and brought to the mass spectrometer for analysis. This tended to be a time consuming and expensive endeavor, especially if the surface being analyzed was located a distance from the laboratory.","In order to address the problem of analyzing samples at a contamination site, portable field detection systems have been developed. For example, Bruker Daltonics manufactures portable mass spectrometers such as the MM series and the EM series. With some mass spectrometers, a sample to be tested is collected and placed in a test chamber, where it is exposed to heat and a carrier gas to volatilize and transport molecules to a mass spectrometer detection unit. Other mass spectrometers, such as Bruker Daltonics MM1 and MM2 models, utilize a sampling head or probe that is brought into contact or proximity with a surface to capture volatilized molecules from the surface and transport them to a substance detector such as a mass spectrometer. Various sampling heads or probes have been proposed in the art, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,433,982, U.S. Pat. No. 4,541,268, and\/or U.S. Pat. No. 5,517,026. Such sampling heads utilize a membrane that is permeable to the volatile molecules of interest, and apply heat to the membrane when it is placed in contact or proximity to the surface being tested in order to assist in volatilization of the molecules so that they diffuse into the membrane. A carrier gas on the back side of the membrane then carries the volatile molecules to a substance detector such as a mass spectrometer. Known sampling heads, however, have limitations on their operating temperature ranges, particularly on the upper end, which limits their effectiveness on testing for a wide variety of substances potentially of interest, especially substances with low vapor pressures, and\/or their use for testing high temperature surfaces. Attempts have been made to enhance the ability of silicone sampling membranes by incorporating fillers such as ferric oxide into the polymer matrix; however, this can have deleterious effects on product performance such as imputing reactivity and\/or reducing analyte throughput for some analytes. Additionally, the effectiveness of transmission through the membrane is a function of analyte vapor pressure, analyte solubility in the membrane material and analyte mobility through the membrane material. All of these properties are, in turn functions of temperature and obtaining optimum, or even satisfactory, performance over a wide range of analyte volatility has been impracticable.","Accordingly, there continues to be a need in the art for sampling devices that are capable operating under a wide range of operating conditions and\/or for sampling for the presence of a wide range of compounds, including both compounds of low volatility that require substantial heating to collect and compound of high volatility that are more effectively captured via whole air sampling.","According to an exemplary embodiment, a sampling device for a substance detection instrument includes","a membrane comprising a porous support having a coating thereon, the coating comprising a carborane polysiloxane or an arylene polysiloxane, the membrane having a front side configured to be placed in contact with a test sample and a back side;","a sample line having an inlet proximate to the back side of the membrane and an outlet in fluid communication with a substance detector; and","a source of carrier gas in fluid communication with the back side of the membrane and the sample line inlet.","In another exemplary embodiment, the sampling device further includes a heater disposed to heat the membrane.","In yet another exemplary embodiment, a membrane for a sampling device includes a porous support having a coating thereon, the coating including a carborane polysiloxane or an arylene polysiloxane.","In a further exemplary embodiment, a method of sampling a material for the presence of substances comprises placing a sampling device in contact with the material, the sampling device comprising:","a membrane comprising a porous support having a coating thereon, said coating comprising a carborane polysiloxane or an arylene polysiloxane, said membrane having a front side configured to be placed in contact with a test sample and a back side;","a sample line having an inlet proximate to the back side of the membrane and an outlet in fluid communication with a substance detector; and","a source of carrier gas in fluid communication with the back side of the membrane and the sample line inlet.","A simplified sampling device is schematically shown in an exploded cross-sectional view in , in which a sampling device  has a housing  having a threaded coupling or other similar attachment feature . A membrane retainer  having an opening  disposed therein is disposed over the housing  such that threaded coupling  on the retainer engages with threaded coupling  on the housing to secure the membrane retainer to the housing . Membrane  comprising a porous support having a coating thereon is supported by a membrane support ring  to maintain a carrier gas flow gap between the membrane  and the housing , and a sample transfer line  is disposed in the housing having an inlet  that is disposed proximate to the upper (rear) surface of the membrane  and an outlet (not shown) that leads to a substance detector (not shown) such as a mass spectrometer. During operation, a vacuum is drawn in the sample transfer line  by a pump, diaphragm, or other suitable gas transfer mechanism to draw sample gas from the inlet  to provide test gas to the substance detector. This creates a membrane sweep flow of ambient gas (e.g., air) drawn along the path shown in  through wire mesh washer . This membrane sweep flow carries volatilized molecules to the sample line inlet  from the test sample that have diffused through the membrane , from where they are transported to the substance detector. In an alternative embodiment as shown in , uncoated area(s)  in the membrane , disposed in the area of the retainer opening  proximate to the edge of the retainer opening provide an alternative flow path for carrier gas as shown in . In this alternative embodiment, mesh washer  () is eliminated and the membrane support ring is disposed to provide a seal against housing  when the membrane  is in place.","Turning now to , a schematic cross-section view of membrane  is shown having a porous support  having coating  thereon. The porous support can be fabricated from any sort of inert material, including but not limited to metals (e.g., nickel, chromium, stainless steel alloys such as SS304, SS306, SS316), quartz, glass, fiberglass, cloths composed of carbon nanotube fibers, polymers (e.g., fluoropolymers, polyamides, aramids), and the like as are known in the art and may be formed from woven clothes or sintered disks. The support is porous, and in an exemplary embodiment is a mesh support having mesh opening sizes ranging from 2 \u03bcm to 25 \u03bcm, more specifically 4 \u03bcm to 5 \u03bcm. The thickness of the support can vary depending on the specific design requirements and the properties of the coatings and the molecules being tested for, but can generally range from 50 \u03bcm to 205 \u03bcm. In the case of a sintered disk support, mechanical requirements would necessitate a support thickness of 1588\u00b1794 \u03bcm, though the membrane material per se would be the same thickness as if a wire cloth support were used.","In some exemplary embodiments, prior to applying the arylene or carborane siloxane coating, the support is surface treated to provide a coating comprising silicon or other inert surface layers such as silica (SiO), substituted silica, siloxane oligomers, and the like, any of which may be substituted with functional groups (e.g., alkyl, fluoroalkyl) to provide desired levels of inertness and\/or hydrophobicity. Such surface treatments can improve the adhesion and integration of the siloxane coating, as well as modifying the characteristics of the membrane, e.g., hydrophobicity. Such surface treatments are known in the art, and generally involve applying silicon-containing surface coatings (e.g., carboxysilicons) using vapor deposition techniques such as chemical vapor deposition of silicon hydride gas. Other surface treatments include but are not limited to electropolishing (e.g., Summa\u00ae polishing) or anodization. Exemplary surface treatment techniques and compositions are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,444,326, 6,511,760, 7,867,627, and 7,070,833, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Surface-treatment processing is commercially available from suppliers such as Silcotek of Bellefonte, Pa. In an exemplary embodiment, a hydrophobic surface treatment such as Silcotek's Dursan\u2122 surface treatment is utilized. In another exemplary embodiment, a hydrophobic surface treatment such as Silcotek's Dursan\u2122 surface treatment is utilized in conjunction with the above-described exemplary embodiment where portion(s) of the support are not coated with the siloxane coating in order to provide a flow path for carrier gas. Surface treated supports of various morphologies are commercially available from suppliers such as Restek of Bellefonte, Pa.","In an exemplary embodiment, the sampling device's membrane is a porous support coated with a layer comprising an arylene polysiloxane.
