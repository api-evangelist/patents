In addition, the POI may be extended to an object that forms a relationship with an individual, and a relationship between an individual and a place (that is, POI) is formed, and thus, an advanced concept social network may be formed.","Therefore, the present invention may define a concept of a social navigation  of an SNS structure that provides a connection with another user using a POI as a medium through an SNS-based POI service supported by the SNS media studio .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},"As illustrated in , the open-type POI service system according to an embodiment of the present invention may be configured of an SNS media studio server  that acts as a platform of . The SNS media studio server  performs an overall POI service based on an SNS. The SNS media studio server  provides a web service associated with the POI service, and an individual may register, manage, and share a POI by connecting to the web service provided by the SNS media studio server  through an information registration device  that supports a communication environment. Here, the information registration device  corresponds to a device for inputting user-generated data for generating a POI into the SNS media studio server , and may inclusively indicate all communication terminal that is capable of connecting to the SNS media studio server  such as a PC, communication-type navigation device, a smart phone, and the like.","Particularly, the SNS media studio server  may include a POI information server , a POI collect server , a traffic information collect server , an SNS supply server , a POI information database , a traffic information database , an SNS database , an analysis server , and a management server .","The POI information server  opens map data, particularly, a POI, displayed on a map to a user. Here, the POI may correspond to data for displaying main facilities disclosed on a map screen on a digital map, and may include text information such as a name, an address, a telephone number, and the like. The POI information server  may provide a user communication environment (i.e., an open API) to enable a user to generate a POI. For example, the POI information server , as illustrated in , may open map data including a POI  corresponding to each facility and a road  through user communication.","The POI collect server  collects an open-type POI generated based on user-generated data input through the information registration device . The POI collect server  recognizes a location of interest designated by the user in map data opened by the POI information server , and collects the recognized the location of interest as an open-type POI. In the present embodiment, the open-type POI may include at least one of a static POI, a dynamic POI, and a content POI. Here, the static POI corresponds to a POI of which a location of interest designated by the user is fixed, and indicates all existing POIs displayed on a map. Particularly, the static POI corresponds to a POI selected by the user as an interest POI which the user is interested in, or a POI of which POI related information (e.g., a name and the like) is changed or added. Referring to , the user may generate a static POI by selecting the POI  associated with a predetermined facility through user communication. Also, the dynamic POI corresponds to a POI of which a location of interest designated by the user is dynamically changed, and indicates a POI that is designated to be a location of another user that allows opening of the location to the user. For example, when the user requests POI registration with respect to a location of a predetermined friend through user communication, the location of the corresponding friend may be generated to be a dynamic POI displayed on a map. The content POI corresponds to a POI of which a location of interest designated by the user is located on a road or near the road. In other words, the content POI is generated by setting a virtual point on a road, the virtual point being a location where circumjacent traffic information is collected, or may provide the user with circumjacent traffic information based on the virtual point, that is, may indicate a point of interest as a reference for providing various contents. Traffic information is information associated with a time and thus, the content POI may be utilized as a location for collecting and providing real-time traffic information. Referring to , the user may generate a content POI by setting a point on the road  through user communication. The content POI may be manually or automatically set. In the case of automatic setting, at least one specific point from among an accident black spot, a region for which TPEG (Transport Protocol Expert Group) data does not exist (e.g., an interchange ramp and the like), and a chronically congested section may be automatically generated as a content POI. In this example, the content POI may be utilized as public information for users located in a corresponding specific point or users located within a predetermined radius based the predetermined point. In addition, the POI collect server  may collect POI related information input by the user with respect to an open-type POI. In this example, the POI related information may be input in at least one form of a text, an image, a video, and a voice. Also, the POI collect server  may collect POI related information that is associated with an open-type POI on the Internet in addition to POI related information that is directly input by the user.","The traffic information collect server  collects traffic information associated with a road. Here, the traffic information inclusively indicates information associated with various factors that affect traffic such as traffic conditions for each section (congestion, delay, and the like), accidents, construction work, and the like. For example, the traffic information collect server  may collect traffic information directly input by the user with respect to the content POI. As another example, the traffic information collect server  may automatically collect traffic information associated with a point of interest corresponding to the content POI or traffic information associated with a region within a predetermined radius based on the point of interest, from among traffic information on the Internet.","The SNS supply server  provides social network information related to the user on the Internet. In this example, the social network information indicates information of another user with whom the user sets a relationship (e.g., a neighbor, a friend, and the like), and the information of the other user may include all information for identifying the other user (e.g., an ID, a telephone number, an e-mail address, a blog address, and the like registered in a site related to an open-type POI service system or a map service site).","The POI information database  stores and maintains overall map data for a map service, and particularly, stores and maintains an open-type POI collected by the POI collect server . The POI information database  may store a POI-type POI to be associated with a user who generates a POI and thus, may register the open-type POI generated by the user. Also, the POI information database  may store an open-type POI through connection with POI related information input by the user or with POI related information on the Internet.","The traffic information database  stores and maintains traffic information associated with a road, which is collected by the traffic information collect server . In this example, the traffic information database  may store traffic information through connection with location information of a corresponding road so that search and supply of traffic information associated with the content POI may be readily performed.","The SNS database  stores and maintains social network information associated with the user, which is collected by the SNS supply server . That is, the SNS database  may store information of another user with whom the user sets a relationship, to be associated with the user.","With respect to an open-type POI collected by the POI collect server , the analysis server  verifies at least one of the open-type POI, a user who generates the open-type POI, and POI related information associated with the open-type POI. That is, the analysis server  is to manage generation of a poor POI, and performs verification and management by always monitoring a POI generated by a user. For example, when a POI registered by a user corresponds to a facility that is excluded from generation of a POI such as bars and clubs and the like, the analysis server  may delete the corresponding POI through monitoring. As another example, the analysis server  may monitor whether POI related information (a text, an image, a video, and a voice) does not use a predetermined data form, or includes a swear word or slang, or includes pornography or information associated with spam, or the like, and may delete the corresponding POI. As another example, when a user attempts registration of a poor POI more than a predetermined number of times, when a user is reported as a bad user more than a predetermined number of times, or the like, the analysis server  may restrict generation of a POI and the use of the service for the corresponding user. The analysis server  may automatically select a POI that fails to correspond to a filtering condition of a data verification system (automatic verification system), as a POI suspected to be a poor POI. In this example, although content that is suspected to be a swear word, slang, pornography, spam, and the like, is not filtered through the data verification system, the content may be separately extracted and may be deleted by determination of a manager. Also, the analysis server  may manage a poor POI or a bad user based on a report from a user. After a report associated with a poor POI or a bad user is collected from a user through the analysis server , the poor POI may be deleted or the use of the service for the user may be restricted based on determination of the manager. In this example, the POI information database  may be built as an open-type POI that is finally verified by the analysis server  and the manager.","The management server  is a server to manage an overall open-type POI service, and may provide a personalized POI service through an open-type POI based on information stored in the POI information database , the traffic information database , the SNS database , and may also provide a service by connecting the open-type POI with an SNS.","In particular, the management server  opens, to a user, map data stored in the POI information database , particularly, a POI displayed on a map, so that the user may generate a POI through an open API. The management server  provides a web service for opening a POI to a user and for generating a POI, and may register a POI in the POI information database  through an open API when a user generates the POI.","Also, the management server  may provide a personalized map service through a POI layer extended based on an open-type POI registered by a user. Referring to , the management server  may provide an open-type POI including a static POI , a dynamic POI , and a content POI  which are registered by the user on a map screen that is requested by the user. In this example, POI related information associated with an open-type POI may be automatically displayed on a map screen together with a POI, or may be provided in a form of an image or a voice when a user provides an input such as touching an open-type POI and the like. Also, the management server  may provide a location of another user designated by a user through the dynamic POI  in real-time. The management server  provides a service by connecting the content POI  with traffic information input by a user or may provide a service by connecting the content POI  with traffic information collected on the Internet in real-time. As illustrated in , an SNS media studio server  of the present embodiment may share, with a different type of device, a user's open-type POI which is registered in a POI information database  through using an open API. When a user registers an open-type POI in a first device  (e.g., a mobile device and the like) by viewing a map, the POI may be stored in the POI information database  through the open API. Subsequently, when the user turns on a second device  (e.g., a navigation device, a PC, and the like) which is in a type different from the first device, or user authentication is performed through the second device , the user may download an open-type POI registered in the POI information database  and may be provided with a personalized POI service in an environment of a different type of device.","The management server  may provide an open-type POI to another user with whom a user sets a relationship, through connection with an open-type POI generated by the user based on an SNS. For example, when the user enables an open-type POI to be connected based on an SNS using an open API, the user may share user's POI with another user whom the user is following. When a user requests providing user's open-type POI from a predetermined friend, or when the friend of the user requests providing user's open-type POI, the user's open-type POI stored in the POI information database  may be provided to a corresponding friend. In the present embodiment, an SNS is connected and thus, the POI information database  may be shared and may transmit user's open-type POI to other users like sending an e-mail. Also, the management server  may share open-type POIs among users and may apply a POI layer received from another user when a map service is provided. The present embodiment uses an open API and thus, may share user's open-type POI with another user who uses a different type of device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":"200"},"In step , the SNS media studio server  opens, to a user, a POI displayed on a map so that the user may generate a POI. The SNS media studio server  supports a web service that opens a POI on a map so that the user may register a location of interest designated by the user on the map as an open-type POI.","In step , the SNS media studio server  recognizes the location of interest designated by the user on the map opened in step , and collects the recognized the location of interest as an open-type POI. Here, the open-type POI may include a static POI, a dynamic POI, and a content POI. For example, when a user selects an interest POI which the user is interested in or changes or adds POI related information associated with a POI, the SNS media studio server  may collect the corresponding POI as a static POI. As another example, when a user generates a POI with respect to a location of a predetermined friend through user communication (open API), the SNS media studio server  may collect the location of the corresponding friend as a dynamic POI displayed on a map. As another example, when a user generates a POI with respect to a predetermined point that is located in a road or near the road, the SNS media studio server  may collect the corresponding point as a content POI displayed on a map. Here, the content POI may correspond to a location for collecting circumjacent traffic information or may correspond to a reference point for providing circumjacent traffic information to a user. Also, in addition to a manual setting method by a user, a content POI may be automatically set with respect to at least one specific point from among an accident black spot, a region for which TPEG data does not exist, and a chronically congested section, and may be collected. Also, the SNS media studio server  may collect POI related information directly input by a user and POI related information on the Internet, with respect to an open-type POI. In this example, the POI related information may include traffic information associated with a road, and may be input in at least one form of a text, an image, a video, and a voice. The SNS media studio server  may manage the open-type POI by connecting the open-type POI with POI related information.","In step , with respect to the open-type POI collected in step , the SNS media studio server  verifies at least one of the open-type POI, a user who generates the open-type POI, and POI related information associated with the open-type POI. The SNS media studio server  always monitors a POI generated by a user, and may delete a POI determined to be poor or may restrict the use of the service for a user who registers a poor POI.","In step , the SNS media studio server  may complete POI registration by storing the open POI finally verified in step  in a POI information database. The SNS media studio server  may provide a personalized map service through a POI layer extended based on the open-type POI registered by the user. In this example, the SNS media studio server  provides a location of another user designated by the user in real-time through a dynamic POI, or provides traffic information of a point corresponding to a content POI in real-time through the content POI.","In step , the SNS media studio server  may search for another user with whom the user sets a relationship. The SNS media studio server  may collect information associated with the other user with whom the user sets a relationship through social network information associated with the user on the Internet (e.g., an ID, a telephone number, an e-mail address, a blog address, and the like that are registered in an open-type POI service system).","In step , the SNS media studio server  may provide the open-type POI to the other user with whom the user sets a relationship through connection with the open-type POI generated by the user based on an SNS scheme. The SNS media studio server  may provide the open-type POI of the user to the other user in response to a request from the user or a request from the other user with whom the user sets a relationship. Therefore, the SNS media studio server  may enable the user to share a POI with the other user with whom the user is following through connection of the open-type POI based on an SNS scheme, and may provide a map service by applying a POI layer that is received from the other user when a map service is provided by sharing POIs among users.","In step , the SNS media studio server  may share the open-type POI of the user registered in the POI information database among different types of devices using an open API. For example, when a user registers a new POI in a mobile device by viewing a map, and user authentication is performed through a navigation device that is in a type different from the mobile device, the POI newly registered in the POI information database  is downloaded to the navigation device and a personalized POI service may be provided in an environment of a different type of device.","In the same manner, in step , the SNS media studio server  may provide the open-type POI of the user to another user who uses a different type of device using an open API when the user's POI is shared with the other user through an SNS connection.","As described in the foregoing, according to the embodiments of the present invention, a POI on a map is opened to a user so that the user directly generates a POI and thus, any one is capable of generating a POI in a horizontal structure through an open API and a personalized map service may be provided through an extended POI layer. Also, a POI is extended to an object that forms a relationship with a user and a relationship between an individual and a place may be formed and thus, an SNS structure may be provided that provides a connection with another user based on a POI. Also, more reliable data may be collected in real-time by utilizing a POI on a map as a location having real-time data, and the real-time data of a POI may be provided based on an SNS.","The embodiments of the present invention may be recorded in non-transitory computer readable media including program instructions to implement various operations embodied by a computer. The media may also include, alone or in combination with the program instructions, data files, data structures, and the like. The media and program instructions may be those specially designed and constructed for the purposes of example embodiments, or they may be of the kind well known and available to those having skill in the computer software arts.
