{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field","Embodiments may generally relate to communication devices, such as mobile communication devices. More particularly, some embodiments may be concerned with efficiently providing communication history information to a user of a communication device.","2. Description","A user of a communication device, such as a Smartphone, may access an application on the device to initiate and receive events associated with communications between the user and other people and devices. For example, a user might receive a wireless telephone call from another person. A user may also communicate via other applications executing on the mobile device, such as an email application, a contact application, and\/or a calendar application. Similarly, external business applications such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications, social networking sites (such as Facebook or Twitter), and\/or third party applications might be used to communicate with others.","Note that more than one user (e.g., associated with multiple mobile communication devices) associated with an enterprise might communicate with the same party. For example, a first employee of a company might use his Smartphone to place a telephone call to a customer on Monday, and a second employee might use her Smartphone to send an email to the same customer on Tuesday. The second employee, however, might be completely unaware that the first employee called the customer the previous day. As a result, when a user performs typical day-to-day communication operations using a mobile communication device, he or she may be unable to quickly get an accurate overview of a situation and view related data that pertains to a person or enterprise associated with prior communication events. For example, an employee who receives a telephone call from a potential client might not realize that his or her boss had already discussed a particular issue with that potential client via a social networking site.","Systems and methods are therefore desired to integrate and provide information about previous communications, including communications associated with other users and\/or other mobile communication devices.","Some embodiments provide a system, method, program code and\/or means to receive, from a first mobile communication device associated with a first user, information about a first communication event between the first user and another party. The information about the first communication event may be stored. A request associated with the other party may be received from a second mobile communication device associated with a second user. Responsive to the request, information about the first communication event may be retrieved and transmitted to the second mobile communication device. In this way, the second user may be made aware prior communication events with the other party (e.g., prior events associated with other users and\/or other mobile communication devices).","With these and other advantages and features that will become hereinafter apparent, further information may be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and appended claims, and to the figures attached hereto.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","110","120","120","110","120","110","120"]},"According to some embodiments, a first communication \u201cevent\u201d may occur between the first and second devices , . As used herein, the term \u201cevent\u201d might refer to, for example, a telephone call, an email, a calendar event (e.g., a meeting request), a social networking site event (e.g., a post or comment), a text message, including a Simple Messaging Service (SMS) text message, or an image. Note that the event may be either an inbound or outbound event from the perspective of the first mobile communication device . Moreover, the event, or log of the event, may include information that can be used as an identifier, address, or key (e.g., a phone number or email address) to identify the parties involved in the communication. Note that in some cases, more than two parties could be involved in a single communication event (e.g., the first mobile communication device  might send an email to three other devices).","At (2), information about the first communication event is provided from the first mobile communication device  to a remote server  (e.g., related to a CRM application) which may store the information. The information might include, for example, the identity of the other party , the type of event (e.g., an inbound phone call or an outbound SMS message), a time\/date of the event, a duration of the event, a subject of the event (e.g., the subject line of an email message), etc. Note that the first mobile communication device  might transmit the information about the first event immediately or might instead locally store the information to be uploaded to the remote server  later (e.g., on a periodic basis). As used herein, the remote server  is \u201cremote\u201d from the first mobile communication device  in that it is physically distant from the first mobile communication device  and\/or needs to communicate with the first mobile communication device  via one or more wireless networks.","A second user may then initiate a communication history display at a second mobile communication device . For example, the user might enter a search term and\/or select a button or icon associated with the communication history display. According to some embodiments, the user establishes a second communication event at (3) between the second mobile device  and the other party , which may automatically initiate display of communication history information. Note that the first and second communication events could be different types of events (e.g., email messages, calendar appointments, and\/or telephone calls).","At (4), information about the first communication event (between the first mobile communication device  and the other party ) is transmitted from the remote server  to the second mobile device . For example, the second mobile device  might initially send a request to the remote server , including a phone number or other information identifying the other party . The remote server  might search locally stored information to determine all prior communication events associated with the other party  and transmit a response to the request including the appropriate information. In this way, a user of the second mobile device  can be made aware of other communications that involved the other party  (even when those other communications involved other users and\/or other mobile devices).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"100"},"At , it may be determined that a first communication event occurred between a first mobile device and another party. For example, a first user might use the first mobile device to place a wireless telephone call to the other party. Other examples of communication events might include an email message, a to-do list, a calendar event (e.g., a meeting request), a social networking site event (e.g., a post or comment), a text message, including a Simple Messaging Service (SMS) text message, or an image message (e.g., sending a picture or posting a video). Note that the event may be either an inbound or outbound event from the perspective of the first mobile communication device. Moreover, the event, or log of the event, may include information that can be used as an identifier, address, or key (e.g., a phone number or email address) to identify the parties involved in the communication. Note that the detection performed at  might be associated with a \u201clistening\u201d application or hook to catch the appropriate information when a communication event occurs.","At , information about the first communication event may be uploaded to a remote server. For example, the first mobile device might immediately transmit information about the event to a remote server associated with a CRM application (which may then store the information). The information might include, for example, an identity of the other party, an event type (e.g., an inbound phone call or an outbound SMS message), an event time\/date, an event duration, a subject associated with the event (e.g., the subject line of an email message), etc. According to some embodiments, the first mobile communication device locally stores the event information to be later uploaded to the remote serve (e.g., on a periodic basis). Note that the remote server might be associated with an application other than a CRM application (e.g., another application that stores contact information). Moreover, information about the communication event might be validated (e.g., to determine if a party associated with the event exists in a CRM application).","At , an initiating event may be detected at a second mobile device associated with a second user. The initiating event might comprise, for example, a user request (e.g., he or she may press a physical button or select an icon on a display of the second device). The initiating event might instead comprise, for example, the occurrence of a new or current communication event (e.g., the second user might receive an email from a client).","At , information about the first communication event may be displayed at the second mobile device. For example, the second mobile device might transmit an information request to the remote server, including the telephone number of the other party. The remote server might then search through one or more databases or tables to determine all prior events associated with that party. The remote server may then transmit the appropriate information to the second mobile device. For example, a list including a scheduled meeting and telephone call between other users and the client might be displayed to the user. According to some embodiments, the user may then select one of the search results, and further information about the selected search result may be displayed to the user (e.g., so that he or she may \u201cdrill down\u201d to view additional details).","Note that the prior communication events might be associated with other users. For example, Mr. Smith of Acme, Inc. might send an email to Ms. Jones of Beta Corp. The next day, Mr. Greene of Acme, Inc. might place a telephone call to Ms. Jones and automatically be shown an indication of the prior days email (e.g., because the remote server is aware that the telephone number and email address of Ms. Jones are linked). Further note, according to some embodiments, that the prior communication events might not directly share any participants. By way of example, Mr. Greene of Acme, Inc. might have instead placed a telephone call to Ms. West of Beta Corp. In this case, the remote server might still arrange to display the prior communication between Mr. Smith and Ms. Jones (e.g., because the remote server is aware that Ms. Jones and Ms. West are linked as being associated with Beta Corp.)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300"]},"Device  includes voice call transceiver , user interface module , and text messager . Each element of device  may comprise any combination of hardware and\/or software components suitable for providing the functions attributed thereto herein. Two or more of transceiver , user interface module , and text messager  may share one or more constituent components, and, in some embodiments, device  may include unshown elements for providing the functions described herein.","Voice call transceiver  may receive and transmit voice calls via any suitable protocol. Voice call transceiver  may also receive caller information associated with received voice calls. The caller information may comprise caller ID information and\/or any other information that device  may use to identify a party from whom a voice call is received (and such identification may facilitate a storage and\/or display of appropriate communication history information).","A user input may be transmitted to voice call transceiver  by user interface module . In this regard, voice call transceiver  may notify module  of the reception of the voice call. User interface module  may present a user interface to a user in response to the notification. The user interface, examples of which are described below, may present communication history information related to a received voice call or other communication event detected by the device  and\/or similar devices.","User interface module  may also instruct text messager  to transmit a text message. In response, text messager  transmits a text message using a suitable text messaging service. The text messaging service may comprise any currently- or hereafter-known text messaging service. Conventional examples include IM, SMS, Multimedia Message Service (MMS), Enhanced Message Service (EMS), and electronic mail.","Communication history about communication events handled by the voice call transceiver  and text message  may be stored at the device  and\/or transmitted to a remote server. Moreover, communication history information may be provided to the user as appropriate via the user interface module . As a result, some embodiments of the  system , the  process, and\/or the  device  may provide more efficient and enhanced communications than previously available. Although the device  illustrated in  may be associated with a wireless telephone network, note that any of the embodiments described herein may be associated with other types of devices, including devices that exchange information (e.g., voice and data) via circuit switched or packet switched protocols (e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) packets).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","475","475","430","425"]},"Also included in the cellular telephone  are internal memory  and removable memory . Internal memory  may include one or more of ROM (read only memory), RAM (random access memory, e.g., static RAM), and flash memory. Removable memory  may comprise a flash memory, a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card or any other removable memory that is or becomes known. Cellular telephone  may therefore be equipped with an interface for physically receiving and transferring data to and from removable memory .","Note that a communication event database might be stored in the internal memory  and\/or the removable memory . Memories  and  may also store program code that is executable by processor  to control telephone . The program code may include but is not limited to operating system program code, application program code, device driver program code, and database connector program code. The program code may include code to cause cellular telephone  to perform functions that are described herein. In some embodiments, the program code is executable to provide a voice call transceiver, a user interface module and a text messager as described with respect to .","Memories  and  may also store data used in the operation of cellular telephone . Such data may include phone numbers, addresses, access codes, stored audio files, text corresponding to the stored audio files, and other data. Some or all of the data may be read-only, while other of the data may be rewritable.","Analog\/digital coder\/decoder (A\/D codec)  is also in communication with processor . A\/D codec  may receive analog signals from microphone , convert the analog signals to digital signals, and pass the digital signals to processor . Conversely, processor  may transmit digital signals to A\/D codec , which converts the digital signals to analog signals and passes the analog signals to speaker . Speaker  then emits sound based on the analog signals.","RF receiver\/transmitter  is operatively coupled to antenna . RF receiver\/transmitter  may, in accordance with conventional practices, comprise a combination of two or more different receive\/transmit modules (not separately shown) that operate in accordance with mutually different radio communication protocols to provide various services for the cellular telephone . For example, receiver\/transmitter  may operate in accordance with one radio communication protocol to provide conventional two-way service for cellular telephone , and may operate in accordance with another radio communication protocol to provide PoC service for cellular telephone .","Those in the art will understand that the block diagram of  is simplified in a number of ways. For example, all power and power management components of cellular telephone  are omitted from the diagram. Also, some embodiments may employ an internal architecture somewhat different or completely different from that shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600"]},"Architecture  includes operating system , which may comprise architecture  of . In such a case, application environment  and communications environment  may correspond, respectively, to the connectivity framework and the connectivity plug-ins of architecture . Generally, application environment  provides a platform by which another application environment  may interface with operating system . Application environment  may comprise a C, Java\u2122 or any other programming environment. As such, plug-in applications  may be written in Java or C for execution by cellular telephone. Plug-in applications  may also be written for the application interface provided by application environment .","Communications environment  provides plug-in applications  with access to the communications functionality of operating system . This functionality may include text messaging, Web browsing and of course telephone communication. Plug-in applications  may also transmit data and commands to and receive input from user interface drivers  for control of the user interfaces of telephone.","According to some embodiments, an application executing in the application environment  transmits and\/or receives communication history information via a remote server. Moreover, communication history information may be displayed to a user of the telephone. For example,  illustrates a mobile communication device  display of list\/search screen for communication events. The display may let a user easily and quickly determine information about other communication events that may be of interest. For example, the user might enter a telephone number, email address, name, or portion of a name into a search box . As a result, the display may be updated with a list of prior communication events matching the entered information (e.g., based on a request transmitted to, and response received from, a remote server)\u2014including events between \u201cArthur\u201d and other Smartphones.","A user might select one or more of the prior communication events to receive further details about that event. For example,  illustrates a mobile communication device  display of a detail screen for a communication event. In this example, the details of a particular prior email, including a communication type, direction, time, subject, and contact information are displayed to the user.","Instead of entering a search term into a search box as described with respect to , information about prior communication events might be automatically displayed to a user when or she initiates a new or current communication event (e.g., communication history data might be displayed in a native phone application during an incoming or outgoing call). For example,  illustrates a mobile communication device  display provided to a user who is currently connected to \u201cJOHN SMITH.\u201d Based on the current connection, the display includes a list of other communication events with John Smith, including other telephone calls, emails, and Facebook posts. Moreover, some of the other events are between John Smith and other users (e.g., the email message from the CEO to John Smith on Aug. 13, 2009).","In this way, embodiments may integrate phone communications (including email, voice, and SMS text communication) and Personal Information Management (PIM) apps (e.g., an address book, calendar, and to-do list) with a communication history at a mobile device. Embodiments may allow a user to quickly navigate between phone applications using the information currently being viewed (e.g., prior events) to related data such as CRM information (e.g., contacts, accounts, cases, and\/or data in social networks).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1","FIG. 10"],"b":["1000","1000","130","1000","1010","1020","1020"]},"The processor  is also in communication with an input device .

Additionally, data may be transmitted through communication network  using one or more currently- or hereafter-known network protocols, including but not limited to Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP).","Devices  through  are examples of some devices that may be a part of or in communication with communication network . As such, devices  through  may receive communication events, either as intended recipients or as network nodes for passing messages. Devices  through  include satellite transmitter\/receiver , landline telephone  having a subscriber line interface circuit to receive a telephone line (e.g., a cordless phone or a corded phone), communication tower , desktop computer or server , satellite  and portable computing device . Note the server  might be associated with, for example, a remote database containing CRM information (e.g., to be searched in response to a request received from a communication history application executing at the mobile communication device ). Any other suitable devices may be used as a transmitting device or a receiving device in conjunction with some embodiments.","The elements of system  may be connected differently than as shown. For example, some or all of the elements may be connected directly to one another. Embodiments may include elements that are different from those shown. Moreover, although the illustrated communication links between the elements of system  appear dedicated, each of the links may be shared by other elements. Elements shown and described as coupled or in communication with each other need not be constantly exchanging data. Rather, communication may be established when necessary and severed at other times or always available but rarely used to transmit data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["110","1200","1302","110","110"]},"The devices might then transmit a request to a remote server (e.g., including the other party's name and\/or telephone number) and, at , receive from the remote server information about one or more prior communication events. The prior communication events may, for example, be between other communication devices and the other party. At , the mobile communication device  displays information about the prior communication events to the first user (e.g., a list of prior events).","Thus, embodiments may automatically collect and upload communication history information from Smartphone clients to a server (e.g., email, voice calls, calendar entries, and\/or text messages). This information may then be available to search and to be used as related data for a contact or an account. Various types of different communications with the contact may be tracked, including from other parties in a company or team (e.g., depending on visibility parameters set by an operator or administrator). For example, Sally calls John, and Kevin calls John. When the systems searches for John in a mobile contact application, entries for both voice calls might be found and thus a \u201cshared communication history\u201d may be provided. As a result, a user may easily find past communications with a contact, along with the type of communication and possibly some or all of the content (e.g., the text of an SMS message).","The system may also collect information from other on-premise or on-demand applications (e.g., MICROSOFT Outlook and\/or Salesforce) as well as other types of communication (Skype and\/or VOIP communications). The information may, according to some embodiments, also be used for analytics on the server to evaluate various communications for the purpose of optimization and tracking (e.g., communication volume with a company, communication \u201ccost\u201d to close a deal, and\/or best practices).","By way of example, a client application might capture the following for a voice call: a user identifier, an incoming\/outgoing indication, a telephone number, a contact name, a timestamp, a duration, and\/or any notes associated with the call. Similarly, for an email message, a client application might capture: a user identifier, an incoming\/outgoing indication, to and from addresses, cc: addresses, a timestamp, a subject, a message body and\/or any attachments. For a calendar event, the client application might capture: a user identifier, a subject, a timestamp, a duration, and any notes associated with a meeting. The captured information may be automatically uploaded to a server immediately at the time of \u201ccreation\u201d for storage (e.g., on mail received\/sent, voice call received\/sent, appointment created, changed, or deleted). According to some embodiments, if the information cannot be sent to the server, it may be stored locally on the client and later uploaded together with the next communication event. According to some embodiments, only information that matches an existing contact in a CRM system is stored on the server. After being stored, the communication history may be searched from clients and may be displayed in a list\/detail screen, and may also be available as related data (e.g., related \u201ccommunications\u201d) for either a contact or an account.","The following illustrates various additional embodiments of the invention. These do not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments, and those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is applicable to many other embodiments. Further, although the following embodiments are briefly described for clarity, those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes, if necessary, to the above-described apparatus and methods to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications.","Although specific hardware and data configurations have been described herein, note that any number of other configurations may be provided in accordance with embodiments of the present invention (e.g., some of the information associated with the databases and engines described herein may be split or combined). Moreover, other types of communication applications and\/or search techniques may be used in addition to, or instead of, those described herein.","According to some embodiments, a current or prior communication event may be \u201cparsed\u201d to determine one or more context tokens that may be of interest to a user. Moreover, according to some embodiments, the tokens may be stored at the server and might include, for example, an event type (e.g., indicating which native application was associated with the event), an event date, an event time, a party identifier, an event subject, an event duration, attachment information, and\/or a \u201cparsed\u201d token key words or phrases (e.g., strings of characters that might be of interest to users at a later time).","According to some embodiments, a list of context tokens may be displayed to the user. For example, when a user receives an email, a context application might automatically parse text information associated with the email using a keyword list and display a set of tokens to the user. The set may be prioritized (e.g., with those tokens more likely to be of interest being placed near the top of the display). The user may then select one or more of the context tokens. Those selected tokens can be used to perform a search of prior communication events and the result of the search may be displayed to the user. Note that the parsing might be associated with a keyword list, an alias list (e.g., correlating nicknames and abbreviations), a language analyzer (e.g., using the syntax of one or more languages to identify potential tokens of interest), and\/or a speech-to-text converter.","For example, if an initiating event was an email from a client, the \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201csubject\u201d portions of the email might be used to search a communication history database for similar items. Such information might be associated with, for example, CRM systems, news sources, social networking systems, and\/or contact management systems. According to one embodiment, a mobile communication device makes a web service call to an application executing at a remote server using a preconfigured or known service access point in order to search for communication history data. Moreover, some or all of the embodiments described herein might be implemented using Application Programming Interfaces and\/or a web application framework for a programming language (e.g., Ruby on Rails).","The present invention has been described in terms of several embodiments solely for the purpose of illustration.
