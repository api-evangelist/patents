No. 61\/124,392 filed Apr. 15, 2008.","The present inventions relate generally to systems and methods for monitoring user interaction with a remote computer. More specifically, the present inventions relate to systems and methods for the remote tracking and replay of user interaction with a remote computer or webpage.","It is desirable for companies conducting business online, such as by operating business related webpages over the Internet, to be able to observe and\/or collect and analyze the interaction of certain users with their webpages. Commercial software for collecting and analyzing summary aspects of user interaction with webpages is known in the art. However, such known tools typically do not permit the collection or analysis of details of individual user interactions with a webpage, such as how an individual user completes a form on a webpage, or which parts of a webpage a user interacts with the most easily, or how a user navigates from one element of a webpage to another, for example.","Other software for remotely collecting and analyzing certain other details of individual user interactions with a webpage is known in the art. However, such known software typically requires that the host or service provider collect user interaction details and also provide the webpage to the user's computer. Such configurations increase the processing overhead on the webpage server and limits the ability of a third party service provider, such as a user interaction analysis service provider, from being able to collect user interaction data from the host server.","As a result of such limitations, it would be desirable to provide systems and methods that provide remote tracking and replay of user interaction with a webpage that allows for hosting and serving the webpage by one service provider, and collection and replay of user interaction with the webpage provided by a separate service provider, using computers separate from the service hosting and serving the webpage to the user.","It is an object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for remote tracking of user interaction with a webpage that addresses some of the limitations of the prior art.","Another object of the present invention is to provide systems and methods for remote replay of user interaction with a webpage that addresses some of the limitations of the prior art.","It is a further object of the invention to provide a computer readable medium and computer implemented method of remotely tracking and replaying user interaction with a webpage that provides for cross-domain transmission of user interaction data to a tracking computer separate from a host computer that hosts the webpage","Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a computer readable medium and computer implemented method of remotely tracking user interaction with a webpage or other multimedia resource that provides for real-time cross-domain transmission of user interaction data to a tracking computer, and real-time replay of user interaction data on one or more other computers in a collaborative environment.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a computer readable medium is provided, comprising executable instructions to request a webpage from a web server, request a tracking script from a tracking server, receive the webpage and tracking script and execute the tracking script, to capture, process and store user interaction data during browsing of the webpage, and to periodically transmit the user interaction data by means of dynamic script request or commonly available compression and transmission techniques, and to store the user interaction data on a tracking or replay server.","According to another embodiment, a computer readable medium is provided, comprising executable instructions to identify elements of a webpage, define listeners for each element, record user interaction with the webpage as user interaction data using the listeners, to process and store the data in a web browser storage, to packetize the data and encode the packetized data as a dynamic script request, and to transmit the dynamic script request to a tracking server.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, a computer implemented method for replaying a user's interaction with a webpage is provided, comprising requesting playback of a tracking record from a tracking server, requesting the webpage from a web server, receiving the webpage and requesting a tracking script from the tracking server, receiving and executing the tracking script, periodically requesting and receiving user interaction data from the tracking server by means of a dynamic script request, recreating an interaction visualization from the user interaction data, and playing back the interaction visualization on the webpage.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, a computer implemented method for replaying a user's interaction with a webpage is provided, comprising requesting playback of a video file from a replay or tracking server, and constructing the video file by requesting a replay script from the server, receiving and executing the replay script, periodically requesting and receiving user interaction data from the tracking or replay server through commonly available data compression and transmission applications, recreating an interaction visualization, such as movie from the user interaction data, and playing back the interaction visualization using commonly available video playback applications such as Windows Media Player or QuickTime.","Further advantages of the invention will become apparent when considering the drawings in conjunction with the detailed description.","Like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","50","10","50","50","20","30","40","50","10","10","50"]},"Similarly, web server  includes standard computing components known in the art for serving web pages to other computers over the network . In particular, web server  is connected to a webpage storage repository  which stores one or more webpage resources . Webpage storage repository  may include a conventional data storage device such as a hard disk or solid-state memory located with and connected directly to web server , or may include a remote data storage facility connected to web server . Webpage  may include a single document, such as a hypertext document commonly written in a markup language such as HTML or XML, or may include multiple documents such as a multi-page website, which may be accessed by a user computer  connected to the web server  through network . Webpage  may also include one or more scripts or commands for executing operations expressed in one or more known scripting languages such as JavaScript for example. Such scripts may be included in the webpage  when it is served to other computers by web server .","Tracking server  includes standard computing components known in the art for sending and receiving data to and from other computers connected to network .

In some embodiments, the script may include a function call to one or more applications that may be used to communicate interaction data across network . For example, one or more commonly found applications, such as Adobe Flash, may be used to compress and transmit data (e.g., in action message format (\u201cAMF\u201d format)).","Tracking storage repository  may also store one or more tracking records  including such interaction data, which may be received from or transmitted to one or more computers connected to tracking server  through network , such as a user computer  or an analysis computer , for example.","It will be appreciated from the above that tracking server  and tracking storage  may be constructed in many forms (not shown). For example, these resources may be constructed from multiple, physically remote, stand alone platforms, with functions that may be distributed across such resources or may be integrated into one or more \u201csingle platforms\u201d configured to perform the various different required functions as further described herein (e.g., through a partition or logical assignment).","Moreover, it will be further understood that server  and storage  may perform a variety of roles. For example, server  and storage  may receive tracking information regarding a user's interaction with a webpage as further described herein. However, server  and storage  may also perform certain other functions such as the replay of interaction data stored in storage  in response to a request for playback.","For example, a system analyst may desire to view user interactions at analysis computer  based on tracking data stored in storage . In this case, tracking server  may act as a \u201creplay server\u201d and fetch the tracking records from storage  and replay them for viewing on analysis computer . Thus, tracking server  and tracking storage  may be sometimes by referred to herein as \u201creplay server\u201d  or \u201creplay storage\u201d  depending on the role they perform.","Furthermore, it will be understood that server  and storage  may play dual roles, performing both replay and tracking functions as needed.

Operating system module  may also include instructions for standard computer operation, including receiving input from input devices such as a keyboard or mouse, and for displaying output in a graphical format on a monitor, for example.","Tracking server module  includes instructions for receiving a request for a tracking script from a user computer, accessing the tracking script, and transmitting a tracking script to the user computer. In one embodiment, the tracking script or other suitable tracking code may be stored in tracking storage repository . Furthermore, tracking server module  includes instructions for accessing tracking storage repository  to retrieve the tracking script or other suitable tracking code.","As shown in , tracking server module  may further include tracking server module  as a sub-module or embedded application. Tracking recording module  includes instructions to receive user interaction data transmitted by a user computer, and to record such data as one or more tracking records or data structures. In one embodiment, such tracking records may be stored in tracking storage repository , for example. In other embodiments, tracking recording module  may also include instructions for analyzing user interaction data received from a user computer.","Tracking server module  may also further include a tracking replay module  as a sub-module or embedded application.

In one embodiment, tracking replay module  may further include instructions to process and\/or transform user interaction data retrieved from one or more tracking records, prior to transmitting the data to the an analysis computer.","For example, in some embodiments, tracking replay module  may include code or routines that facilitate the playback of captured interaction data. It may also include the ability to create video or \u201cmovies\u201d from interaction data. For example, such interaction data may be combined, modified, extrapolated or otherwise \u201cstitched together\u201d as is known in the art to generate a video representation of the user's webpage interaction. Such video may be subsequently replayed using known commonly available video players such as Windows Media Player or QuickTime on a user's computer.","Tracking replay module  may further include code or routines that improve the quality or comprehensiveness of the replay experience. For example, data captured by recording module  may be in varying formats and\/or may be captured with limited metadata or background information. This may limit the quality and\/or ability to consistently or accurately replay user session data. Tracking replay module  may include routines that normalize the different data formats received by module  to permit accurate or consistent replay and may further include certain \u201cproxy\u201d routines to collect information to further facilitate and improve the playback experience.","Such normalization functions may include, but are not limited to: rewriting image URL's to point to the correct location of an image; document write calls are removed or masked; AJAX requests are rewritten to use custom AJAX class requests rather than native browser HTTP requests; JavaScript errors known to cause errors are rewritten using heuristics; known third party components such as JQuery are supplanted with customized versions that function better in the replay environment, etc.","Proxy routines may retrieve certain information such as environment, content, background, driver or other related webpage information such as a document object model \u201cDOM\u201d (the \u201cadditional features\u201d information) not related to user interaction. This information may not have been captured along with the user interaction due to the size of the information, based on the relatively static nature of the information, due the information already existing in tracking storage , due to the specific coding of the tracking script, or based on other factors.","In operation, such proxy routines may seek this additional features information from various sources such as the Internet or other network locations to facilitate replay of user interaction data. This may be referred to as a \u201cremote proxy.\u201d In some embodiments, such additional features data may be automatically obtained after associated user interaction data is transmitted to tracking storage . In other embodiments, such additional features data may be obtained when playback of that user interaction data is requested (or somewhat before, based on expected replay to prevent excessive system latency).","In some embodiments, the additional features data may have been captured at the time the user interaction data was captured. In this case, this information may be retrieved from tracking storage  when replay is requested. This may be referred to as a \u201clocal proxy.\u201d In other embodiments, some additional features information may be captured with user interaction data, while others are not. In this case, proxy routines in tracking replay module  may first poll storage  for the additional features data. If it is not present in storage , the information may be automatically sought as described above (i.e., start with a local proxy and expand to remote proxy, if necessary (or desired)).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2-4","FIG. 5"],"b":["510","24","20","24","10","114","10","24","20","50","20","216","24","22","20","216","114","30"]},"In such an embodiment, when web server  receives the request for webpage  from web browser module  on user computer , tracking tag code  may be incorporated in webpage  before it is sent to user computer . In a particular embodiment, tracking tag code  may comprise a <script src=\u201c . . . \u201d> tag which includes executable instructions for a web browser to request a script file from a particular source location, such as a JavaScript file from a particular Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or Internet Protocol (IP) address. However, any other suitable script or command structure may be used, if desired.","In another embodiment, the scripting tag may not be static included in webpage , but rather may be dynamically included by a user through a web browser plug in or proxy technique, using a tool such as Fiddler. In this case, the webpage interaction data may be recorded and replayed as further described herein. However, one benefit of this approach is the added ability to perform remote usability studies whereby certain web users may be selected to interact with specific websites to acquire interaction data related to specific website functions. This allows third parties to determine or otherwise assess the usability and functionality of given website of interest.","In the second processing operation  of , the user receives webpage  with tracking tag code  from web server . Processing operation  may be implemented using user web browser module  on user computer  to receive webpage  which may be served using web server module . Webpage  may be transmitted between web server  and user computer  by means of network , according to known methods.","Next, at processing step , the user web browser requests tracking script  from tracking server . Processing operation  may be implemented using user web browser module  on user computer , which communicates the request for tracking script  from user computer  to tracking server , according to known methods. In one embodiment, tracking tag code  incorporated in webpage  as received from web server  includes instructions executable by web browser module  to request tracking script  from tracking server .","In a preferred embodiment, the request for tracking script  from tracking server  according to operation  is made automatically by the user's web browser, such as web browser module , and is substantially transparent to the human user of user computer . In an alternative embodiment, tracking script  may be stored separate from tracking server , such as on another computer or storage repository which may be accessed by tracking server  upon receiving the request for tracking script  from user computer . According to a further alternative embodiment, tracking script  may be stored on a separate computer, and web server  may request and receive tracking script  from the separate computer in place of tracking server .","In the next processing operation  of , the user web browser receives tracking script  from tracking server , and executes tracking script . Processing operation  may be implemented using web browser module  executing on user computer , which may receive tracking script  from tracking server  by means of network , according to known methods. Preferably, executable instructions in tracking script  as received by the web browser on user computer  may be executed by any standard web browser application running on the user computer , such as represented by web browser module . Exemplary standard web browser applications may include Internet Explorer\u00ae from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., Firefox\u00ae from Mozilla Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., Safari\u2122 from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Opera\u2122 from Opera Software of San Diego, Calif., for example. In one embodiment, the executable instructions included in tracking script  may be implemented by a sub-module, such as tracking script module , executing within web browser module .","In one embodiment, upon receiving tracking script , web browser module  may add tracking script  to the webpage  by appending the executable instructions or other code in tracking script  at the top of the markup language code of webpage . Tracking script  may also be appended to webpage  by attaching it to webpage  or by referencing the tracking script file  in the markup language code of webpage , and then execute the tracking script together with webpage . In alternate embodiments, tracking script  may be stored separately from webpage  by web browser module , and may be executed by web browser module , or tracking script sub-module  separately from the execution (or display) of webpage , although such separate execution may take place simultaneously.","According to a further embodiment of the invention, tracking script  includes executable instructions which may be executed by a web browser application for capturing and processing user interaction data generated by user interaction with a webpage, and for transmitting such user interaction data to tracking server . Details of processing operations associated with such executable instructions according to one embodiment are described below with reference to .","Exemplary user interaction data which may be captured, processed and transmitted according to the instructions in tracking script  may include, but are not limited to: a user's movements and selections (such as mouse-clicks) of a pointing device such as a mouse or touchpad, scrolling, entry of text in or selection of menus, buttons, checkboxes, password fields, tables or SELECT fields, data related to the completion of forms or query boxes including initial values of form or text fields, which may include pixel coordinates of such form fields, and navigation (such as scrolling or clicking of links) while a user interacts with a webpage , for example. Additionally, one or more of: the network address, location, URL or identity of the host of the webpage  the user is browsing, the type and version of web browser application and operating system software the user is using, and the dimensions of the user's web browser viewing window, may also be incorporated in the user interaction data that is captured, processed and transmitted.","According to an additional embodiment, user interactions with dynamic elements which may be included in webpage , such as interactions with rich AJAX (involving DHTML and JavaScript) elements, Adobe Flash\u2122 elements, or other dynamic elements which may be part of webpage  may also be captured as user interaction data. Such data may qualify as the additional features data described above in connection with .","In an alternative embodiment of the invention directed to tracking a user's interaction with video or dynamic multimedia applications, such as Adobe Flash\u2122 and Adobe Flex\u2122 applications or movies, processing operation  may include a user request for a Flash\u2122 or Flex\u2122 application or website comprising such an application from a web server . Following such user request, the user may receive a Flash\u2122 or Flex\u2122 application or movie (such as in the form of a .swf file) from web server  which includes a tracking code portion, analogous to tracking script  referenced in processing operations  and . Such tracking code portion of the Flash\u2122 or Flex\u2122 application of movie received by the user computer includes instructions for tracking a user's interaction with the application or movie, such as described above in reference to tracking script , which may be executed by the user's web browser, or an ancillary application, such as a Flash\u2122 plug-in application on the user's computer, for example.","In the next processing operation  of , the web browser captures, processes and stores user interaction data during browsing of a webpage . Processing operation  may be implemented using web browser module  on user computer , which may execute instructions in tracking script  to capture, process and store various types of user interaction data, such as the exemplary types of user interaction data described above, generated while the user browses and interacts with webpage . The capture, processing and storing of user interaction data generated while a user browses website  may be accomplished by any suitable method such as those well known in the art.","In a preferred embodiment, the instructions in tracking script  for capturing, processing and storing user interaction data during a user's browsing of webpage  may be executed by a standard web browser application, and optimized for using standard features and instruction sets commonly or universally supported by industry standard web browser applications. Further, processed user interaction data may be stored in the cache memory of the web browser application, such as in the web browser module  of user computer . In an exemplary embodiment, tracking script  may comprise instructions using JavaScript which are executed by web browser module  to capture, process and cache user interaction data while the user browses webpage .","In some embodiments, the capture process may involve capturing enough data to recreate the website as actually seen by the user. For example, if there was a special advertisement, promotion, pop-up or other banner present on the site it may be desired to capture that information to fully recreate it. One way this may be accomplished is by capturing a document object model (DOM) describing the webpage itself. The DOM may be serialized (e.g., converted into a text string) and subsequently transmitted as described below in connection with step . In some embodiments, to avoid transmitting the entire webpage repeatedly, the DOM may be compressed using a hashing algorithm or represented by a shorter data structure (e.g., a 32 bit data structure) and compared against other known DOMs that have previously been saved. In the case where the DOM has been previously saved, it is unnecessary to transmit it again, and pointer to the previously saved version may be used instead.","In an alternative embodiment of the invention directed to tracking a user's interaction with dynamic multimedia applications, such as Adobe Flash\u2122 and Adobe Flex\u2122 applications or movies, processing operation  may comprise the user's web browser or ancillary application (such as a Flash\u2122 plug-in application) capturing, and processing user interaction data during the user's interaction with a Flash\u2122 or Flex\u2122 application or movie, for example.","At processing operation , the user's web browser periodically transmits cached user interaction data to tracking server  via a script request. Processing operation  may be implemented using web browser module  on user computer , which may periodically transmit cached user interaction data over network  to tracking server  by means of a script request.","Such a transmission request may be initiated by the browser based on predefined criteria or may be triggered by certain behavior of the user. For example, if the number of navigation maneuvers with a certain webpage exceeds a certain threshold, or if the number of webpages visited exceeds a certain number, the user data may be transmitted and saved. In some embodiments where a triggering event occurs, the user's browser may be instructed to save the interaction data rather than immediately transmitting the data, so that it may be collected subsequently in the future.","In one embodiment of the invention, data may be transmitted to server  in compressed format using commonly available compression and transmission applications. For example, in one embodiment, this may include the use of ADOBE Flash software. Using this approach, the stored interaction data may be converted in to FLASH format (AS3 byte array via ExternalInterface) and compressed using GZIP. This information may then be transmitted to tracking server  using an Action Message Format (AMF) request. From a high level, this may be thought of as converting user interaction data into a Flash movie and transmitting it as such to server .","In another embodiment of the invention, the transmission of stored user interaction data from web browser module  to tracking server  may be accomplished using a cross-domain dynamic script request, (which may also be referred to as a cross-site scripting request). This configuration may be used in instances where the compression and transmission technique or application described above is not feasible. Using the cross-domain approach, the executable instructions in tracking script  include instructions to periodically request a script file from tracking computer , during the user's interaction with the webpage . The user's interactions are sent along with the script request. In both of the above transmission cases, should the data fail to be saved, a failure indicator is returned to the requestor and the data will be sent again at a later time.","In executing such instructions, the user interaction data stored during operation  while the user browses webpage  may be periodically incorporated into a script request, and then transmitted to the tracking server  as part of a dynamic script request. According to standardized functionality supported by industry standard web browser applications, exemplified by web browser module , such a dynamic script request may be transmitted across domains to the tracking server  even though tracking server  may typically not be located at the same network domain or site as web server . In such a manner, user interaction data captured while browsing webpage  received from web server  located at a first domain on network  may be periodically transmitted cross-domain to tracking server  which may be located at a second domain on network .","In one embodiment, webpage  may include dynamic content which may typically be changed periodically such that if webpage  were received from web server  at a subsequent time, the content of at least a portion of webpage  may have changed. In such an embodiment, one or more portions of webpage  which contain dynamic content likely to be changed over time may also be transmitted to tracking server  along with cached user interaction data according to processing operation . One or more portions of the markup code of webpage , such as HTML and\/or XML code, corresponding to such periodically changing dynamic content may be transmitted to tracking server , while static elements of webpage  such as static images or other static content are not transmitted to tracking server , in order to reduce the amount of information required to be transferred by dynamic script request. Such information may be obtained by the proxy routines or applications further described herein.","In another embodiment, additional information related to the content and structure of webpage  such as a DOM may be transmitted to tracking server  along with cached user interaction data as part of operation , such as a copy of JavaScript elements of webpage , pixel coordinates of one or more on-screen elements of webpage , or a list of forms and form fields and their types and attributes, for example.","In an alternative embodiment of the invention directed to tracking a user's interaction with dynamic multimedia applications, such as Adobe Flash\u2122 and Adobe Flex\u2122 applications or movies, processing operation  may comprise the web browser transmitting user interaction data to tracking server  via an ancillary web browser application such as a Flash\u2122 plug-in, for example. In such an embodiment, transmission of interaction data may be streamed to tracking server  in real-time, or may be stored in the web-browser or ancillary application for delayed and\/or packetized transmission to tracking server . In such an embodiment, the next processing operation may include tracking server  storing user interaction data received from the user's web browser, substantially analogous to processing operation  as described below.","In the last processing operation  of , the tracking server may  store user interaction data periodically received from the user's web browser. Processing operation  may be implemented using tracking recording module  of tracking server computer , which may store user interaction data periodically received from the web browser of user computer . In one embodiment, such periodically received user interaction data may be persistently and recoverably stored in a tracking storage repository , as tracking record  (or other data structure), according to any suitable known method, such as through the use of a database, wherein tracking record  may be stored in one or more accessible database records, for example.","User interaction data stored as tracking records may alternatively be stored in a separate computer or storage repository which may be accessible by tracking server . In embodiments where information in addition to user interaction data, such as dynamic content of webpage , or other data relating to the content or structure of webpage  are transmitted to tracking server , such additional information may also be stored by tracking server  in processing operation , and may be stored as part of a tracking record  which includes user interaction data, or alternatively may be stored in a separate record from such user interaction data.","According to a further embodiment, in a case where a user ends a session of browsing or interacting with webpage  before all of the user's interaction with webpage  has been captured, processed and transmitted to tracking server , tracking script  may additionally comprise instructions to save any remaining cached user interaction data in a web browser offline storage memory, and to save information identifying the user browsing session from which the user interaction data was captured. Such browser offline storage memory may be comprised in web browser module  of user computer , or alternatively, may be comprised elsewhere in memory  of user computer .","In such an embodiment, tracking script  may further comprise instructions to transmit any such remaining user interaction data saved in browser offline storage to tracking server  if the user subsequently visits another webpage, and to transmit the information identifying the user browsing session saved with the remaining interaction data, so that the remaining user interaction data may be associated with other interaction data from the same browsing session for storage on the tracking server .","In yet another embodiment, user interaction data received by tracking server  may be subjected to data analysis and\/or processing before or after being stored as tracking record . Data analysis may include calculation of certain analytics which may include, but are not limited to: calculating the distance traveled by a user's mouse on webpage , calculating completion rate and\/or user time spent on a form on webpage , calculating the cumulative amount of time a user's mouse spent on various parts of webpage , and compiling a visual representation of user interaction with webpage , for example. This may further include tracking which portions of the webpage were visible to a user at what times.","Data processing may include, for example, formatting user interaction data for storage and\/or compressing user interaction data. In such embodiments, the results of such analysis and\/or data processing may be stored as part of or in association with tracking record , or alternatively, may be stored separate from tracking record . In a particular embodiment, certain statistical reports relating to user interaction may be generated. For example, a heatmap visual representation of user interaction may be created wherein an aggregate of a user's (or multiple users) interaction with webpage  are represented graphically as colored regions overlaid on webpage , each region corresponding to relative concentrations of users' mouse movements and\/or clicks on the underlying portions of the webpage , may be compiled from user interaction data received by tracking server . Such statistical reports may be user-defined or pre-programmed by a tracking service provider or other third parties.","According to yet a further embodiment, such data analysis and\/or data processing may be performed on a computer separate from tracking server , such as a processing server, for example, which may be connected to tracking server  to send and receive user interaction data, such as by means of network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["114","10","34","10","20","24","114","610","24","20","24","24","610","24","610","24","610"]},"The next processing operation  of  is to define listeners or other event based triggers for each webpage element indentified in operation  above. In one embodiment of the invention, listeners may be implemented according to any suitable method known in the art for monitoring changes in states and\/or values of the indexed elements of website  that occur while a user is browsing website . In a preferred embodiment, such listeners are implemented according to standard features and\/or instruction sets commonly supported by standard web browser applications, such as Internet Explorer\u00ae from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., and Firefox\u00ae from Mozilla Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., Safari\u2122 from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Opera\u2122 from Opera Software of San Diego, Calif., for example.","The next processing operation  of  records user interaction with webpage  as interaction data, using listeners defined in operation  above. In one embodiment of the invention, as a user interacts with webpage , such as by browsing or otherwise using webpage  displayed on user computer , data detected by defined listeners may be recorded as user interaction data by web browser module .","Interaction data may be recorded in a buffer within web browser module . Such a buffer may be implemented as cookies, DOM storage, or any other suitable buffer configuration known in the art. When interaction data is transmitted to server , a response may be sent back to the browser such that only the portion of the interaction data confirmed as received by server  is deleted or overwritten. If certain interaction data is not confirmed as properly received, it will be sent again at a later time. This improves the likelihood that substantially all data is properly received at the server, ensuring that any replay of that data will accurately reflect the user's experience.","It will be understood that such interaction data may be recorded on an ongoing basis as user interaction with webpage  proceeds over time, and that such interaction data may be recorded in a suitable buffer within web browser module  on an ongoing basis. A suitable web browser buffer may allow interaction data to be read from the buffer at the same time as additional interaction data may continue to be recorded to the buffer, as is well known in the art. In an exemplary embodiment, a suitable buffer within web browser module  may be implemented by using a JavaScript Array or a JavaScript String, for example.","The next processing operation  of  is to process interaction data and store it in web browser storage. In a preferred embodiment, the interaction data previously recorded in a buffer in web browser module  during operation  may be processed to reduce the total amount of interaction data retained while maintaining a substantially accurate representation of user interaction with website , and the resulting retained interaction data may be stored in a memory cache within web browser module .","According to one embodiment, interaction data may be processed according to any suitable method or methods known in the art for reducing the amount of interaction data retained while maintaining a substantially accurate representation of user interaction, including, but not limited to: eliminating data relating to redundant events, compressing data relating to substantially similar events (such as by basic run length encoding or other techniques for example), and throttling recurring data such as mouse\/cursor\/pointer trace location data to a selected data rate, for example. The retained interaction data resulting from such data processing may be stored in a standard web browser cache memory used for storing other types of user browsing-related data and as supported by standard web browser applications known in the art.","The next processing operation  of  packetizes stored interaction data for transmission. Stored interaction data may be divided or packaged into one or more interaction data packets using any suitable technique or method known in the art. In one embodiment, stored interaction data stored in a memory cache within web browser module  may be divided or packaged into one or more interaction data packets in substantially the order it was recorded during the user's interaction with webpage .","For example, such interaction data may be divided into one or more data packets each of a size suitable for transmission as an AMF request. In some embodiments, such data packets may be arranged such that they may be transmitted as streaming content. In yet other embodiments, stored interaction data may be divided or packaged into one or more interaction data packets each of a size suitable for transmission as a dynamic script request by the particular web browser application running on user computer .","Next, at step , if one or more commonly available data compression and transmission applications are present on computer , such interaction data may be compressed at step  using those applications. For example, in one embodiment, this may include the use of ADOBE Flash software. Using this approach, the stored and packetized interaction data may be converted in to FLASH format (AS3 byte array via ExternalInterface) and compressed using GZIP. At step  this information may then be transmitted to tracking server  using an AMF request. In some embodiments, tracking server  may be a server using BlazeDS or AMFPHP.","In other embodiments, where suitable compression and transmission applications are not present on computer  at step , such stored interaction data may be packaged into one or more interaction data packets, each of a substantially standard size suitable for transmission as a dynamic script request by standard commonly known web browser applications, such as Internet Explorer\u00ae from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., and Firefox\u00ae from Mozilla Corporation of Mountain View, Calif., Safari\u2122 from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., and Opera\u2122 from Opera Software of San Diego, Calif., for example.","With this alternate approach, processing operation  encodes an interaction data packet as a dynamic script request. The interaction data packet may be encoded as a script object by any suitable known encoding means, and a URL identifying tracking server  as the location of the script object may be added to define a dynamic script request. In such a manner, the interaction data packet may be incorporated in a dynamic script request to the tracking server . The encoding method used to encode the interaction data packet, and the format of the dynamic script request created in operation  may preferably be supported by standard web browser applications, and the encoding process is preferably implemented by web browser module  running on user computer .","The last processing operation  of  transmits the dynamic script request to the tracking server . The dynamic script request created in operation  and incorporating the user interaction data packet may be allowed by standard web browser applications to be transmitted to the tracking server  even though tracking server  may typically not be located at the same network domain as web server  from which webpage  was served to the user computer . Although the transmission of data by a web browser application across domains would not normally be supported due to Same Origin security policies included in all standard web browser applications known in the art, the transmission of user interaction data by means of a cross-domain dynamic script request allows for the transmission of user interaction data by the web browser application to a tracking server  that is not located at the same network domain as the web server .","In an alternative embodiment, an interaction data packet may be encoded as a dynamic request for a hidden image file in processing operation , rather than a dynamic script request. In such a case, tracking server  may be set as the source location or URL for the requested image file. In such an embodiment, processing operation  would then comprise transmitting the dynamic image request to the tracking server  as a cross-domain dynamic image request.","In a further alternative embodiment of the invention directed to tracking a user's interaction with a webpage  and playing back the user's interaction in real-time for display to one or more other users in a collaborative environment, processing operations  and  may include encoding the user's interaction data as a real-time data stream suitable for transmission to the tracking server  using COMET asynchronous data transfer methods, Adobe Flash\u2122 or HTTP \u201cGet\u201d requests.","In such an embodiment, processing operation  may comprise transmitting the encoded user interaction data to tracking server  in real-time such as by streaming of interaction data using comet methods or Adobe Flash. Upon receipt of the streamed interaction data by tracking server , the real-time interaction data may be played back in real-time from the tracking server  to one or more other computers, such that the recorded user interaction with webpage  is displayed on the other computers, allowing for collaboration. Such embodiment may be particularly suited to applications where one or more collaborative users wish to view the interaction of a single user with webpage , such as for assisting the user in completing an operation on the webpage  for example, or for collaborative applications where two or more users wish to view each other's interaction with a webpage  simultaneously in realtime, such as for collaborating on a game on webpage  for example. Optionally, in such embodiment, executable instructions for collaboratively tracking and replaying user interaction with a webpage as described above may be provided or exposed as an application programming interface (API) for integration into existing applications, such as web applications and\/or webpages, for example, to provide for the recording, transmission and replay of user interaction data for the purposes of collaboration between two or more users.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2-4","FIG. 7"],"b":["710","36","30","36","30","40"]},"In another embodiment of the invention, the analysis user may request playback of the tracking record  from replay server  using a commonly available web browser application executing on an analysis computer  to access a playback webpage served by replay server  and selecting tracking record  for playback.","Analysis computer  may be substantially similarly configured to user computer  shown in , and reference to computer  may be substituted for analysis computer  hereafter.

Tracking record  may include user interaction data recorded from the interaction of a user while browsing webpage , and has been previously transmitted to replay server  as described above, and stored as tracking record . Tracking record  may be stored on any suitable storage medium accessible to replay server , such as tracking storage repository  for example.","If the tracking record exists in multimedia format, that record may be provided to computer  and replayed as such. If tracking record  remains as a set of interaction data when the playback request is made, that data may be replayed and converted to a suitable multimedia file format at replay server , and then provided to analysis computer  after conversion.","For example, this may be accomplished using any known suitable multimedia conversion technique or through a \u201cmovie maker\u201d application that is configured to replay tracking record  in an embedded browser hosted by replay server  as described below in steps -. Screenshots of the browser replaying the interaction data may be captured at selected or predetermined intervals and combined as is known in the art to create a video file. Once converted to a video file, the interaction data may be subsequently stored on replay server  in that format so that future conversion is not required. Once in such a video format, the interaction is substantially independent of replay server  and may be freely transferred to standard computing devices for further playback or analysis.","In the case where web browser replay is performed, the next processing operation  of , the analysis web browser may be redirected to request the original webpage  from web server  if it is unavailable from tracking server . In the next processing operation  of , the web browser receives webpage  from web server  and requests tracking script  from replay server .

Optionally, any cross-domain AJAX request may also be used to implement processing operation .","According to another embodiment, the interaction data requested and received from tracking server  according to processing operation  may comprise user interaction data substantially as it was received transmitted by a user computer  during recording, and substantially as it was stored as tracking record .","According to a preferred alternative embodiment, the interaction data requested and received from tracking server  according to processing operation  may be transformed or otherwise processed by tracking server  prior to its receipt by the web browser of analysis computer . In such preferred embodiment, tracking server  may process user interaction data stored as tracking record  prior to its transmission to the web browser of analysis computer , in order to improve the quality of playback of the user interaction data on the analysis computer. Such processing may include one or more of: conversion of the format of user interaction data such as for improving transmission or display of user interaction data, and interpolation of discontinuous user interaction data to improve continuity such as using various known methods (such as Bezier Curve interpolation methods) to interpolate mouse\/cursor\/pointer movement data to improve continuity of movement, for example.
