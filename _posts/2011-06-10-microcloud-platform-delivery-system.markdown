The present application is further related by subject matter to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/767,010 filed on Apr. 26, 2010 and entitled \u201cCloud Platform Architecture\u201d, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/094,500 filed on Apr. 26, 2011 and entitled \u201cPolicy Engine for Cloud Platform\u201d and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/094,521 filed on Apr. 26, 2011 and entitled \u201cRapid Updating of Cloud Applications\u201d, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","\u201cPlatform-as-a-Service\u201d (also commonly referred to as \u201cPaaS\u201d) generally describes a suite of technologies provided by a service provider as an integrated solution that enables a web developer (or any other application developer) to build, deploy and manage the life cycle of a web application (or any other type of networked application). One primary component of PaaS is a \u201ccloud-computing platform\u201d which is a network (e.g., Internet, etc.) infrastructure run and maintained by the service provider upon which developed web applications may be deployed. By providing the hardware resources and software layers required to robustly run a web application, the cloud computing platform enables developers to focus on the development of the web application, itself, and leave the logistics of scalability and other computing and storage resource requirements (e.g., data storage, database access, processing power, facilities, power and bandwidth, etc.) to the cloud computing platform (e.g., at a cost charged by the service provider). A service provider may additionally provide a plug-in component to a traditional IDE (i.e., integrated development environment) that assists a developer who creates web applications using the IDE to properly structure, develop and test such applications in a manner that is compatible with the service provider's cloud computing platform. Once the developer completes a web application using the IDE, the plug-in component assists the developer in deploying the web application into the cloud computing platform.","However, due to complexities in providing flexible and scalable cloud computing platforms, PaaS is offered by few service providers. Current offerings of cloud computing platforms provide limited choices in the computer languages, application frameworks, runtime environments, available services and other technology options that may be selected to create a web application that can be launched in the cloud computing platform. For example, a cloud computing platform that only supports a runtime environment such as .NET\u00ae runtime environment made available by Microsoft would not be suitable for an enterprise with a technology development policy that requires development of web applications using an open source runtime environment such as the Apache Tomcat\u2122 application server. Furthermore, software layers of current cloud computing platforms are inextricably coupled to the hardware resources (e.g., servers, storage, data centers, etc.) upon which they are built, making any enterprise requested customization, modification and\/or portability of functionality prohibitive. Such inflexibility and limited choices make adoption of current PaaS more suitable for small start-up companies than for sophisticated enterprises that need to address issues such as governance, security, privacy and higher levels of control over web applications (service level requirements, scalability, fault tolerance etc.).","One or more embodiments of the present invention provide a cloud computing environment for deployment of web applications that can be developed utilizing any choice of application framework (e.g., Ruby on Rails\u2122, Spring\u2122, etc.), any choice of runtime environment (e.g., Apache Tomcat\u2122 application server, Microsoft .NET\u00ae, etc.) and any choice of programming language (e.g., Java, Ruby, Scala, Python, etc.). The cloud computing environment further decouples the software-based components of the cloud computing environment that provide web application deployment functionality from any hardware-based infrastructure platform upon which the software-based components might be built. As such, instances of the cloud computing environment can be launched on top of any type of hardware resource, from a single laptop to an enterprise-wide data center. The flexibility of such a cloud computing environment can lead to increased adoption at all levels, from the single developer to the entire enterprise.","One method, according to an embodiment, delivers the cloud computing environment as a self-contained virtual machine disk image configured to launch in a virtualization environment. According to the method, a cloud computing platform provider first receives a request for the cloud computing environment. In response to the request (or alternatively, in a pre-processing phase) the cloud computing platform provider composes a virtual machine disk image comprising (i) at least one installed server providing a service accessible to the web application (e.g., a database server such as a MySQL\u2122 database), (ii) a runtime environment configured to deploy the web application (e.g., Apache Tomcat\u2122 server), (iii) a controller component configured to receive the web application, bind the service to the web application and package the web application into a deployment package; (iv) a deployment agent component configured to receive the deployment package from the controller component and deploy the web application into the runtime environment, (v) a router component configured to route web application requests to the runtime environment, and (vi) an address and discovery layer component configured to propagate messages among the server, runtime environment, controller component, deployment agent component and router component. In response to the request, the cloud computing platform provider provides the virtual machine disk image. This virtual machine disk image may be attached to any virtual machine, whether running on a personal computing device such as a laptop or in an infrastructure-as-a-service service provider to provide a cloud computing environment that is automatically configured to receive and deploy a web application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["100","102","102","104","106","102","100","102","108","100"]},"Cloud computing platform provider  provides service provider  an infrastructure platform  upon which a cloud computing environment  may be executed. In the particular embodiment of , infrastructure platform  comprises hardware resources , such as servers to and one or more storage array networks (SAN), such as SAN , which are configured in a manner to provide a virtualization environment  that supports the execution of a plurality of virtual machines across servers to . As further detailed below, these virtual machines provide the various services and functions that make up cloud computing environment .","Virtualization environment  of  additionally includes an orchestration component  (e.g., implemented as a process running in a virtual machine in one embodiment) that monitors the infrastructure resource consumption levels and requirements of cloud computing environment  (e.g., by monitoring communications routed through addressing and discovery layer  as further detailed below) and provides additional infrastructure resources to cloud computing environment as needed or desired. For example, if cloud computing environment  requires additional virtual machines to host newly deployed web applications or to scale currently running web applications to support peak demands, orchestration component  can initiate and manage the instantiation of virtual machines on servers to to support such needs. In one example implementation of an embodiment similar to that of , virtualization environment  may be implemented by running VMware ESX\u2122 based hypervisor technologies on servers to provided by VMware, Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif. (although it should be recognized that any other virtualization technologies, including Xen\u00ae and Microsoft Hyper-V virtualization technologies may be utilized consistent with the teachings herein).","In the embodiment of , cloud computing environment  supports an application execution space  that comprises a plurality of virtual machines (referred to as container VMs to ) instantiated to host deployed web applications. For example, the deployment by enterprise  of a web application  on the cloud computing platform of service provider  results in the hosting of web application  in container VM of application execution space  at cloud computing platform provider .","Web application  can access a set of base services  (e.g., run in one or more virtual machines) provided by cloud computing environment  as well as third-party services such as those that may be provided directly by service provider  (e.g., custom database , CRM service , etc.). For example, a relational database service (e.g., MySQL, etc.), monitoring service, background task scheduler, logging service, messaging service, memory object caching service and the like may comprise base services  in one embodiment. A service provisioner  (e.g., run in one or more virtual machines) serves as a communications intermediary between these available services (e.g., base services  and other third party provided services such as custom database  and CRM service ) and other components of cloud computing environment  (e.g., cloud controller , health manager , router , container VMs to , etc.) and assists with the task of provisioning or binding such available services to web applications during the web application deployment process.  depicts a component architecture for service provisioner  of cloud computing environment , according to one embodiment. In the embodiment of , service provisioner  maintains a shim or similar stub component (sometimes also referred to as a \u201cservice gateway\u201d) for each service available in cloud computing environment  (see, e.g., shims , and , respectively, for base services and , and CRM service ). Each shim component itself maintains service provisioning data for its corresponding service, such as a description of the service type, service characteristics (e.g., multi-tenancy versus single tenancy, etc.), login credentials for the service (e.g., root username, password, etc.), network address and port number of the service, and the like. Each shim component is configured to communicate with its corresponding service utilizing an API or other similar communications protocol that is supported by such service. For example, in order to bind web application  to base service during deployment, service provisioner  may direct shim to log into base service and generate new credentials (e.g., a new username and password) specifically for web application  so that web application  can directly log into and access base service with such credentials during its execution. In certain embodiments, service provisioner  further comprises an addressing and discovery layer communications client  that enables service provisioner  to communicate with other components of cloud computing environment  through addressing and discovery layer . In an alternative embodiment, service provisioner  may communicate with other components of cloud computing environment  through HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) or other network protocols rather than through addressing and discovery layer , for example, to eliminate any compatibility requirements of third party services such as customer database  and CRM service  to utilize communication protocols of addressing and discovery layer .","It should be recognized that service provisioner  as depicted in  is only one embodiment of a communications intermediary between available services and other components of cloud computing environment  and that alternative embodiments may be implemented consistent with the teachings herein. For example,  depicts an alternative embodiment of service provisioner , as an abstraction layer of independently operating shim components. Each shim component (e.g., to to ) operates, for example, as an independent process and comprises its own addressing and discovery layer communications client (e.g., , and , respectively) to interact with addressing and discovery layer  (although, in alternative embodiments, such shim components may communicate with other components of cloud computing environment  through HTTP or other network protocols rather than utilizing such an address and discovery layer communications client ). In an embodiment similar to that of , shim components may be implemented in different locations, so long as they are able to effectively communicate with address and discovery layer . For example, shim for CRM service  may be implemented as a process running on a server at service provider  while shim components and for base services and , respectively, may be implemented as processes running within allocated virtual machines at cloud computing service provider .","Returning to , addressing and discovery layer  provides a common interface through which components of cloud computing environment , such as service provisioner , cloud controller , health manager , router  and container VMs to in application execution space , can communicate and receive notifications. For example, in one embodiment, service provisioner  may communicate through addressing and discovery layer  to broadcast the availability of services and to propagate service provisioning data for such services during deployment of web applications in cloud computing environment  (in other embodiments, service provisioner  may communicate with other components of cloud computing environment  through HTTP or other network protocols rather than address and discovery layer ). Similarly, container VM may broadcast a notification through addressing and discovery layer  to indicate the successful deployment of web application  and to provide routing information (e.g., hostname and network address information, bound port number, etc.) for the successfully deployed web application . In one embodiment, addressing and discovery layer  is implemented as a message brokering service (e.g., running in one or more virtual machines) that defines a common protocol and message format through which components of cloud computing environment  can exchange messages and broadcast notifications and other information. In such an embodiment, the components of cloud computing environment  establish a connection with the message brokering service (e.g., also sometimes referred to as \u201csubscribing\u201d to the message brokering service), for example, through known authentication techniques (e.g., passwords, etc.) and, once connected to the message brokering service, can provide, receive and request messages, notifications and other similar information to and from other components that have also subscribed to the message brokering system. Examples of a message brokering service that may be used in an embodiment is RabbitMQ\u2122 which is based upon the AMPQ (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) open protocol standard or NATS\u2122, an open source publish-subscribe messaging system. It should be recognized, however, that alternative interfaces and communication schemes may be implemented for addressing and discovery layer  other than such a message brokering service.","Cloud controller  (e.g., run in one or more virtual machines) orchestrates the deployment process for web applications that are submitted to cloud computing environment  for deployment. Cloud controller  receives web applications submitted to cloud computing environment  and, as further detailed below, interacts with other components of cloud computing environment  to bind available services required by submitted web applications and package web applications for transmission to available container VMs (e.g., container VMs to ) for deployment. In the embodiment depicted in , web applications, such as web application , received by cloud controller  may be developed by an application developer  in enterprise  using an integrated development environment (IDE)  installed on the developer's laptop or terminal IDE  includes an installed plug-in provided by service provider  that facilitates the development and submission of web application  to cloud computing environment . In order to provide enterprise  the ability to impose enterprise-wide rules on web applications (e.g., permitted accessible services, computing resource consumption limitations, etc.), service provider  may also provide to enterprise  a policy engine  to be run, for example, as a proxy server within enterprise . As depicted in the embodiment of , policy engine  is situated in the communications path between the cloud controller  and entities that communicate with cloud computing environment  through cloud controller ), such as application developer  or an administrator , as further discussed below. For example, policy engine  intercepts web applications submitted for deployment by developer  and reviews the requested requirements of such submitted web applications, prior to releasing them to cloud computing environment  for deployment. Administrator  in enterprise  is able to set policies for policy engine  as well as review analytics for web applications currently deployed in cloud computing environment  through a policy engine user interface  that communicates with policy engine  and can be accessed via a web browser or other client application. In one embodiment, policy engine  is further able to provide the same or similar functions as cloud controller  locally within enterprise . It should be recognized that policy engine  is an optional feature that may be provided by service provider  to enterprise  and that alternative embodiments or implementations may not utilize or include policy engine . For example, as depicted in , application developer  and administrator  may communicate directly with cloud controller , without utilizing policy engine . Furthermore, it should be recognized that in alternative embodiments, policy engine  may be situated at any location within the communications path to cloud controller , for example, within service provider  or cloud platform provider  rather than enterprise , as is depicted in . It should further be recognized that multiple policy engines , enforcing policies for different organizations, may be situated between in communications paths to cloud controller , for example, both within enterprise  and service provider . Cloud computing environment  further comprises a health manager  (e.g., run in one or more virtual machines) that tracks and maintains the \u201chealth\u201d of cloud computing environment  by monitoring messages broadcast on addressing and discovery layer  by other components of cloud computing environment . For example, health manager  may notice the failure of an instance of a deployed web application and automatically broadcast a request to cloud controller  to re-start the web application. Similarly, health manager  may be further configured to itself initiate the re-starting of failed available services or other components of cloud computing environment  (e.g., cloud controller , service provisioner , router , etc.).","Once cloud controller  successfully orchestrates the deployment of web application  in container VM , an enterprise customer  can access web application , for example, through a web browser or any other appropriate client application residing on a computer laptop or other computer terminal. Router  (e.g., run in one or more virtual machines) receives the web browser's access request (e.g., a uniform resource locator or URL) and routes the request to container VM which hosts web application . More generally, router  maintains mappings in internal routing tables between URLs and deployed web applications in order to properly route URL requests from customers to the appropriate container VMs hosting the requested web applications (as well as maintain load balancing among web application instances, etc.). These mappings are received by router  through address and discovery layer , as detailed further below, when a container VM successfully deploys a web application and thus broadcasts routing information (e.g., hostname, network address information, port number, etc.) for the web application through addressing and discovery layer .","It should be recognized that the embodiment of  is merely exemplary and that alternative cloud computing architectures may be implemented consistent with the teachings herein. For example, while  implements cloud computing environment  on an infrastructure platform  hosted by cloud computing platform provider , it should be recognized that cloud computing environment  may be implemented by entities other than cloud computing platform provider , on top of any type of hardware infrastructure.  depicts an alternative embodiment of a cloud computing architecture in which infrastructure platform  is provided by service provider  itself. Furthermore, unlike , in which infrastructure platform  comprises a virtualization environment  in which components of cloud computing environment  are implemented as processes or daemons running in one or more virtual machines, the components of cloud computing environment  in  are run in a non-virtualized infrastructure platform , as processes or daemons directly on hardware resources , such as servers to .","It should be recognized that embodiments may configure cloud computing environment  and infrastructure platform  in a loosely coupled manner with communication between computing environment  and infrastructure  only occurring through orchestration component  of infrastructure platform  which monitors hardware resource consumption by connecting to addressing and discovery layer ). In such loosely coupled embodiments, it should be recognized that cloud computing environment  may be implemented on any infrastructure platform, including on a laptop or personal computer (e.g., in which case, each component of cloud computer environment  runs as a separate process or daemon on the laptop or personal computer).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 2A and 2B"],"b":["134","300","142","140","142","302","134","134","304","306","142","134","308","306","308","310","134","112","112","312","134","132","130","314","130","132","316"]},"Upon receipt of such service provisioning data, in step , cloud controller  is then able to transmit the identity of available services to IDE  as requested in step . Upon receipt of the identity of available services, in step , the IDE plug-in then determines and transmits a selection of desired available services to bind to the submitted web application. It should be recognized that such a selection process may, in certain embodiments, be automated, in accordance with pre-configured preferences set in the IDE, or may involve manual selection by developer  in other embodiments. Upon receipt of the selection of services, in step , cloud controller  begins a \u201cstaging process\u201d to stage, or otherwise modify the contents of the WAR file (or other package) of the submitted web application to bind the selected services to the web application. In one embodiment, this staging process involves unpacking the WAR file or extracting its constituent directory structure and files, accordingly inserting new files and\/or modifying existing files to bind the selected services, and repacking the WAR file (e.g., or otherwise creating a new WAR file that replaces the previous WAR file). For example, in step , cloud controller  and the shim components of service provisioner  for the selected services may exchange messages through addressing and discovery layer  (or via HTTP or other network protocols in other embodiments) to establish or otherwise obtain additional service provisioning data such as service login credentials (e.g., username\/password combinations), hostname, network address and port number to access the service and any requisite software drivers\/libraries that may be needed to enable the submitted web application to communicate with the services upon deployment. Cloud controller  is then able to incorporate such service provisioning data into the contents of the WAR file as part of the staging process. In one embodiment, set-up information identifying the application framework utilized to develop the submitted web application (i.e., that was received by cloud controller  in step ) enables cloud controller  to properly insert service provisioning data into the contents of the WAR file to bind selected services based upon a data organization structure of the WAR file that is imposed by the application framework (e.g., inserting additional environmental variables, entries in configuration files, additional system parameters and the like reflecting, for example, the hostname, network address, port number and login credentials for the service, etc.). For example, if the application framework is the Spring framework, cloud controller  inserts service provisioning data into the contents of the WAR file in accordance with how a Spring framework developed web application organizes its data within the WAR file. Once the contents of the WAR file have been modified to bind selected services to the submitted web application, in step , cloud controller  generates a start script file that can be executed by a container VM to start a runtime environment and launch the submitted web application in the runtime environment. For example, if the WAR file is intended to be deployed in a runtime environment such as Apache Tomcat application server, the start script file may include commands to start Apache Tomcat and then start the servlet (or servlets) that comprises web application  (e.g., via a net start command, etc.). In an alternative embodiment, such binding as described in steps - may be deferred until the submitted web application is actually deployed, as further described below (when describing ).","In step , cloud controller  then creates a web application deployment package that can be unpacked by any available container VM. In one embodiment, such a web application deployment package is a \u201ctar\u201d file (also referred to as a tarball) that includes the start script file, an instance of the runtime environment (e.g., Apache Tomcat, etc.) to be installed and started in a container VM, and the WAR file for web application  (e.g., embedded in an appropriate directory within the directory structure of the instance of the runtime environment). Alternative embodiments may include further optimizations to streamline the communication (and utilized network bandwidth) between the IDE plug-in at enterprise  and cloud controller . For example, in one embodiment, in step , IDE plug-in may include as part of the transmission of set-up characteristics, a \u201cfingerprint\u201d list of hash values (e.g., SHA-1 values, etc.) and file sizes for each file in the WAR file. Cloud controller , in turn, maintains its own table of fingerprint entries for hash value\/file size pairs, with each entry associated with a stored file. Upon receipt of the list from the IDE plug-in, cloud controller  determines whether it already has any of the files in the WAR file by reviewing its table. In such manner, cloud controller  can specifically request only those files with associated hash values and file sizes for which cloud controller  does not have an entry in its table. Such an optimization can significantly reduce the amount of data transmitted by IDE plug-in to cloud controller . For example, if only a few lines of code have been changed in a single library file of an already uploaded web application, the foregoing fingerprinting process enables the IDE plug-in to transmit only the library file itself, rather than the entire WAR file. Similarly, since different web applications often share common application framework files, the foregoing fingerprinting process can further significantly reduce the uploading times for different web applications. It should be recognized that although an IDE (or IDE plug-in) is described in , alternative embodiments may initiate the flow in  performed by the IDE plug-in using other non-IDE environments. For example, developer  may interact with cloud controller  through a command line interface (\u201cCLI\u201d), other applications, or any other similar process or tool capable of initiating a network request (e.g., HTTP request) to communicate with cloud controller . Furthermore, it should be recognized that embodiments may include a policy engine  that intercepts communication between IDE plug-in (or CLI or other similar tool) and cloud controller , altering communications in order to adhere to set policies and\/or performing steps on behalf of the IDE plug-in (e.g., selecting services in step  according to pre-defined policies, etc). It should also be recognized that functionalities described herein as provided in a plug-in IDE (or CLI or other application or tool) may be alternatively provided inside the cloud computing environment , for example, in cloud controller , in alternative embodiments. For example, in one alternative embodiment, determination of the application framework as part of the \u201cset-up\u201d characteristics in step  may be performed by cloud controller  upon its receipt of the web application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1A","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["120","126","116","116","116","402","404","406","408","410"],"sub":["1 ","1 ","n ","1 "]},"A virtualization software layer, also referred to hereinafter as hypervisor , is installed on top of hardware platform . Hypervisor  supports virtual machine execution space  within which multiple container VMs for hosting web applications may be concurrently instantiated and executed. As shown, virtual execution space  supports container VMs to . For each of container VMs to , hypervisor  manages a corresponding virtual hardware platform (i.e., virtual hardware platforms -) that includes emulated hardware such as virtual hard drive , virtual NIC , virtual CPU and RAM for VM . For example, virtual hardware platform may function as an equivalent of a standard x86 hardware architecture such that any x86 supported operating system, e.g., Microsoft Windows\u00ae, Linux\u00ae, Solaris\u00ae x86, NetWare, FreeBSD, etc., may be installed as guest operating system  to execute web application  for container VM , although it should be recognized that, in alternative, embodiments, each of container VMs to may support the execution of multiple web applications rather than a single web application. Hypervisor  is responsible for transforming I\/O requests from guest operating system  to virtual platform into corresponding requests to hardware platform . In the embodiment of , guest operating system  of container VM supports the execution of a deployment agent , which is a process or daemon that communicates (e.g., via addressing and discovery layer ) with cloud controller  to receive and unpack web application deployment packages, and with router  to provide network routing information for web applications that have been successfully deployed in container VM . Deployment agent  is automatically launched upon the instantiation of a container VM in certain embodiments. Guest operating system  further supports the installation and execution of runtime environment  within which web application  runs. For example, in one embodiment, runtime environment  may be a Java application server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, etc.) that includes a Java virtual machine and various API libraries that support the deployment of Java-based web applications. As described in the context of , such a runtime environment  may be received by a container VM as part of a web application deployment package created by cloud controller .","It should be recognized that the various terms, layers and categorizations used to describe the virtualization components in  may be referred to differently without departing from their functionality or the spirit or scope of the invention. For example, virtual hardware platforms -may be considered to be part of virtual machine monitors (VMM) -which implement the virtual system support needed to coordinate operations between hypervisor  and their respective container VMs. Alternatively, virtual hardware platforms -may also be considered to be separate from VMMs -, and VMMs -may be considered to be separate from hypervisor . One example of hypervisor  that may be used is included as a component of VMware's ESX\u2122 product, which is commercially available from VMware, Inc. It should further be recognized that other virtualized computer system architectures may be used consistent with the teachings herein, such as hosted virtual machine systems, where the hypervisor is designed to run on top of a host operating system. It should further be recognized, as previously discussed in the context of , that virtualized platform  which provides container VMs, such as those in , may be supported by hardware resources  that comprise any number of physical computers and data storage systems in one or more data centers connected by networking, with each of the physical computers hosting one or more of container VMs to , and possibly other VMs that run one or more processes carrying out the functions of other components of cloud computing environment , such as router , cloud controller , health manager , various base services , service provisioner , address and discovery layer  and the like. As discussed in the context of  with respect to container VMs, each VM supporting such other components is a virtual computer system that may have a guest operating system and one or more guest applications that can include any of the above processes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["134","125","500","134","100","140","125","502","134","132","134","504","428","126","132","126","125","506","134","132","428","126","125","328","508","428","510","428","430","125","512","428","126","125"],"sub":["1 ","1 ","1 ","1 "]},"In certain embodiments, base services  and\/or third party services (such as custom database  and CRM service ) are dynamically bound to web application  upon its launch in step  rather than during steps - of the staging process as previously described in the context of . In one such embodiment, cloud controller  may maintain globally accessible environment variables for available services in cloud computing environment . For any particular service, the values of such environment variables may provide service provisioning data such as the hostname, network address and port number or login credentials for the service. In one embodiment, such environment variables are initialized by cloud controller  during the staging process, for example, after step  of , when a service has been identified to cloud controller  to be used by web application  during its deployment. In such an embodiment, the staged web application  itself includes code (i.e., the web programmer knows to programmatically check the values of such environment variables or such code is otherwise injected into web application  during the staging process) that the searches for the names of environment variables for services that are utilized by web application  and binds web application  to those services using the values of such environment variables. As such, launch of web application  in step  causes such code in web application  to be executed, thereby dynamically binding the services to web application  upon its launch by utilizing the service provisioning data values of the environment variables.","Once deployment agent  recognizes that web application  has successfully launched (e.g., by confirming the successful binding of a port number to web application  in one embodiment), deployment agent  broadcasts the hostname, network address information of container VM and the bound port number of deployed web application , in step , through addressing and discovery layer . In turn, router  retrieves the broadcast hostname, network address information and bound port number though the addressing and discovery layer  in step  and updates its internal routing table in step , thereby enabling router  to properly route URL requests received from enterprise customer  for web application  to container VM . It should be recognized that the process of dynamically updating routing information in router  upon successful deployment of a web application through steps  to  provides cloud computing environment  flexibility to more easily migrate, move or otherwise re-deploy web applications to different containers VM to for any of a number of reasons (e.g., during hardware failures, for load balancing purposes, etc.). For example, in one exemplary scenario, health manager  may recognize that web application  has stopped running because server that hosts container VM in which web application  has been deployed has suffered a hardware failure. Upon such recognition, health manager  may initiate a request to cloud controller  to re-deploy web application  in a different container VM running on a different server. Once web application  has been successfully re-deployed by cloud controller , as a result of steps  to , router  will be automatically updated with new routing information to properly route requests to web application  which is now deployed on a different container VM on a different server (and therefore is associated with new network routing information). It should be recognized that although the foregoing description utilizes hostnames, network addresses and port numbers to generally describe network address information for a web application, any type of network information may be utilized as network address information in embodiments, depending upon the structure of the connected network and communications protocols implemented by cloud computing environment . Additionally, in step , deployment agent  also identifies a process identifier for the deployed web application  and generates a stop script file, in the event that cloud controller  receives a command to stop web application  in the future (e.g., by request of administrator , etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 6","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["108","600","112","600","128","130","132","134","136","138","600","430","428","605","126","116","108","600","610","615","605"],"sub":["x ","x "]},"As depicted in , such a downloadable microcloud  supports the deployment of web application  in a diversity of virtualization environments, ranging from an individual's personal laptop  to an infrastructure-as-a-service (\u201cIaaS\u201d) service provider  (such as, e.g., Amazon's Elastic Cloud Compute web service). For example, the user may download microcloud  to personal laptop  (or any other personal computing device), which runs an operating system , such as Microsoft Windows, that provides the ability to run applications , including a hosted virtualization platform , such as VMware Workstation (or any other virtualization platform or virtual machine player that provides a capability to run a virtual machine). In such a personal computing environment, for example, downloaded microcloud  may be formatted as a .vmdk file (e.g., a virtual machine disk file format promulgated by VMware) or any other known virtual disk file format, such as the Open Virtualization Format (OVF).","Alternatively, microcloud  may be uploaded (e.g., by cloud computing platform provider  or the user himself, for example) to an IaaS service provider  that, for example, provides an IaaS platform  enabling users to dynamically launch (and stop) virtual machine instances  in a manner that supports the users' particular business needs. For example, a user can log into IaaS platform , allocate himself a virtual machine instance (e.g., with a selected guest operating system), and upload, configure and install desired applications, libraries and data accordingly (for example, to launch a web application, etc.). As depicted in , IaaS platform  may further provide the capability to upload and attach a preconfigured virtual machine disk image, such as microcloud , to an allocated virtual machine. Once a user uploads and attaches microcloud  to a launched virtual machine instance in IaaS , the various processes running on top of guest operating system  in the virtual machine instance (e.g., base services , service provisioner , address and discovery layer , cloud controller , router , and health manager , runtime environment , deployment engine , etc.) provide a web application deployment environment that enables a user to upload a web application deployment package to cloud controller  running in the virtual machine instance for eventual unpacking into runtime environment  and deployment by deployment agent  of execution engine  (as described in the context of ). In one embodiment, for example, IaaS service provider  may be Amazon.com and IaaS platform  may be Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) web service. In such an embodiment, microcloud  may be formatted as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and uploaded and persisted to Amazon's Elastic Block Service (EBS) storage system. A user can then log into EC2 to launch a virtual machine instance that accesses the AMI version of microcloud  that is stored in EBS in order to provide a cloud computing environment in a self-contained virtual machine to deploy web applications.","It should be recognized that the microcloud platform delivery system of  is merely exemplary and that alternative embodiments may have various modifications and changes. For example, in one alternative embodiment, rather than uploading microcloud , cloud computing platform provider  may communicate with IaaS service provider  to request the provisioning and launching of a virtual machine instance with a default virtual disk image within IaaS platform  (for example, containing a guest operating system such as Linux). As part of the provisioning process of the virtual machine instance, cloud computing platform provider  may upload a shell script (or any other type of script executable by the default operating system) in to the virtual machine instance that executes upon an initial booting of the virtual machine instance. During its execution, the shell script instructs the guest operating system to download, configure and install cloud computing environment components such as base services , service provisioner , address and discovery layer , cloud controller , router , and health manager , runtime environment , and deployment engine , thereby composing microcloud  during an initial boot process of the provisioned virtual machine image. For example, in one embodiment, the shell script contains certain URLs corresponding to the components (and any additional data and configuration information) such that the components may be downloaded, for example, from a \u201cblobstore\u201d (binary large object store) or are otherwise available at cloud computing platform provider  or at any other networked location designated by the shell script. In yet another embodiment, a user can provide a more scalable cloud computing environment by launching multiple virtual machine instances of microcloud . In such an embodiment, the user may designate one virtual machine instance as a primary instance and configure each of the other cloud computing environment components (e.g., cloud controller, base services, runtime environment , etc.) running on other \u201chelper\u201d virtual machine instances of microcloud  to communicate using address and discovery layer  of the primary instance. The user may further configure the cloud computing environment components of the helper virtual machine by turning certain components off or on to increase performance of the helper virtual machines.","It should be recognized that various modifications and changes may be made to the specific embodiments described herein without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. For example, while the foregoing description has discussed embodiments using web applications or Internet applications, it should be recognized that any network utilizing application can leverage the techniques disclosed herein, and as such, \u201cweb application\u201d as used herein shall be interpreted to include any type of client-server based application that employs network based communications. Furthermore, although the foregoing embodiments have focused on the use of container VMs to host deployed web applications, it should be recognized that any \u201capplication container\u201d may be used to host web applications, including such container VMs, processes in virtual machines, kernel level containers, processes in traditional non-virtualized operating systems and any other execution environment that provides an isolated environment capable of running application level code. Similarly, while the various components of cloud computing environment  have been generally described as being implemented in one or more virtual machines (e.g., for load balancing and scalability purposes), it should be recognized that any type of \u201capplication container\u201d (as previously discussed above) can also implement such components, including, for example, traditional non-virtualized computing environment background processes, threads or daemons. Furthermore, any combination of different types of \u201capplication containers\u201d to host web applications and implement other components (e.g., cloud controller , router , health manager , base services , service provisioner , addressing and discovery layer , etc.) can comprise any particular cloud computing environment  implementation. It should further be recognized that multiple instances of the various components of cloud computing environment  (e.g., cloud controller , router , health monitor , service provisioner , etc.) may be implemented in alternative embodiments, for example, for scalability purposes.","The various embodiments described herein may employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems.
