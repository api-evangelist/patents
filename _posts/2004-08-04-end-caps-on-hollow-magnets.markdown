title: End caps on hollow magnets
abstract: A compact permanent magnet structure is provided to produce a uniform magnetic biasing field confined to an internal cavity of a cylindrical magnetic flux source which eliminates the drawbacks, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties associated with an elongated magic ring. The compact permanent magnet structure is composed of a cylindrical magnetic flux source with a cylindrical axis, a hollow central cavity, an inner diameter and a remanence perpendicular to said cylindrical axis. The ends of the cylindrical magnetic flux source are capped by a first magnetic flux source and a second magnetic flux source. The compact permanent magnet structure produces a uniform biasing field by capping the end of the cylindrical magnetic flux source with a hemispheric section of a magic sphere having a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring. The cylindrical magnetic flux source can be a magic ring and the caps can either be geometric or parametric. A method for producing the uniform magnetic biasing field in a compact permanent magnet structure is also provided.

More particularly, this invention relates to useful devices and methods that eliminate or lessen the effects of transverse fields in the cylindrical cavity of hollow cylindrical magnets.","Many devices that employ magnetic fields have heretofore been encumbered by massive solenoids with their equally bulky power supplies. There has been increasing interest in the application of permanent-magnet structures for such uses as electron-beam focusing and biasing fields. The current demand for compact, strong, static magnetic field sources requiring no electrical power supplies has created needs for permanent magnet structures of unusual form. Many of these permanent magnet structures have been developed for electronic beam guidance in millimeter or microwave tubes, for millimeter wave filters, circulators, isolators and strip lines, nuclear magnetic resonance imagers and other similar devices for which a relatively large uniform magnetic field is desired.","Many of these permanent magnet structures provide a relatively high uniform magnetic field and have embodied the principles of a \u201cmagic\u201d ring, cylinder, hemisphere sphere. An example of a \u201cmagic sphere\u201d or hollow spherical flux source is disclosed in Leupold, U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,506, entitled \u201cHollow Substantially Hemispherical Permanent Magnet High Field Flux Source,\u201d issued May 30, 1989. Methods of making the \u201cmagic ring\u201d and \u201cmagic sphere\u201d are also disclosed in Leupold, U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,472, entitled \u201cMethod of Making Cylindrical and Spherical Permanent Magnet Structures,\u201d issued on Aug. 16, 1994. Magnets creating transverse magnetic fields have been disclosed in Leupold, U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,339, entitled \u201cTubular Structure Having Transverse Magnetic Field With Gradient,\u201d all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Particularly promising for such purposes is the configuration based on the hollow cylindrical flux source (\u201cHCFS\u201d), also known as a magic ring, which is a cylindrical permanent-magnet shell offering a magnetization vector that is primarily constant in magnitude and produces a field greater than the remanence of the magnetic material from which it is made.","The magic ring concept and its polygonal approximations have proven useful for applications requiring relatively high transverse fields in tubular working spaces, such as mm\/microwave radiation sources and amplifiers. The magic ring has also been particularly useful as a common permanent magnet configuration to confine transverse magnetic fields to cylindrical magnets. For example, see H. A. Leupold and E. Potenziani, . U.S. Army T.R. SLCET-TR-90-6, August 1990. However, the magic ring is not without its drawbacks, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties. The magic ring can exhibit field distortions because of end effects, and in order to achieve a fairly uniform biasing field, each end of the ring must be elongated by an amount approximately equal to its structural diameter, so that the central portion of the field which is uniform is long enough for the user's purposes. However, the elongated structure's wastefully long length-to-length ratio, as well as the end regions having the field attenuating because of the significant amounts of wasted space in the structure, causes a number of undesirable increases in a device's mass and bulk, making the elongated magic ring unsuitable for a number of applications.","Thus there has been a long-felt and unsatisfied need for a uniform magnetic field within an internal cavity in a far more compact structure that does not suffer from the drawbacks, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties associated with the elongated magic ring. Up until now, there is no compact magnetic structure that also provides the much-needed magnetic field uniformity. The present invention solves the long-felt need for field uniformity within a more compact structure by providing a permanent magnetic structure that produces a uniform biasing field by capping the end of the magic ring with a hemispheric section of a magic sphere having a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring. In accordance with the present invention, a permanent magnetic structure with a capped end of a magic ring and a hemispheric magic sphere section, as further described herein, produces a magnetic field on an axis of the magic ring's end because the magic sphere caps now produce a transverse magnetic field within the structure's hollow cavity.","Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to achieve a highly uniform biasing field within a very compact magnetic structure and a high, uniform magnetic field that is undistorted because of end effects.","It is yet another object of the present invention to achieve a highly effective and uniform magnetic field within a magic ring by capping each end with a hemispheric section of a magic sphere having a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring.","It is still a further object of the present invention to achieve a highly effective and uniform magnetic field within a magic ring by capping the end of a magic ring with a hemispheric section of a magic sphere having a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring to produce magnetic field on an axis of the magic ring's end because the magic sphere caps now produce a transverse magnetic field within the structure's hollow cavity.","These and other objects and advantages are achieved in accordance with the permanent magnetic structure producing a uniform and undistorted biasing magnetic field, comprising a magic ring structure with its ends advantageously capped with a portion of a magic sphere having both a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring in order to produce a transverse magnetic field. The capped magic ring structure of the present invention achieves a compact, uniform magnetic flux source having a transverse magnetic field without suffering from any of the disadvantages, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties previously associated with the elongated magic ring and other prior art devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["5","10","16"]},"The magic ring structure is a cylindrical shell of permanent magnet material in which the direction of magnetization, \u03b3, will vary, as depicted in  according to the formula:\n\n\u03b3=2\u03c6\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the cylindrical coordinate system with its origin at the magic ring's center. Such a ring of infinite length, or a length much larger than its diameter, produces a magnetic field, H, in its interior cavity according to the formula: \n\n\nwhere Bis remanence, and rand rare the outer and inner radii of the ring, respectively. Theoretically, there is no limit to the magnitude attainable for magnetic field, H. However, because of the logarithmic dependence of H on the outer radius, such a structure would be prohibitively large for magnetic fields much greater than about 2 B.  shows that the magnetic field begins dropping near the ends of the ring until the field is only about a half as strong as the field at the center of the cavities' cylindrical axis. Due to the tendency of the magnetic field to drop near the ends of the cylindrical ring, in those applications where a uniform field in the magic ring is needed, the ring must be elongated at each end by an amount approximately equal to its structural diameter, so that the central portion, or cavity, where the field is uniform is then long enough for the user's needs. However, the consequence of this elongation process is that significant amounts of wasted space now occupy the structure and the attendant undesirable increases in both mass and bulk. These undesirable consequences of the elongated magic ring have created the long-felt need for a more compact structure with a uniform field within the ring's internal cavity.\n","The present invention discloses permanent magnetic structures that solve this long-felt and heretofore unsatisfied need for field uniformity within a more compact structure by utilizing a portion of the HCFS, or magic sphere structure depicted in , and a magic ring structure.  illustrates both ideal  and actual  magic sphere structures. Actual magic sphere structure  depicts a group of sections  that surround a central cavity , with a quarter of the sections  removed to reveal central cavity  the sake of clarity. A solution to the long-felt need for a more compact magnetic structure providing a uniform magnetic field is suggested by considering the ideal  and actual  magic sphere structures, each having a cavity diameter and shell with the same dimensions as the  magic ring under consideration. To produce a magnetic field on axis at the end of  magic ring , one can supply the missing half-field by advantageously capping the end of the  magic ring with a  magic half sphere. Since the hemispheric magic sphere produces a transverse magnetic field at the juncture of: \n\n\nand the magic ring produces at that point a field of only: \n\n\nit is clear that the remanence, B, of the sphere must be reduced so that: \n\n\nThus, the Hand Hof the preceding equations (2 and 3) are equal with the sphere and ring each contributing one half of the desired field. These and other objects, advantages and features will become readily apparent in view of the drawings and more detailed description.\n","In order to satisfy the long-standing need for a uniform magnetic field within an internal cavity in a compact magnetic structure without suffering from the drawbacks, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties associated with prior art devices, the present invention provides compact magnetic structures that provide the much-needed magnetic field uniformity by capping the end of the magic ring with a hemispheric section of a magic sphere having a cavity diameter and shell axis equivalent to the magic ring. The permanent magnetic structures of the present invention further comprise a compact parametric capped permanent magic ring structure and a compact geometric capped permanent magic ring structure without suffering the drawbacks, shortcomings, limitations and difficulties associated with prior art devices.","In accordance with the present invention, it is now possible to configure magic ring structures in such a way that the outer radius of the sphere can be reduced so that H and Hin equations (2) and (3) above are equal despite the remanence values of the sphere and the cylinder being the same. This approach will save weight, but will also require additional tooling, because if the diameters of the sphere and the cylinder are the same, the component rings of each structure can be made with the same die, although parts of the sphere need to be subjected to additional treatment in either case.

No. 5,337,472, entitled \u201cMethod of Making Cylindrical and Spherical Permanent Magnet Structures,\u201d which is also incorporated herein by reference.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00027","num":"00027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","31","40","41","32","33","34","31","35","32","31","36","37","31","36","38","39","31","36","31","34","35","38","42","35","30","31"]},"Variations of the parametric capped permanent magic ring structure  include  the cylindrical magnetic flux source  being composed of a plurality of circular magnetic segments, the cylindrical magnetic flux source  being a magic ring, the first magnetic flux source  being composed of a plurality of magic sphere segments and the second magnetic flux source being composed of said plurality of magic sphere segments.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00029","num":"00029"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["50","51","59","60","52","53","54","55","56","51","57","52","56","55","51","56","54","61","51","56","51","54","58","61","53","57","50"]},"The compact geometric capped magic ring structure  tends to be lighter than the parametric capped permanent magic ring structure . The parametric capped permanent magic ring structure  is also somewhat easier to fabricate than the geometric capped magic ring structure . The cylindrical magnetic flux source  could be a magic ring structure composed of a number of magnetic segments with the appropriate dimensions, which are not shown in  for the sake of clarity. Similarly, the first and second magnetic flux sources may also be composed of magic sphere segments with the appropriate dimensions and they are not depicted in the figures for the sake of clarity. The variations to the parametric capped permanent magic ring structure  may also be applicable to the geometric capped magic ring structure .","It is also noted that the addition of the hemispherical caps of the present invention to the ends of the cylinder will result in correct fields at the junctures, but this configuration will not completely accomplish the correct field within the cylinder because of the fall-off of the spherical field with distances from the juncture are not quite the same as the rise in the cylindrical field over the same distance. Therefore, the sum of the hemispherical and cylindrical fields will not add up to exactly the same field at all points. For most purposes this variation is insignificant, however, where a more precise approximation is needed, this can be effected through the variation of the cylindrical field by slight variations of the remanence value along the cylindrical axis similar to the methods disclosed in the inventor's U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,339, entitled \u201cTubular Structure Having Transverse Magnetic Field With Gradient,\u201d which is also incorporated herein by reference. Based on this, it should therefore be possible to cancel the mismatch between the hemisphere and cylinder by an appropriate manipulation of the remanence value as well as the outer radii of the cylinder, if needed.","It is also noted that results of this invention may also be accomplished through the use of polygonal and polyhedral approximations to the magic rings and magic spheres, respectively.","The present invention also encompasses a method for producing a uniform magnetic biasing field in a compact permanent magnet structure, comprising the steps of forming a cylindrical magnetic flux source with a cylindrical axis, a hollow central cavity, an inner diameter and a remanence perpendicular to said cylindrical axis; capping a first end of the cylindrical magnetic flux source with a first magnetic flux source, the first magnetic flux source having a first cavity diameter; capping a second end of the cylindrical magnetic flux source with a second magnetic flux source, the second magnetic flux source having a second cavity diameter; dimensioning the inner diameter to be equivalent to the first cavity diameter and the second cavity diameter and generating a transverse magnetic field from the first magnetic flux source and the second magnetic flux source, the transverse magnetic field assisting in producing the uniform biasing magnetic field perpendicular to the cylindrical axis and confined within the hollow central cavity. The variations to the parametric capped permanent magic ring structure , geometric capped magic ring structure  may also be applicable to the method for producing a uniform magnetic biasing field in a compact permanent magnet structure.","It is to be further understood that other features and modifications to the foregoing detailed description are within the contemplation of the present invention, which is not limited by this detailed description. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that any number of configurations of the present invention and numerous modifications and combinations of materials, components, geometries, arrangements and dimensions can achieve the results described herein, without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.
