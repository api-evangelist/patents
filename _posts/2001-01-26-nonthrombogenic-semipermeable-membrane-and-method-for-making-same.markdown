{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present invention concerns the field of blood and plasma treatment by extracorporeal circulation, in particular by dialysis, haemofiltration and plasmapheresis. It relates to a composite semipermeable membrane comprising a semipermeable support membrane coated with an anticoagulant agent, which reduces the thrombogenic character of the support.","The present invention also relates to exchangers for treating blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation, comprising this composite semipermeable membrane, as well as to methods for manufacturing these exchangers.","Throughout this text, the term \u201csemipermeable membrane\u201d is used to denote a flat semipermeable membrane or a bundle of semipermeable hollow fibres. Also, throughout this text, the term \u201cexchanger\u201d is used to denote an exchanger for treating blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation, which generally comprises two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane, each provided with two accesses, a first compartment being intended for the circulation of the patient's blood or plasma, and a second compartment being intended for the circulation of used liquid.","The treatment of a uraemic patient's blood or plasma requires the use of an extracorporeal blood circuit connected to an exchanger. The blood, in the extracorporeal circuit, is subjected to a major thrombotic risk which it is necessary to prevent by effective anticoagulation. This is why, even though the materials used for the manufacture of exchangers are selected to be as biocomoatible as possible so that, in particular, coagulation reactions do not take place or take place at a relatively benign levels, an anticoagulant agent, generally heparin (fractionated or non-fractionated) is customarily injected into the patient's blood.","The amount of heparin injected into the patient conventionally varies from 7500 to 11,000 international units (IU) per treatment session, or more in certain cases.","In common practice, the anticoagulation of blood rarely presents difficulties. In certain patients, however, heparin can cause undesirable secondary reactions, in particular haemorrhaging. Other side-effects reported in the literature are thrombocytopoenia (drop in the number of platelets) allergies, osteopoross (observed in the event of prolonged heparin adrinistration), increases in transaminases (hepatic enzymes) and hyperlipidaemia. Sensitivity to heparin is variable from one patient to another and as a function of time for a given patient.","For patients with a high risk of haemorrhaging, there is a method of extracorporeal blood treatment without an anticoagulant, which consists in preventing thrombosis of the blood in the extracorporeal circulation circuit and in the dialyser by frequently rinsing the circuit and the dialyser with physiological saline in order to flush therefrom the thrombi being formed. This method involves high blood circulation rates, which are not always tolerated by patients.","Furthermore, this treatment without an anticoagulant, which is technically difficult, requires specific training of the nursing staff, rigorous compliance with the operating protocol, strict monitoring of the dialysis in order to prevent incidents, and early detection of incidents so that they can be dealt with.","With a view to avoiding the injection of anticoagulant into the extracorporeal blood circuit, a great deal of research work has been undertaken in order to improve the haemocompatibility of semipermeable membranes by binding heparin to the surface of the membrane intended to be placed in contact with the blood, by means of ionic or covalent bonding (see J. Pelissi\u00e9 \u201cH\u00e9parinisation de surface\u201d [surface heparinization] in RMB (1994) 16, 7, 290\u2013291).","The techniques described for the ionic binding of heparin aim to create quaternary amine groups on the surface of the semipermeable membrane to be treated. Heparin, which is negatively charged owing to its sulphate and carboxylic groups, can react with quaternary amine groups. However, rapid release of heparin due to the weakness of the intermolecular bonding has been observed, which presents the drawback of reducing the antithrombogenic character of the surfaces intended to be in contact with the blood and of promoting the appearance of undesirable side-effects due to freed heparin. In order to compensate for the continuous release of heparin, large amounts of this anticoagulant must be bound to the membrane, which makes it difficult to control the anticoagulation of the patient's blood and increases the cost.","The techniques described for covalent binding involve specific and complex chemical reactions allowing heparin to become attached to the surfaces of the materials intended to be placed in contact with the blood. These techniques, however, since they cause a substantial modification of the chemical nature of the materials, are not generally suitable for semipermeable membranes because they would risk provoking a significant reduction in the fundamental properties of these membranes, such as diffusive and convective transport capacities and the capacity for adsorbing undesirable substances. There is furthermore a risk of reducing the antithrombogenicity by inactivation of heparin.","The only exchanger marketed to date comprising a semipermeable membrane treated with an anticoagulant agent in order to reduce its thrombogenic character is the haemofilter with the brand name DURAFLO from the company BAXTER. This semipermeable membrane is based on polysulphone.","Certain semipermeable membranes consisting essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic or anionizable monomer, which is o'efinically unsaturated, such as the copolymer manufactured by HOSPAL under the brand name AN69, are acknowledged to be much less thrombogenic than cellulosic membranes. The implementation of dialysis without heparin using these membranes requires, however, high blood circulation rates [at least 400 ml\/min according to the article \u201cHeparin-free hemodialysis with a polyacrylonitrile membrane\u201d, by Robert H. Barth et al., Vol. XXXV Trans Am Soc Artif Intern Organs (1989)], which is not always tolerated by all patients.","It is a first object of the present invention to reduce the thrombogenic character of semipermeable membranes consisting essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic and anionizable monomer by binding an anticoagulant agent to these membranes, while keeping the other fundamental properties of these membranes at an acceptable level, that is to say their capacity for diffusive and convective transport (water permeability, selective permeability to molecules with a weight-average molecular weight less than that of albumin), their capacity for adsorbing undesirable substances and their mechanical properties.","It is a second object of the present invention to bind, stably, to the surface of semipermeable membranes consisting essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic and anionizable monomer, an anticoagulant agent which can exert its anticoagulant activity without being eluted and released rapidly into the blood or plasma during the treatment by extracorporeal circulation.","It is a third object of the present invention to reduce the amount of anticoagulant agent injected into the patient during an extracorporeal blood treatment session carried out by means of an exchanger provided with a semipermeable membrane consisting essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic and anionizable monomer, to which an anticoagulant agent is bound.","In order to achieve these objects, the present invention provides a composite semipermeable membrane comprising a semipermeable support membrane and an anticoagulant agent suitable for treating blood and plasma by extracorporeal circulation, characterized in that:\n\n","In certain cases, the present invention furthermore makes it possible to reduce the total amount of the bound or unbound anticoagulant agent needed for implementing an extracorporeal blood treatment session by means of an exchanger provided with a semipermeable membrane consisting essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic and anionizable monomer, to which an anticoagulant agent is bound, and hence to reduce the cost of the treatment session and the undesirable side-effects of the anticoagulant agent.","According to the invention, the chains of the cationic polymer have a sufficiently large steric hindrance for them not to pass through the semipermeable support membrane, which makes it possible for these chains to become bound essentially to the surface of the membrane by ionic bonding. The amount of cationic polymer needed for treating the semipermeable support membrane is consequently moderate since a bulk treatment of the semipermeable support membrane with penetration of the cationic polymer into the pores is not required.","Preferably, the cationic polymer is prepared by ultrafiltration using a semipermeable membrane which is identical to the semipermeable support membrane or which has a cut-off threshold equal to or greater than that of the semipermeable support membrane, in order to exclude the cationic polymer chains capable of passing through the semipermeable support membrane.","The composite semipermeable membrane according to the invention has three major advantages:\n\n","According to one variant of the invention, the cationic polymer is a polyamine which is preferably hydrophilic and carries primary, secondly, tertiary or quaternary amine groups. The cationic polymer is preferably a polyethyleneimine (PEI). The amount of PEI deposited and bound can vary between approximately 1 mg and approximately 30 mg per mof membrane (including the end points).","The anticoagulant agent suitable for the invention must not be toxic.","According to another variant of the invention, the anticoagulant agent carrying anionic groups belongs to the family of glycoaminoglycans having an anticoagulant activity. Preferably, this agent essentially consists of heparin (fractionated or non-fractionated). The amount of heparin deposited and bound can vary between approximately 200 IU and approximately 20,000 IU per mof membrane (including the end points), preferably between approximately 500 IU and approximately 10,000 IU per mof membrane (including the end points). The amount of heparin bound is selected according to the type of treatment for which the exchanger is intended:\n\n","The amount of heparin bound is less than the amount of heparin which is injected into the patient during a conventional treatment (which as of the order of from 7500 to 11,000 IU or more in the event that the membrane is rinsed with a heparin solution before the blood is circulated in the extracorporeal circuit).","The invention is suitable for the preparation of composite semipermeable membranes from a semipermeable support membrane consisting essentially of a polyacrylonitrile carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are selected from sulphonic, phosphonic, carboxylic, sulphuric, phosphoric groups and from the corresponding salified groups.","Preferably, the anionic or anionizable groups of the polyacrylonitrile are acid sulphonic groups or salified sulphonic groups.","Advantageously, the semipermeable support membrane consists essentially of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl sulphonate, such as the copolymer with the brand name AN69 manufactured by HOSPAL, with which the best performance has been achieved.","The invention also relates to an exchanger for treating blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation, comprising two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane having a surface oriented towards a first compartment intended for the circulation of blood or plasma, characterized in that that the surface of the semipermeable membrane oriented towards the first compartment is coated successively with a cationic polymer and with an anionic anticoagulant agent.","The composite semipermeable membrane may be in the form of a flat membrane or a bundle of hollow fibres.","Preferably, the exchanger which comprises the composite semipermeable membrane according to the invention is sterilized and ready for use. It hence does not require any special handling by its user.","The present invention also relates to a method for reducing the thrombogenic character of an exchanger for treating blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation, comprising two compartments separated by a semipermeable membrane having a surface oriented towards a first compartment intended for the circulation of blood or plasma, comprising the following successive stages:","(a) preparing a semipermeable membrane, In the form of a flat membrane or a bundle of hollow fibre, from a solution of polyacrylonitrile carrying anionic or anionizable groups;","(b) assembling the various components of the exchanger, in particular fitting the semipermeable membrane or a bundle of hollow fibres in a case;","(c) preparing a solution containing at least one cationic polymer carrying cationic groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the polyacrylonitrile, the cationic polymer comprising only polymer chains whose size is sufficient for them not to pass through the semipermeable membrane, and bringing this solution into contact with the surface of the semipermeable membrane intended to be placed in contact with the blood, it being possible to carry out stage (c) before or after stage (b); when the semipermeable membrane is flat, the cationic polymer solution may be sprayed onto the surface of the membrane;","(d) in the event that stage (c) is carried out subsequently to stage (b), purging the exchanger of the solution containing the cationic polymer;","(e) preparing a solution containing, in the dissolved state, at least one anticoagulant agent carrying anionic groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic groups of the said cationic polymer, and bringing this solution into contact with the surface of the semipermeable membrane intended to be placed in contact with the blood, stage","(e) being implemented after stage (c) but before or after stage (b);","(f) in the event that stage (e) is carried out subsequently to stage (b), purging the exchanger of the solution containing the anticoagulant agent.","In the event that the cationic polymer is PEI, the aforementioned stage (c) may be carried out according to the following conditions:\n\n","In the event that the anticoagulant agent is heparin, the aforementioned stage (e) may be carried out according to the following conditions:\n\n","Optionally, the flat membrane or the bundle of hollow fibres is glycerinated at the end of stage (a), whence the need to de-glycerinate before undertaking the aforementioned stage (c).","Optionally, the semipermeable membrane is rinsed in order to remove the excess bound cationic polymer, either after stage (c) when stage (c) is carried out before stage (b), or after stage (d).","Optionally, the semipermeable membrane is rinsed in order to remove the excess unbound anticoagulant agent, either after stage (e) when stage (e) is carried out before stage (b), or after stage (f).","Optionally, the semipermeable membrane is re-glycerinated, depending on the case, at the end of stage (e) or (f), after the optional rinsing stages.","In the scope of the invention, the sterilization of the exchanger, without a significant effect on the composite semipermeable membrane, may be sterilization by irradiation, in particular by gamma irradiation, or sterilization with ethylene oxide. The sterilization of the exchanger may be implemented at two specific times during the method of manufacturing the exchanger.","According to a first variant, the exchanger is sterilized when the semipermeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying anionic or anionizable groups is coated with the said cationic polymer, then the treatment using the solution containing at least one anticoagulant agent is performed extemporaneously.","According to a second variant, the exchanger is sterilized when the semipermeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying anionic or anionizable groups is coated with the said cationic polymer and the said anticoagulant agent.","The assaying methods used to evaluate the semipermeable membranes which have been described are as follows:","Treatment of the Blood Samples Prior to the Assays","The blood sampled, when leaving the dialysers, during the dialysis sessions of the following examples is immediately placed in the presence of sodium citrate which, by chelation of the calcium ions, stops any coagulation activity. The sample is then centrifuged at room temperature at 3000 revolutions per minute for 15 minutes. The supernatant plasma is collected and stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until the assay.","Determination of the Coagulation Time (KCT, for Kaolin-Cephalin Time)","The KCT determination is carried out using the assay kit marketed under the name C.K. PREST\u00ae by the company DIAGNOSTICA STAGO.","The KCT makes it possible to assess the lengthening of the coagulation time of a citrated plasma due to the deficit of certain coagulation factors or the presence of an anticoagulant such as heparin. In the latter case, the lengthening of the coagulation time is proportional to the amount of heparin present. The KCT determination hence makes it possible to assess the anticoagulation level of the blood. The method of measuring this coagulation time (expressed in seconds) is known, and it is carried out after recalcification and addition of an activator.","Heparin Assay in Non-Plasmatic Medium","Heparin is determined in simple media (water and electrolytes) by spectrophotometry after formation of a complex with azure A (maximum absorption at 630 nm).","Test of Extracorporeal Circulation on a Sheep:","The dialysers tested in the examples are rinsed with a physiological saline solution (heparinated or non-heparinated) circulated in the blood compartment (2 L at 200 mL\/min.). The dialysate compartment is filled by ultrafiltration. Depending on the case, the sheep blood is anticoagulated by injecting heparin into the jugular vein five minutes before the start of the session. The extracorporeal blood circulation is carried out at the rate of 200 mL\/min. using a HOSPAL BSM22 pump (carotid access and jugular return). The input and output pressures are recorded. The circulation is stopped when the blood pressure exceeds 500 mmHg at the entry of the dialyser, giving evidence 15 of coagulation in the circuit.","This example describes a method of preparing a cationic polymer, in this case a polyethyleneimine WE (PEI), aiming to remove by fractionation the smallest polymer chains (with little steric hindrance) capable of penetrating into the pores of the semipermeable membrane to be treated, and passing through it.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"a\u2014preparing, in a tank , a solution of 1.5 liters of a solution of PEI with a weight-average molecular weight of 750 k Dalton (LUPASOL P, from BASF) and 50 g per liter, in distilled water;","b\u2014circulating, in a closed circuit, the solution in the blood compartment of a dialyser  with hollow fibres (brand name FILTRAL 16, manufactured by the company HOSPAL INDUSTRIE, France), equipped with a membrane (working area of 1.6 m) made of AN69 35 (copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl sulphonate), at the raze of 300 ml per minute;","c\u2014simultaneously with stage b, ultrafiltration at the rate of 60 ml per minute with addition of water into the tank , at the same rate.","The duration of the preparation is 156 minutes.","The assay of the PEI present in the ultrafiltrate is determined in water by spectrophotometry after formation of a coloured complex with cobalt II thiocyanate (maximum absorption at 304 nm).","The change in the PEI concentration in the ultrafiltrate is given on appended .","Under the conditions of the aforementioned method, the amount of PEI removed by ultrafiltration is 32 g, which represents 43% of the original PEI.","The distribution by molecular weight (Mw) of the non-fractionated PEI (denoted PEI P) and the fractionated PEI is determined by a steric exclusion chromatograph (ultrahydrogel column from the company WATERS) and is represented on appended .  shows that the molar mass of the smallest chains of fractionated PEI is of the order of 10,000 g\/mole.","A dialyser with a flat membrane made of AN69 (brand name CRYSTAL 4000, manufactured by HOSPAL INDUSTRIE, France), having a working area of 1.5 mand sterilized by gamma irradiation, is rinsed by circulating, in the blood compartment, 2 liters of physiological saline containing 5000 IU of non-fractionated heparin.","An extracorporeal blood circuit comprising the dialyser is then connected to the vascular circuit of a sheep.
