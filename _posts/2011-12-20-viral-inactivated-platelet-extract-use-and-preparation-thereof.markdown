{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a Non-Provisional that claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/425,474, filed Dec. 21, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. The present application also claims benefit of Israeli Patent Application Number IL210162, filed Dec. 21, 2010.","The invention relates to viral-inactivated platelet extract derived from multiple donors; to its preparation and use.","Platelets are small, irregularly-shaped a-nuclear cells that play a fundamental role in hemostasis and healing. Platelets contain a complete array of pre-synthesized proteins, among which are signaling proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane proteins and regulatory proteins. They are involved in key stages of tissue regeneration and healing processes at the site of injury, mainly due to the content of platelet granules comprising a multitude of bioactive molecules including growth factors (GFs), cytokines and chemokines. Platelet GFs such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and others are key players in all the following phases of the wound healing cascade: inflammatory, proliferative and remodeling phase.","Studies have shown that platelet derived GFs stimulate angiogenesis, mitogenesis, cell proliferation, neutrophils and macrophages, collagen synthesis, wound contraction, extracellular matrix synthesis, epithelialization and chemotaxis.","Platelets are routinely used by transfusion e.g. to improve hemostasis. Recently, platelets are increasingly used in the form of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), also referred to as PRP gel, platelet gel, PRP-clot etc. Typically, PRP is an ex vivo preparation consisting of autologous platelets concentrated in a limited volume of plasma (Lacci K M, Dardik A. Platelet-rich plasma: support for its use in wound healing. Yale J Biol Med. 2010 March; 83(1):1-9).","For topical application, PRP is usually activated by the addition of thrombin and\/or CaClresulting in the formation of fibrin gel by the interaction between thrombin (endogenous or exogenous) and fibrinogen. Upon activation, the platelets undergo active degranulation and release various mediators including GFs (Lacci K M, Dardik A, 2010). The use of PRP for injection currently comprises a small but rapidly growing segment of the market. The rationale for using PRP in soft and hard tissue augmentation is its potential to enhance tissue regeneration in non-healing injuries, accelerate wound maturity, vascularization and epithelialization, decrease scar formation, and reduce post operative complications and morbidity (Lacci K M, Dardik A, 2010).","Studies using activated PRP together with various cell types have shown that factors e.g. growth factors released from PRP can induce cell proliferation [(e.g. Kanno et al. Platelet-rich plasma enhances human osteoblast-like cell proliferation and differentiation. J Oral Maxillofac Surg. 2005 March; 63(3):362-9; Bertrand-Duchesne et al. Epidermal growth factor released from platelet-rich plasma promotes endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. J Periodontal Res. 2010 February; 45(1):87-93; Kakudo et al. Proliferation-promoting effect of platelet-rich plasma on human adipose-derived stem cells and human dermal fibroblasts. Plast Reconstr Surg. 2008 November; 122(5):1352-60), modulate the angiogenic capability of human endothelial cells (Sulpice et al. Cross-talk between the VEGF-A and HGF signalling pathways in endothelial cells. Biol Cell. 2009 September; 101(9):525-39; Rughetti et al. Platelet gel-released supernatant modulates the angiogenic capability of human endothelial cells. Blood Transfus. 2008 January; 6(1):12-7), and induce osteo-inductive properties (Intini G. The use of platelet-rich plasma in bone reconstruction therapy. Biomaterials. 2009 October; 30(28):4956-66)]. Moreover, activated PRP was found to support in vitro cell growth and maintained viability of a number of target cells including myelomas, hybridomas, hepatocytes, fibroblasts and epithelial cells, at a level comparable or superior to the level supported by fetal bovine serum (Johansson et al. Platelet lysate: a replacement for fetal bovine serum in animal cell culture? Cytotechnology. 2003 July; 42(2):67-74).","PRP and released growth factors are currently used in various surgical tissue regeneration procedures, predominantly in orthopedic and dental surgery (Nurden et al. Platelets and wound healing. Front Biosci. 2008 May 1; 13:3532-48). In orthopedic surgery PRP is used mainly for knee arthroplasty, lumbar spinal fusion, and in intervertebral disc degeneration (reviewed in Nurden et al, 2008). Dentistry and maxillofacial surgery PRP applications include mainly consolidation of titanium implants, maxillary sinus augmentation and bone remodeling (reviewed in Nurden et al, 2008). PRP is also increasingly used for tendon and ligament repair, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, chronic skin wound healing, ophthalmology, facial nerve regeneration, as well as in cardiac and bariatric surgery (reviewed in Nurden et al, 2008).","However, a major disadvantage of the current use of autologous PRP and released factors resides in the lack of standardization. Of note, different manual, semi-automated and fully-automated systems for preparation of PRP are commercially available that differ in parameters such as preparation time, platelet yield and collection efficiency (Mazzucco et al. Not every PRP-gel is born equal. Evaluation of growth factor availability for tissues through four PRP-gel preparations: Fibrinet, RegenPRP-Kit, Plateltex and one manual procedure. Vox Sang. 2009 August; 97(2):110-8).","Another important variable is the technique used for platelet activation [autologous, heterologous or recombinant throtnbin, calcium chloride or batroxobin (Rozman P, Bolta Z. Use of platelet growth factors in treating wounds and soft-tissue injuries. Acta Dermatovenerol Alp Panonica Adriat. 2007 December; 16(4):156-65)], which can affect the efficiency of granule release and the amount of secreted GFs (Rozman P, Bolta Z, 2007). Moreover, since platelets are very sensitive to mechanical stress and changes in the surrounding environment, they may be activated and GFs may be released during processing, prior to the intended activation step (Mazzucco et al, 2009). This uncontrolled activation may further increase the variability in the composition of the final product when using different PRP preparation systems. Additionally, a major inherent weakness of autologous PRP preparation is that the platelets GFs content varies among individuals, and therefore may lead to sub-optimal results. Finally, the financial burden of dedicated machinery, disposable PRP processing kits, and the need for trained personnel, should be taken into consideration when working with autologous PRP.","A recent publication (Su et al. \u201cA virally inactivated functional growth factor preparation from human platelet concentrates\u201d. Vox Sang. 2009 August; 97(2):119-128) discloses the preparation of a clottable functional growth factor extract derived from pooled aphaeresis platelet donations. However, the disclosed clottable preparation has the disadvantage that it includes only one viral inactivation step, i.e. solvent detergent (S\/D) viral inactivation which is effective particularly against enveloped viruses, but not against non-enveloped viruses. The publication indicates the possibility of applying nanofiltration as a second viral inactivation step. This preparation also contains plasma and leukocyte protein impurities. The step of S\/D removal by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) largely reduces the PDGF in the preparation. Furthermore, the clotability potential of the preparation may limit its use to local application or prevent its systemic use.","Burnouf et al. (\u201cA novel virally inactivated human platelet lysate preparation rich in TGF-beta, EGF and IGF, and depleted of PDGF and VEGF\u201d. Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 2010 Aug. 6; 56(4):151-60) discloses an S\/D treated platelet lysate with a standardized content of TGF-beta, EGF and IGF and depleted of PDGF and VEGF. The publication discloses a method for preparation of this lysate evading removal of SD by hydrophobic interaction chromatography.","There is a need of a viral-safe platelet extract preparation obtained from multiple donors comprising a mixture of proteins having growth factor and\/or trophic factor activity.","Platelets contain a complete array of factors involved in key stages of tissue regeneration and healing processes. Currently, whole autologous activated platelets (derived from the patient) are used for facilitating wound healing. However, there are multiple disadvantages of using whole autologous platelets, inter alia, the lack of standardization; the factors needed for healing may be scarce in the patient's own platelets; the special equipment needed; the procedure is time consuming and requires additional steps which are carried out on the patient itself; and the requirement of medically trained personnel. These problems can be solved e.g. by using a platelet extract prepared from multiple donors. However, human blood-derived products may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents such as viruses. Effective reduction of viral transmission risk can be achieved by including at least two orthogonal viral inactivation steps. Yet, additional steps in the manufacture of a platelet extract may compromise the recovery and activity of the factors contained therein.","The invention solves a long felt need for a viral safe (at least double viral inactivated) platelet protein extract obtained from multiple donors comprising a mixture of proteins having growth factor and\/or trophic factor activity.","The invention relates to an active and viral-safe platelet extract derived from multiple donors; to its preparation and use.","The viral-safe platelet extract comprises a mixture of active platelet cell growth factors and\/or trophic factors.","In one aspect, the invention relates to a method for preparing a viral-safe platelet extract, the method comprising at least two orthogonal viral inactivation treatments e.g. solvent detergent (S\/D) viral inactivation treatment and heat inactivation. The method comprising the following steps:","providing a platelet-enriched fraction from multiple donors e.g. a washed and\/or leukocyte-reduced platelet fraction from aphaeresis pooled from multiple donors;","preparing a platelet lysate;","carrying out a solvent detergent (S\/D) viral inactivation treatment;","removing the S\/D by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), wherein the HIC comprises the steps of: loading the lysate to HIC, and collecting a material eluted under non isocratic conditions; and","conducting a second orthogonal viral inactivation treatment.","In one embodiment of the invention, preparing the platelet lysate is carried out during the S\/D viral inactivation treatment.","In a further embodiment of the invention, during the S\/D viral inactivation treatment a sub step of aggregate reduction is carried out e.g. by filtration.","In certain embodiments of the invention, the HIC comprises the steps of: loading the lysate to HIC; washing HIC with an isocratic solution; collecting the unbound material; washing HIC with a non isocratic solution; and collecting the eluted material.","Yet, in a further embodiment of the invention, the isocratic solution consists of acetate glycine buffer and human serum albumin; and wherein the non isocratic solution comprises an organic solvent and\/or a molecule capable of binding platelet derived factors.","Yet, in a further embodiment of the invention, the lysate is contacted with a molecule capable of binding platelet-derived factors, e.g. heparin, dextran sulphate and combination thereof, prior to S\/D removal.","Yet, in a further embodiment of the invention, the extract is lyophilized.","In another aspect, the invention relates to a viral-safe platelet extract, obtainable according to the method of the invention.","The invention provides a viral-safe platelet extract derived from multiple donors comprising a mixture of biologically active platelet cell growth factors and\/or trophic factors.","In one embodiment of the invention the extract comprises PDGF-AB, VEGF and TGFb 1, wherein the ratio for PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 is at least 0.2; and\/or the ratio for PDGF-AB:VEGF is at least 45.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is enriched with PDGF-AB and\/or bFGF.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is non-clottable.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract has a low aggregate content.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is in solid form.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is provided with a delivery agent made of natural and\/or synthetic material selected from the group consisting of polymers, hydrogels, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, gelatin, alginate, collagen matrices, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), agar, oxidize regenerated cellulose, self assembled peptides, poly(glycolic) acid, poly(lactic) acid, fibrin and combinations thereof.","In another aspect, the invention relates to the use of the extract in tissue healing; organ reconstruction; tissue regeneration and\/or treating inflammation.","In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of tissue healing; organ reconstruction and\/or tissue regeneration comprising administering to a subject in need a therapeutically effective amount of an extract according to the invention.","In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating inflammation in a subject in need comprising administering to a subject in need a therapeutically effective amount of an extract according to the invention.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is administered with a delivery agent.","The invention provides a method for removing solvent-detergent (S\/D) from a biological liquid mixture by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), comprising the steps of:","providing the biological liquid mixture; and","loading the mixture to HIC, collecting the unbound material and a material eluted under non isocratic conditions.","The invention also provides a method for removing solvent-detergent (S\/D) from a biological liquid preparation by HIC, comprising the steps of:","providing the preparation;","loading the preparation to HIC; and","collecting a material eluted under non isocratic conditions.","In one embodiment of the invention, the biological preparation is a platelet derived preparation.","In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises the steps of: loading the preparation to HIC; washing HIC with an isocratic solution; collecting the unbound material; washing HIC with a non isocratic solution; and collecting the eluted material.","In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises an isocratic solution consisting of acetate glycine buffer and human serum albumin; and a non isocratic solution comprising an organic solvent and\/or a molecule capable of binding platelet derived factors.","In another aspect, the invention provides a viral-safe preparation or mixture, obtainable according to the method of the invention.","Yet in another aspect, the invention provides a kit comprising a recipient containing an extract according to the invention, optionally comprising a delivery agent.","In one embodiment, the delivery agent is made of natural and\/or synthetic material selected from the group consisting of polymers, hydrogels, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, gelatin, alginate, collagen matrices, carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), agar, oxidize regenerated cellulose, self assembled peptides, poly(glycolic) acid, poly(lactic) acid, fibrin and combinations thereof.","The invention relates to an active and viral-safe (at least double viral inactivated) platelet extract derived from multiple donors; to its preparation and use. The viral-safe platelet extract comprises a mixture of biologically active platelet cell growth factors and\/or trophic factors.","It was found according to the present invention that washed leukocyte-reduced aphaeresis platelets (WAP) contain very small amounts of albumin and, possibly, small amounts of other plasma impurities relative to washed platelets obtained from whole blood donation. It was also found that WAP subjected to S\/D treatment (lysis and viral inactivation), S\/D removal, lyophilization and reconstitution (e.g. LYO I extract) was biologically active and capable of inducing proliferation and\/or changes in morphology e.g. vessel-like structure formation (associated with angiogenesis) or formation of spindle-like structures (an attribute of increased motility) in cell lines e.g. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) or 3T3 fibroblasts cells. It was observed that the activity of the extract could be increased by addition of thrombin, biologically active component (BAC; a fibrinogen component as in EVICEL\u2122 fibrin sealant, Omrix Biopharmaceuticals Ltd.) or thrombin+BAC (Fibrin).","Human blood-derived products may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents such as viruses. Several measures are usually taken in order to minimize the risk of viral and\/or unknown pathogens transmission including routine testing of donated samples for the presence of certain viruses, and viral inactivation\/removal steps during the manufacture process. Effective reduction of viral transmission risk can be achieved by including at least two orthogonal viral inactivation steps that do not alter the beneficial properties of the product. Lipid-enveloped viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and West Nile Virus are quickly and efficiently inactivated by the S\/D treatment which destroys the lipid membrane of the viruses.","Next, the extract was subjected to a second viral inactivation treatment e.g. a heat treatment (pasteurization) step or nanofiltration. It was found according to the invention that the extract could not easily pass through a nanofiltration system.","Surprisingly, it was found according to the invention that a heat treatment (pasteurization) viral inactivation step is feasible and yields a biologically active extract (e.g. LYO II) as tested by a cell proliferation assay and induction of morphological changes (e.g. induction of angiogenesis or induction of spindle like shapes) assay. It was found that thrombin, fibrinogen or fibrin addition pronounced the extract activity (fibrinogen or fibrin addition by promoting tubular structure formation and thrombin by increasing proliferation).","In one embodiment of the invention, for heat treatment, the S\/D treated material is subjected to a step of stabilization. Sucrose and glycine can be added into the solution to serve as stabilizers during the pasteurization step. The solution can then be pasteurized e.g. by heat treatment at 60\u00b10.5\u00b0 C. for 9-10.5 hours with constant mixing. Then the solution can be diluted e.g. with acetate-glycine buffer and the stabilizers can be removed from the solution e.g. by diafiltration against acetate-glycine buffer. If aggregated material is present, it can be removed by filtration through one or more sequential filtrations e.g. using 20, 5 and 1.2 \u03bcm filters, followed by 0.45 \u03bcm filter. Sterile filtrations can be carried out under aseptic conditions using a 0.2 \u03bcm filter. The solution can be lyophilized in autoclaved vials and sealed with autoclaved rubber stoppers under nitrogen atmosphere and in partial vacuum (0.6 Bar).","It was found according to the invention that the double viral-inactivated extract could be concentrated (e.g. as in LYO III) e.g. four-fold or 32-fold compared to the concentration of the starting material. Concentration can be achieved e.g. by diafiltration of the solution and\/or reconstitution of the lyophilized extract in a lower volume compared to the volume of the extract prior to lyophylization.","If aggregated material is present, it can be removed by sequential filtration as above. It was found that the concentrated extract (e.g. LYO III) comprises very low amounts of plasma proteins. It was found that the concentrated extracts (e.g. LYO VI and LYO VII) were non-clottable. The extracts exhibited marginal levels or complete absence of clotting proteins. The concentrated extract is depleted of physiologically active fibrinogen since the levels of physiologically active fibrinogen are undetectable by a sensitive method currently used in the art. The extracts lacked pro-coagulant activity as assessed by the non-activated partial thromboplastin time measurement test (NAPTT). The NAPTT can be carried out essentially as described in the European Pharmacopoeia 7.0; 2.6.22: Activated coagulation factors monograph (January 2008:20622); in European Pharmacopoeia Strasburg (France), Council of Europe, 2009. The absence of coagulation factors was also determined by the Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) test. It was shown by this test that the platelet extract according to the invention is deficient in one or more of the coagulation factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and I, rendering the extract non-clottable.","It was found according to the invention that increasing the concentrations of the extract affected the proliferation level of 3T3-Swiss albino mouse fibroblast cells with the effect of the concentrated extract being more pronounced than a lysate of the starting material while normalized to the amounts of PDGF-AB present in the samples. Notably, the effect of the concentrated extracts was more pronounced than the positive control (MasterMix, a custom mixture of recombinant human growth factors prepared with TGF-\u03b21 200 ng\/ml, b-FGF 0.5 ng\/ml, VEGF 5 ng\/ml and PDGF-AB 300 ng\/ml). It was also found that addition of the concentrated extract to Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) monolayer promoted tubulogenesis. A synergistic effect in tubulogenesis of HUVEC monolayer was shown by the addition of the concentrated extract in combination with fibrin sealant.","For optimal S\/D viral inactivation a sub step of aggregate removal can be added during the S\/D treatment (e.g. as carried out in LYO IV). Aggregate removal can be carried out e.g. by centrifugation; filtration; preparative size exclusion chromatography (SEC); ultrafiltration e.g. using 100 KD polyethersulfone (PES) membrane, 100 KD polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, 300 KD PES membranes, polypropylene membranes, cellulose acetate membranes and\/or by any other method known in the art.","Optionally, an additional step of aggregate removal by addition of calcium chloride, or other calcium salts, and clarification filtration is included. E.g. calcium chloride at a final concentration of 40 mM can be added (to facilitate the precipitation of aggregates) followed by clarification filtration e.g. using 20, 5, 1.2 and 0.45 \u03bcm filters. In one embodiment, this step is added after the S\/D treatment.","It was found according to the invention that these additional steps of aggregate removal are feasible and yield a biologically active extract. A platelet extract having a low aggregate content can be advantageously used for intravenous administration. Also, a platelet extract having a low aggregate content can be used together with a component comprising a relatively high concentration of calcium.","It was found in uncoated cell culture wells, and in collagen or fibrinogen coated wells containing fibroblast, that treatment of the cells with extracts which were subjected to aggregate removal, promoted fibroblasts motility and closure of wound (in scratch assay) in a similar manner as the lysate of the starting material and as PRP-R [(PRP-releasate, activated with calcium and thrombin (from EVICEL\u2122)]. PRP-R has been reported to be beneficial in wound healing in in-vivo settings (Lacci K M, Dardik A, 2010).","In addition, it was found according to the invention that extracts subjected to aggregate removal induced in HUVEC strong morphological changes which are associated with angiogenesis.","It was found according to the invention that certain platelet factors can be recovered during the S\/D removal step by adding at least one elution step in the HIC column used for the S\/D removal and by collecting also the eluted material. One such factor is PDGF-AB. It was found that by washing HIC with a non isocratic solution, in accordance to the invention, at least 3-fold recovery or enrichment of PDGF-AB can be obtained (as in LYO V, VI, and VII). The concentration of PDGF-AB was measured in the final lyophilized material following reconstitution with 4 ml double distilled water (DDW). The concentration of PDGF-AB was found to be 4,578 pg\/ml in LYO VI, 15,028 pg\/ml in LYO V, and 194,353 pg\/ml in LYO VII which corresponds to about 7\u00d710pg in LYO VI, 2.26\u00d710pg in LYO V, and 3.12\u00d710pg in LYO VII PDGF-AB per platelet used as the starting material. Notably, the effect of the extract enriched with PDGF-AB on proliferation of cells was more pronounced than recombinant PDGF-AB alone, pointing to the fact that other platelets' extracted components may synergistically enhance fibroblasts proliferation. Another factor enriched\/increased using the method of the invention is bFGF (also named FGF-2 or \u03b2-FGF). It was also found that by washing HIC with a non isocratic solution, in accordance to the invention, at least 1.8 fold recovery or enrichment of bFGF can be obtained (as in LYO VI). The concentration of bFGF was found to be 36-127 pg\/ml which corresponds to about 5.4\u00d710\u22121.95\u00d710pg bFGF per platelet used as the starting material.","These findings paved the way to prepare an extract according to the invention. The extract of the invention comprises one or more of the following features: comprises proteins having growth and\/or trophic factors e.g. TGF-b1, b-FGF, VEGF, and PDGF-AB with a more balanced composition as compared to other platelet factor mixtures known in the art; is double viral inactivated e.g. S\/D treated and pasteurized; has reduced aggregate content; comprises a proportion of factors that is similar to the physiological proportion of the same factors; comprises a physiological balanced proportion between TGF-b1, VEGF, and PDGF-AB; and exhibits reduced plasma impurities (e.g. reduced IgG and fibrinogen levels).","The term \u201cphysiologically balanced proportion\u201d refers, for example, to a proportion between PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 and\/or between PDGF-AB:VEGF that is similar to the proportion of these factors in a physiological composition of platelets, concentrated platelets, pooled platelets, platelets leukocyte reduced, pooled platelets leukocyte reduced, washed platelets, washed aphaeresis platelets leukocyte-reduced (WAP) preparation, platelet extract, Platelet Rich Plasma releasate (PRP-R), serum, and\/or platelet releasate. \u201cSerum\u201d typically refers to blood plasma without fibrinogen or other clotting factors that contain growth\/trophic factors released by activated platelets. In the case of serum, the physiological ratio can be calculated according to growth\/trophic factor values present in the serum (according to package inserts of commercial ELISA kits). In such an example, the physiological ratio between PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 and PDGF-AB:VEGF was found to be 0.5 and 90.9, respectively.","In one embodiment, the physiological ratio between PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 in WAP (starting material) is at least 0.2 or in the range of about 0.2 to about 0.5, such as about 0.2, 0.3, 0.36, 0.4, 0.44 and 0.47.","In another embodiment, the physiological ratio between PDGF-AB:VEGF in WAP (starting material) is at least 45 or in the range of about 45 to about 103, such as about 45, 64, 73, 76, and 103.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract according to the invention comprises a ratio for PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 that is at least 0.2; and\/or for PDGF-AB:VEGF that is at least 45.","In one embodiment of the invention, the extract according to the invention comprises a ratio for PDGF-AB:TGF-b1 that is at least about 0.56; and\/or for PDGF-AB:VEGF that is at least about 74 (as in LYO VII).","The extract according to the invention has one or more of the following advantages: is standardized and allows robust (consistent) biological performance; exhibits biological activity e.g. induction of proliferation and\/or morphological changes in cells; exhibits increased activity with low concentrations of PDGF-AB as compared to the concentration of recombinant PDGF-AB alone therefore the likelihood of transformational changes in non proliferative tissue is decreased; has optimal viral safety; has improved immunological safety e.g. since it comprises low levels of plasma impurities relative to an extract prepared from platelet-enriched fractions which were not subjected to a step of plasma proteins removal e.g. a washing step; and is non clottable.","The term \u201cviral-safe platelet extract\u201d refers to an extract which was subjected to at least two orthogonal viral inactivation treatments.","\u201cAt least two orthogonal viral inactivation treatments\u201d involves carrying out at least two different and independent treatments for inactivating viruses. A combination of two or more of the following non limiting treatment examples can be used: pasteurization, Solvent\/Detergent (S\/D), nanofiltration, Low pH treatment, UV irradiation and Sodium thiocyanate treatment.","The term \u201cinactivating viruses or viral inactivation\u201d refers to a situation wherein viruses are maintained in the solution but are rendered non-viable e.g. by dissolving their lipid coat; and\/or to the situation wherein viruses are physically removed from the solution e.g. by size exclusion techniques.","The term \u201cplatelet extract\u201d refers to a mixture comprising platelet-derived factors. Typically, extracts are cell free.","The term \u201clysate\u201d refers to a solution produced when cells are destroyed by disrupting their cell membranes.","The term \u201cactive platelet extract\u201d refers to a platelet extract which comprises biologically active substances such as growth factors and\/or trophic factors and exhibits biological activity including, but not limited to, induction of cell proliferation cell motility, cell-cell interactions, and\/or cellular morphological changes.","The term \u201cplatelet extract derived from multiple donors\u201d refers to a platelet extract which is prepared from at least two individuals. The individuals can be human or other mammalians.","The term \u201cgrowth factor\u201d typically refers to an agent that promotes cellular growth, proliferation and\/or differentiation. Examples of growth factors include, but are not limited to, transforming growth factor (TGF) e.g. TGF-b1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) e.g. bFGF, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) e.g. PDGF-AB, and the like.","The term \u201ctrophic factors\u201d typically refers to an agent that stimulates differentiation and\/or survival of cells. Examples of trophic factor include, but are not limited to, adhesion molecules, bone morphogenetic proteins, cytokines, eph receptor tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factors, fibroblast growth factors (FGF), GDNF, heparin-binding growth factors, insulin-like growth factors, neurotrophins, semaphorins, transforming growth factors (TGF) \u03b2, tyrosine kinase receptor ligands, and the like.","A platelet factor may have growth activity and trophic activity.","The term \u201caggregates\u201d refers to a chunk of material which contains solids such as protein aggregates. Protein aggregation can be encountered during manufacture of biotherapeutics (Protein aggregation and bioprocessing. Cromwell M E, Hilario E, Jacobson F. AAPS J. 2006 Sep. 15; 8(3):E572-9. Review).

In another embodiment, the binding buffer comprises 20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4 and 1% human serum albumin (v\/v from the total volume). In another embodiment, the binding buffer comprises 20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4 and 0.2% human serum albumin (v\/v from the total volume). Yet in another embodiment, the binding buffer comprises 20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4, 0.2% human serum albumin (v\/v from the total volume) and 1% dextran sulfate (w\/w from the total weight). The binding buffer can comprise HSA in a concentration range from about 0.2 to about 5% (v\/v from the total volume).","The term \u201cunbound material\u201d typically refers to the fraction collected following washing of the loaded column with the same buffer used for equilibration and\/or the buffer used for loading the S\/D treated extract onto the column (\u201cbinding buffer\u201d). Advantageously, in the S\/D removal step, using HIC, after washing the column and collecting unbound material, a non-isocratic solution is used to increase the recovery of certain growth factors, e.g. PDGF-AB and bFGF; to obtain a more balanced composition and\/or an extract having a physiologically balanced proportion. In this regard, S\/D removal in the S\/D treated lysate is carried out by loading the S\/D treated lysate onto HIC in a binding solution, washing with an isocratic solution, collecting the unbound material containing the lysate substantially without the S\/D and next collecting PDGF-AB, and perhaps other factors e.g. bFGF, bound to the HIC resin by using elution conditions. The most common elution conditions employ a shift in the composition of the mobile phase or a non-isocratic solution so the factors e.g. PDGF-AB binding environment created by the binding solution is lost.","In one embodiment of the invention, PDGF-AB is 3-fold enriched, during S\/D removal employing HIC, by eluting PDGF-AB bound to the HIC resin using non isocratic elution conditions.","The term \u201celution conditions\u201d refers to using a non-isocratic condition e.g. a solution or condition different from the solution or condition used to load and\/or equilibrate the column, and\/or different from the solution used in a previous step. The elution conditions are such that S\/D substantially remains bound to the column whereas the factors are eluted. The method according to the invention comprises at least one elution step with a non isocratic solution.","Elution conditions, typically involves an increase in salt concentration. It was found that when using a C-18 resin, a positive correlation exists between NaCl concentration in the elution buffer and PDGF-AB recovery following HIC using a concentration ranging from 0.3 M up to 1M NaCl. Improved results were obtained at a concentration of 1 M (about 30% PDGF-AB recovery). When using SDR resin, similar PDGF-AB recoveries were obtained in all NaCl tested concentrations of 0.7 and 1.5 M.","A further improvement in the elution conditions for PDGF-AB was obtained by adding an organic solvent to the buffer in combination with an increase in salt concentrations. Optimal elution conditions are such that S\/D substantially remains bound to the column whereas most of the factors are eluted.","It was found according to the invention that a high PDGF-AB recovery was obtained with lower than 1 M NaCl and\/or lower than 20% ethanol in both C-18 and SDR resins without substantially affecting SD removal.","It was found according to the invention that increased elution for b-FGF was obtained by adding in the buffer, in addition to ethanol and NaCl, a molecule capable of binding b-FGF e.g. heparin. Optimal results were obtained for PDGF-AB and b-FGF recovery when incubating the lysate with a molecule capable of binding growth\/trophic factors (e.g. dextran sulfate) prior to the S\/D removal step and carrying out the S\/D removal step in the presence of such molecule.","In one embodiment of the invention, the elution solution employed is different from the binding buffer e.g. different from a solution containing 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine and 0.2% human serum albumin; different from a solution containing 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine and 1% human serum albumin and\/or different from a solution containing 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine and 5% human serum albumin.

In another embodiment of the invention, the elution solution comprises components other than 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine and 0.2% human serum albumin. In another embodiment, the elution buffer comprises an organic solvent, a salt, and\/or a molecule that binds growth\/throphic factor(s). In another embodiment, the elution buffer comprises ethanol e.g. at a concentration from 10-12.5%, NaCl e.g. at a concentration of 0.5M-1M, heparin e.g. at a concentration of 5 IU\/ml and\/or dextran sulphate e.g. at a concentration of 0.1-1%. In another embodiment, the elution solution comprises 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, 10% ethanol, 1M NaCl, and 0.2% human serum albumin. In another embodiment, the elution solution comprises 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, 12.5% ethanol, 0.5M NaCl, and 0.2% human serum albumin. In another embodiment, the elution solution comprises 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, 12.5% ethanol, 0.5M NaCl, 5 IU\/ml Heparin and 0.2% human serum albumin.

In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises more than one elution step. In such case the elution solution is different from the solution used in a previous step and can be the same as the binding buffer.","In one embodiment of the invention, the non isocratic solution is acetate glycine buffer (e.g. 20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4) containing from 5% to 15% ethanol, from 0.2M to 1.2M NaCl, and from 0.1% to 1.0% HSA e.g. 0.2% HSA. Other possible salts are, but not limited to, KCl, MgCl, CaCl. Other possible solvents are, but not limited to, isopropanol, glycerol, ethyelene glycol.","It was found according to the invention that by carrying out two elution steps I\u2014with acetate glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4) containing 12.5% ethanol, 0.5M NaCl, 5 IU\/ml Heparin [a molecule that binds growth\/trophic factor(s)], and 0.2% HSA; and II\u2014with acetate glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4) containing 10% ethanol, 1M NaCl and 0.2% HSA, at least 3-fold recovery or enrichment of PDGF-AB can be obtained and about 1.8-fold recovery or enrichment of bFGF can be obtained (as in LYO VI) as compared to a preparation obtain in the absence of such elutions steps.","In one embodiment of the invention, a two step elution with a non isocratic condition is carried out.

By these elution steps, the recovery of bFGF can be increased to 85% and the recovery of PDGF-AB can be increased to 88% as compared to concentrations of the factors prior to S\/D removal by HIC.","Surprisingly, the overall recovery of PDGF-AB (from the starting material, WAP) in LYO VII was 51% compared with the overall recovery of PDGF-AB of 1.5% in LYO VI. The overall recovery of VEGF in LYO VII was 73% compared to 37% in LYO VI.","In one embodiment of the invention, the method of the invention further comprises the step of contacting the lysate with a molecule that binds factors e.g. growth factors prior to the S\/D removal step. The molecule that binds factors can be e.g. dextran sulphate at a final concentration range of 0.01 to 1% e.g. at a concentration of 1% (w\/w). In such an embodiment, the binding buffer comprises dextran sulphate in addition to sodium acetate, glycine, and human serum albumin. In another embodiment of the invention, the non isocratic solution comprises dextran sulphate at a final concentration of 0.1% (w\/w).","It was found according to the invention that the sequence of elution solutions plays a role in the recovery level of PDGF-AB and b-FGF. Namely, factor recoveries can vary when different non isocratic solutions are used and\/or when the elution order is changed or reversed.","The molecule can be heparin, dextran sulphate, heparan sulfate, and other sulfated polysaccharides, glycosaminoglycans, or polyanions, and the like to which growth\/trophic factors can bind upon contact.","The term \u201ccontact between the molecule and the factor\u201d is used in its broadest sense and refers to any type of combining action which brings the molecule into sufficiently close proximity with the factors of interest present in the lysate such that a binding interaction will occur between the chemical compound and the factors. Contacting can be carried out in a different ways, including, but not limited to, introducing the compound into the lysate.","Advantageously, contacting the lysate with a molecule that binds growth factors and\/or trophic factors prior to S\/D removal step results in an increase\/enrichment in the amounts of several factors e.g. PDGF-AB, bFGF.","In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for removing solvent-detergent (S\/D) from a biological liquid substance by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC).

The effect of LYO I on cell proliferation was compared to the effect of WAP.","Cell Proliferation Assay.","For this purpose, 3T3-Swiss albino fibroblast cells (ATCC, Cat number CCL92) were plated at a concentration of 25\u00d710cells\/ml (2500 cells\/well) in tissue culture treated Costar 96-wells plates (Corning Life Science, MA USA) in 100 \u03bcl full growth medium [DMEM (Biological Industries, Israel; Cat. number 01-055-1A) containing 4.5 gr\/1 glucose and supplemented with 4 mM glutamine (Biological Industries, Israel; Cat. number 03-020-1B), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone, USA; Cat. number SH30070.03), penicillin (100 U\/ml)\/streptomycin (0.1 mg\/ml)\/amphotericine (0.25 \u03bcg\/ml) solution (P\/S\/A; Biological Industries, Israel; Cat. number 03-033-1B)]. The seeded cells were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO. 24 hours after cell seeding, the full growth medium was discarded, the wells were washed twice with 100 \u03bcl starvation medium and 100 \u03bcl fresh starvation medium was added into each well [starvation medium: DMEM containing 4.5 gr\/1 glucose supplemented with 4 mM glutamine, 1% MEM-EAGLE non-essential amino acids (Biological Industries, Israel; Cat. number 01-340-1B, 1% human serum albumin (Plasbumin 25, Talecris Biotherapeutics, Germany) and P\/S\/A (in the concentrations listed above)].","The proliferation was induced 24 hours after replacement of the medium by adding \u201cpooled WAP\u201d (see preparation above) or reconstituted \u201cLYO I\u201d. LYO I was reconstituted in 0.4 ml starvation medium (5-fold concentrated as compared to the material before lyophilization). Total protein amounts were determined by using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (see Example 2). Concentrations of several growth factors in both WAP I and LYO I were detected by ELISA (Quantikine by R&D Systems, MN USA: Human TGF-\u03b21 cat DB100B, Human FGF basic cat HSFB00D, Human PDGF-AB cat DHD00B, Human EGF cat DEG00) and the amounts present in the wells during the proliferation assay are as follows: TGF-\u03b21\u2014205 and 350 ng\/ml; bFGF\u2014260 and 265 pg\/ml; PDGF-AB\u201475 and 7 ng\/ml; and EGF\u20143 and 3 ng\/ml in wells treated with WAP I and LYO I, respectively.","Proliferation was evaluated 48 hours after addition of addition of WAP or LYO I by using WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent according to the manufacturer instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany; Cat. number 11-644-807) which quantifies cell proliferation and cell viability based on mitochondria activity. The plate was incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% COand then shaken for 1 min. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm against a background control (starvation medium without cells) as a blank using an ELISA reader.

Under certain conditions, for example during the wound healing process, fibroblast cells acquire spindle-like shapes. These shapes are an attribute of the increased motility of the fibroblasts (Park et al. Comparative study on motility of the cultured fetal and neonatal dermal fibroblasts in extracellular matrix. Yonsei Med J. 2001 December; 42(6):587-94; Nagano et al. PDGF regulates the actin cytoskeleton through hnRNP-K-mediated activation of the ubiquitin E3-ligase MIR. EMBO J. 2006 May 3; 25(9):1871-82). HUVEC, which are often used to assess induction of angiogenesis by different substances form vessel-like structures (Arnaoutova I, Kleinman H K. In vitro angiogenesis: endothelial cell tube formation on gelled basement membrane extract. Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5(4):628-35). These morphological changes are associated with angiogenesis.","To monitor the effect of LYO I on the morphology of cells, HUVEC or 3T3-Swiss albino cells were seeded at a concentration of 25\u00d710cells\/ml (2500 cells\/well) in a 96-wells plate in 100 \u03bcl full growth medium [for HUVEC: medium 200 (Gibco Invitrogen, CA USA; Cat. number M200500) supplemented with Low Serum Growth Supplement (LSGS; Gibco Invitrogen, CA USA; Cat. number S00310) and P\/S\/A solution (in the concentration mentioned above); for 3T3-Swiss albino cells: as listed in the preceding experiment]. 24 hours after cell seeding, the full growth medium was discarded, each well was washed twice with 100 \u03bcl starvation medium, and 100 \u03bcl fresh starvation medium was added [for HUVEC: medium 200 supplemented with 2% FCS and P\/S\/A (same concentration as above); for 3T3: as listed in the preceding experiment]. 24 hours after the change to starvation medium, reconstituted LYO I (20 mg\/ml total protein in well; reconstitution was carried out in 0.4 ml appropriate starvation medium for each cell) was added into the wells. Concentrations of TGF-\u03b2, bFGF, PDGF-AB, and EGF in the wells are the same as in the proliferation assay.","In some HUVEC samples additional treatments were carried out: in some samples addition of 2 IU\/ml thrombin (final concentration in the well) (a solution as in the thrombin component of EVICEL\u2122 fibrin sealant, Omrix Biopharmaceuticals Ltd.); in some samples addition of fibrinogen component diluted 1:16 (final dilution in well; the fibrinogen component used was the BAC component of EVICEL\u2122 fibrin sealant); in other samples LYO I+2 IU\/ml thrombin (final concentration in the well); and LYO I+diluted fibrinogen component (1:16). All dilutions were carried out in starvation medium. Untreated cells grown in starvation medium were used as control.","The morphology of the cells was microscopically evaluated 48 hours (3T3; ) or 72 hours (HUVEC, ) after the different treatments. Each experiment was carried out in triplicates.","The results show that untreated 3T3-Swiss albino cells () possessed diamond, kite-like shapes (see striped arrows). Addition of LYO I () resulted in formation of spindle-like structures (continuous arrows).","HUVEC untreated cells and thrombin treated cells ( and C, respectively) possessed diamond-like shapes (striped arrows) whereas addition of LYO I () induced vessel-like structures formation (continuous arrows). In addition, treatment of HUVEC cells with LYO I and thrombin () or LYO I and BAC () resulted in an increased vessel-like structures formation as compared to the other treatment groups. Treatment with BAC alone () resulted in a minor effect (a few vessel-like structures were formed).","Human blood-derived products may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents such as viruses. Several measures are usually taken in order to minimize the risk of viral and\/or unknown pathogens transmission including routine testing donated samples for the presence of certain viruses, and viral inactivation\/removal steps during the manufacture process. Effective reduction of viral transmission risk can be achieved by including at least two orthogonal viral inactivation steps that do not alter the beneficial properties of the product. Lipid-enveloped viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and West Nile virus are quickly and efficiently inactivated by the S\/D treatment which destroys the lipid membrane of the viruses.","Pasteurization is a process by which heat destroys both lipid-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Nanofiltration is a process by which lipid-enveloped and non-enveloped viruses are excluded from the sample by using special nanometer-scale filters.","In the following examples the ability of using pasteurization as the second viral inactivation step was assessed.","A pool of WAP material was prepared and S\/D treated as elaborated in Example 1 except that: 1) Three WAP bags were used (a total volume of 600 ml). 2) A sample of 430 ml was removed and treated with S\/D and the rest 170 ml were frozen at \u221280\u00b0 C. for later analysis (\u201cpooled WAP II\u201d). 3) HSA was added into the sample at a final concentration of 1% v\/v (and not 5% HSA as in LYO I). 4) The 500 ml [430 ml sample+70 ml acetate-glycine buffer (200 mM sodium acetate; and 100 mM glycine)] sample was transferred to a stainless steel beaker and placed in a water bath set to 25\u00b0 C. (not 4\u00b0 C. as in Example 1). 5) Following addition of Triton X-100 and TnBP the sample was continuously stirred for 2 hours at 25\u00b0 C. (Triton X-100 and TnBP were added for a shorter period of time in this experiment, 2 hours vs. 4 hours in Example 1 since S\/D treatment was carried out at a higher temperature 25\u00b0 C. vs. 4\u00b0 C. in Example 1). 6) S\/D removal was performed using XK26\/40 liquid chromatography column packed with 80 ml of SDR HyperD solvent-detergent removal chromatography resin in conjunction with a BT300-2J peristaltic pump (MRC, Israel) and a UA-6 UV\/VIS detector+Type 11 recorder (ISCO, NE, USA) at a constant flow rate of 10 ml\/min. The column was prepared with 320 ml of ddHO followed by equilibration with 240 ml of acetate-glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4) containing 1% HSA v\/v (not 5%). 7) After loading the sample (450 ml), the column was washed with 144 ml acetate-glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, pH 6.8-7.4+1% HSA v\/v, followed by 144 ml ddHO. 8) D-mannitol was not added into the flow through material. Next, the flow through S\/D treated material (i.e. unbound fraction and washing buffer) (610 ml) was subjected to a step of stabilization and pasteurization as follows: one gram sucrose per gram of flow through sample was slowly added into the flow through material while mixing (at about 22\u00b0 C.) until the sucrose was completely dissolved. Then, the solution was warmed to 37\u00b11\u00b0 C. and 0.11 g glycine per g of flow through material was slowly added into the solution while mixing and adjusting the pH to 6.8-7.4 using 0.5N NaOH. pH adjustment was carried out until the glycine was completely dissolved. This was followed by a gradual addition of 0.8 g sucrose per g flow through material while mixing at 37\u00b0 C. until completely dissolved. Sucrose and glycine were added into the solution to serve as stabilizers during the pasteurization step. The solution was then pasteurized by heat treatment at 60\u00b0 C. for 10 hours with constant mixing (50 RPM). In order to transfer the resulting viscous solution (which was formed as a result of the stabilizers addition) into a clean vessel, it was diluted with acetate-glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, and 10 mM glycine at pH 6.8-7.4) up to a total volume of 1830 ml. The stabilizers were removed from the solution by diafiltration against acetate-glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, pH 6.8-7.4) using Filtron Ultrafiltration System with 2 Omega Minisette 10 kDa cassettes (Pall Corp, Port Washington, N.Y., USA). The diafiltration step was carried out as follows: the sample was first concentrated to a volume of 900 ml, and dialysis was carried out against a total volume of 5,400 ml acetate-glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine, pH 6.8-7.4) by a gradual addition of the buffer and keeping the solution volume at 900\u00b1100 ml. The dialyzed solution was then concentrated to 400 ml.","In order to remove aggregated material, the solution was sequentially filtered through 5 and 1.2 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters (Cat. Numbers 5591342P5, 5591303P5), followed by 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France; Cat. Number 5441306G5). Sterile filtration was carried out under aseptic conditions (inside a biological sterile cabinet) using a 0.2 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France; Cat. Number 5441307H5). The solution was then aliquoted (4 ml) into autoclaved glass vials, lyophilized and sealed with autoclaved rubber stoppers under nitrogen atmosphere and in partial vacuum (0.6 Bar) as indicated in Example 1. The lyophilized platelet extract prepared above is referred herein as \u201cLYO II\u201d.","The preparation of LYO II included S\/D treatment, a pasteurization step, and final sterile filtration through 0.2 \u03bcm.","The following experiment was aimed to determine the effect of LYO II (a lyophilized platelet extract prepared from pooled WAP, treated with S\/D, subjected to SDR HyperD chromatography resin, pasteurized, sterile filtrated and lyophilized) on cell proliferation. Cell seeding concentrations and full growth medium replacement were carried out as in Example 3 in two different cell lines: HUVEC and 3T3-Swiss albino (the compatible full growth medium and starvation medium was used for each cell type; see components of medium above; 2500 cells per well in 100 \u03bcl medium).","In 3T3-Swiss albino cells, the proliferation was induced 24 hours after replacement of the medium by the addition of pooled WAP II or reconstituted LYO II (the LYO II, which was lyophilized from a 4 ml solution, was reconstituted in 0.5 ml sterile purified water-8-times concentrated as compared to pooled WAP II). Following reconstitution of LYO II, both LYO II and pooled WAP II were serially diluted 5-fold in the compatible starvation medium (the starting concentration of pooled WAP II was designated as 1 accordingly relative concentrations of 1, 0.2, 0.04, 0.008, 0.0016, 0.00032 were used; the starting concentration of LYO II was designated as 8 (this concentration was not tested in this experiment) and accordingly relative concentrations of 1.6, 0.32, 0.064, 0.0128, 0.00256 were used). 10 \u03bcl were added from each dilution into the well (initial plating concentration of 2500 cells; and 100 \u03bcl medium). Concentrations of several growth factors in both WAP II and LYO II were detected by ELISA (Quantikine by R&D Systems, MN USA: Human PDGF-AB cat DHD00B, Human VEGF cat DVE00) and the actual concentrations that were present in the wells (in the highest concentration) during the proliferation assay are as follows: bFGF\u2014120 and 280 pg\/ml; VEGF\u20140.75 and 2.7 ng\/ml; and PDGF-AB\u201480 and 36 ng\/ml in wells treated with WAP II and LYO II, respectively.","The proliferation level of 3T3-Swiss albino cells was evaluated 48 hours later by using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent. The plate was incubated for 4 hours at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO. At the end of the incubation period, the plate was shaken for 1 min and the absorbance of the samples was measured as elaborated in Example 3. The OD values obtained for un-treated cells were subtracted from the obtained OD results and the calculated values were plotted as a sigmoidal dose-response curve. Rfit and median effective concentration (EC50) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. The proliferative effect of LYO II or pooled WAP II on 3T3-Swiss albino fibroblast cells are shown in . The experiment was carried out in triplicates.","The results show that the proliferative effect of LYO II on 3T3-Swiss albino is similar to that of the starting material (pooled WAP II). These results demonstrate that the production process of LYO II, which included double-step viral inactivation, does not affect its potency compared to the WAP starting material e.g. EC50 values were 0.018 and 0.013 for pooled WAP II and LYO II, respectively.","For HUVEC, the proliferation was induced 24 hours after medium replacement by different treatments: addition of thrombin (T; 1 IU\/ml final concentration in the well; a thrombin component from EVICEL\u2122 fibrin sealant, Omrix Biopharmaceuticals Ltd.) with or without reconstituted LYO II; and addition of reconstituted LYO II. Untreated cells were used as reference (marked as 0). 10 \u03bcl of each solution treatment was added into each well","Reconstitution of LYO II, which was lyophilized from a 4 ml solution, was carried out in 0.5 ml sterile purified water-8-times concentrated.","Concentrations of bFGF, VEGF, and PDGF-AB were as in the proliferation assay carried out in the 3T3-cells.","Measurements of the proliferation level were carried out 72 hours after the initiation of the treatment by the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent. At the end of the incubation period (4 hours), the plates were shaken for 1 min and the absorbance of the samples was measured as indicated above. The measurements were carried out in duplicates. A third replicate was stained with Calcein-AM in order to explore the angiogenic potency of LYO II (see the results below \u201cVessel-like structures formation in HUVEC\u201d).","HUVEC proliferation rate following induction with LYO II, thrombin, and thrombin+LYO II are shown in .","The results show that the addition of LYO II to HUVEC resulted in a significantly higher proliferation as compared to the control cells (\u201c0\u201d without LYO II) or to the cells treated with thrombin alone. Addition of LYO II+thrombin (T) resulted in a more pronounced proliferative activity as compared to the addition of LYO II alone. Vessel-like structure formation in HUVEC.","The following experiment was carried out as a positive control to observe the vessel-like structures acquired by HUVEC when grown on a Basement Membrane Extract (BME) coating in HUVEC starvation medium. BME has an essential role in tissue organization that affects cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation and growing of cells (Mehta V B, Besner G E. HB-EGF promotes angiogenesis in endothelial cells via PI3-kinase and MAPK signaling pathways. Growth Factors. 2007 August; 25(4):253-63; Arnaoutova I, Kleinman H K. 2010).

Calcein-AM is a fluorescent dye which is used in biology for testing cell viability and for short-term labeling of cells\u2014after transport into the cells, intracellular esterases (present in viable cells) remove the acetomethoxy group, the molecule gets trapped inside and gives a strong green fluorescence. As dead cells lack active esterases, only live cells are labeled. The results are presented in .","The results show that pronounced tubular structures which reflect potential of angiogenesis were detected on the BME coated surfaces. No tubulogenesis were observed on collagen coatings (data not shown).","In order to explore the capability of LYO II to induce angiogenesis, the third replicate from the previous experiment (cell proliferation experiment in Example 5) was stained with 5 \u03bcM Calcein-AM as above and representative pictures were taken using Axiovert 200 microscope (\u00d7200 magnification) and a fluorescence filter for 530 nm. The vessel-like structures acquired by HUVEC following treatment with LYO II are shown in .","It can be seen that addition of reconstituted LYO II (8B) resulted in initiation of formation of tubular structures similar to the positive control treatment (HUVEC seeded on BME coating; ).","To explore the ability of LYO II to induce cell morphology changes which might be correlated with induced cell motility, an experiment was carried out in 3T3-Swiss albino cells in similar conditions as in Example 5 cell proliferation assay (compatible full growth and starvation media were used). It was observed that LYO II and pooled WAP II induced morphological changes (form diamond like to spindle-like shapes) as compared to untreated cells (data not shown).","In another experiment, the ability of LYO II to induce vessel-like structures in the presence of fibrin sealant or fibrinogen was evaluated. Fibrin sealant comprises components of the extracellular matrix e.g. fibronectin and fibrinogen (Bar et al. \u201cThe binding of fibrin sealant to collagen is influenced by the method of purification and the cross-linked fibrinogen-fibronectin (heteronectin) content of the \u2018fibrinogen\u2019 component\u201d.

The marginal levels or complete absence of clotting proteins in LYO III renders the platelet extract non-clottable. In comparison, a platelet extract prepared according to Burnouf (WO 2009\/087560) contains a high concentration of coagulation factors. LYO III and pooled WAP III comprise less than 0.08 mg\/ml active fibrinogen.","The effect of LYO III on cell proliferation was carried out as elaborated in Example 5 using 3T3-Swiss albino cells.","LYO III, which was lyophilized from a 4 ml solution and that was concentrated 4-fold compared to the starting WAP volume, was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of sterile purified water-8-times concentrated (32-fold concentrated compared to starting volume of pooled WAP III). Following reconstitution, pooled WAP III or reconstituted LYO III were serially diluted 5-fold in the appropriate starvation medium and 10 \u03bcl of each dilution was added into a well containing 100 \u03bcl starvation medium. The starting concentration of pooled WAP III was designated as 1 and the serial dilutions were calculated accordingly. The starting concentration of LYO III was designated as 32 and the serial dilutions were calculated accordingly. Concentrations of several growth factors in both WAP III and LYO III were detected by ELISA (Quantikine by R&D Systems, MN USA: Human TGF-\u03b21 cat DB100B, Human FGF basic cat HSFB00D, Human VEGF cat DVE00, Human PDGF-AB cat DHD00B) and the actual concentrations that were present in the well (in the highest concentration) during the proliferation assay are as follows: TGF-\u03b21 \u2014170 and 4250 ng\/ml; bFGF\u201485 and 540 pg\/ml; VEGF\u20141 and 13 ng\/ml; and PDGF-AB\u201473 and 33 ng\/ml in wells treated with WAP III and LYO III, respectively.","As a standard control, a custom mixture of recombinant human growth factors (referred herein as MasterMix; MM) was prepared with the following components: TGF-\u03b21 200 ng\/ml, b-FGF 0.5 ng\/ml, VEGF 5 ng\/ml and PDGF-AB 300 ng\/ml (the growth factors were purchased from R&D Systems; Cat. Number Cat. Number 240-B-010\/CF, 233-FB-025\/CF, 293-VE-010\/CF and 222-AB-010, respectively). The MM mixture was also serially diluted 5-fold in starvation medium and added into the wells (10 \u03bcl). The proliferation was evaluated 72 hours after treatment initiation by using the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent (cells without any additives were used as background and subtracted from OD values). At the end of the incubation period (4 hours), the plates were shaken for 1 min and the absorbance of the samples was measured as indicated above. The tests were carried out in triplicates. In order to compare the different materials based on a common factor, the obtained results were normalized (see below) to the concentration of PDGF-AB, a growth factor which triggers 3T3 cell proliferation, present in all tested materials. Normalizing to PDGF-AB was carried out by measuring the PDGF-AB concentration [a commercial ELISA kit (Quantikine, R&D Systems, MN, USA; Cat. Number DHD00B] in the reconstituted LYO III and calculating the PDGF-AB concentration in the relative dilutions. The OD results obtained by the WST-1 Cell Proliferation Reagent were plotted against the calculated PDGF-AB concentration values. MasterMix (MM) was used as positive control. Normalization was done to the PDGF-AB concentration as evaluated by specific ELISA.","Results of the proliferative effect of LYO III or pooled WAP III on 3T3-Swiss albino cells are shown in .","The results show that increasing concentrations of LYO III or pooled WAP III affected the proliferation level of 3T3-Swiss albino fibroblast cells with the effect of LYO III being more pronounced while normalized to the amount of PDGF-AB present in the samples. Notably, the effect of both treatments was even more pronounced than the positive control (MM).","A tube-formation assay was carried out to assess the angiogenic effect of LYO III and to explore for a possible synergistic effect of LYO III and fibrin sealant or its components. In order to eliminate any possible effects of the additives on attachment of the cells to the plate surface, the cells were first seeded and only then treated with the different additives.","For this purpose, HUVEC were plated at a concentration of 50\u00d710cells\/ml (5000 cells\/well) in tissue culture treated Costar 96-wells plates in 100 \u03bcl full growth medium (same components as above). 24 h after cell seeding, the full medium was discarded, the wells were washed twice with 100 \u03bcl starvation medium, and 100 \u03bcl starvation medium was added into each well (same components as above).","24 hours after the medium was changed, the assay was initiated by the addition of 10 \u03bcl of either LYO III (reconstituted in 0.5 ml sterile water\u2014concentrated 32-fold relatively to pooled WAP III volume) or a combination of LYO III and fibrin [formed with 1 IU\/ml thrombin (final concentration in well) and 11.3 mg\/ml (total protein) fibrinogen [both thrombin and fibrinogen are components of EVICEL\u2122 fibrin sealant (Omrix Biopharmaceuticals Ltd.) diluted in starvation medium]. Concentrations of TGF-\u03b2, bFGF, VEGF, and PDGF-AB in the wells were as in the proliferation above.","Cells treated with thrombin and\/or fibrinogen in the same concentrations listed above were used as reference. 48 hours after the different treatments, the cells were stained with 5 uM Calcein-AM for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. and representative pictures were taken using Axiovert 200 microscope at 100-fold magnification and fluorescence filter for 530 nm (Zeiss). The results are presented in .","As depicted in the , no tubulogenesis were observed in the control cells (A). Also, it is apparent that thrombin or fibrinogen alone had only marginal ability to induce morphological changes in HUVEC as can be evaluated from the very low number of prolonged cells and vessel-like shapes (B and C, respectively). Treatment with fibrin (thrombin and fibrinogen; E) resulted in re-arrangement of the cells toward tubulogenesis however no pronounced vessel structures were detected. Addition of LYO III (D) to the HUVEC monolayer promoted tubulogenesis which was further augmented by addition of fibrin (F).","In this experiment a lyophilized platelet extract was prepared from a frozen material, before thawing as follows: Ten WAP bags were individually weighed, wiped with 70% ethanol, cut open and the frozen material was placed in a large beaker that was immersed in a water bath adjusted to 25\u00b0 C. The empty bag was weighed and the weight difference between the empty bags and the full bags was used to calculate the net WAP weight (the net WAP weight of each bag was about 200 g). The pooled material was mixed slowly at 25\u00b0 C. until completely thawed using a stainless steel propeller connected to an RW20 overhead stirrer (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co., Staufen, Germany) at 20 RPM. The osmolarity of the pooled WAP was 275 mOs [measured by using The Advanced\u2122 Micro Osmometer Model 3300 (Advanced Instruments Inc, Norwood, Mass., USA)]. 10% acetate-glycine buffer (200 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM glycine; at pH 6.8-7.4) and 1% HSA (v\/v from the final volume solution) were added into the pooled WAP. In order to keep the osmolarity level as constant as possible throughout the process, buffer osmolarity was adjusted to that of the WAP starting material using NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA). In the next step, S\/D treatment was carried out by slowly adding 1% Triton X-100 and 0.3% TnBP (v\/v) into the pooled sample while mixing at 50 RPM. In order to avoid sub-optimal viral inactivation due to the possible presence of particulate matter, the S\/D treatment was split into two parts. First, the sample was continuously stirred for 30 minutes and then filtered through 20, 5 and 1.2 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France). Then, the filtered material was returned to a beaker immersed in a water bath adjusted to 25\u00b0 C. and mixed at 50 RPM for additional 2 hours for continuing the viral inactivation process. S\/D removal was carried out using XK50 liquid chromatography column packed with 295 ml SDR HyperD solvent-detergent removal chromatography resin (Pall Corp) in conjunction with a peristaltic pump and a UA-6 UV\/VIS detector+Type 11 recorder (ISCO, NE, USA). 1800 ml of S\/D-treated platelet extract were loaded onto the column followed by washing with 540 ml acetate glycine buffer (200 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM glycine; at pH 6.8-7.4)+1% HSA v\/v. A total volume of 2700 ml was collected from the column (flow through). It was found that water-insoluble aggregates, which may interfere with later stages of the production, are formed during the manufacturing process. It was also found that the aggregation is intensified in the presence of calcium. Thus, it was decided to use calcium to facilitate the precipitation of aggregates at an early stage, followed by removal of these aggregates by clarification filtration. Accordingly, CaClwas slowly added (to 40 mM final concentration) to the extract following S\/D removal procedure and the extract was incubated for 30 minutes at 25\u00b0 C. while mixing at 50 RPM. The product was then filtered using 20, 5 and 1.2 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France). In the next step, the extract was subjected to stabilization and pasteurization as in Example 4. In order to transfer the obtained viscous solution into a clean vessel, it was diluted with acetate-glycine buffer (at a final concentration of 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine in the viscous solution; at pH 6.8-7.4) and 1% HSA v\/v up to a total weight of 11,320 ml. Removal of the stabilizers was carried out by diafiltration against acetate-glycine buffer (as above) using Centramate PE tangential flow filtration membrane cassette holder+4 Omega Centramate 10 kDa ultrafiltration cassettes (Pall). The diafiltration was carried out as follows: the extract was first concentrated to a volume of 3600 ml and then dialysis was carried out against a total volume of 10,800 ml acetate-glycine buffer (as above) by a gradual addition of the buffer and keeping the solution volume at 3600\u00b1200 ml. The dialyzed solution was then concentrated to a volume of 473 ml, which is approximately 25% of the starting volume.","For stabilization, Mannitol was added into the solution at a final concentration of 2% w\/w. In order to remove aggregated material, the sample was sequentially filtered through 20, 5 and 1.2 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters, and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter. Sterile filtration was carried out under aseptic conditions using a 0.2 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter. The product was then aliquot into 4 ml portions under aseptic conditions and lyophilized as elaborated above. The lyophilized material was sealed in nitrogen atmosphere in partial vacuum (0.6 Bar). The lyophilized platelet extract prepared above is referred herein as \u201cLYO IV\u201d.","The viral purification step of LYO IV included S\/D treatment which included a filtration sub step within the SD treatment. Filtration at this step was carried out through 20, 5, 1.2 and 0.45 \u03bcm filters. In addition, a pasteurization step was carried out, and a final sterile filtration. During the dialysis step the volume of the dialyzed solution was concentrated 4 times as compared to the starting volume.","The effect of LYO IV on cell proliferation was carried out as elaborated in Example 5. 3T3-Swiss albino cells were plated at a concentration of 25\u00d710cells\/ml (2500 cells\/well) in tissue culture treated Costar 96-wells plates in full growth medium (components as elaborated above). 24 h after cell seeding, the full growth medium was replaced with fresh starvation medium (as above). The proliferation was induced 24 hours after the medium was replaced by the addition of pooled WAP IV or reconstituted LYO IV. Reconstitution was carried out as follows: LYO IV, which was lyophilized from a 4 ml solution (concentrated 4-fold comparing to starting pooled WAP), was reconstituted in 0.5 ml sterile purified water-8-times concentrated (32-fold concentrated compared to the starting volume pooled WAP IV). Following reconstitution, reconstituted LYO IV or pooled WAP IV were serially diluted 5-fold in the appropriate starvation medium and 10 \u03bcl of each dilution was added into a well containing 100 \u03bcl starvation medium. The starting concentration of pooled WAP IV was designated as 1 and the serial dilutions were calculated accordingly (relative concentration). The starting concentration of LYO IV was designated as 32 and the serial dilutions were calculated accordingly. Concentrations of several growth factors in both WAP IV and LYO IV were detected by ELISA (same kits as above) and the actual concentrations present in the well (in the highest concentration) during the proliferation assay are as follows: TGF-\u03b2\u2014230 and 2000 ng\/ml; bFGF\u2014100 and 170 pg\/ml; VEGF\u20141.25 and 8.1 ng\/ml; PDGF-AB\u201457 and 27 ng\/ml; and Thrombospondin-1\u201460 and 330 ng\/ml in wells treated with WAP IV and LYO IV, respectively.","MasterMix (MM) prepared as in Example 8 was used as positive control. This mixture was serially diluted 5-fold in starvation medium and 10 \u03bcl was added into the wells. The maximal concentration of MM was designated as 30 (since the concentration of PDGF-AB in MM was 30 ng\/ml) and the serial dilutions were calculated accordingly.","The proliferation of the cells was evaluated 48 hours after beginning of the treatment as elaborated above. After 4 hours incubation with WST-1, the absorbance of the samples was measured as indicated above. The obtained results were normalized to the PDGF-AB (as explained above). All the tests were done in triplicates. The results are presents in .","The results show that LYO IV and pooled WAP IV had a similar effect on 3T3-Swiss albino fibroblasts proliferation level. The obtained effect was even more pronounced than the positive control (MM).","To evaluate the effect of LYO IV on morphological changes of 3T3-Swiss albino cells, phase-contrast microscope images were taken following the treatments (the cells were seeded as in the proliferation assay in Example 10, treated with 10 \u03bcl of reconstituted LYO IV (in 0.5 ml sterile water), pooled WAP IV and maximal concentration of MM (as in Example 8) added to 100 \u03bcl of starvation medium and the images were taken 2 days following the treatment). Concentrations of TGF-\u03b2, bFGF, VEGF, PDGF-AB, and Thrombospondin-1 in the wells were as in the proliferation assay. Representative images are shown in .","Untreated fibroblast cells possess diamond-like shapes (). Addition of LYO IV (B) to 3T3-Swiss albino fibroblasts promoted morphological changes of the cells from diamond-like cells to spindle-like shapes, a characteristic of motile fibroblasts. These observed morphological changes were stronger than the changes observed following treatment with pooled WAP IV (C) and the positive control (MM; D).","As indicated above, the spindle-like shapes of 3T3 fibroblast cells are an attribute of the motility potential. In the following experiment the actual motility of the cells was evaluated following treatment with LYO IV by using the wound-scratch migration assay (Liang et al. In vitro scratch assay: a convenient and inexpensive method for analysis of cell migration in vitro. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2(2):329-33). 3T3-Swiss albino cells were plated at a concentration of 1\u00d710cells\/ml (50,000 cells\/well) in tissue culture treated Costar 24-wells plates (Corning Life Science, MA USA) in 0.5 ml full growth medium (as above). Prior to seeding, the well was coated with one of the following:\n\n","Uncoated wells were used as control. 6 hours after cell seeding, the full growth medium was discarded, the wells were washed twice with 0.5 ml starvation medium and 0.5 ml fresh starvation medium was added into each well (as above). After over-night starvation the cell monolayer was wounded in the middle of the well with a p200 plastic pipette tip, the detached cells were washed out together with the starvation medium and 0.5 ml fresh starvation medium was added. Migration of the cells (i.e. motility) was evaluated following addition of either pooled WAP IV, reconstituted LYO IV (in 2 ml of sterile water), or PRP-R (PRP-releasate) [prepared as follows: 60 ml of single-donor PRP (prepared by and obtained from MDA, Blood Bank, Israel) were activated with 3 ml of 1000 IU\/ml Thrombin (from EVICEL\u2122) and 2 ml of 2M CaCl, and then centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0 C. resulting in 27 ml supernatant which was used for the experiment]. All treatment solutions were diluted 1:10 into the well (50 \u03bcl). Each treatment was carried out in duplicates.","Concentrations of several growth factors in both WAP IV and LYO IV were as follows: TGF-\u03b2\u2014920 and 8000 ng\/ml; bFGF\u2014400 and 680 pg\/ml; VEGF\u20145 and 32.4 ng\/ml; PDGF-AB\u2014228 and 108 ng\/ml; and Thrombospondin-1\u2014240 and 1320 ng\/ml in the wells (respectively for WAP IV and LYO IV).","The wounded width was captured using phase-contrast microscope (\u00d7100 magnification) at three different locations in each well (6 pictures per each treatment) at time point 0 and after 24 hours. In each picture, the wounded width was measured 5 times (15 times per well) and the wound closure (a narrower wound width) was calculated as a percentage of wound left 24 hours after initiation of the treatment in the same location.","Representative phase-contrast pictures of the wounded width in the different treatments at the different time points are shown in . Quantitative evaluation of the wound closure as a percentage left 24 hours after initiation of the treatment in the different treatment groups are shown in . Results are presented as mean of 6 replicates\u00b1S.D.","The results show that on all surfaces (coated or uncoated wells) LYO IV promoted fibroblasts motility and closure of the scratch in the monolayer (the wound is narrower than the control reference treatment) in a similar manner as pooled WAP IV and PRP-R (which has been reported as efficient in wound healing in in-vivo settings Lacci K M, Dardik A, 2010).","Collagen coated wells showed a slightly higher motility promoting effect as compared to the fibrinogen coated wells.","Tube-formation assay was carried out to assess the ability of LYO IV to induce morphological changes of HUVEC. These morphological changes are associated with angiogenesis. For this purpose, HUVEC were plated at a concentration of 1\u00d710cells\/ml (10000 cells\/well) in tissue culture treated Costar 96-wells plates in 100 \u03bcl starvation medium (as above, excluding 2% FCS). In order to simulate extracellular matrix environment, the wells were coated with BME (50 \u03bcl\/well according the manufacturer protocol) prior to cell seeding.","During seeding, 10 \u03bcl of either pooled WAP IV or LYO IV (reconstituted in 2 ml sterile water, concentrated 8-fold relatively to pooled WAP IV volume) were added to the designated wells. The concentration of TGF-\u03b2, bFGF, VEGF, PDGF-AB, and Thrombospondin-1 in the wells were as in the migration assay above. Untreated HUVEC seeded on BME coating were used as reference. After 24 h the cells were stained with 5 uM Calcein-AM for 30 min at 37\u00b0 C. and representative pictures were taken using Axiovert 200 microscope with 60-fold magnification and fluorescence filter for 530 nm (Zeiss). The results are shown in .","As observed in , LYO IV (B) had the strongest tubologenic potency compared to WAP IV (C) or untreated cells (A) (treatment with LYO IV resulted in vessel-like structure formation).","A pool of WAP material was prepared from 10 donors (2000 ml) as elaborated in Example 1. Then, 200 ml acetate-glycine buffer and 1% HSA v\/v were added into the pooled WAP. A sample of 50 ml was removed, treated with S\/D as elaborated below and stored in\u201480\u00b0 C. until assayed. Upon analysis the sample was thawed at room temperature and then filtered (to remove any particulate matter) through 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter (Millex-HV by Millipore; Cat. Number SLHV033RS). Only about 25 ml (out of 50 ml) were filtered before the filter was clogged, therefore a fresh filter was used for the remainder of the sample. Extracts were obtained by freezing and thawing and by carrying out an S\/D treatment.","After thawing, an S\/D removal step was carried out using HR 10\u00d710 liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed with 8 ml of SDR HyperD solvent-detergent removal chromatography resin (Pall Corp.) in conjunction with a peristaltic pump and a UA-6 UV\/VIS detector+Type 11 recorder (ISCO, NE, USA). The flow parameters used during the process were: 1 ml\/min with a maximum pressure limit of 1.0 bar.","The column was prepared with 32 ml of purified water, followed by 24 ml of acetate glycine buffer including 1% HSA v\/v. The column was loaded with 40 ml of the extract sample. After loading the extract sample, the column was washed first with 14 ml of acetate-glycine buffer including 1% HSA v\/v. A second washing step was carried out using 22 ml of acetate-glycine buffer including 10% ethanol\/1M NaCl\/0.2% HSA. The latter washing step was found in our experiments to increase the recovery of some growth factors, e.g. PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB (See Example 12). The column was then washed with 16 ml purified water. The total volume of the collected flow through was 80 ml. To facilitate the precipitation of aggregates at an early stage, precipitation with CaClwas carried out as described in Example 9. Clarification filtration of the extract sample after the CaCltreatment was carried out using 5 \u03bcm capsule filter (mdi Advanced Microdevices), followed by 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filter (Millex-HV by Millipore; Cat. Number SLHV033RS).","To remove smaller aggregates, a pre-filtration step was carried out prior to the nanofiltration step by passing the material through 0.2 and 0.1 \u03bcm filters. In order to filter the entire 80 ml of extract sample, two 0.2 \u03bcm vacuum filters (Nalgene Supor Mach V 50 mm) and four 0.1 \u03bcm syringe filters (Millex VV by Millipore; Cat. Number SLVV033RS) were used. The filtered material was then subjected to a nanofiltration step. The nanofiltration system was assembled in-line as follows: Pressured nitrogen gas tank\u2014pressure regulator\u2014filter housing SEALKLEEN (Pall Corp.) with 2.5 bar pressure gauge (PG1)\u2014valve\u20140.2 \u03bcm filter (Minisart by Sartorius; Cat. Number 16534)\u20140.1 \u03bcm filter (Millipore; Cat. Number VVLP02500)\u20141.0 bar pressure gauge (PG2)\u2014PLANOVA 75N filter (Asahi Kasei; Cat. Number 75NZ-001)\u20141.0 bar pressure gauge (PG3)\u2014PLANOVA 35N filter (Asahi Kasei; Cat. Number 35NZ-001)\u20141.0 bar pressure gauge (PG4)\u2014PLANOVA 20N filter (Asahi Kasei; Cat. Number 20NZ-001).","The nanofiltration procedure was carried out as follows:","Prior to loading the extract sample, the performance of the system was tested by filling the filter housing with 40 ml purified water (PuW), and elevating the pressure by increasing the nitrogen gas flow into the system. Under normal conditions, the solution is expected to flow through the system with only small drops in pressure after passing through each PLANOVA filter. As shown in Table 3 below, 40 ml of PuW were passed through the system without a major drop in the pressure.","After verifying the performance of the system, the filter housing was filled with acetate glycine buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine; at pH 6.8-7.4) containing 1% HSA (the same buffer that is present in the extract sample).

The osmolarity of the pooled WAP was 272 mOs. 211 ml acetate-glycine buffer (to a final concentration of 20 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glycine; at pH 6.8-7.4) and 0.2% v\/v (from the final volume solution) Human serum albumin (HSA, Talecris USA) were added into the pooled WAP. In order to keep the osmolarity level as constant as possible throughout the process, buffer osmolarity was adjusted to that of the WAP starting material using NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA).","S\/D treatment was carried out as described previously by slowly adding 1% Triton X-100 and 0.3% TnBP (v\/v) into the pooled sample while mixing at 50 RPM. In order to avoid sub-optimal viral inactivation due to the possible presence of particulate matter, the S\/D treatment was split into two parts. First, the sample was continuously stirred for 30 minutes and then filtered through 20 and 3 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France). Then, the filtered material was returned to a beaker immersed in a water bath adjusted to 25\u00b0 C. and mixed at 50 RPM for additional 2 hours for continuing the viral inactivation process.","Dextran sulfate is known to bind certain growth factors. Thus, the effect of Dextran sulfate addition on the recovery of platelet factors was examined Dextran sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada; Cat. number D4911) was added to the sample to a final concentration of 1% (w\/w) and incubated at 25\u00b0 C. while stirring at 50 RPM for 20 minutes.

The column was equilibrated with 900 ml of acetate glycine buffer containing 1% dextran sulfate and 0.2% HSA. 1800 ml of S\/D- and dextran sulfate-treated platelet extract (which contained 1620 ml of platelet material) were loaded onto the column followed by an elution step with 600 ml acetate glycine buffer with 12.5% ethanol, 0.5M NaCl, 0.1% dextran sulfate and 0.2% HSA. This was followed by washing with 600 ml of acetate glycine buffer containing 1% dextran sulfate and 0.2% HSA (consider as non isocratic compared to the solution used in the previous step). Next, the column was washed with 300 ml of purified water. A total volume of 3000 ml was collected from the column. The collected material was filtered using 3 and 1.2 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filters and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 (Sartorius Stedim Biotech S.A., Aubagne, France). In the next step, the extract was subjected to stabilization and pasteurization as in Example 4. Removal of the stabilizers was carried out by diafiltration against acetate-glycine buffer (as above). The dialyzed solution was then concentrated to a volume of 480 ml (which is approximately 27% of the starting volume).","For stabilization, Mannitol was added into the solution at a final concentration of 2% w\/w. In order to remove aggregated material, the sample was filtered through 3 \u03bcm Sartopure PP2 filter and 0.45 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter. Sterile filtration was carried out under aseptic conditions using a 0.2 \u03bcm Sartopore 2 filter. The obtained product was then aliquot into 4 ml portions under aseptic conditions and lyophilized as elaborated above. The lyophilized material was sealed in nitrogen atmosphere in partial vacuum (0.6 Bar).","The lyophilized platelet extract prepared above is referred herein as \u201cLYO VII\u201d. The viral purification step of LYO VII included S\/D treatment which included a filtration sub step within the SD treatment. Filtration at this step was carried out through 20, 3, and 0.45 \u03bcm filters. The platelet extract was treated with dextran sulfate prior to SDR removal. The SDR step included several elution steps using non-isocratic solutions in the presence of dextran sulfate. In addition, a pasteurization step was carried out, and a final sterile filtration. During the dialysis step the volume of the dialyzed solution was concentrated about 4 times as compared to the starting volume.","PDGF-AB and bFGF content was measured in the material before loading the sample onto the SDR chromatography resin and after collecting the sample from the SDR resin (following solvent and detergent removal) in the production process of LYO II-LYO IV and in LYO VII.

As a result, the plasma fibrinogen immediately transforms to insoluble fibrin (clot formation) and the clotting time can be measured by a coagulometer (STart4 Coagulation Instrument, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres sur Seine, France). The process of factor activation in the above reference control sample usually takes 4-7 minutes. In a parallel experiment, a sample of platelet extract is added into the human standard plasma and the clotting time is measured as above. The obtained result is divided by the result of the reference control sample. The calculated ratio serves as a measure of the pro-coagulant activity of the tested platelet extract sample. A ratio of lower than 1 means that the tested sample contains activated coagulation factors and thus has a pro-coagulant activity.","The tested platelet extract was reconstituted with 4 ml purified water (PuW) prior to the measurement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0354","num":"0361"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 11"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Pro-coagulant activity of LYO VI-VII."}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Ratio* sample"]},{"entry":[{},"time\/control time"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"140pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"LYO VI","1.2"]},{"entry":[{},"LYO VII","1.3"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"*Average of three measurements."}]}}]}}},"The results presented in Table 11 show that the platelet extract prepared according to the invention does not have a pro-coagulant activity as assessed by the NAPTT assay.","The following experiment was aimed to determine whether LYO VI-VII comprise coagulation factors.
