title: Target ranging using information from two objects
abstract: In an embodiment, an apparatus includes a detector, direction finder, receiver, and range finder. The detector is operable to detect a target, and the direction finder is operable to determine a first direction to the target from the apparatus. The receiver is operable to receive a second direction to the target from a remote object, and the range finder is operable to determine from the first and second directions a range of the target from the apparatus. For example, the apparatus may be a first fighter jet, and the remote object may be a second fighter jet. By using directional information from both the first and second jets, a computer system onboard the first jet may compute a range to the target from the first jet more quickly and more accurately than by using directional information from only the first jet.

For purposes of discussion, the jet azimuth plane is a plane that passes through the jet's fuselage from nose to tail and in which both of the jet's wings lie or to which both of the jet's wings are parallel. An earth azimuth plane is any plane that is parallel to the earth's surface, or, more precisely, any plane that is perpendicular to a radius line of the earth. Therefore, when the jet  is flying at a level altitude, the jet's azimuth plane is either coincident with or parallel to a selected earth azimuth plane depending on the altitude of the selected plane. That is, if the altitude of a selected earth azimuth plane is the same as the level altitude of the jet , then the jet azimuth plane can be said to be coincident with the earth azimuth plane; but if the altitudes of the selected earth azimuth plane and the jet's azimuth plane are different, then these planes are parallel to, but not coincident with, each other. It is sometime convenient to select the earth azimuth plane in which the target T lies as the earth azimuth plane for target-ranging calculations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","14","10"],"sub":["EL ","RANGE "]},"Geometrically speaking, the target T lies in an elevation plane which is perpendicular to the jet azimuth plane  and which includes the straight line  along which His measured. For example, in this embodiment, the elevation plane may be coincident with the page of .","Referring to , the fighter jet  typically includes a targeting system (not shown in ) for detecting the target T, and for determining \u03b8, \u03b8, R, and H, and potentially V. For example, the targeting system may actively detect and range the target by transmitting a signal (e.g., a radar signal) that impinges upon, and is reflected back to the jet  by, the target T, and by receiving the reflected signal with a directional antenna (not shown in ). The targeting system may then determine \u03b8and \u03b8by analyzing the phase of the received signal at each of multiple elements of the antenna. Alternatively, the targeting system may passively detect and range the target T by similarly analyzing a signal emitted by the target to determine \u03b8and \u03b8. Passive detection may be useful when the pilot of the fighter jet  does not want to alert the target T to the jet's presence, or when the target is a \u201cpop-up\u201d target (e.g., a hand-held rocket launcher) that is difficult or impractical to actively detect. Because such target detecting and ranging systems are known, the details of such a system are omitted for brevity.","Referring again to , although the target detecting and ranging system onboard the fighter jet  can determine from \u03b8and \u03b8that the target T lines along a straight-line path , the system cannot determine from these angles alone a value for R, H, or V.","Therefore, the targeting system onboard the jet  needs additional information to determine at least one of R, H, and V. Once the targeting system determines at least one of these values, it can determine the remaining ones of these values via a trigonometric identity such as the law of sines.","For example, a targeting system employing passive detection may obtain this additional information by comparing a signature of a signal emitted from the target T with signal signatures that are stored in a database.","If the signature of the emitted signal matches a signature in the database, then the targeting system may be able to identify the target T, and may be able to retrieve from the database information describing the target and or the emitted signal.","For example, if the database includes a plot of distance vs. signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for the emitted signal, then the targeting system may calculate Rby measuring the SNR of the emitted signal at the fighter jet  and obtaining a value for Rfrom the plot.","But this technique for calculating Rmay require a significant processing time, and thus the system may be relatively slow in providing an accurate value for R. Furthermore, phenomena such as an atmospheric disturbance and multipath may render the measurement of Rtoo inaccurate for some applications regardless of the needed processing time. As an example of when ranging convergence and accuracy may be an issue, there are some targets, e.g., pop-up targets, that the targeting system may be unable to detect until the jet  is practically \u201con top\u201d of the target (e.g., His ten or fewer nautical miles). This inability of the targeting system may be due to the target (e.g., a rocket launcher) not being activated until the jet  is in sight, or the target being hidden by a mountain or other object. At the speed that the fighter jet  may be travelling toward the target T (and the speed at which the target may be travelling toward the jet if the target is airborne), the pilot may have only a few seconds to decide on the best course of action (e.g., engage or evade the target), so the convergence time and the accuracy of the ranging calculation may be an important factor in allowing the pilot sufficient time to make the best decision and to execute the corresponding maneuver.","Alternatively, if the target detecting and ranging system determines that the target T is a type of ground-based target (e.g., a tank or rocket launcher), then, if the target is at sea level, Vis substantially equal to the altitude of the fighter jet \u2014because the altitude is measured by an altimeter (not shown in ) on board the jet, the targeting system has access to the altitude. Once the targeting system has a value for V, the system can calculate Hand Rusing the law of sines.","But depending on the terrain in the vicinity of the target T, the target detecting and ranging system onboard the jet  may be unable to assume that the target is at sea level. For example, if the target T is located in a mountainous region, then the target may be thousands of feet above or below sea level. And even if the targeting system has access to data representing the terrain in the vicinity of the target T, processing this data to determine the height at which the target is located may be relatively time consuming, inaccurate, or both time consuming and inaccurate. And such slow or inaccurate processing may make this ranging technique unsuitable for certain applications as discussed above.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["20","22","24","26","20","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["30","20","22","30","32","34","36","38","40","42"]},"Referring to , an embodiment of a multi-jet technique for detecting and ranging the target T is discussed. Although steps of the technique are presented in a particular order, it is understood that these steps may be performed in any other suitable order. Furthermore, although the jet  is discussed as ranging the target T for both the jets  and , it is understood that the jet  may also range the target T for either of the jets.

Each detector and may detect the target in any suitable manner, such as the manner discussed above in conjunction with .","Next, the target detector onboard the jet  types the target T. For example, the target detector may determine the type of the target T (e.g., hostile fighter jet, missile) based on the signature of a signal emitted by the target. Because techniques for typing a target are known, a discussion of these techniques is omitted for brevity.","The target detector also types the target T independently from the target detector .","Then, the jet  transmits via its transceiver and antenna the target type that its target detector has determined for the target T.","Next, the jet  receives via its antenna and transceiver the target type transmitted by the jet , and the target detector compares the two target types determined by the target detectors and .","If the two target types match, then the target detector determines that both the jets  and  are attempting to range the same target T, and allows the ranging of the target to proceed.","But if, the two target types do not match, then the target detector halts the ranging algorithm until such time as it determines that the jets  and  are attempting to range a same target.","If the target detector determines that both the jets  and  are attempting to range the same target T, then the target direction finders and  onboard the fighter jets determine the following quantities: \u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8, \u03b8, and D.","\u03b8is the azimuth angle between the heading  of the jet  and the target T, and the direction finder may determine this angle by analyzing the phases of a signal received from the target by multiple elements of the first antenna .

The direction finder may determine this angle in a manner similar to the manner it uses to determine \u03b8AZ. Alternatively, the direction finder may receive (via the antenna and transceiver ) from the jet  or from another source (e.g., a satellite or ground-based tracking station) the coordinates of the jet , and, therefore, may calculate \u03b8from the coordinates of the jets  and  using one or more trigonometric functions\u2014it is assumed that the direction finder has access to the coordinates of the jet  in which it is installed.","Similarly, \u03b8is the azimuth angle between the jet  and the heading  of the jet .
