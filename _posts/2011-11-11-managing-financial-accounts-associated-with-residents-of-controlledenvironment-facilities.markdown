title: Managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities
abstract: Systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities are disclosed. In some embodiments, a method may include receiving information corresponding to a pooled account (e.g., a trust account, etc.) held by a financial institution (e.g., a bank), at least in part, for the benefit of residents (e.g., work-release inmates, etc.) of a controlled-environment facility (e.g., a jail, prison, etc.). The method may also include allocating funds within the pooled account to corresponding residents. The method may further include designating a first portion of the funds allocated to a given resident as inaccessible to the resident and designating a second portion of funds allocated to the given resident as accessible to the resident. A magnetic card, near-field communications (NFC) device, or the like may be associated with the accessible portion of a resident's funds and used to complete transactions inside and/or outside of the controlled-environment facility.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This specification relates to systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities.","In the United States, when a person is arrested, detained, or otherwise committed to a correctional facility, that person is typically stripped of his or her personal possessions (e.g., cash, watches, jewelry, clothes, personal electronics, etc.) during an intake process commonly referred to as \u201cbooking.\u201d Cash is deposited into a trust account for the individual while credit cards and other valuables are stored as personal property and returned to the individual upon his or her release from the facility. Family members or friends may be allowed to deposit additional money into the inmate's trust account during his or her incarceration.","While residing within the correctional facility, the inmate may often desire or need to initiate transactions that require monetary payment. For example, commissary purchases, medical payments, telephone calls, and other goods and services may be available to inmates whose trust accounts have sufficient funds to complete transactions. Moreover, as the inventors hereof have recognized, in prison systems that implement work-release programs and allow certain inmates to periodically leave confinement to work outside of the prison, inmates may also have a desire or need to initiate other transactions outside of the correctional facility.","Work-release inmates receive compensation from their employers. In some cases, employers mail checks to the prison administration, which will then cash the checks at a local bank (e.g., once a week) and disburse the money to respective inmates. As the inventors hereof have also recognized, however, attempting to distribute cash to inmates can cause a number of problems. Typically, a significant part of the cash can be lost, stolen, or distributed to the wrong inmate. Once the inmate receives cash, there is no mechanism in place to control, restrict, or monitor how the inmate spends his or her money (e.g., illegal or prescription drugs, etc.), especially with respect to transactions conducted outside of the correctional facility. To address these and other issues, the inventors hereof have developed various systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities.","This specification relates to systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities. In some embodiments, certain techniques described herein may enable and\/or facilitate the management of funds within pooled, escrow, or trust accounts maintained for the benefit of several (or all) residents within one or more controlled-environment facilities. In various implementations, residents may be full- or part-time residents (e.g., work-release inmates, etc.) of a controlled-environment facility (e.g., a prison, jail, etc.). Meanwhile financial accounts may be held by one or more financial institutions (e.g., banks, etc.) that are distinct or independent from the controlled-environment facilities.","In some embodiments, funds may be allocated to each resident of a given facility, and each resident's allocation may be further designated as (or split into) two or more different categories. For example, a first category of funds may be inaccessible to the resident, whereas a second category of funds may be usable by the resident, for example, to purchase goods and services inside and\/or outside of the resident's controlled-environment facility. Each resident may be issued a magnetic card, near-field communication (NFC) device, or the like, and each card or device may be associated an inmates available funds (e.g., the resident's individual funds designated in the second category). As additional amounts are deposited into or debited from the pooled account, each resident's allocation and fund designations may be managed according to rules designed by the relevant authorities.","In an embodiment, a method may include receiving, over a computer network, information corresponding to a pooled account held by a financial institution, at least in part, for the benefit of a plurality of residents of a controlled-environment facility. The method may also include electronically allocating funds within the pooled account to corresponding ones of the plurality of residents. In response to a user's command received via a graphical user interface (GUI), the method may include electronically designating a first portion of the funds allocated to a given resident as inaccessible to the given resident during his or her commitment to the controlled-environment facility and electronically designating a second portion of funds allocated to the given resident as accessible to the given resident while during his or her commitment to the controlled-environment facility.","In various implementations, the pooled account may be an inmate trust account, the financial institution may be a bank, the given resident may be a work-release inmate, and the controlled-environment facility may be a work-release institution.","In some cases, a method may also include electronically adding money to the funds allocated to the given resident, the added money received from the given resident or from the given resident's employer. The method may also include electronically subtracting money from the funds allocated to the given resident, the subtracted money corresponding to at least one of a restitution obligation, child support obligation, fee, or fine. Additionally, a method may include electronically enforcing, for the given resident, an allocation rule configured to establish a maximum amount of funds allowed to be designated as the second portion. The method may further include electronically enforcing, for the given resident, a spending rule configured to control at least one of: a geographical area where funds in the second portion are allowed to be spent, a type of transaction allowed to be conducted using funds in the second portion, or a type of business allowed to receive payment from funds in the second portion. In some cases, a method may include automatically transferring funds from the first portion to the second portion in response to the second portion reaching a minimum amount.","The method may also include causing the second portion of funds to be available for the given resident's use via a physical instrument. In some implementations, the physical instrument may be a magnetic card or a near-field communication (NFC) device.","In another embodiment, a method may include receiving information corresponding to a financial account maintained, at least in part, for the benefit of a plurality of work-release inmates, allocating funds from the financial account to corresponding ones the plurality of work-release inmates, and designating, for each respective of the plurality of work-release inmates, a first portion of the allocated funds as not accessible to the respective work-release inmate and a second portion of the allocated funds as accessible to the respective work-release inmate.","The method may also include causing the system to link each second portion of allocated funds to a corresponding physical instrument, each physical instrument usable to pay for goods or services purchased by a work-release inmate outside of a controlled-environment facility. In various implementations, the physical instruments may be magnetic cards or NFC devices. Each of the physical instruments may include an account number associated with a respective second portion of the allocated funds. Further, the physical instruments may be configured to prohibit cash withdrawal or advance.","In yet another embodiment, a method may include identifying funds allocated to each of a plurality of part-time residents of a controlled-environment facility and designating, for each of the plurality of part-time residents, a first portion of the allocated funds as unusable by the part-time resident for purchases outside of the controlled-environment facility and a second portion of the allocated funds as usable by the part-time resident for purchases outside of the controlled-environment facility. In response to an indication that additional money has been received at the controlled-environment facility from a given part-time resident's employer, the method may include adding the received money to the allocated funds corresponding to the given part-time resident. Additionally or alternatively, in response to an indication that a given part-time resident's restitution obligation, child support obligation, fee, or fine is due, the method may include subtracting or withholding money from the allocated funds corresponding to the given part-time resident.","In certain implementations, the method may include controlling at least one of: a maximum amount of funds allowed to be designated in the second portion, a geographical area where funds in the second portion are allowed to be spent, a type of transaction allowed to be conducted using funds designated in the second portion, or a type of business allowed to receive payment from funds designated in the second portion. Also, in response to an indication that a given part-time resident's commitment to the controlled-environment facility is being terminated, the method may include transferring money from the first portion of allocated funds corresponding to the given part-time resident to the second portion of allocated funds corresponding to the given part-time resident.","In various embodiments, one or more of the techniques described herein may be performed by one or more computer systems. In other various embodiments, a tangible computer-readable storage medium may have program instructions stored thereon that, upon execution by one or more computer systems, cause the one or more computer systems to execute one or more operations disclosed herein. In yet other various embodiments, a system may include at least one processor and a memory coupled to the at least one processor, the memory configured to store program instructions executable by the at least one processor to cause the system to execute one or more operations disclosed herein.","While this specification provides several embodiments and illustrative drawings, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present specification is not limited only to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description are not intended to limit the specification to the particular form disclosed, but, on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the claims. Also, any headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the description. As used herein, the word \u201cmay\u201d is meant to convey a permissive sense (i.e., meaning \u201chaving the potential to\u201d), rather than a mandatory sense (i.e., meaning \u201cmust\u201d). Similarly, the words \u201cinclude,\u201d \u201cincluding,\u201d and \u201cincludes\u201d mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to.\u201d","This specification discloses systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities. Various types of controlled-environment facilities are present in today's society, and persons may be voluntary or involuntary residents of such facilities, whether temporarily or permanently, full-time or part-time. Examples of controlled-environment facilities may include correctional institutions (e.g., municipal jails, county jails, state prisons, federal prisons, military stockades, juvenile facilities, detention camps, home incarceration environments, etc.), healthcare facilities (e.g., hospitals, nursing homes, mental health facilities, rehabilitation facilities, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities, etc.), restricted living quarters (e.g., hotels, resorts, camps, dormitories, barracks, etc.), and the like. Full-time residents typically spend all their time within a given facility for the entire duration of their commitment. Conversely, part-time residents of these facilities may include persons that are allowed to spend some amount of time outside of his or her facility despite being otherwise committed to that facility (e.g., a work-release inmate, etc.).","Controlled-environment facilities, such as the ones described above, may sometimes be thought of as a small community or city, perhaps walled or otherwise access restricted, wherein various activities occur within the community and between the community and those outside the community in the daily operation thereof. Such a community includes a number of individuals and enterprises directly associated therewith, including management, staff, and inmates, residents, patients, or guests, and a number of individuals and enterprises indirectly associated therewith, including friends and family of residents, vendors, government agencies, providers of services to residents, and individuals with a connection to the facility or its residents. Information is often exchanged and transactions are often conducted by, between, among, and on behalf of the aforementioned individuals and enterprises in performing their day-to-day activities.","For convenience of explanation, various examples discussed herein are presented in the context of correctional facilities. For instance, in some of the embodiments discussed below, a controlled-environment facility may be referred to as a jail or prison, and its residents may be referred to as arrestees, detainees, or inmates. It should be understood, however, that the systems and methods described herein may be similarly applicable to other types of controlled-environment facilities and their respective residents (e.g., a hospital and its patients, a school dormitory and its students, etc.).","Turning now to , a block diagram of an illustrative environment where various techniques described herein may be implemented is depicted according to some embodiments. As shown, prison  may host a plurality of inmates. In a typical scenario, immediately upon arrival at prison , each inmate may be subject to an \u201cintake\u201d or \u201cbooking\u201d process, whereby certain information may be collected by prison staff via enrollment access terminal . For example, the inmate's name, gender, address, date of birth, etc. may be received by terminal  and stored in a prison management system (not shown). According to some embodiments, in addition to identification information, terminal  may also be configured to receive biometric samples (e.g., fingerprints, voice prints, iris scans, etc.) and store one or more such samples as biometric signatures that may later be used, for example, to validate the identities of inmates in the course of a transaction or purchase.","Terminal  may be further configured to allow prison staff to indicate how much cash the inmate has at hand at the time of booking, and this information may be provided to account management system  via the controlled-environment facility's communication system  for further processing. Once accounted for, the inmate's cash may be physically transported to local bank  to be deposited into a pooled, escrow, or trust account  held by bank  for the benefit of the facility's inmates. These and other operations involved in the management of the facility's trust account(s) are discussed in more detail below.","In some embodiments, prison  may allow an inmate to make or receive phone calls using device  via communication system . To that end, communication system  may include one or more analog switches, IP gateways, PBX systems, etc. that provide communication systems to prison . For example, an inmate within prison  may use device  to make a telephone call to (or to receive a telephone call from) a non-resident of prison  operating device  through public switched telephone network (PSTN) .","Although illustrated as telephones in , devices  and  may include any communication device such as, for example, an analog telephone, a Voice over IP (VoIP) phone, a video visitation system, an Internet terminal, etc. For example, in some embodiments, non-resident device  may be operable to communicate with device  through network . Network  may include, for example, the Internet. Additionally or alternatively, network  may include wireless cellular networks or the like.","In some implementations, communication system  may also include an interactive voice response (IVR) system. The IVR system may be configured to allow a non-resident to authorize a transfer of funds from his or her personal account (e.g., a checking account, etc.) to the facility's trust account  for the benefit of a specified inmate.","During their commitment to prison , inmates may be allowed to purchase commissary items from commissary agent  (e.g., a person, an automated vending machine, etc.). To conduct these types of transactions, in various implementations, commissary agent  may communicate with account management system  through communication system  to determine whether the inmate has sufficient funds in trust account  held by bank system . If the inmate has sufficient funds to allow a particular transaction, the inmate may be allowed to purchase the commissary item. Otherwise, commissary agent  may inform the inmate that there are insufficient funds and may not allow the transaction. In some situations, at least some of the inmates may be work-release inmates or other part-time residents of facility . Generally speaking, work-release inmates are allowed to leave facility  at predetermined times or days to work outside of facility . Accordingly, in some cases, work-release inmates may also be able to purchase certain items, for example, through point-of-sale (POS) system  located outside of facility .","In operation, account management system  may be configured to interface with other systems within bank system  to enable the implementations of various techniques described herein. As noted above, bank system  may maintain a trust account in database  for several (or all) inmates within facility . Meanwhile, account management system  may be configured to logically allocate funds from trust account  to individual inmates. These allocations may be stored, for example, in allocated accounts database . Account management system  may also be configured to sub-allocate funds belonging to a given inmate into two or more portions. In some cases, each such portion may be designated for a different type of use, may be subject to different restrictions or limitations, etc. For example, in some embodiments, certain portions of an inmate's individual account may be linked to a physical instrument (e.g., a magnetic card, near-fieldd communication (NFC) device, etc.), and therefore may be usable by the inmate to effect monetary transactions or purchases. Other portions of an inmate's individual account may not be so linked, and may be generally inaccessible to the inmate. The physical instrument may be provided or otherwise authorized by bank  and\/or account management system .","Generally speaking, databases  and\/or  may include any suitable type of application or data structure that may be configured as a data repository. For example, databases  and\/or  may be configured as relational databases that include one or more tables of columns and rows and that may be searched or queried according to a query language, such as a version of Structured Query Language (SQL). Alternatively, databases  and\/or  may be configured as structured data stores that include data records formatted according to a markup language, such as a version of eXtensible Markup Language (XML). In other embodiments, databases  and\/or  may be implemented using arbitrarily or minimally structured data files managed and accessible through any suitable type of application.","As illustrated in , account management system  may be located inside of prison . In other embodiments, however, system  and\/or components thereof may be disposed outside prison . For example, in some cases, account management system  may be at least partially co-located with bank system , and their respective databases  and  may be at least partially merged. Furthermore,  shows a single prison  served by a single account management system  for ease of explanation only. In other embodiments, two or more prisons may be served by the same account management system  and\/or two or more of each such system may serve the same prison. Also, it should be noted that account management system  and\/or bank system  may be distributed across different geographical areas.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 3-7"],"b":["130","200","205","210","115","220","200"]},"Communication interface  may enable the account management software to exchange information with other systems (e.g., bank system ) via network . In some embodiments, communication interface  may be configured to transmit and\/or receive information using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. Additionally or alternatively, other connections may also be used, such as, for example, XML file transmission utilizing file transfer protocol (FTP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) POST transactions, or other data transmission protocols. Communication interface  may further include any of a variety of standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) configured to allow different software programs to communicate (e.g., to request services and respond to such requests) in an autonomous, web-based, and\/or platform-independent manner. For example, banking system  may choose to expose certain data (e.g., account number, balances, recent transactions, etc.) and\/or certain operations (e.g., deposits, withdraws, transfers, payments, etc.) via a web services interface. Communication interface  may then access those exposed data and\/or functions via the appropriate API(s).","Database management module  may include any suitable database management system (DBMS) or application configured to manage the creation, maintenance, and use of database  of . Allocation rules module  may include one or more sets of rules for each individual inmate (or groups of inmates), in any suitable format, that allow an administrator within facility  to manage the allocation and distribution of trust account funds. GUI module  may be configured to provide, for example, a web-based user interface (WUI) that implements JAVA\u2122, AJAX, ADOBE\u00ae FLEX\u00ae, MICROSOFT\u00ae .NET, or similar technologies to provide real-time user control. In other cases, GUI module  may be a command line interface or another suitable interface using non-web based technologies.","In various embodiments, the modules shown in  may represent sets of software routines, logic functions, and\/or data structures that are configured to perform specified operations. Although these modules are shown as distinct logical blocks, in other embodiments at least some of the functionality provided by these modules may be combined into fewer blocks. Conversely, any given one of modules - may be implemented such that its functionality is divided among two or more logical blocks. Moreover, although shown with a particular configuration, in other embodiments these various modules may be rearranged in other suitable ways.","Turning now to , a diagram illustrating certain account management techniques is depicted according to some embodiments. These techniques may be performed, at least in part, by account management system  and\/or banking system  shown in . Particularly, trust account  may include or otherwise represent a pooled or escrow account maintained for the benefit of inmates within controlled environment facility . Funds within trust account  may be allocated to individual inmates A-N in the form of individual accounts A-N\u2014i.e., one account for each respective inmate. Each individual account may then be further split into different portions, each portion having its own distinct designation. For example, funds in inmate A's individual account A may be divided into first portion A- and second portion A-. Similarly, funds in inmate B's account B may be split into first portion B- and second portion B-. In some cases, more that two sub-portions may be used. For instance, funds in inmate N's individual account N may be split into N portions C-N.","In various implementations, each portion may receive a designation selected by facility . For example, as illustrated, portions A-, B-, and C- are designated as being inaccessible to their respective inmates, whereas portions A-, B-, and C--N are designated as accessible to their respective inmates. As such, portion A- may be associated with magnetic card or NFC device A (i.e., for use by inmate A), portion B- may be associated with magnetic card or NFC device B (i.e., for use by inmate B), and portions C--N may be associated with magnetic cards or NFC devices NA-NN (i.e., for use by inmate N).","It should be noted that, whereas trust account  may be an actual financial account (e.g., a checking account, etc.), individual inmate accounts A-N may represent logical, fiscal or accounting subdivisions of trust account  that may be maintained by software. Also, portions A-, -A-, etc. may represent further logical, fiscal or accounting subdivisions of the each respective individual inmate account A-N, also maintained by software. These various allocations may be created, for example, by account allocation engine  of the account management software depicted in .","Generally speaking, the account management techniques described in  may be implemented in various ways. For example, in implementation mode , banking system  may be responsible for managing trust account  and account management system  within facility  may be responsible for managing allocated accounts and designated portions of those allocated accounts. In implementation mode , banking system  may be responsible for managing trust account  as well as the first level of logical abstraction involved in the management of allocated accounts A-N, whereas account management system  within facility  may be responsible for managing only the designated portions of allocated accounts (i.e., a second level of abstraction). In implementation mode , either banking system  and\/or account management system  may be responsible for managing trust account , allocated accounts A-N, and their designated portions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["220","400","400","400","105","130"]},"In the example shown in , first area  within window  indicates the total balance present in trust account , a total amount of funds that are linked to inmate cards and therefore available to them, and a total amount of funds that are not linked to inmate cards and thus inaccessible. First area  may also include a link to \u201cGlobal Allocation Rules\u201d (i.e., rules that affect all inmates), and other application functionality including, for example, search features, etc.","Second area  of window  includes a list of inmates within facility . The list may be presented or ordered, for example, by inmate's name, identification number, or the like. Each line item containing an inmate's entry may include certain summary information such as, for example, the inmate's current balance (e.g., for inmate A, the amount of funds present in individual inmate account A), as well as funds in the various logical account sub-portions (e.g., for inmate A, funds linked to a physical instrument in portion A- and inaccessible funds in portion A-). A user may reorder the list of inmates based on these various summary items, for instance, by allowing a user to select those items using a pointing device or the like.","Once a user selects a particular inmate, third area  of window  may be displayed with detailed information about that inmate. Examples of detailed information may include, for example, biographic information (e.g., inmate's name, date of birth, employer, salary, etc.), allocated funds  (e.g., total allocation in individual inmate account, as well as linked and non-linked portions), recent transactions , and allocation rules  applicable to that inmate. In this manner, the GUI of  may allow a user to manage allocations and distribution of fund among various inmate's accounts, as well as rules applicable to those allocations and to the inmate's use of funds. As a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize in light of this disclosure, however, the GUI shown in  is merely illustrative, and other variations may be implemented.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","500","145","150","505","135"]},"At blocks  and , the method may include designating, for each individual account, a first portion and a second portion, respectively. For example, for inmate A, blocks  and  may include logically dividing account A into portion A- and A-. At block , the method may include linking, for each individual account, the second portion of the account (e.g., for inmate A, portion A-) to a magnetic card, NFC device, or the like. In some cases, account allocation engine  may transmit a request to bank  to issue a magnetic check card or the like for the inmate. The check card may be linked only to the sub-portion of the respective inmate's individual account that is accessible to that inmate (e.g., A-), such that the inmate may not use the card to access other funds (e.g., in portion A-), despite these other funds otherwise belong to him or her. In some cases, the magnetic card may be configured such that it also does not allow the inmate to withdraw cash, for example, from an ATM machine.","In other cases, instead of issuing a magnetic card, bank  may cause a security code to be transmitted to an NFC-capable device, such as, for example, an inmate's smart phone or the like. Again, the code may be configured to allow the inmate to access only funds designated in a particular portion of his or her individual account.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","600","605","610"]},"At block , the method may determine whether certain rules are satisfied. For example, allocation rules module  may include regulations such as, for instance, a maximum amount of funds that the inmate is allowed to have in the second designated portion of his or her individual account (e.g., for inmate A, portion A-). In some cases, a controlled-environment facility may set a maximum and\/or minimum amount of money that may be transferred to an inmate's second designated portion in a single transfer transaction and\/or over a period of time. Additionally or alternatively, the controlled-environment facility may set a maximum number of transfers between the first and second designated portions over a period of time. If the rules are satisfied, the remainder of the received money may be deposited in the inmate's second designated portion and thus be linked to the inmate's magnetic card or NFC device at block . Otherwise, at block , the remainder of the received money may be deposited in the inmate's first designated portion (e.g., for inmate A, portion A-), and thus be inaccessible to the inmate via his or her magnetic card or NFC device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 7","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","700","155","160","145","705"]},"At block , the method may determine whether the amount of the pending transaction exceeds the balance available to the inmate (e.g., for inmate A, the amount in second portion A-). If the balance available to the inmate in the second designated portion is sufficient to conduct the transaction, control passes to block . At block , the method may determine whether the transaction is allowed for the particular inmate based on one or more transaction rules. If so, the transaction may be approved at block  and the appropriate amount may be deducted from the inmate's account. If at block  it is determined that the balance available to the inmate in his second designated account is not sufficient to complete the transaction, or if in block  it is determined that the rules are not satisfied, the transaction may be declined in block . In these cases, an alert may be transmitted to the appropriate authorities and\/or sanctions may be imposed upon the offending inmate.","As noted above, the method of  may determine whether a pending transaction complies with transactions rules established for the requesting inmate. Examples of transaction rules include, but are not limited to, a geographical area where funds in the second portion are allowed or not allowed to be spent (e.g., based on the location of the point-of-sale where the transaction is initiated, GPS coordinates provided by the NFC device, etc.), a type of transaction allowed or not allowed to be conducted using funds in the second portion (e.g., purchases of lottery tickets, cash withdrawals, etc. may not be allowed), or a type of business that is allowed or not allowed to receive payment from funds in the second portion (e.g., stores that sell pornographic material, alcohol, etc. may not be eligible to receive payment). These various transactions rules may be stored, for example, within module  of . In some cases, certain allocation and\/or transactions rules may be applicable to individual inmates. Additionally or alternatively, other such allocation and\/or transactions rules may be applicable to groups of inmates (e.g., work-release inmates). Also, module  may allow a user (e.g., prison staff, relevant authorities, etc.) to modify allocation and\/or transactions rules on a global basis (i.e., affecting all inmates) or on an individual or group basis.","As mentioned above, the method may include determining a physical, geographical area where inmates are allowed to spend money. For example, each inmate (or group of inmates) may only be allowed to spend money (e.g., by using the magnetic card linked to the second designated portion or his or her account) in a given geographical area outside of the prison. Such a geographical area may be defined, for example, by latitude and longitude, zip code(s), or in some other suitable manner. In other words, in some cases, a system implementing the method of  may create a \u201cgeofence\u201d or the like. As such, if the inmate attempts to use the magnetic card or NFC device outside of the allowed area (i.e., outside the geofence), the transaction may be blocked and\/or authorities may be notified of the infraction. In other embodiments, geofencing may be used to define or limit certain types of purchases to specific areas. For example, a mall or shopping center may be defined as a geographic area in which the inmate is allowed to purchase food, clothing, and electronics, but the inmate may be limited to purchasing only food outside the defined geographic area.","Additionally or alternatively, a webfencing technique may also serve to enforce limitations on an inmate's ability to spend money over the Internet. For example, in some cases, the magnetic card or NFC device may be used to conduct certain online transactions (e.g., over the Internet) in a controlled manner. For example, an inmate may be allowed to purchase calling minutes or time, commissary items, etc. via one or more websites that are pre-approved by the prison administration. In these situations, if an inmate attempts to purchase items via a non-approved retail website, a website that sells pornographic materials, etc., a system implementing the method of  may also block the transaction and\/or notify the authorities. Although discussed in terms of an Internet transaction, similar rules may be applied in the context of phone-based transactions.","In some embodiments, the method of  may determine whether a resident is still incarcerated within a controlled-environment facility or still participating in a work-release or similar program prior to authorizing a given transaction. For example, if an inmate has escaped from prison (e.g., a work-release inmate has not reported back to prison at the specified time or day of the week), the otherwise accessible portion of his or her account (e.g., the second designated portion) may be frozen and\/or subsequent transactions may be declined.","Embodiments of systems and methods for managing financial accounts associated with residents of controlled-environment facilities, as described herein, may be implemented or executed by one or more computer systems. One such computer system is illustrated in . In various embodiments, computer system  may be a server, a mainframe computer system, a workstation, a network computer, a desktop computer, a laptop, or the like. For example, in some cases, account management system  shown in  may be implemented as computer system .
