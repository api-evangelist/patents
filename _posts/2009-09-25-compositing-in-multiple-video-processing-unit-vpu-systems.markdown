title: Compositing in multiple video processing unit (VPU) systems
abstract: Systems and methods are provided for processing data. The systems and methods include multiple processors that each couple to receive commands and data, where the commands and/or data correspond to frames of video that include multiple pixels. Additionally, an interlink module is coupled to receive processed data corresponding to the frames from each of the multiple processors. The interlink module selects pixels of the frames from the processed data of one of the processors based on a predetermined pixel characteristic and outputs the frames that include the selected pixels.

No. 11\/140,165, filed May 27, 2005, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","The invention is in the field of graphics and video processing.","Graphics and video processing hardware and software continue to become more capable, as well as more accessible, each year. Graphics and video processing circuitry is typically present on an add-on card in a computer system, but is also found on the motherboard itself. The graphics processor is responsible for creating the picture displayed by the monitor. In early text-based personal computers (PCs) this was a relatively simple task. However, the complexity of modern graphics-capable operating systems has dramatically increased the amount of information to be displayed. In fact, it is now impractical for the graphics processing to be handled by the main processor, or central processing unit (CPU) of a system. As a result, the display activity has typically been handed off to increasingly intelligent graphics cards which include specialized coprocessors referred to as graphics processing units (GPUs) or video processing units (VPUs).","In theory, very high quality complex video can be produced by computer systems with known methods. However, as in most computer systems, quality, speed and complexity are limited by cost. For example, cost increases when memory requirements and computational complexity increase. Some systems are created with much higher than normal cost limits, such as display systems for military flight simulators. These systems are often entire one-of-a-kind computer systems produced in very low numbers. However, producing high quality, complex video at acceptable speeds can quickly become prohibitively expensive for even \u201chigh-end\u201d consumer-level systems. It is therefore an ongoing challenge to create VPUs and VPU systems that are affordable for mass production, but have ever-improved overall quality and capability.","Another challenge is to create VPUs and VPU systems that can deliver affordable, higher quality video, do not require excessive memory, operate at expected speeds, and are seamlessly compatible with existing computer systems.","All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.","An improved system and method for video processing is described herein. Embodiments include a video processing system with at least one graphics processing unit (GPU) or video processing unit (VPU). As used herein, GPU and VPU are interchangeable terms. In various embodiments, rendering tasks are shared among the VPUs in parallel to provide improved performance and capability with minimal increased cost. Respective VPUs in the system cooperate to produce a frame to be displayed. In various embodiments, data output by different VPUs in the system is combined, or merged, or composited to produce a frame to be displayed. In one embodiment, the system is programmable such that various modes of operation are selectable, including various compositing modes, and various modes of task sharing or load balancing between multiple VPUs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","102","104","102"]},"The API  can be any one of the available APIs for running video applications. The API  communicates with a driver . The driver  is typically written by the manufacturer of the video hardware, and translates the standard code received from the API into a native format understood by the hardware. The driver allows input from, for example, an application, process, or user to direct settings. Such settings include settings for selecting modes of operation, including modes of operation for each of multiple VPUs, and modes of compositing frame data from each of multiple VPUs, as described herein. For example, a user can select settings via a user interface (UI), including a UI supplied to the user with video processing hardware and software as described herein.","In one embodiment, the video hardware includes two video processing units, VPU A  and VPU B . In other embodiments there can be less than two or more than two VPUs. In various embodiments, VPU A  and VPU B  are identical. In various other embodiments, VPU A  and VPU B  are not identical. The various embodiments, which include different configurations of a video processing system, will be described in greater detail below.","The driver  issues commands to VPU A  and VPU B . The commands issued to VPU A  and VPU B  at the same time are for processing the same frame to be displayed. VPU A  and VPU B  each execute a series of commands for processing the frame. The driver  programmably instructs VPU A  and VPU B  to render frame data according to a variety of modes. For example, the driver  programmably instructs VPU A  and VPU B  to render a particular portion of the frame data. Alternatively, the driver  programmably instructs each of VPU A  and VPU B  to render the same portion of the frame data.","When either of VPU A  and VPU B  finishes executing the commands for the frame, the frame data is sent to a compositor . The compositor  is optionally included in an interlink module , as described more fully below. VPU A  and VPU B  cooperate to produce a frame to be displayed. In various embodiments, the frame data from each of VPU A  and VPU B  is combined, or merged, or composited in the compositor  to generate a frame to be rendered to a display .

The invention is not limited to two VPUs. Aspects of the invention as described herein would be workable with one VPU with modifications available to one of ordinary skill in the art. However, in most instances the system would be less efficient with one VPU than with more than one VPU. Various embodiments also include more than two VPUs. Systems with more than two are workable with modifications available to one of ordinary skill in the art, and in most instances would provide better efficiency than a system with two VPUs.

In other embodiments, there may be a direct dedicated communication mechanism between VPU A  and VPU B .","VPU A  and VPU B  each have a local video memory  and , respectively, available. In various embodiments, one of the VPUs functions as a master VPU and the other VPU functions as a slave VPU, but the invention is not so limited. In other embodiments, the multiple VPUs could be peers under central control of another component. In one embodiment, VPU A  acts as a master VPU and VPU B  acts as a slave VPU.","In one such embodiment, various coordinating and combining functions are performed by an interlink module (IM)  that is resident on a same card as VPU A . This is shown as IM  enclosed with a solid line. In such an embodiment, VPU A  and VPU B  communicate with each other via the bus  for transferring inter-VPU communications (e.g., command and control) and data. For example, when VPU B  transfers an output frame to IM  on VPU A  for compositing (as shown in  for example), the frame is transferred via the bus .","In various other embodiments, the IM  is not resident on a VPU card, but is an independent component with which both VPU A  and VPU B  communicate.

The two input pixel streams from the respective VPUs are either processed through the MUX  (in pass-through mode, or \u201cstandard\u201d interlink modes), or through the mixer  in extended modes. In one embodiment, the extended modes include a super antialiasing mode, or \u201cSuperAA mode\u201d, as described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/140,156, titled \u201cAntialiasing System and Method\u201d, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.","In the MUX , just one pixel from either VPU A or VPU B is selected to pass through, and no processing of pixels is involved. In the extended modes mixer , processing is done on a pixel by pixel basis. In the SuperAA mode, for example, the pixels are processed, averaged together, and reprocessed. In one embodiment, the processing steps involve using one or more lookup tables to generate intermediate or final results.","The selection between the MUX  path and the mixer  path is determined by I2C register bits and control bits. For example, the mixer  path is selected if:\n\n","(else MUX).","In one embodiment, the IM has three ports, two input ports and one output port.","The output port configuration is split into two parts. The DAC is driven across a 24 bit single data rate (SDR) interface. The TMDS is driven with a double data rate (DDR) interface; a 12 pin interface for TMDS single link, and a 24 pin interface for TMDS dual link. The I2C control bit registers determines this configuration.","There are three primary pixel clock domains. Both the master and slave inputs come in on their own separate domains. The IM uses the DVO clock domain for all internal paths and the final output. The DVO clock is generated by the active input port in pass-through mode and from the master input clock in interlink mode.","The master input bus (data and control) goes through a synchronizer as it passes into the DVO clock domain, imparting a 2-4 clock delay. The slave input bus (data and control) goes into a FIFO which is synchronized on its output to the DVO clock domain. The outputs of both paths are routed to a MUX or extended modes mixer which then outputs a single bus width data output.","In slave pass-through mode the slave FIFO is set into pass-through mode, while in interlink mode, it is used as a standard FIFO. For slave pass-through mode, the control bits go through the FIFO with the pixel data. In interlink mode, sAFR_MAS goes through with the data, and the control bits are ignored from the slave input port.","I\/Os that use DDR clocking are split into double wide buses (e.g., 12-bit DDR input becomes 24 bits internally). This is to avoid having to run the full clock speed through the IM.","In one embodiment, there is one FIFO on the IM, located on the slave channel. Twenty-four (24) bits of pixel data flow through the FIFO in single TMDS mode, and 48 bits of data flow through the FIFO in dual TMDS mode. The slave port's control bits are also carried through this FIFO when in pass-through mode, slave path. When in interlink mode, the control bits are ignored, and instead of the control bits the sAFR_MAS bit is carried through in parallel with the pixel data.","When in single link TMDS mode (CONTROL_BITS: Dual_Link_Mode bit=0), the extra 24 bits of data for dual link are not clocked to conserve power.","On power up the FIFOs should be set to empty. FIFOs are also cleared when the ENABLE_INTERLINK bit toggles to 1 or if the CONTROL_ONESHOTS: FIFO_Clear bit is set to 1.","The slave FIFO has two watermarks (registers FIFO_FILL, FIFO_STOP). The IM drives the SlavePixelHold pin depending on how full the FIFO is and the values in these registers. If the slave FIFO has FIFO_FILL or fewer entries in use, the SlavePixelHold should go low. If the slave FIFO has FIFO_STOP or more entries in use, the SlavePixelHold should go high.","\u201cLoad balancing\u201d refers to how work is divided by a driver for processing by multiple system VPUs. In various embodiments, the processed data output by each VPU is composited according to one of multiple compositing modes of the IM , also referred to herein as \u201cinterlinking modes\u201d and \u201ccompositing modes\u201d. The IM  supports numerous methods for load balancing between numerous VPUs, including super-tiling, scissoring and alternate frame rendering (\u201cAFR\u201d), all of which are components of \u201cBlacking\u201d. These modes are described below.  is a diagram illustrating various load balancing modes performed by the system as described. Frame data from various VPUs in the system is processed according to a load balancing mode and composited in a compositor , as described herein, to generate a displayable frame. Alternative embodiments of the IM may use any of the compositing modes in any combination across any number of VPUs.","For Super-Tiling, software driver control determines the tile size and alternates between image data and black tiles so that, between the master and slave VPUs, each frame is fully painted. The IM  passes through the non-black pixels (image data) creating a super tiling-type split between the master and slave inputs. The tile sizes can be dynamically adjusted every pair of master and slave frames if desired. Super-Tiling may divide a display screen into a chess board pattern for which each square\/tile is 32\u00d732, pixels for example. The image tiles are rendered on a first VPU of a multi-VPU system while the black tiles are rendered on a second VPU. Super-Tiling provides fine grain load sharing for pixel processing within a frame of rendering, a more even distribution of pixel load relative to other load balancing methods, and less complex driver implementation.","Scissoring divides a display screen into two parts, and this division can be horizontal or vertical. While a horizontal split may be more convenient when considering software implementation and data transfer flexibility, a vertical split may provide better load balancing. In the context of multiple VPUs, scissoring provides optimization opportunities in the direction of parallelizing data transfers with 3D rendering. Scissoring also supports methods in which the slave VPU (which performs the majority of data transfers) does less work than the master VPU, thereby facilitating dynamic load balancing schemes between the master and the slave VPUs.","Scissoring includes both Vertical Split Screen Blacking Control and Horizontal Split Screen Blacking Control. With Vertical Split Screen Blacking Control, the drivers determine which side of a frame are output from the master and slave VPU, so that between the two VPUs every frame is completely painted. The part of a frame that each VPU does not handle is cleared to black by the drivers. The IM  then interlinks the two frames as a vertical split between the master and slave VPU. The split does not have to be an even split of the screen (e.g., 50% rendered by each VPU) and can be dynamically adjusted for every pair of master and slave frames.","Under Horizontal Split Screen Blacking Control, the software drivers determine which upper or lower section of a frame are output from the master and slave VPU. The drivers then clear to black the portions that will not hold valid frame buffer data and the IM  mixes the inputs as a horizontal split of the inputs. The split does not have to be an even split of the screen (e.g., 50% rendered by each VPU) and can be dynamically adjusted for every pair of master and slave frames.","Alternate Frame Rendering (\u201cAFR\u201d) performs load balancing at a frame level. A \u201cframe\u201d as referred to herein includes a sequence of rendering commands issued by the application before issuing a display buffer swap\/flip command. AFR generally passes each new frame through to the output from alternating inputs of the IM . One VPU renders the even-numbered frames and the other VPU renders the odd-numbered frames, but the embodiment is not so limited. The AFR allows performance scaling for the entire 3D pipeline, and avoids render-to-texture card-to-card data transfers for many cases.","The IM  of an embodiment may perform AFR under Manual Control, Manual Control with automatic VSync switching, or Blacking Control. When using Manual Control, the drivers manually select an input of the IM  for a frame after the next VSync. Using AFR using Manual Control with VSync switching, and following a next vertical blank, the IM  chooses the input coupled to the master VPU as the output source and then automatically toggles between the master and slave VPU inputs on every VSync. Using Blacking Control, the drivers alternate sending a fully painted frame versus a cleared-to-black frame from the master and slave VPUs; the IM  toggles between the master and slave frames as a result.","As described above with reference to , the IM merges streams from multiple VPUs to drive a display. The merging of streams uses Manual AFR compositing and Blacking compositing () but is not so limited. Both Manual AFR and Blacking compositing support AFR, which includes switching the IM output alternately between two VPU inputs on a frame-by-frame basis. The Blacking with both horizontal screen split and vertical screen split includes a variable split offset controlled by the IM. The Blacking with Super-Tiling includes a variable tile size controlled by the IM.","The control logic including the black register  and MUX path logic and black comparator  determines the compositing mode of the IM  by controlling the MUX  to output a frame, line, and\/or pixel from a particular VPU. For example, when the TMDS control bits  select AFR Manual compositing as described herein, the IM  alternately selects each VPU to display alternating frames. As such, system drivers (not shown) determine the VPU source driven to the output. By setting the xAFR_MAS control bit  high, the MUX  of an embodiment couples the master input port (master VPU output) to the IM output on the next frame to be displayed. In contrast, by setting the xAFR_MAS control bit  low, the MUX  couples the slave input port (slave VPU output) to the output on the next frame to be displayed.","The AFR_AUTO bit of the TMDS control bits  enables automatic toggling that causes the IM output to automatically switch or toggle between the master and the slave inputs on every VSync signal. When the AFR_AUTO bit is asserted the IM begins rendering by coupling to the IM output the input port selected by the xAFR_MAS bit. The IM automatically toggles its output between the master and slave inputs on every VSync signal, thereby ignoring the xAFR_MAS bit until the AFR_AUTO bit is de-asserted. The IM thus automatically controls the display of subsequent frames (or lines) alternately from each VPU.","The AFR Manual mode may also control a single VPU to drive the IM output by setting the AFR_MAN_ON* bit to an asserted state. In contrast to coupling the IM output alternately between two VPUs for each frame, AFR_MAN_ON* bit sets the IM output path according to the state of the xAFR_MAS bit and does not toggle the output between multiple VPUs for subsequent frames or pixels.","The IM of an embodiment supports more advanced merging of streams from multiple VPUs using Blacking compositing. The MUX path logic and black comparator , when operating under Blacking, controls the MUX  so as to provide the IM output from one of multiple VPUs on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The decision on which pixels are to be displayed from each of a number of VPUs generally is a compare operation that determines which VPU is outputting black pixels. This is a fairly efficient and flexible method of intermixing that allows the drivers to \u201ctune\u201d the divisions, and the blacking can be done by clearing memory to black once per mode set-up and then leaving it until the mode is changed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0100","num":"0101"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["1102","1104","1106","1108"]},"The drivers (e.g., referring to , driver  of video processing system ) corresponding to the IM select Blacking compositing by deactivating the AFR Manual mode at the IM. Deactivation of the Blacking mode is controlled by asserting the AFR_MAN_ON* bit of the TMDS control bits . The drivers also set up the frame buffers by setting any pixel of a VPU to black when another one of multiple VPUs is to display that pixel. This is similar in effect to a black chroma key affect but the embodiment is not so limited. If the pixels of all VPUs coupled to the IM are black the IM couples the pixel output from the master VPU to the IM output.","The IM uses the pixel clock and internal control lines to selectively couple an input port to the IM output on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In an example system having two VPUs, the MUX path logic and black comparator  performs compare-to-color operations so that output pixels from a first VPU output are compared with the contents of the black register to determine if the output pixels are a particular color. In an embodiment, the compare-to-color operations are compare-to-black operations, but the \u201cblack\u201d color may be configurable to any pixel color. If the output pixels are black then the MUX path logic and black comparator  controls multiplexer  to output pixels (non-black) from the second VPU. When the IM determines the output pixels from the first VPU are not black then the MUX path logic and black comparator  controls multiplexer  to output the pixels from the first VPU.","Other compositing strategies are available and are not limited by the IM . For example, extended interlink modes are also available that go beyond the load sharing usage of the Manual AFR and Blacking modes. These modes, while not the standard interlinking used for pure speed gains by sharing the processing between multiple VPUs, enhance the system quality and\/or speed by offloading functionality from the VPUs to the IM . As one example of an extended mode, the IM  of an embodiment supports the \u201cSuperAA\u201d mode previously referred to in addition to the Manual AFR and Blacking modes.","Referring again to , the IM  supports multiple input modes and single or dual link TMDS widths, depending on the input connectivity. The IM  also includes counters that monitor the phase differences between the HSyncs and VSyncs of the two inputs. The counters may include a pixel\/frame counter to assist in matching the clocks on the two input streams.","With reference to Table 2, in one embodiment, the IM  has three counters . Each counter increments the master pixel clock and uses one of the VSyncs for latching and clearing.","If a read of an I2C counter is occurring, the update to that register is held off until after the read is completed. If a write of the register is occurring, then the read is delayed until the write is completed. Read delays are only a few IM internal clocks and therefore are transparent to software.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0108"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"IM Counters"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Counter Name","Bits","Clock","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["CLKS_PER_FRAME_CTR","22","Master","Number of master clocks "]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pixel","per 1 slave frame"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"uses slave VSync to "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"determine frame edges"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"every slave VSync latches "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"the count to "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"CLKS_PER_FRAME and "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"resets this counter"]},{"entry":["S2M_VSYNC_PHASE_CTR","11","Master","Number of lines displayed "]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pixel","between slave VSync and "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"master VSync"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"latched to "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"S2M_VSYNC_PHASE "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"every master VSync"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"resets the count to 0 every "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"slave VSync"]},{"entry":["S2M_HSYNC_PHASE_CTR","12","Master","Number of pixels displayed "]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pixel","between slave HSync and "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"master HSync"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"latched to "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"S2M_HSYNC_PHASE "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"every master HSync"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"resets the count to 0 every "]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"slave HSync"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"The IM  may be used in a number of configurations as described above. In one configuration, referred to herein as a \u201cdongle\u201d, the IM  receives two separate TMDS outputs, one each from two separate VPUs, and brings them onto the dongle through two TMDS receivers. The separate receivers then output two DVO streams directly into the IM  of the dongle. The IM  mixes the two received inputs into a single output stream. The output DVO signals from the IM  are then fed either to a TMDS transmitter or through a DAC, both of which drive out through a standard DVI-I connector on the dongle.","In another configuration, referred to herein as an \u201con-card\u201d configuration, the IM  receives two streams of DVO signals directly from two VPUs that reside on the same card as the IM . This on-card configuration does not use TMDS transmitters or receivers between the VPUs and the IM , in contrast to the dongle configuration. The IM  mixes the two received inputs into a single output stream. The output DVO signals from the IM  are then fed either to a TMDS transmitter or through a DAC, both of which drive out through a standard DVI-I connector for example.","The input streams received at the IM  inputs are referred to herein as the \u201cmaster input\u201d and the \u201cslave input\u201d, and are received from the master and slave VPUs, respectively. The master and slave VPUs may be on two separate cards or on a single \u201csuper\u201d card. Either VPU can function as the master or slave VPU.","The master VPU is used as the primary clock to which the slave is synchronized (\u201csynced\u201d). The master clock is not adjusted or tuned other than the normal card initialization process. The slave VPU is adjusted to run slightly ahead of the master VPU to allow for synchronization and FIFO latencies. The slave VPU uses a larger FIFO in order to compensate for variances between the pixel clock rates of the two VPUs, while the master VPU path uses a shallow FIFO to synchronize the master input clock domain to the internal DVO clock domain. Flow control between the master and slave VPUs includes initial synchronization of the two VPUs and then ongoing adjustments to the slave VPU to match the master VPU. The flow control includes clock adjustments via a pixel hold off signal generated by the IM  or driver action in response to counters within the IM .","The initial alignment and continuing adjustments between the master and slave VPUs or cards, collectively referred to as \u201csynchronization\u201d or \u201cflow control\u201d, ensures that the slave VPU pixel clock is running a pre-specified number of pixels ahead of the master VPU pixel clock. When the IM is configured in a dual VPU mode, the depth of alignment between the VPUs is determined by the increased latency in getting pixels through the slave path and to allow for any variation in the pixel output of the slave compared to the master VPU.","The slave FIFO described herein is used to buffer the slave input to allow it to stay ahead of the master input as described above. The slave input is clocked by the slave pixel clock. The output of the slave FIFO is clocked by the master VPU pixel clock as is the master pixel path.","An initial alignment of the slave and master VPU pixel clocks generally resets the frame\/pixel clocks of the slave and master VPUs so that the slave VPU pixel clock starts before the master VPU pixel clock. This initial alignment is verified against the difference between the HSync and VSync slave to master counters, and readjusted when appropriate. The IM provides initial alignment between the master and slave VPU pixel clocks under a number of embodiments as described below.","The initial pixel clock alignment of a first embodiment sets the slave VPU ahead of the master VPU by setting the slave VPU pixel clock a pre-specified percentage faster than the master VPU pixel clock rate. To keep the slave VPU pixel clock from getting too far ahead of the master VPU pixel clock, the IM drives a Slave Pixel Hold Off signal across the unused VSync pin (e.g., on the dongle). The IM uses a set of high and low threshold register values (I2C settable) against the slave FIFO fill level to determine when to use this signal to pause or restart the slave VPU pixel output. The high and low threshold register values control the Pixel Hold Off signal, which effectively stalls the pixel output and frame counters from the slave VPU, as described herein.","The initial pixel clock alignment of a second embodiment tunes the slave VPU pixel clock to be as close as possible to the master VPU pixel clock. This tuning is done by reading how many pixel clocks occur on the master VPU pixel clock between two slave VPU TMDS VSyncs (1 frame) and comparing it to the number of pixel clocks the slave VPU is known to have generated in a frame. As such the IM uses a frame clock counter to match the slave VPU pixel clock to that of the master VPU. The IM then adjusts the slave VPU pixel clock and rechecks it until it is matched to within a pre-specified percentage of the master VPU pixel clock.","Since the master and slave VPU pixel clocks drift over time, the IM maintains pixel clock alignment after initial alignment by keeping the slave VPU pixel clock ahead of that of the master VPU. The IM periodically determines how much drift has occurred between the pixel clocks by looking at the difference between the HSync and VSync slave to master counters and readjusting the slave VPU pixel clock to compensate for the determined drift. This is possible without screen artifacts, as the pixel clocks can be adjusted by discrete increments without the VPU DLL losing lock.","In addition to the clock syncing, the synchronization of an embodiment starts both the master and slave VPUs so that the first pixels of a new frame are output with the relationship specified in the slave VSync to master VSync minimum and do not overflow the slave FIFO. This is done by resetting each VPU with a CRTC_EN bit, where the CRTC_EN bit is first written to the slave VPU and then on the very next instruction cycle to the master VPU to ensure the slave VPU starts ahead of the master VPU.","It is possible but not very likely that the host system could generate an interrupt or some other bus activity between the back-to-back VPU accesses. Therefore, the IM uses the TMDS VSync and HSync Phase counters to ensure proper cycle timing as appropriate to the back-to-back access time frame. If the timings do not match, then the system driver may repeat the operation until the relative timing is within the specification.","The IM of an embodiment includes a synchronization algorithm that keeps the slave VPU pixel clock running a pre-specified number of pixels ahead of the master VPU pixel clock as described above. In describing the synchronization algorithm the master VPU pixel clock is \u201cfaster\u201d than the slave VPU pixel clock when, in one slave frame, there are more pixel clocks than Total Pixels (\u201cTp\u201d) for the mode (Clkf>Tp), where Tp is approximately equal to the quantity (HTotal*VTotal), and a CLKS_PER_FRAME register of the IM provides the drift \u201cClkf\u201d between master and slave VPU pixel clocks. Further, the slave VPU pixel clock is faster than the master VPU pixel clock when, in one slave frame, there are less pixel clocks than Total Pixels for the mode (Clkf<Tp). The master\/slave drift per frame \u201cD\u201d is approximately equal to the quantity (|Clkf\u2212Tp|).","The system driver (e.g., driver  of ) periodically reads IM registers via I2C to determine the phase between master and slave VPU pixel clocks. In order to ensure minimum affect on system performance the number of periodic reads is minimized and any clock adjustments are made so that time intervals between adjustments are maximized.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0123"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1","2"],"br":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{},{},{}],"i":["F","Fs","Dm","Fp, ","Fp=Tp\u00f7Pclk, ","F","Fs","Ff\u2212F"]},"When the current FIFO mark (\u201cFm\u201d) is above the FIFO stop limit Fs then the slave pixel clock will be made slower to allow the master to consume pixels before the FIFO overflows. This may be achieved by adding dummy blank pixels from the slave while the master consumes active pixels.","Further, when the current FIFO mark Fm is below FIFO fill Ff then the slave pixel clock will be made faster to allow the master to add pixels before the FIFO underflows. This may be achieved by subtracting blank pixels from the slave so that while the master is processing blank pixels the slave is adding active pixels. The synchronization algorithm therefore provides a delay that ensures an initial alignment of the slave and master VPU pixel clocks by having the FIFO mark Fm in Region  at the initial alignment.","The synchronization of an embodiment also supports the addition of one blank pixel per line (e.g., HTotal). Knowing the current FIFO mark Fm allows for calculation of the number of pixels for addition or subtraction to the FIFO in order to hit the middle portion of Region . Compared to drift (in the range of approximately twenty (20) pixels per frame) the blank pixel addition or subtraction acts as a burst adjustment since one frame of pixel addition means VTotal pixels are added in one frame.","The IM  as described above supports numerous operational modes, including Pass-through Mode and various Interlink Modes, as illustrated in Table 1. These operational modes are set through a combination of I2C register bits and the TMDS Control Bits as described herein.","Pass-through Mode is a mode in which an input of the IM  is passed directly through to the output (monitor). The input port used is chosen at power-up by the initial toggling of an I2C clock. The path can be changed again by switching an ENABLE_INTERLINK register from \u201c1\u201d back to \u201c0\u201d and then toggling the I2C clock of the desired port.","Interlink Modes include numerous modes in which the IM  couples inputs received from the master and slave VPUs to an output in various combinations. Dual VPU Interlink Modes of an embodiment include but are not limited to Dual AFR Interlink Mode and Dual Blacking Interlink Mode.","Dual VPU Interlink Modes are modes in which both VPUs are being used through manual AFR control or through blacking modes. Both IM  ports are output continuously during operations in these modes.","Dual AFR Interlink Mode includes modes in which the source of the IM  output is alternated between the two input ports. It can either be done manually by the IM  drivers or automatically once started based on VSync.

It is clocked in with mClk, one clock before the rising edge of mDE after the rising edge of mVSync. The action in response to it takes place before the first pixel of this mDE active period hits the MUX. Other than this specific time, there is no direct response to AFR_MAN_ON*.","When AFR_MAN_ON* is active (LOW) and ENABLE_INTERLINK is set to 1 and the ExtendedModes bit is 0, then the path set by the pixel MUX is controlled by the xAFR_MAN bits as described below.","The I2C register reflects the result after the resulting action occurs. It does not directly reflect the clocked in bit.","AFR_AUTO* is sent across the slave TMDS Control Bit bus on bit no . It is clocked in with sClk timings and then synced to mClk. It is latched in the clock before mDE goes high after the rising edge of mVSync. The action in response to it then occurs before the first pixel associated with the active mDE hits the MUX and only if AFR_MAN_ON* is low on the same latching point.","When AFR_AUTO* and AFR_MAN_ON* are active and ENABLE_INTERLINK is set to 1 and extended interlink modes are not active, then the path set by the pixel MUX is initially set to the master path. The path is then automatically toggled on every rising edge of mDE after the rising edge of mVSync until AFR_AUTO* is deasserted.","The I2C register reflects the result after the resulting action occurs. It does not directly reflect the clocked in bit.","The mAFR_MAS is set from the master port on mLCTL[1] and sAFR_MAS is set from the slave port on sLCTL[1]. These two bits control which path is set by the pixel MUX when in Interlink mode, manual AFR control.","The mAFR_MAS is clocked directly in with mCLK. The sAFR_MAS is clocked in with sCLK and then synced to mCLK. The bits are latched on the rising clock edge before the rising edge of mDE. Both latched bits then go into a logic block which detects a bit changing state. Depending on an I2C register bit, either after the rising edge of a VSync or an HSync, if a bit is detected as having its state changed, the logic sets the pixel MUX when in AFR_MANUAL Interlink mode to match the path of the toggled bit.

As soon as the IM  sees one of the input TMDS I2C clocks toggling, it sets the MUX to pass that specific channel to the output.

An IM  device ID is an exception and can be accessed by either port at the same time.","In order to optionally verify that an I2C cycle has completed successfully, all write registers are readable back. Since the I2C registers on the IM  do not time out, this matches the current method of I2C accesses used on various conventional video cards. The read back should not be necessary to verify writes.","The IM  I2C resets its state machine (not shown) every time it gets a stop bit. This occurs at the start and end of every I2C cycle, according to known I2C protocol.","A CONTROL_ONESHOTS register (not shown) has a different behavior from the other read\/write registers. Once written to, the IM  latches its results to internal control bits. The CONTROL_ONESHOTS registers themselves are cleared on the next read of this register (allowing for confirmation of the write).","The internal copies of the CONTROL_ONESHOTS bits are automatically cleared by the IM  once the IM  has completed the requested function and the CONTROL_ONESHOTS register corresponding bits are cleared. The IM  does not re-latch the internal versions until the I2C versions are manually cleared.","The IM has one set of registers which are I2C accessible. The IM_MASTER_ID and IM_SLAVE_ID registers have the same internal address but are accessible only from their own I2C bus (e.g., slave or master).","The rest of the registers are only accessible from one side (master or slave) at a time.","In order to verify that an I2C cycle has completed successfully, all write registers must also be readable back to verify the updated values. Since the I2C registers on the IM do not time out, this is consistent with conventional methods of I2C accesses used on various existing video cards. If needed, the read back should not be necessary to verify the writes.","The IM I2C also resets its state machine every time it gets a stop bit. This happens as per I2C protocol at the start and end of every I2C cycle.","The CONTROL_ONESHOTS register has a different behavior from the other read\/write registers. Once written to, the IM latches its results to internal control bits. The CONTROL_ONESHOTS are cleared on the next read of this register (allowing for confirmation of the write).","The internal copies of the CONTROL_ONESHOTS bits are automatically cleared by the IM once the IM has completed the requested function and the CONTROL_ONESHOTS register corresponding bits are cleared.","In a dongle configuration, such as in systems  and , for example, the TMDS control bits are transmitted through the TMDS interface into the IM. The software (driver) sets the registers within the VPU for the desired control bit values and the results arrive at the TMDS receivers on the dongle and are latched into the IM. The AFR_MAN_ON* and AFR_AUTO* are latched on the rising edge of the TMDS VSync. No pixel data is being transmitted at this time. AFR_MAS is latched in on the rising edge of either HSync or VSync, depending on the setting in the I2C Control_Bits register, bit .","If the interlink_mode is not enabled (I2C register set), then the bits will be ignored until it is enabled and will take place on the next VSync.","If the interlink_mode is enabled, then the affect occurs on the very next pixel data coming out of the IMs after the VSync or HSync as is appropriate.","If in pass-thru modes, the Syncs used are from the active path. If in AFR_MANual or blacking interlink modes, then the Syncs used are always from the master path.","Aspects of the invention described above may be implemented as functionality programmed into any of a variety of circuitry, including but not limited to programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable array logic (PAL) devices, electrically programmable logic and memory devices and standard cell-based devices, as well as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and fully custom integrated circuits.
