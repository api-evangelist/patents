The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention is directed to phase reconstruction in imaging and more particularly to conjugate phase reconstruction based on a polynomial (e.g., Taylor or Chebyshev) approximation of the off-resonance phase accrual term.","Off-resonance effects are common in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to Cartesian acquisitions, where off-resonance effects usually cause only geometrical distortion and intensity variations, off-resonance effects can cause unacceptable image degradation in non-Cartesian acquisitions. In particular, uncorrected off-resonance causes space-variant image blurring in spiral k-space scanning This issue has been long recognized and is one of the most challenging problems in non-Cartesian MRI.","Off-resonance effects in MRI can arise from various sources. The off-resonance from chemical shift usually can be addressed by presaturation RF pulses or spectral-spatial excitation. Another source of off-resonance effects is B0 field inhomogeneity, including susceptibility-induced field inhomogeneity and main field inhomogeneity. Off-resonance effects can also come from concomitant gradient fields. The combination of a static main field and linear gradients as applied in MRI do not satisfy Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics. As a result, additional magnetic field terms known as concomitant gradients arise. When the off-resonance phase from B0 field inhomogeneity and concomitant gradients are both present, correction of only one of them is insufficient and sometimes can even increase blurring artifacts in some parts of the image.","Field inhomogeneity commonly exists in MRI and becomes more significant at high field strength. Field inhomogeneity causes geometrical distortion and intensity variations for acquisition using Cartesian trajectories. For acquisition using non-Cartesian trajectories, such as spiral or radial trajectories, field inhomogeneity causes image blurring artifacts, which can impair the diagnostic value of the images.","Since both B0 field inhomogeneity and concomitant gradient fields vary slowly in space, we would expect that conjugate phase (CP) reconstruction can afford effective simultaneous correction of both off-resonance effects. However, direct calculation of CP reconstruction is very time consuming. Fast alternatives to CP reconstruction with comparable accuracy have been developed, including time approximation methods, frequency approximation methods, and polynomial approximation methods. Each of these methods was originally developed for B0 field inhomogeneity correction. King et al (King K F, Ganin A, Zhou X J, Bernstein M A. Concomitant gradient field effects in spiral scans. 1999; 41: 103-112) discussed how to extend fast CP methods for concomitant field correction in spiral imaging. No literature to date has discussed in detail simultaneous B0 inhomogeneity and concomitant field correction in non-Cartesian MRI.","Conjugate phase reconstruction and its fast approximations are widely used methods of compensating for field inhomogeneity effects. Ignoring T2 relaxation, conjugate phase reconstruction can be expressed as:\n\n()=\u222b()()exp((2()\u00b7+\u0394\u03c9())\u2003\u2003[1]\n\nwhere s(t), k(t), \u0394\u03c9(r), and w(t) are the time signal, k-space trajectory, field inhomogeneity, and the density compensation accounting for the non-uniformity of the data sampling in k-space, respectively. Direct computation of Eq. [1] is time consuming. Fast approximations include time-segmented reconstruction, frequency-segmented reconstruction, and mutlifrequency interpolation. All of these methods reduce the computation cost of conjugate phase reconstruction by employing different approximations for the off-resonance phase accrual term exp(j\u0394\u03c9(r)t). However, a technique offering both accuracy and computational efficiency is still needed.\n","It is therefore an object of the invention to provide such a technique.","To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention is directed to conjugate phase reconstruction based on a polynomial approximation (e.g., Taylor or Chebyshev) of the off-resonance phase accrual term.","In at least some embodiments, the present invention implements a new fast conjugate phase reconstruction method based on a polynomial expansion of the off-resonance phase accrual term. This algorithm achieves high approximation accuracy and can be performed rapidly with the developed computational strategies. The aspects of the present invention method and algorithm may be implemented as a computer method, system, computer system, and computer program product. Further, the aforementioned present invention method, system, computer method, computer system and computer program product may be implemented with MRI systems, MRI subsystems and various types of computer processors and computer related systems and components.","In one of the preferred embodiments, we introduce a new fast alternative to CP reconstruction, where the off-resonance phase term is approximated by its Chebyshev polynomials. Compared to similar ideas discussed in the past, that embodiment is more computationally efficient and is well-suited for simultaneous B0 inhomogeneity and concomitant field correction. We apply the technique to deblurring images acquired using spiral scanning. We also demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient for combined semi-automatic inhomogeneity correction and concomitant field correction. Semi-automatic correction is accurate even with an inaccurate or low-resolution field map.","B0 field inhomogeneity and concomitant gradient fields can cause image degradation in non-Cartesian MRI. We propose an efficient algorithm for simultaneous B0 inhomogeneity and concomitant field correction in non-Cartesian MRI. Our algorithm is a fast alternative to CP reconstruction with the off-resonance phase term approximated by Chebyshev polynomials. Conventional B0 map acquisition can be inaccurate in some applications. We demonstrated that the proposed algorithms can be employed for combined semi-automatic correction and concomitant field correction to address this problem.","The algorithms are computationally efficient. The interpolation coefficients are object-independent and can be precalculated and used for any sequence with a given trajectory. Since the number of base images required is proportional to the off-resonance frequency range, linear concomitant field correction is incorporated to reduce the computational cost. Incorporation of linear B0 inhomogeneity correction is also desirable in many applications to reduce computational cost when the B0 inhomogeneity is not highly non-linear. To reduce the number of gridding operations, we also interchange the sequence of gridding operation and multiplication of modified sampling time when calculating base images.","During our experiments, we found that automatic off-resonance correction and semi-automatic off-resonance correction can sometimes achieve comparable results to combined B0 inhomogeneity and concomitant field correction when the concomitant gradient field is mild or moderate. The rationale behind this is that, in automatic or semi-automatic correction, the off-resonance phase \u03c6(\u0394\u03c9(r),\u0394\u03c9(r),t) is approximated as a spatially-dependent angular off-resonance frequency times t, which is equivalent to approximating tas \u03b1t, where \u03b1 is a constant. This approximation is reasonable for the spiral gradients designed in our sequences, because the latter part of the spiral gradients has constant magnitude. Consequently, automatic correction and semi-automatic correction can achieve modest simultaneous B0 inhomogeneity correction and concomitant field correction even without explicitly including a concomitant field term. We constrained the searching range of off-resonance frequency within \u00b150 Hz from the acquired B0 map when performing semi-automatic correction on acquired data sets. A least square fit of \u03b1t to tfrom our spiral gradient indicates that \u00b150 Hz B0 off-resonance frequency corresponds to about \u00b1100 Hz searching range of concomitant field off-resonance frequency. This is sufficient for a moderate concomitant field, especially after incorporating linear concomitant field correction. A larger searching range can be employed in semi-automatic correction to accommodate a stronger concomitant gradient field. Automatic off-resonance correction does not have this issue since the searching range is not constrained by the B0 field map.","We focused on fast CP reconstruction in the preferred embodiments. The idea of approximating a phase term by a Chebyshev or other polynomial can be applied to other image reconstruction methods where off-resonance phase is a concern, such as SPHERE and off-resonance correction based on iterative reconstruction.","We only discussed the concomitant gradient field arising from spiral gradients in this paper. Since arbitrary time-varying phase terms can be approximated by Chebyshev or other polynomials, the present invention should be able to address the concomitant gradient field from a more general readout gradient. The present invention is also likely capable of addressing other time varying phase terms such as those induced by eddy current effects.","Preferred embodiments of the invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements or steps throughout.","The preferred embodiments use polynomial expansions of the off-resonance phase accrual term, namely,\n\n\u2248\u03b1+\u03b1+ . . . +\u03b1t+\u2003\u2003[2]\n","The expansions are converging infinite series; however, the approximations terminate the series at some point, as disclosed below.","The first preferred embodiment replaces the phase term with its Taylor expansion, which can be expressed as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["m","CP"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}},{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mi":"n"},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"\u0394\u03c9","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}}},"mi":"n"},"mrow":{"mi":"n","mo":"!"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["m","n"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}}}],"mo":"="},{"mrow":[{"mi":"with","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["m","n"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}},{"msub":{"mo":"\u222b","mi":"t"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"W","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mi":"exp","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mi":"j2\u03c0","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"k","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mi":"r"}}}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"msup":{"mi":["t","n"]},"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.2em","height":"0.2ex"}}}}}],"mo":"="},{"mi":"n","mo":"=","mn":"0"}],"mo":[",",",",","],"mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"3"}}]}}}},"br":{},"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"sub":["n","t"],"i":["r","W","t","s","t","t","\u03c0k","t","r]dt, n="],"sup":"n"},"where m(r) are referred to as base images.

In our implementation, as shown in , we perform gridding  on the time signal s(t) to acquire a Cartesian time signal, and also interpolate the time t onto a Cartesian grid using Delaunay triangulation  to form a Cartesian time mask. To compute the base images, we then simply multiply the Cartesian time signal by the time mask n times and then perform a Fourier transform.

W(t) can be calculated from geometric arguments, as the Jacobian of the coordinate transformation or by numerical methods. Noll et al (Noll D C, Fessler J A, Sutton B P. Conjugate phase MRI reconstruction with spatially variant sample density correction 2005; 24: 325-336) discussed the implementation of a spatially-varying density compensation function in CP reconstruction.","CP reconstruction is computationally inefficient. Fast alternatives, including time approximation methods, frequency approximation methods, and polynomial approximation methods, have been developed. These methods essentially approximate the off-resonance phase term in different ways to reduce the computational cost of CP reconstruction, and consequently possess different features. Each of these methods was originally developed to correct for B0 field inhomogeneity. Fast CP reconstruction in the presence of both B0 field inhomogeneity and concomitant gradient fields has increased numerical complexity and has not been previously described to our knowledge. Extending the time approximation and frequency approximation methods to produce a combined correction would likely increase computation significantly. As we show below, it is possible to design a particular polynomial approximation that leads to fast and accurate correction for both B0 inhomogeneity and concomitant gradient fields.","Fast conjugate phase reconstruction based on the Chebyshev approximation will now be discussed. Schomberg (Schomberg H, Off-Resonance Correction of MR Images. 1999; 18: 481-495) has previously discussed Chebyshev approximation in CP reconstruction for the purpose of Bfield inhomogeneity correction. In his algorithm, the off-resonance phase term is approximated by a Chebyshev polynomial that is a function of the product of Bfield inhomogeneity and time. One drawback of Schomberg's algorithm is that the calculation of Chebyshev coefficients becomes object dependent, since the field map is involved in the Chebyshev polynomial variable. Another problem associated with Schomberg's algorithm is that it can not be applied for simultaneous B0 field inhomogeneity correction and concomitant gradient field correction.","To address these problems, we propose a fast CP reconstruction algorithm where the off-resonance phase term is approximated by a Chebyshev polynomial in time t. The proposed fast CP reconstruction algorithm can be expressed as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00009","num":"00009"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["w","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"\u0394\u03c9","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","c"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}],"mo":[",",","],"mi":"\u03c4"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["I","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}],"mo":"\u2062"},{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","o"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}}],"mo":"-"},"mo":","}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"15"}}]}}}}},"where \u03c4 is the readout length, I(r) are base images, and w(\u0394\u03c9(r),\u0394\u03c9(r),\u03c4) are constant coefficients whose values depend on the Bfield inhomogeneity, the concomitant gradient field, and the readout length. The mathematical derivation of Eq. [15] is given in Appendix A below. Two forms of Eq. [15], including Eq. [A5] and Eq. [A10], are derived. Our experiments on spiral data sets indicate that these two formulas lead to equivalent off-resonance correction results. The present embodiment can also be easily modified for B0 field inhomogeneity correction or concomitant field correction when only one off-resonance source is present.","The coefficients w(\u0394\u03c9(r),\u0394\u03c9(r),\u03c4) can be calculated offline and saved as a table at a range of \u0394\u03c9(r) and \u0394\u03c9(r). The table is object independent and the same table can be used for any data set acquired with same readout length. The table is three dimensional and the length of each dimension corresponds to the number of bins of \u0394\u03c9(r), the number of bins of \u0394\u03c9(r), and the number of base images, respectively.","Equation [15] involves reconstruction of the time signal s(t) multiplied by t{l=0,1,2 . . . } followed by a fast reconstruction method such as gridding. To reduce the computational cost, as explained above with reference to , we perform gridding on the time signal s(t) to calculate raw data on a Cartesian grid, and also interpolate the time t onto a Cartesian grid using Delaunay triangulation to form a Cartesian time mask. To compute the base images, we then simply multiply the Cartesian time signal by the time mask multiple times and then perform a Fourier transform. This strategy reduces the number of gridding operations performed during image reconstruction. Since the time mask is only a function of the k-space trajectory, it can also be calculated offline and used for data sets acquired with same k-space trajectory.","The number of base images needed in Eq. [15] is proportional to the range of B0 field inhomogeneity and concomitant gradient field. Center frequency correction can be incorporated into Eq. [15] to reduce the range of B0 field inhomogeneity. When the B0 field map is not highly non-linear, incorporation of linear off-resonance correction into Eq. [15] is desirable to further reduce the computational cost. To reduce the range of concomitant gradient field, we incorporate linear concomitant gradient correction into Eq. [15]. For a given scan plane orientation, linear concomitant gradient correction reduces the frequency range of an off-center slice to that of a slice at isocenter. The derivation of this is given Appendix B below.","The combination of semi-automatic off-resonance correction and concomitant gradient field correction will now be disclosed. CP reconstruction requires knowledge of accurate off-resonance maps. The off-resonance map from concomitant gradient fields can be calculated from theory. For B0 inhomogeneity correction, a field map is usually acquired by two single shot spirals at different echo times. Such field map acquisitions, however, can be inaccurate in many applications and residual errors can appear in images. Recently, we proposed a method termed semi-automatic off-resonance correction (Chen W, Meyer C H, Semiautomatic off-resonance correction in spiral imaging. 2008 May; 59(5):1212-9.) to address this problem. In semi-automatic off-resonance correction, the acquired map is used to provide a frequency constraint for following automatic off-resonance correction rather than directly for CP reconstructions.","The computational strategy developed in semi-automatic correction requires calculating the value of individual pixels at an arbitrary constant frequency without reconstructing the whole image at that frequency. Multifrequency interpolation was employed previously for this purpose. Note that the proposed fast CP reconstruction method also has this property. Therefore, the proposed CP reconstruction based on Chebyshev approximation is well suited for combined semi-automatic off-resonance correction and concomitant field correction. To perform combined semi-automatic correction and concomitant field correction, we reconstruct a series of images as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00010","num":"00010"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":";","msub":{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","i"]}}}},{"mrow":[{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"k","mo":"=","mn":"0"},{"mi":"N","mo":"-","mn":"1"}]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["w","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mi":"\u0394","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"~"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}},"mo":"+","msub":{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","i"]}},{"msub":{"mi":["\u0394\u03c9","c"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}],"mo":[",",","],"mi":"\u03c4"}}},{"msub":{"mi":["I","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}},{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","o"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"r"}}}],"mo":"-"}],"mo":"="},{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},{"mn":"2","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mi":"\u2026"}],"mo":[",","\u2062",",","\u2062",","],"mstyle":[{"mtext":{}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mn":"16"}}]}}}}},"where \u0394{umlaut over (\u03c9)}(r) is the frequency constraint estimated from an acquired low resolution B0 field map and \u0394\u03c9(i=1, 2 . . . ) is a series of constant frequency shifts from \u0394{umlaut over (\u03c9)}(r). Note that concomitant field effects are corrected when reconstructing m(r;\u0394\u03c9) in Eq. [16]. After reconstructing m(r;\u0394\u03c9), semi-automatic correction is then performed for B0 field inhomogeneity correction.","We tested our algorithm on both phantom and in vivo data sets collected by spiral scanning on a Siemens 1.5 T Avanto scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). We performed the following correction methods and compared the results: (1) concomitant field correction using the proposed method; (2) field-map-based B0 field inhomogeneity correction using fast CP reconstruction; (3) semi-automatic off-resonance correction; (4) combined field-map-based B0 field inhomogeneity correction and concomitant field correction (combined correction A); and (5) combined semi-automatic B0 field inhomogeneity correction and concomitant field correction (combined correction B). For semi-automatic correction and combined correction B, the following parameters are used for the semi-automatic portion of the image reconstruction: the size of summation window was 15\u00d715; the power \u03b1 of the objective function was 1; the searching range of the off-resonance frequency shift was from \u221250 Hz to 50 Hz; the increment of searching frequencies was 10 Hz; and the first 1.6 ms of the readout was used to reconstruct the low resolution images (after concomitant gradient field correction) whose phase was then removed from corresponding high resolution images before objective function calculation. The value of each of these parameters was the same as those specified in our above-cited 2008 paper. To account for trajectory errors due to gradient delay and eddy current effects, modified k-space trajectories based on methods described by Tan et al (Tan H, Meyer C H, K-space trajectory estimation in spiral imaging.
