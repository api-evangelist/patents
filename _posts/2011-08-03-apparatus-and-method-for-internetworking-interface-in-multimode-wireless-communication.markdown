Field of the Invention","This invention relates in general to the field of wireless communications, and more particularly to an apparatus and method for providing a multimode smartphone with inter-radio access technology (IRAT) internetworking features and capabilities.","2. Description of the Related Art","The cell phone industry is undergoing exponential growth, not only in this country, but all over the world. In fact, it is well known that the over twenty percent of the adult population in the United States does not have a traditional landline telephone. It is also noteworthy that nearly ninety percent of the adult population owns a wireless phone (i.e. cell phone).","In addition to this growth in ownership, the usage of cell phones is increasing as well over the use of traditional landline telephone coverage. In fact, one in seven adults now uses cell phones exclusively. Whereas in the past cell phones were used when a landline was not available or under emergency conditions, lower carrier rates, affordability of family packages, and free mobile-to-mobile or friend-to-friend promotions have fostered in significant increases in usage. It is not uncommon today to walk into any public forum or facility and observe a majority of the people there talking, texting, or accessing data on their cell phones.","The ability to communicate using a wireless mobile phone has been available since the middle of the last century. However, during the 1990's so-called \u201c2G\u201d or second generation mobile phone systems were fielded that began the growth in both deployment and usage that we currently enjoy today. These initial systems predominately provided for the routing and reliable servicing of voice calls between parties. But even at this time, rudimentary protocols were established to enable cell phones to receive and transmit data as well as voice. Exemplary networks include General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), providing data rates up to roughly 60 Kilobits per second.","During the early 2000's so-called \u201c3G\u201d or third generation cellular systems were fielded that have provided significant increases in user capacity, quality of service, and data rate. CDMA2000, also known as 1xRTT, is perhaps the most prevalent of these 3G systems and this protocol is well known by those in the art to provide for excellent transmission of voice and data. In concert, newer and faster data networks were fielded providing for data rates greater than 2 Megabits per second.","In the past few years, however, there has been an exponential increase in the requirement for data access from a mobile device. Users now check their email, browse the web, and send and receive pictures and movie clips\u2014all from their mobile phones. Accordingly, developers continue to make advances in data networks and protocols to support this pull from the user community. More recently, systems are now being fielded that support so-called Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, providing for peak data rates up to 100 Megabits per second, as supported by the 3Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).","Thus, in addition to supporting legacy data and voice standards, present day cell phone manufacturers must also support LTE. But because of the vast network and modulation differences between LTE and legacy voice and data standards, it has become common practice to develop so-call multimode smartphones that support legacy data standards as well as LTE. To accomplish this objective, smartphone developers typically employ a modem that comprehensively provides for existing voice and data network compatibility, and in addition provide an LTE modem for purposes of accessing the LTE network. More specifically, CDMA modems provide for CDMA-based voice (e.g., 1x RTT) and data (HRPD, EV-DO) communications, but they do not provide for LTE because LTE functions according to an entirely different set of protocols and modulation schemes.","Integrating existing data capabilities with LTE would be less problematic were it not for the fact that LTE is not universally fielded. That is, LTE networks are in their infancy and there are currently only a few pockets of LTE coverage in selected major metropolitan areas. Consequently, cell phone developers must provide for the handoff of data sessions from LTE to legacy data networks and vice versa. And the present inventors have observed that this handoff requirement if extremely onerous from a developer's point of view because the interface requirements of LTE modems are not standardized, thus requiring significant modification of a legacy voice\/data modem for each LTE modem in the inventory. Consequently, the development costs\u2014in terms of both investment and time\u2014are substantial when directed at developing a multimode smartphone solution.","Accordingly, what is needed is an apparatus and method that enables existing legacy voice\/data modems to be employed in a cellular device in conjunction with an LTE modem from any manufacturer, where interoperation of the two modems is seamless, and where significant modification of the legacy voice\/data modem is minimized.","What is also needed is a generalized application programming interface and commensurate hardware that a legacy voice\/data modem can utilize to interface and interoperate with a plurality of LTE modems.","The present invention, among other applications, is directed to solving the above-noted problems and addresses other problems, disadvantages, and limitations of the prior art. The present invention provides a superior technique for providing a multimode smartphone having IRAT internetworking capabilities. In one embodiment, an apparatus for support of connectionless machine type communication (MTC) in a long-term evolution (LTE) environment is provided. The apparatus includes an LTE modem and a code demand multiple access (CDMA) modem. The LTE modem is configured to access a first wireless network and execute first data transactions over the first wireless network, where the first wireless network comports with LTE radio access technology (RAT) standards. The CDMA modem is operationally coupled to the LTE modem, and is configured to access a second wireless network and execute second data transactions over the second wireless network, where the second wireless network comports with one or more CDMA-based RAT standards. The CDMA modem includes an inter-radio access technology (IRAT) application programming interface (API) element and an inter-process communication (IPC) module. The IRAT API element is configured to send\/receive IRAT messages via function calls to\/from the LTE modem, where the IRAT messages remain the same regardless of interface requirements for the LTE modem. The IPC module is coupled to the IRAT API element, and is configured to generalize the function calls to enable the CDMA modem to interoperate with the LTE modem.","One aspect of the present invention contemplates an apparatus for support of connectionless machine type communication (MTC) in a long-term evolution (LTE) environment. The apparatus has an LTE modem and a code demand multiple access (CDMA) modem. The LTE modem is configured to access a first wireless network and execute first data transactions over the first wireless network, where the first wireless network comports with LTE radio access technology (RAT) standards.

The application processor is coupled to the LTE modem and to the CDMA modem, and is configured to implement main call control to internetwork between the modems.","Another aspect of the present invention comprehends a method for support of connectionless machine type communication (MTC) in a long-term evolution (LTE) environment. The method includes: via an LTE modem, first accessing a first wireless network and first executing first data transactions over the first wireless network, where the first wireless network comports with LTE radio access technology (RAT) standards; and via a code demand multiple access (CDMA) modem, operationally coupled to the LTE modem, second accessing a second wireless network and second executing second data transactions over the second wireless network, where the second wireless network comports with one or more CDMA-based RAT standards.

Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will, however, be apparent to one skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described herein, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed.","In view of the above background discussion on multimode interfaces for smartphone applications, a discussion of the limitations of present day devices will be presented with reference to . Following this, a discussion of the present invention will now be presented with reference to . The present invention overcomes the limitations of present day multimode smartphones by providing application programming interface mechanisms that allow for interoperation of inter-radio access technology (IRAT) modems that are developed by different manufacturers","Turning to , a block diagram illustrating a present day multimode smartphone  that exhibits a unique inter-radio access technology stack . The smartphone is typical of what is currently being fielded in the art, consisting of an application processor (AP)  that is coupled to a code division multiple access (CDMA) modem  via a bus . Representative CDMA modems  perform those calling and data functions that are well known in the art such as 1x RTT, data optimized (DO), enhanced high rate packetized data (EHRPD), and etc.","The AP  is also coupled to a long term evolution (LTE) modem  via bus . As one skilled in the art will appreciate, CDMA and LTE are two entirely different radio technologies and although they are employed together within the present day smartphone , there is a requirement for coordinated interoperation between CDMA and LTE such as performing handoffs between DO and LTE, LTE and EHRPD, and etc. It is beyond the scope of this application to provide a comprehensive presentation of these different radio technologies that are employed for data transactions, however it is sufficient to note that a present day multimode smartphone requires that there be a seamless and integrated interface between the modems ,  providing these two disparate radio technologies because there will arise situations where no LTE coverage is provided and the phone  must revert back to, say, EHRPD in order to complete a data flow. And as the phone  continues movement, LTE coverage many indeed reappear, thus providing a requirement for handoff back to LTE from EHRPD. The above example is only one of many instances that illustrate the necessity for integrated operation between the two modems , .","Operationally, the AP  implements main call control to internetwork between the LTE modem  and the CDMA modem . If the two modems ,  are developed by the same manufacturer, then seamless integration is achieved as part of the design process. However, as is more and more prevalent, if the two modems ,  are developed by different manufacturers, then one of the modems ,  must provide a mechanism to perfect seamless interoperability. This case is shown in  where the CDMA modem  includes a unique IRAT stack  that allows for interoperation of the CDMA modem  with the LTE modem  as described above.","As noted, in a wireless HRPD\/EHRPD\/LTE multimode handset , a user can access both the LTE and DO network whenever coverage of either is available. Thus LTE and CDMA modems ,  must internetwork with each other in order to perform such functions as global mode system selection (GMSS). In addition, these modems ,  must internetwork in order to accomplish all of the LTE-DO redirection and reselection IRAT procedures. In a typical operation, the smartphone  powers up, performs system selection procedures according to the GMSS algorithm, and acquires an LTE or CDMA network according to an associated carrier's priorities and roaming list. When the device  moves from coverage of one technology to another, a reselection or redirection handoff procedure is performed. The execution of such IRAT operations may involve measurements of signal quality of both network technologies prior to the handoff. When the quality of a current technology network degrades and another better network technology is available, a handoff may be performed. Such interworking operations require the definition and coordination of all the IRAT call flow sequence between the two technologies. As also alluded to, if the manufacturers of the modems ,  are different, these IRAT application programming interface (API) and call flow sequencing must be defined and implemented clearly to allow for seamless internetworking. Such is the function of the unique IRAT stack  shown in the CDMA modem  of .","Alternatively, if an HRPD\/EHRPD wireless technology modem developer wants interoperate with the LTE modem , then that developer must invest in the development effort of a unique IRAT stack , often requiring the definition of unique IRAT call flows for all interworking usage scenarios, several of which are noted above.","If the HRPD\/EHRPD wireless technology modem manufacturer already has IRAT call stack capabilities with one LTE\/AP manufacturer and desires to interoperate with an LTE wireless modem  from another LTE\/AP vendor as a solution, there is a requirement to integrate and customize the IRAT stack  to interoperate with the modem  from the other LTE\/AP vendor because IRAT call flows are typically different for each LTE\/AP manufacturer. Thus, significant customization or adaptation is needed to realize a multimode device , requiring significant investment in development to support this unique solution.","As one skilled in the art will appreciate, these unique interface solutions are proprietary and customized according to each manufacturer, and cannot be ported to any other LTE\/AP wireless modem manufacturer without significant effort and investment. Furthermore, providing unique internetworking solutions is disadvantageous because of the difficulty required to incorporate requirements for a new carrier because the new carrier's requirements would need to be duplicated across all the customized IRAT solutions for each different manufacturer.","The present inventors have observed that providing a unique IRAT stack  to interface to different LTE modems  is not adaptable for a different manufacturer's solution that has different inter-process communication (IPC) methods, such as using a proprietary IPC mechanism or using AT commands from the well known Hayes command sent to communicate between the AP  and the CDMA modem . Consequently, a unique IRAT stack  is not reusable, it requires significant effort to incorporate new additional carrier's requirements, it is not adaptable to any other wireless technologies in a multimode device , it is not flexible for different configurations such as smartphone with a direct LTE\/DO datacard, and it is not portable to different platforms such as single or multiple chip configurations.","To overcome the above noted limitations and disadvantages, the present inventors have provided an interface and internetworking mechanism within a CDMA modem according to the present invention that allows for seamless interoperation between the CDMA modem and LTE modems from other manufacturers.","Referring now to , a block diagram is presented depicting a multimode smartphone  according to the present invention that features integral inter-radio access technology (IRAT) internetworking elements. The multimode smartphone  is particularly suited in architecture for interfacing an LTE modem  to a CDMA modem  that is employed for performing DO functions or functions corresponding with a different radio access technology (RAT).","The smartphone  includes an AP  that is coupled to an LTE modem  via bus . The LTE modem  is coupled to a corresponding antenna . In operation, the LTE modem  performs those functions associated with transmission and reception of data according to the LTE protocol and RAT.","The smartphone  also includes a CDMA modem  that is coupled to the AP  via busses  and . Bus  is configured to provide inter-RAT messages between the modem  and the AP . Bus  is configured to provide Internet protocol (IP) packets between the modem  and the AP . The CDMA modem  includes a system selection element  that is coupled to a data stack . The selection element  and the data stack  are coupled to a CDMA protocol stack . The CDMA protocol stack  is coupled to a CDMA physical modem . The CDMA physical modem  is coupled to a corresponding antenna .","The system selection element  includes an IRAT element  that is employed to select between the RATs that are provided for by the device . The data stack  includes an EHRPD element  and a data packet handler . Forward and reverse data packets from between the corresponding antenna , the physical modem , the protocol stack  and the data stack  in accordance with direction from the system selection element .","In contrast to a conventional multimode smartphone , which employs a unique stack  configured to interface to a specific manufacturer's LTE modem , the CDMA modem  according to the present invention also includes an inter-process communication module  and an IRAT application programming interface (API) element  that are configured to generalize function calls and data that are associated with inter-RAT handoffs and communication. As will be detailed below, API functions are defined to allow any manufacturer's LTE modem  to interoperate with the CDMA modem  according to the present invention via inter-RAT messages provided over bus  to\/from the AP .","In one embodiment, the AP  and LTE modem  represent a different manufacturer's solution which can interwork with the CDMA modem  according to the present invention, via the communication module  and API . In one embodiment, the CDMA modem  is configured to perform functions corresponding to EHRPD, DO, and 1x protocols. The inter-process communication (IPC) module  is configured to route messages and packet data between the AP  and the CDMA modem ","The CDMA protocol stack  implements the 1X and DO protocol state machines required to handle traffic channel call setup, releases, and other protocol features such as handoff according to the 3gpp2 standards. The EHRPD stack  implements the 3gpp2 standards' specified EHRPD requirements to interoperate with the Enhanced Packet Core Network for Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and other radio access technologies. The data packet handler  processes and routes the IP\/Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) data path packets between the AP  and the CDMA modem  via the IPC module .","The IRAT API  and stack  includes an IRAT_API layer which hosts a suite of adaptable and flexible IRAT Interworking APIs, that any LTE\/AP manufacturer can interface with to realize any DO\/LTE interworking call flow. The IRAT_API layer provides an abstraction for the IRAT stack , which then interfaces with the EHRPD stack , data packet handler , and CDMA protocol stack . The IRAT stack  implements the DO\/LTE interworking handling for each IRAT_API function call, and triggers the EHRPD stack  and CDMA protocol stack  to perform the necessary actions.","The IRAT API  and IRAT stack  are adaptable to other RATs as well, for any other DO\/OtherRAT interworking operations, such as DO\/WiFi, DO\/802.15, or DO\/BLUETOOTH\u00ae. The IRAT API  and IRAT stack  are easily extensible to implement any carrier's new additional requirements.","The IRAT API  and IRAT stack  are adaptable to all manufacturer's LTE modems  and APs  by providing a generic IRAT API suite of functions. Because the API functions according to the present invention are performed automatically, the IRAT API  and stack  solution according to the present invention can flexibly accommodate any manufacturer's specific requirements.","Accordingly, the LTE \/AP  manufacturer provides an IPC layer  which calls the IRAT API functions.","The smartphone  according to the present invention is configured to perform the functions and operations as discussed above. The smartphone  comprises logic, circuits, devices, or microcode (i.e., micro instructions or native instructions), or a combination of logic, circuits, devices, or microcode, or equivalent elements that are employed to execute the functions and operations according to the present invention as noted. The elements employed to accomplish these operations and functions within the smartphone  may be shared with other circuits, microcode, etc., that are employed to perform other functions and\/or operations within the smartphone . According to the scope of the present application, microcode is a term employed to refer to a plurality of micro instructions. A micro instruction (also referred to as a native instruction) is an instruction at the level that a unit executes. For example, micro instructions are directly executed by a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor. For a complex instruction set computer (CISC) processor, CISC instructions are translated into associated micro instructions, and the associated micro instructions are directly executed by a unit or units within the CISC processor.","Turning to , a block diagram is presented depicting a multimode smartphone  according to the present invention that features integral inter-radio access technology internetworking elements that are compatible with an application processor  utilizing attention (AT) commands. The smartphone  according to the embodiment of  is substantially similar in configuration and function as the smartphone  discussed above with reference to , where like-numbered elements having the hundreds digit replaced with a \u201c3\u201d operate in the same manner as their counterparts in . The smartphone  according to  has an additional AT command parser  that interfaces between the AP  at bus  and the IRAT API element .","Operationally, this architecture is adaptable to a manufacturer's AP\/LTE solution that employs AT (i.e., Hayes) commands for AP  to CDMA modem  communications. Accordingly the AT parser  is provided to interface with the manufacturer's AP\/LTE stack. The AT parser  interprets the manufacturer's AT commands and directly calls corresponding IRAT_API functions. The very same set of IRAT_API functions (discussed below) are employed by the smartphone  of  as by the smartphone  of .","The IRAT architecture discussed with reference to the smartphones ,  of  provide for a DO\/LTE\/Other RAT multimode configuration that includes an Application Processor , , however the present invention also contemplates other IRAT configurations that do not include an AP.","The smartphone  according to the present invention is configured to perform the functions and operations as discussed above.

The flow sequence  is presented in terms of the IRAT API function calls that are exchanged between a CDMA modem  according to the present invention comprising an IRAT stack  and a data stack , and an AP\/LTE inter-process communication (IPC) element  (or a data card having only an LTE modem), as described above with reference to  and Tables 1-4.","Flow begins at block  where the AP\/LTE  sets a wireless device according to the present invention into a Global Mode System Selection, and performs a system selection algorithm to select a next available system. Accordingly, a CDMA 1X circuit switched voice system is desired to be acquired and registered first, so the AP\/LTE  calls the IRATApi_Registration1X_Only_Req function to trigger the 1X system acquisition. Flow then proceeds to block .","At block , the CDMA 1X system is acquired and registered, and an IRATApi_Registration1X_Only_Rsp call is returned to the AP\/LTE  by the CDMA modem . In addition, once the CDMA 1X system is acquired and registered, an IRATApi_Data_Network_State_Change_Notify (1X) indication is also returned to the AP\/LTE  to indicate a change in the network status. Flow then proceeds to block .","At block , the CDMA system is selected and the AP runs the Global Mode System Selection algorithm based on current acquired LTE and CDMA status. At this point, the AP\/LTE  might have attempted to also acquire an LTE system but was not successful, and so it decides that the next selected system should be a CDMA DO system. Thus, the AP\/LTE (IPC)  triggers the IRATApi_Irat_Trigger_PS_Reg_Req function call to acquire and register to an EHRPD\/DO system for packet data calls. Flow then proceeds to blocks  and .","At blocks , , the DO system is acquired, and a DO Session is setup with EHRPD negotiated. The CDMA modem  calls the IRATApi_Irat_Trigger_PS_Reg_Rsp function, which informs the AP\/LTE (IPC) . In addition, once the CDMA DO system is acquired and registered with EHRPD packet service capability, an IRATApi_Data_Network_State_Change_Notify (EHRPD) function call is executed to indicate to the AP\/LTE  a change in the network status. Flow then proceeds to blocks , ","At blocks , , the EHRPD network is registered and the AP\/LTE (IPC)  triggers the EHRPD main default bearer connection setup by calling the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Default_Bearer_Req function, with the desired Default Bearer PDN Access Point Name (APN), IPversion type (IPv4\/IPv6), and other required information. Flow then proceeds to blocks , .","At block , the EVDO traffic channel connection is setup, followed by block  where an EHRPD Attach procedure is executed to establish the default bearer connection. Following this, the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Default_Bearer_Rsp function is called to indicate to the AP\/LTE (IPC)  the terminal's IP address information and other optional parameters given by the EHRPD network. In addition, when the CDMA packet data state becomes active, the CDMA modem  sends an IRATApi_Irat_Cdma_DataState_Ind function call back to the AP\/LTE (IPC) . Flow then proceeds to block .","At block , the AP\/LTE (IPC)  may also trigger other auxiliary dedicated bearer connections by calling the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Dedicated_Bearer_Req function. Flow then proceeds to block .","At block , once these dedicated bearer connections are setup with the network, the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Dedicated_Bearer_Rsp function is returned to the AP\/LTE (IPC) , thus completing the exemplary call flow sequence .","Turning now to , a flow diagram is presented detailing an IRAT application programming interface usage call flow sequence  according to the present invention featuring a long term evolution (LTE) to EHRPD system redirection with measurements. The flow sequence  is presented in terms of the IRAT API function calls that are exchanged between a CDMA modem  according to the present invention comprising an IRAT stack  and a data stack , and an AP\/LTE inter-process communication (IPC) element  (or a data card having only an LTE modem), as described above with reference to  and Tables 1-4. The sequence  shows an example usage of the IRAT APIs for performing an LTE to EHRPD handoff, with periodic measurement requests made on the CDMA system. Once the conditions for LTE to EHRPD handoff are met (when the LTE conditions becomes weaker than the CDMA system), the AP\/LTE (IPC)  can initiate this handoff.","Flow begins at block  where the AP\/LTE (IPC)  is in the Global Mode and the Packet Service is currently active on the LTE system, concurrent with 1X Circuit Voice Service. Once a user traveling with a smartphone within which the elements ,  are disposed gets near a handoff boundary, the AP\/LTE (IPC)  can periodically trigger measurements on the CDMA system by issuing the IRATApi_Irat_Measure_Cmd function, with a list of desired frequencies and pilots. This information may be given by an associated LTE network. Flow then proceeds to block .","At block , if this is measurement is triggered for the first time, then the CDMA system first acquires the DO system, and flow proceeds to block  where a DO session is set up before performing any measurement. Flow then proceeds to block  where the CDMA modem  then acquires each frequency in the Frequency List received, and performs measurements on each of the pilots in the Pilot List received. The desired list of measurements are returned in the IRATApi_Irat_Measure_Result_Ind function to the AP\/LTE (IPC) . Flow then proceeds to block .","At block  the AP\/LTE (IPC)  runs its algorithm based on the CDMA measurements and current LTE strength. Once the conditions for LTE to EHRPD handoff are met, it can issue an IRATApi_Irat_Trigger_PS_Reg_Freq_Req function to the CDMA system  indicating a desired frequency for the handoff. Flow then proceeds to block .","At block  the CDMA system  acquires the desired frequency if its current frequency is not the desired one. Since an EHRPD DO session is already opened, the LTE to EHRPD handoff is quick and the CDMA system  returns the IRATApi_Irat_Trigger_PS_Reg_Freq_Rsp function immediately. Accordingly, the IRATApi_Data_Network_State_Change_Notify (EHRPD) function is called thus indicating to the AP\/LTE  availability of EHRPD packet service. Consequently, the AP\/LTE  tears down LTE packet resources.","Flow then proceeds to block  where the AP\/LTE  triggers EHRPD connection setups as desired. Accordingly, the AP\/LTE  triggers EHRPD default bearer connection setup with handoff attach type to handoff the packet service from the AP\/LTE  to the EHRPD system, using the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Default_Bearer_Req function, with the desired Default Bearer PDN Access Point Name (APN), and existing AP's IP address assigned by the LTE network.","Flow then proceeds to block  where the CDMA system  initiates an EVDO traffic connection setup. Flow then proceeds to block  where the CDMA system  triggers an EHRPD Default Bearer Attach. The CDMA network sets up the EHRPD connections, and returns with the IRATApi_Ehrpd_Default_Bearer_Rsp and indicates a change of state by calling IRATApi_IRAT_CDMA_DataState_Ind (Active).","At this point, the LTE to EHRPD handoff is successfully completed.","Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they can readily use the disclosed conception and specific embodiments as a basis for designing or modifying other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention, and that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description, and accompanying drawings where:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
