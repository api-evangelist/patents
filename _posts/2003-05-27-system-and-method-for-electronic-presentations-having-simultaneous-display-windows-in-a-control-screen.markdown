{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in part of the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/153,859, filed May 24, 2002, entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ELECTRONIC PRESENTATION, which relates to and claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/293,179, filed May 25, 2001, entitled ELECTRONIC INSTRUCTIONAL DELIVERY SYSTEM AND METHOD, the disclosure of both which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.","The present invention relates to group presentations systems and methods and, more particularly, to an electronic presentation system and method having multiple screens.","One traditional method for making presentations to relatively small groups, such as in an educational or training environment, includes the use of an overhead projector and view foils or transparencies. According to this familiar method, the presenter has a series of view foils that are manually placed on, and then removed from, an overhead projector in a predetermined order. While blank view foils are sometimes inserted to allow the presenter to dynamically present material during the presentation, the presenter is unlikely to annotate a previously prepared view foil because such an annotation would likely ruin the foil for future use.","Recent advances in automation have addressed some of the shortcomings of this traditional presentation method. In one instance, a computer's video output can now be connected to a projector so that a computer generated slide show can be shown on a screen, sometimes with animation. However, this introduction of automation does not change the limited and static nature of the presentation materials and methods.","Accordingly, there remains a need for a dynamic presentation system and method that allows a presenter to effectively and dynamically present material that can easily be modified and augmented according to each environment in which the presentation is made.","The present invention addresses these and other needs with a system and method that provides multiple display screens for presentation materials as well as permits dynamic annotations to presentation materials that do not permanently alter the presentation materials. The presentation materials can easily be directed to any one of the display screens, and any annotations can be saved for future use or simply deleted.","One aspect of the present invention relates to a system for providing electronic presentations in which the system includes, for example, a plurality of presentation slides stored in a first memory accessible by a programmable computer; a first display screen coupled with the programmable computer and having a first video input signal; a second display screen coupled with the programmable computer and having a second video input signal; and a third display screen coupled with the programmable computer and having a third video input signal. The presentation system also includes a presentation control software application that is stored in a second memory accessible by the programmable computer wherein the programmable computer is configured to execute the presentation control application to provide an interface, displayed on the third display screen, by which each of the plurality of slides is dispatched for display to either one of the first or second display screens. The third display screen includes a multi-windowed display interface that simultaneously depicts the current right-side image, the current left-side image and an image of the next slide to be dispatched. Using the presentation control system a presenter can selected either the right-side or left-side image and perform real-time annotation of that image.","Another aspect of the present invention relates to a software application and method for providing an electronic presentation of a plurality of slides using multiple display screens that provides a presentation control interface on a center display screen; displays a slide, from among the plurality of slides, in a preview window within the presentation control interface; receives input via the presentation control interface indicating whether to direct the slide to a right display screen or a left display screen; dispatches the slide for display on the indicated display screen; and retrieves a next slide for display in the preview window. In addition to the display on the separate screens, the presentation control interface simultaneously displays, in separate sub-windows, on the center display screen the slide from the right side, the slide from the left side, and the next presentation slide to be dispatched. From this center display screen either slide can be selected and annotated so as to modify the presentation in real-time.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one schooled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention.","Various embodiments of the present invention are presented and discussed below. In particular, many embodiments are described in reference to the specific environment of instructional or training presentations. This specific environment is helpful in describing many of the aspects of the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to only this specific environment, but rather contemplates within its scope other presentation environments in which multiple screens and dynamic annotation capability are beneficial.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","106","106","122","104","104","116","106","106"],"i":"b "},"The computer system  also includes separate video outputs , that respectively provide video output to the left-hand projector and right-hand projector . The video output can be SVGA formatted video signals as well as other conventional video formats. Within the present description, the left\/right hand convention is from the perspective of the presenter. The video data that is output over each of the video outputs , is determined by the presenter using the interface . Using the interface , the presenter retrieves presentation material from storage (not shown) accessible by the computer system  and then directs that material to one, or both, of the video outputs , . The projectors , then display the respective presentation materials on a respective screen , ","The video outputs , , in addition to being directed to projectors , , also are directed via respective paths , to touch-screen monitors , . In practice, the monitors , would be located near the presenter while the screens , would be located for convenient viewing by an audience receiving the presentation. Each of the touch-screen monitors , are connected to the computer system . In , these connections , are depicted as serial connections, but other functionally equivalent feedback connection paths are contemplated by the present invention as well. These connection paths can be other types of input\/output protocols and hardware and are not limited to RS-232 serial communication paths. The connections , are used to provide feedback from a respective touch-screen monitor , that indicates any tactile interaction that may be taking place with the monitors , . While  depicts an exemplary stylus , for each monitor , , tactile interaction with the monitors , can occur using the same stylus or even no stylus at all.","The interface  can be controlled using a keyboard, mouse or other input device connected to the computer . However, to provide the presenter some flexibility in movement and location around a room, a remote control device  is also connected to the computer system  to control the interface  as well. This remote control device  could include a transmitter (and receiver on the computer ) that utilizes USB, FireWire, IrDA, serial or many other types of input\/output conventions to connect with the computer . Additionally, the display device  can also be a touch-screen device that allows the presenter to control the presentation using tactile initiated commands and such a device will need its own feedback path .","Within the exemplary presentation system  of , the computer system  controls the operation of the presentation by concurrently executing: a) a presentation interface  that is used to retrieve and direct (or dispatch) presentation materials to one of two video outputs , ; b) an annotation tool for the left-hand screen that receives tactile feedback from a touch-screen monitor and adjusts the video output accordingly; and c) an annotation tool for the right-hand screen that receives tactile feedback from a touch-screen monitor and adjusts the video output accordingly.","Within the embodiment just described, as well as other embodiments described herein, the exemplary components are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. For example, the touch-screen monitors , can include LCD display panels or other types of displays; and the computer  does not necessarily have to be physically located with the other components but can be connected through network or other longer-range cabling techniques to the various other components of the presentation system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","240","212","238","234","200","204","204"]},"Within this embodiment, as compared to system , additional video displays are possible and a video switch  is used to provide additional functionality. However, because many aspects of the system  are similar to those of the system  of , detailed explanation of some features are not repeated when describing .","The system  includes a computer  used by a presenter to provide a multi-screen presentation to an audience using left  and right  projectors. The presenter has available three monitors: a left screen monitor  which shows the material being presented from the left projector , a right screen monitor  which shows the material being presented from the right projector , and the center monitor  which provides a graphical user interface to the presentation software application running on the computer .","In the exemplary system , there is also a demonstration computer , demonstration monitor , and video splitter . The video splitter  provides the video output  from the demonstration computer  to both the demonstration monitor  and the video switch . The demonstration computer  is typically under the control of the presenter and can be used to create simulations and other demonstrations that further augment or explain the presentation materials being viewed by an audience. Consequently, the graphical user interface also allows the presenter to direct the video output of the demonstration computer  to one of the projectors ,  so that the audience has the benefit of the simulations and demonstrations.","The video switch  is a conventional video switch as is known to one of ordinary skill and can be controlled to direct a data signal received at one of its inputs to one or more of its data outputs. As shown, the video switch  receives at least three video signals: a)  (from the computer ); b)  (from the computer ); and c)  (from the demonstration computer  via the video splitter ). Depending on the settings of the video switch , these various input signals are then directed to one or more of the following outputs: a)  (the left projector ); b)  (the left monitor ); c)  (the right projector ); and d)  (the right monitor ).","Similar to the system  described before, the system  of  provides a presentation system that allows a presenter to use a graphical user interface that executes on computer  and displays on the center monitor . This user interface permits the presenter to retrieve presentation materials, preview them on the center monitor  and then dispatch the materials to either the left projector , the right projector , or both. To control what is presented to the audience, the presenter uses the interface to send materials out of one of two video outputs ,  and to configure the video switch  to direct its different video inputs to appropriate video outputs.","As shown in , the serial path  is one exemplary method for the computer  to selectably configure the video switch . In particular, using the communications link , the presenter interacts with the presentation system software to send a command from the computer  to the video switch . Based on this command, the video switch  controls the coupling between video inputs and outputs.","The right monitor , left monitor , and the center monitor  in a preferred embodiment are all touch-screen monitors. In addition, the computer  is executing three instances of an annotation tool (e.g., a software application) wherein each instance of the annotation tool allows modification or augmentation of the video data displayed on a respective one of the monitors , , . This augmented video data is overlaid onto any presentation slides that are currently being displayed. As shown in , these monitors are connected to respective inputs of the computer . The exemplary feedback paths \u2013 of  are shown as serial communication paths that provide responses to the computer  that are dependent on tactile interaction with a respective touch-screen monitor. The feedback data is routed to the appropriate instance of the annotation tools in order to appropriately adjust the video data displayed on the appropriate monitor.","In operation, the presenter will touch one monitor for example, right monitor  which brings the \u201cfocus\u201d of the operating system to the instance of the annotation tool associated with the right monitor . Using the annotation tool and the touch screen monitor  (along with its driver software), the presenter is able to draw such things as text, boxes, free-hand diagrams and other annotations that can be overlaid onto the video data that is being output by the computer  for display on the right presentation screen. Accordingly, the audience has the benefit of static presentation material that can be easily augmented in real-time in response to the individual needs of that particular audience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["204","410","414","402","408"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2"]},"In step , a list of available presentations are presented to a presenter to allow the presenter to make a selection. Once a presentation file is selected, the method continues, in step , by providing a list of the slides that comprise the selected presentation. Once the presentation file is selected, the presentation system can proceed with the later steps of displaying images under the control of the presenter. However, a preloader is one useful tool that preloads images and the accompanying data files so that they are cached prior to the start of the presentation. In operation, the preloader tool may or may not be used at the discretion of the presenter; however, use of the cached images will allow faster display of different screens as compared to performing the presentation with uncached images.","The first slide among the slides is automatically presented in a preview window, in step , so that the presenter can see what the next slide is and decide how it can best be displayed. At this point, the presenter might determine that the slide should be annotated, in step , before being displayed.","Next, in step , the method determines which of many possible alternatives the presenter selects for the display of the preview slide. For example, the presenter might select, in step , to send the preview slide to the left screen or, in step  to send the preview slide to the right screen. Alternatively, the method can include an automatic dispatch feature that refers to a preference file to determine, in step , which screen to automatically forward the preview slide to. Other display options can be selected in step , these options can include such things as blanking the left or right screen, going back one slide in the presentation, skipping the current preview slide without displaying it, jumping to a slide out of order, jumping to a slide from another presentation file, or sending a blank template to one of the display screens. The presenter can also select, in step , to display the output of a demonstration computer on either the left screen (step ) or the right screen (step ). The presenter can also elect, in step , to annotate the slide that is displayed on either the left screen (in step ) or the right screen (in step ). By annotating a slide, the presenter is able to interactively augment the presentation in a customized manner appropriate for the audience at hand. As the annotations may be useful in later slide presentations and in order to preserve annotations to more than one displayed slide, step  of the method saves any annotations for future use. Based on the presenter's selection for displaying or annotating a presentation slide, step  results in the next slide being retrieved and displayed in the preview window. Step  represents that the method then repeats itself from step  until the last slide of the presentation file is displayed. The details of this method are presented below in relation to a specific interface and software application for controlling a slide presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","204"]},"The foundation for a presentation can consist of, for example, a number of PowerPoint slides arranged together in what can be referred to as a presentation file. Other slide formats are also contemplated within the present invention. The PowerPoint files, or slide shows, and their individual frames, can be stored on the hard disk drive of the computer . For example, the presentation software can be set to look for a presentation files in a default directory such as \u201cD:\\courses\u201d. Within that directory would be a number of different presentation files that the presentation software automatically scans and displays to the presenter for selection thereof.","In one embodiment, the presentation system also permits user-defined preference data to be associated with any one of the presentation files. This preference data can take the form of preference files using a predetermined extension (e.g., \u201c.ipf\u201d) so that the presentation software can easily associate a preference file with its similarly named presentation file. In a preferred embodiment, the preference file can contain a number of entries having three fields:\n\n","Thus, a preference file could resemble:\n\n","As shown, there is no need for the slide numbers to be in numerical order, although following such a convention may prove helpful under certain circumstances. Furthermore, there is no requirement that each slide have an entry nor that each entry have data in every field.","Alternatively, the preference information can be included in slides of the presentation file itself. Using the \u201cnotes\u201d section of a PowerPoint slide, or similar features for other presentation file formats, the preference information does not need to be stored in a separate preference file but can be included within the presentation file.","The presentation software interface provides a drop-down box  that assists the presenter in selecting a presentation. In , for example, the presenter has selected a file named \u201c503-CH00US\u201d which, in one embodiment, can be meaningful and indicate that the presentation pertains to chapter 00 of lesson 503. On the hard drive this file could be stored as a PowerPoint file \u201c503-Ch00US.ppt\u201d. In a preferred embodiment, the first slide of a selected presentation is automatically displayed in the preview window .","The window  shows the 13 slides within the selected presentation file and their respective titles. One slide title  is shown as selected (as indicated by the reverse video) and this slide  is displayed in the preview window . From this window  the presenter can direct (or dispatch) the slide  to one of the video outputs of the computer .","The monitor on which the screen  is displayed can be a touch-screen monitor  but the presenter can also interact with the presentation software's interface using a keyboard or mouse in addition to tactile input.","There are three icons in screen  that determine the destination of the preview slide . The term \u201cdestination\u201d refers to which video output of computer  the slide is sent so that it is displayed on either the left or right screen. According to one embodiment, the set-up and cable connections of the video switch are configured in a predetermined manner such as that shown in . The presentation software knows of this predetermined configuration and is itself configured to provide slide to the appropriate video output based on which icon is selected by the presenter. The specific cabling connections can be different than that shown in  as long as the presentation software is configured to direct video output accordingly.","The icon  causes the presentation software to send the preview slide  to the left screen, while the icon  causes the presentation software to send the preview slide  to the right screen. If the preview slide  has a direction preference specified in an associated preferences file, then the icon  becomes active and, by selecting that icon , the presenter can send the slide to the preferred screen based on the direction preference found in the preference file. Once the preview slide  is sent to its appropriate screen for display, the presentation software automatically displays the next slide in the sequence of slides within the window . The preference tag can be overridden by using either icon  or  instead of the automatic icon . The window  is used for displaying any memory jogger text from the preference file to assist the presenter with the presentation.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, a slide's entry in the preference file can have a direction entry such as \u201cLR\u201d. This double entry will have the effect of automatically displaying the one slide on the left screen and then displaying the next slide on the right screen so that both slides appear to be displayed substantially simultaneously. As a result, the eventual new preview slide is two removed from the initial preview slide.","Slides can be selected out of sequence from the display window  and then displayed in the preview window .","The interface screen  also provides a \u201cgo-back\u201d icon  and a \u201cgo-forward\u201d icon . The icon  allows the presenter to proceed in a reverse direction in the preview window  and the icon  allows the current preview slide  to be skipped and the next slide in the presentation to be displayed in the preview window .","The icons  and , respectively, provide a left screen and right screen \u201cslide jog\u201d feature that allows a slide to appear to be slid up the display screen. This activity mimics the traditional action of a presenter who slides a view foil up on the projector so that the bottom half of the foil is emphasized. These icons act as toggles such that successive selection of the icon flips between normal presentation of a slide and \u201cjogged\u201d presentation of the slide.","In order to focus students on one screen or the other, and for additional reasons within a presentation, the presentation software interface provides icon  to blank the left display and icon  to blank the right display. Selecting either of these icons again will result in the appropriate display being \u201cunblanked\u201d.","As shown in the environment of , the video output from the demonstration computer  is provided to the video switch . The presentation software can effect the display of this video output to one of the display projectors ,  by appropriate control of the video switch  via the communications link . When the presenter wants to direct the output from the demonstration computer  to the left projector, the icon  is selected. This selection causes the presentation software to control the video switch  to display the video signal  on the left screen. Similar functionality with the right projector  is accomplished using the icon . A second selection of either of the icons ,  will restore the displayed slides to the respective screen instead of the output from the demonstration computer . A second demonstration computer can be included that takes advantage of the unused fourth input of video switch . In such an alternative, manual control of the video switch  can prove useful in selecting appropriate video signal routing.","Using the buttons , , respectively, the current slide displayed on the left or right display screen can be added to a \u201cfavorites\u201d list displayed in window . This list can be named something meaningful such as \u201cfavorites.fvt\u201d and located in the default directory \u201cD:\\courses\u201d. Other file names and locations could also be used.","In a preferred embodiment, the format of the file is:\n\n","By selecting either of the buttons  or , a new entry is appended to, or otherwise inserted into, the favorites file. In a preferred embodiment, this file is useful among different presentation files and is not specific to a particular presentation file. The presenter selects a slide from the window  similar to the manner in which a slide is selected from the window . One difference, is that the presentation software must open the referenced presentation file, extract the appropriate slide and display that in the preview window . The slide can then be dispatched to the left or right screen using the icons  and  respectively. Once the slide is dispatched, the presentation reverts back to the slide location within the original presentation file in order to select the next slide to place in the preview window .","The presentation software cooperates with three different instances of a slide annotation application (i.e., an annotation tool). The slide annotation tool can be a vector-based drawing tool that generates graphics that can be overlaid onto a presentation slide. Each of these instances of the annotation tool correspond to a different one of the monitors , , . The execution of an annotation tool instance results in an annotation toolbar being displayed on each of the different monitors , , . The annotation toolbar  associated with the annotation tool for the center monitor  is depicted at the bottom of the preview window . Using this toolbar, the presenter can annotate the slide  before it is dispatched to either the left or right display screens. Each of the left and right monitors  and  have their own associated annotation tools and similar toolbars.","The clock icon  opens a timer window that allows a presenter to select a time period and display a countdown screen that indicates remaining time within that period. This time period can reflect the time left to complete an exercise or the time left until the end of a break in the presentation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0069","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0076"},"b":"702"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0077"},"b":["704","204"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0078"},"b":"706"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0079"},"b":"708"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0080"},"b":"710"},"In a preferred embodiment, both the rectangle and ellipse tools automatically activate a text entry function so that the created shape can have text entered without requiring the selection of any additional icons.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0082"},"b":"712"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0083"},"b":"714"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0084"},"b":"716"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0085"},"b":"718"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0086"},"b":"720"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0087"},"b":"722"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0088"},"b":"724"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0089"},"b":"726"},"Annotations can be taking place on the left, right and center monitors in any particular order; therefore, in a preferred embodiment, annotations are saved every time a presenter navigates away from a presentation slide. For example, slide 14 can be displayed on the left monitor  and be annotated while slide 13 is displayed on the right monitor . If the presenter touches the right monitor , then the operating system of computer  detects that focus has now shifted to the right monitor  and any further input will be interpreted by the annotation tool associated with that monitor . The presentation software also saves any current annotations for slide  before proceeding. If the presenter then navigates back to slide , the current annotations for slide  are saved and further input is interpreted by the annotation tool associated with the left monitor .","In a preferred embodiment, the vector graphics files created by each annotation tool are stored in the \u201cC:\\courses\u201d directory. For example, as annotations are made to the slides within presentation file 409-Ch05.ppt, a directory 409-Ch05.ann can be created and populated with a file \u201cxxx\u201d wherein the \u201cxxx\u201d refers to the slide within that presentation file.","When the presentation software presents a slide in the preview window  it can automatically search for the existence of any annotation files and automatically augment the slide accordingly. As a result, annotation files can be saved and moved to another computer to augment a presentation from that computer while still utilizing the presentation slides that reside on the second computer. Also, the re-display of an annotated slide is not dependent on the display screen on which the slide was originally annotated. For example, a slide displayed and annotated while on the right display screen can be later recalled for display and dispatched to the left display screen and any previous annotations will be displayed on the left display screen without any need for modification.","Returning briefly to the interface screen  of , there are two complementary icons  and . These icons, respectively, start a blank slide on the left and right display screens. This blank slide can then be annotated as desired. In a preferred embodiment, a dialog box appears that asks for a name for the blank slide and can provide a suggested default name as well. If the newly named slide is not saved as a favorite, then it will be deleted upon ending the current presentation. If it is saved, then it will be available for recall later. In a similar manner, individual slides may be created and copied into the \u201cC:\\courses\u201d directory and manually added to the favorites file. In this manner, additional, extrinsic slides that augment a presentation file can easily be made available for selection and display during a pre-scripted presentation.","The presentation system is not limited to presenting viewable content from only a single document file format. The presentation system, for example, can work with two or more different document file formats such as PowerPoint presentations and Adobe Acrobat PDF files. In a preferred embodiment, the PowerPoint presentations are used to deliver screens of information in landscape layout, while Acrobat files display information from portrait layout paginated documents.","According to this embodiment, both the PowerPoint and Acrobat presentations can be treated in exactly the same way by the presentation system, including the incorporation of any annotation files associated with each screen of the document being displayed. Because of the aspect ratio difference between landscape and portrait documents, there may be instances in which only two-thirds of a portrait-mode page (e.g., an Acrobat page) is displayed on each screen and projector. The \u2018nudge up\u2019 buttons ,  on the interface  are used to make the lower two-thirds of an Acrobat page visible.","The functionality and benefits of the \u201cfavorites\u201d mechanism remain the same for either PowerPoint or Acrobat pages, as both formats can be saved and then recalled for display on any display screen , , .","An exemplary remote control  of  is shown in more detail in  as element . For example, the remote control  can connect to the computer  using an input\/output port that is not being used by another component of the system . The remote control does not need to have the entire tool suite that is shown in  but rather can include a button  for automatically advancing a slide; a button  for skipping the current preview slide; a button  for sending the preview slide to the right screen; a button  for blanking\/unblanking the right screen; a button  for blanking\/unblanking the left screen; and a button  for sending the preview slide to the left screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0098"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 9"],"b":["900","100","200"]},"In , the computer  controls the data flows and presentation materials used by the other components. This computer  includes a communications port  for interfacing with input devices such as trackball, keyboards (standard or miniature) and mice. The computer  provides a graphical user interface, via the video port , on the touch screen  to assist a presenter or instructor in controlling a presentation. The communications port  receives feedback from the touch screen  such as provided by a stylus.","While any conventional touch screen terminal can be used, an exemplary touch screen  is the 18-inch Wacom Cintiq computer-aided design terminal. This particular terminal includes a tailored stylus that allows a user to rest their hand on the display screen while writing. This functionality improves the accuracy of annotation.","Video ports  and  provide the video output for display on the right and left projectors , . As described earlier, the presentation system alternates or otherwise controls the electronic display of information by directing display screens to a particular projector under the control of a presenter using the graphical user interface provided on touch screen .","As other video sources  may be occasionally displayed on either projector  or , the video outputs from the ports  and  are routed through a video switch  that is controlled via signals from a port  on the computer . Thus, using the graphical user interface to produce control signals from the port , the presenter can control the directing of slides from video ports  and  as well as control the selection and deselection of alternate video signals from sources .","Although the video switch  is depicted as a single n\u00d72 video switch (i.e., having n inputs and 2 outputs), other configurations, such as a pair of 2\u00d71 switches, could also be used. Alternatively, the switch  can be omitted if the projectors  and  have multiple input ports. In this alternative, the control signal from port  would directly control the appropriate projector to display a selected input.","One significant difference between the system  of  and the earlier-described systems is that a single touch screen  is used instead of a center display  and left and right displays , .

Of course, other functionally equivalent toolbars, screen layout, icon labels, and features are contemplated within additional embodiments of the present invention.","There is much similarity between the tools and facilities available in the alternative presentation system of  and those described and explained with respect to . However, in the alternative arrangement, there is preferably one touch screen for controlling the three video outputs. Thus, a presenter switches form image to image on the touch screen rather than annotating three separate touch screens.","A typical use of this system would start with selecting the \u201cChapter\u201d button to load a chapter of multiple screens for presentation. Using the instructor screen as the control interface for the presentation application, pages are sent alternately left and right using the left and right buttons of the toolbar. Alternatively, default preferences could be stored that automatically control how the screens are directed for presentation. To annotate a particular projected image, the annotation tools can be used on the smaller display windows found on the instructor screen interface of . Alternatively, should the presenter select one of the current projector screens (by clicking on the window or using the tab button), then the corresponding left or right screen image is magnified to nearly fill the touch screen area as shown in . This allows annotation to be applied much more accurately to the magnified window. Once any annotation is completed, clicking on the \u201cInstructor Screen\u201d tab will cause the composite, multi-windowed instructor screen to reappear so that the presentation can continue.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0113"},"figref":["FIGS. 12","FIG. 1","FIG. 9","FIGS. 12\u201314"],"b":["13","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0114"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":["1210","1204","1206","1208"]},"In the particular situation depicted in , known as split-screen mode, a current slide is displayed on both the left-hand and right-hand screens.
