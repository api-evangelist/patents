{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure is generally related to processing images.","Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful computing devices. For example, there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices, including wireless computing devices, such as portable wireless telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and paging devices that are small, lightweight, and easily carried by users. More specifically, portable wireless telephones, such as cellular telephones and internet protocol (IP) telephones, can communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further, many such wireless telephones include other types of devices that are incorporated therein. For example, a wireless telephone can also include a digital still camera and a digital video camera. Also, such wireless telephones can process executable instructions, including software applications, such as a web browser application, that can be used to access the Internet. As such, these wireless telephones can include significant computing capabilities.","A user of a portable photographic device (e.g., a wireless phone with a camera) may have preferences with regard to one or more display variables. For instance, the user may have a tolerance limit of blurriness, darkness, contrast, etc. It would be advantageous to incorporate the user's preferences into image display by the device.","A photo viewing application enables viewing and editing of an image that has been captured and stored at a portable electronic device. The photo viewing application has hooks to an image processing pipeline of the portable electronic device so that the image processing pipeline can be tuned based on user input received via the photo viewer application. For example, the photo viewing application may provide a series of interactive screens to the user to determine one or more characteristics of the image, such as a memory color saturation or an overall image sharpness or blurriness that a user may adjust. Adjusted values of image processing parameters may be stored and used by the image processing pipeline during processing of subsequent images that are captured at the portable electronic device.","In a particular embodiment, a method of processing image data is disclosed. The method includes receiving a selection of a first image from a plurality of images stored at a memory device and displaying the first image. The method also includes receiving image modification data to modify processing of the first image displayed and providing to an image processor an adjusted value of an image processing parameter. The adjusted value of the image processing parameter is determined based at least in part on the image modification data.","In another particular embodiment, an apparatus is disclosed and includes a processor and a memory accessible to the processor. The memory includes a photo album module executable by the processor to receive a selection via a graphical user interface (GUI) of a first image selected from a plurality of images stored at the memory and to retrieve the selection from the memory. The apparatus also includes an interface module executable by the processor to display the first image at a display device and an image processing module executable by the processor to receive image modification data to modify processing of the first image and to provide to the processor an adjusted value of an image processing parameter. The adjusted value of the image processing parameter is based at least in part on the image modification data.","In another particular embodiment, a computer readable medium storing computer executable code is disclosed and includes code for receiving a selection via a graphical user interface (GUI) of a first image from a plurality of images stored at a memory device. The computer readable medium also stores code for displaying the first image, code for receiving image modification data to modify the first image, and code for providing an adjusted value of an image processing parameter to an image processor. The adjusted value of the image processing parameter is determined based at least in part on the image modification data.","In another particular embodiment, an apparatus is disclosed and includes means for receiving a selection via a graphical user interface (GUI) of a first image selected from a plurality of images stored at a memory device and display means for displaying the first image at a display device. The apparatus also includes update means for receiving first image modification data to modify processing of the first image prior to displaying a first modified image that is based on the first image and for providing a first adjusted value of a first image processing parameter to an image processor. The first adjusted value of the first image processing parameter is based at least in part on the first image modification data.","One particular advantage provided by at least one of the disclosed embodiments is that an image processing pipeline can be tuned by a user. Subjective image processing parameters, such as face blurriness and memory color enhancement, may be adjusted to satisfy a user's personal preference and applied to subsequent image capture operations. An image capture and viewing experience of the user may therefore be enhanced.","Other aspects, advantages, and features of the present disclosure will become apparent after review of the entire application, including the following sections: Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, and the Claims.","Referring to , a particular embodiment of a system to capture, process, and display images and is depicted and generally designated . The system  includes an image capture device  and a user interface  coupled to a central processing unit . The central processing unit  is coupled to a memory  and may be configured to communicate with a service provider . The central processing unit  includes a photo album application  that includes an image editor. The photo album application  may be pre-installed or may be acquired from a third party source that may be accessed via e.g., wireless access, wired access such as by Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, or via another means of access. The central processing unit  also includes an image processing pipeline  that can be tuned in response to user interaction with a stored image via the photo album application .","In a particular embodiment, the image capture device  includes a focusing module , a lens , a sensor , and an exposure module . The focusing module  and the exposure module  may be operative to adjust a focus condition of the lens  and an exposure for an image capture operation at the sensor . The sensor  is configured to detect incoming light and to provide image data to the image processing pipeline .","The user interface  includes a display device and an input device (not shown), such as a touchscreen or one or more physical navigation and selection devices, as illustrative examples. The user interface  is configured to receive image display data  and to display a corresponding image . The user interface  may also be configured to enable user interaction via the input device with one or more graphical user interface (GUI) elements , such as a menu  of selectable image processing parameters and an adjustable control , illustrated as a slider control, to adjust a value of a selected parameter.","The central processing unit  implements the photo album application  and the image processing pipeline . The photo album application  may interact with an application programming interface (API) that enables interaction with the image processing pipeline . The central processing unit  may include one or more processing devices (not shown), such as one or more general purpose processors, digital signal processors, image processors, or any combination thereof. The central processing unit  may also be configured to control communication of the image display data  to the user interface  and to receive image data, such as image modification data , from the user interface  in response to user input. The central processing unit  may also be configured to control file storage and retrieval operations at the memory .","The image processing pipeline  is configured to receive captured image data from the image capture device  and to provide processed image data for storage at the memory , illustrated as a first data file corresponding to a first image , a second data file corresponding to a second image , and a third data file corresponding to a third image . The image processing pipeline  includes multiple image processing modules, such as a representative first image processing module  and Nth image processing module . In a particular embodiment, each image processing module may be implemented as dedicated circuitry configured to perform one or more processing operations on incoming image data and to provide output image data to a next processing module. In other embodiments, one or more modules may be implemented by a processor executing instructions to perform the corresponding processing operation. The image processing modules may apply general image adjustments such as a black level subtraction, a lens correction, or one or more channel gains, while other image processing modules may apply region-of-interest specific adjustments, such as a memory color enhancement or face blurriness detection.","One or more of the image processing modules ,  may read a value of a corresponding image processing parameter, which may be stored in dedicated memory cells, registers, on-chip random access memory (RAM), the memory , or any combination thereof. As illustrated, the first image processing module  is responsive to a default value of a first image processing parameter  and the Nth image processing module  is responsive to a default value of an Nth image processing parameter . For example, a channel gain module may read multiple gain values corresponding to multiple color channels of the image data, while a memory color enhancement module may read one or more saturation gain values to be applied to detected memory color regions of the image data.","During operation, the image capture device  may perform an image capture operation of a first image to generate image data that is sent to the image processing pipeline . The image processing pipeline  may process the received image data using the image modules ,  and the default values of the image processing parameters , . The processed image data may be stored in the memory  as the first data file for the first image . A second image capture operation of a second image may be performed in a similar manner to generate the second data file for the second image .","The photo album application  may be launched in response to user input via the user interface . The photo album application  may provide to the user interface  a list or menu of a plurality of images that are stored at the memory . A user selection of the first image may be received from the user interface  and provided to the photo album application . In response, image data from the first data file for the first image  may be read and provided for display at the user interface .","Upon viewing the displayed image, a user may determine that one or more adjustments would be preferable. For example, the user may decide that a sky region of the image should be more vibrant or have a richer blue color. The user may select an option to launch the image editor of the photo album application  and select an option to adjust the blue sky saturation parameter, such as by selecting a corresponding option of the menu . In response, the adjustable control  may be displayed to enable the user to make adjustments to the displayed image. In a particular illustrative embodiment, a predetermined order of parameter adjustments is imposed within the menu , allowing the user to make adjustments to several parameters if executed according to the predetermined order. In a particular illustrative example, the user can adjust a parameter labeled parameter  after which the user can adjust another parameter labeled parameter . However, the user is prevented from adjusting the parameter  before adjusting the parameter .","The predetermined order of parameter adjustments may be based on an order of imaging processing in the image processing pipeline . For example, in an imaging pipeline in which sharpening occurs prior to skin tone correction, the user may be permitted to adjust the sharpening parameter prior to adjusting the skin tone parameter, but the user may be prevented from adjusting the skin tone prior to adjusting the sharpness.","A user may be permitted to make adjustments to a plurality of image parameters, and the user interface\/display device  displays the adjusted image processed according to a predetermined order associated with the imaging pipeline. For example, in a system in which the imaging pipeline processes sharpness prior to processing skin tone, when a user enters a skin tone adjustment prior to entering a sharpness adjustment, the user interface\/display device  will display a modified image in which the sharpness adjustment has been applied prior to the skin tone adjustment.","As the user interacts with the adjustable control , image modification data  is received indicating modification of the image to be displayed, and the photo album application  causes the displayed image to be adjusted accordingly. For example, the photo album  may emulate processing of a memory color enhancement module (not shown) of the image processing pipeline . As another example, the actual memory color enhancement module (not shown) may be launched to operate on the image display data .","When the user is satisfied with the changes to the image, one or more adjusted image processing parameter value(s)  may replace the corresponding default values used by the image processing pipeline . As a result, when a subsequent image capture operation is performed, the adjusted parameter value(s)  will be used. To illustrate, after the user has adjusted the sky region of the first image, a blue sky saturation gain parameter may be adjusted to have a larger default value. Subsequently, when a third image capture operation of a third image is performed, and the image processing pipeline  identifies the third image as having a blue sky region, the larger default gain value will be applied and the resulting image data will saved at the memory as the third image data file for the third image .","In this manner, a user may tune the image processing pipeline  to the user's particular preference. To increase a likelihood that the user will converge to a preferred set of parameter values that are satisfactory to the user, one or more tests or confirmations may be performed prior to committing image processing parameter changes, such as will be discussed with respect to . The history of user changes to the image processing parameters may be maintained and provided as a parameter change history  to the service provider , such as via a wireless or wireline network. The service provider  may aggregate change history data from multiple devices for use in future designs, updates, or statistical analyses. In addition, the history of changes applied to the system  may be stored at the system  and used in case the user decides to undo one or more changes or to restore the original default parameters that were provided with the system .","Although the photo album application  is described as enabling tuning of the image processing pipeline  based on user feedback to stored images, in other embodiments one or more modules or operations of the image processing pipeline  may be adjusted in a similar manner during an image preview operation prior to a captured image being stored at the memory . In a particular embodiment, the adjusted parameter value(s)  may be applied to modify one or more images stored at the memory  in place of, or in addition to, being used to update the image processing pipeline .","Referring to , a particular embodiment of a system to capture, process, and display images and is depicted and generally designated . The system  includes an image capture device  and a user interface  coupled to a processing unit . The processing unit  is coupled to a memory . The memory  includes a photo album module  and an interface and image editing module  that enable tuning of an image processing pipeline that is implemented via an image processing module . The system  can be implemented into a single apparatus such as a camera or phone. In a particular embodiment, the image capture device , the user interface , the processing unit , and the memory  correspond to the image capture device , the user interface , the central processing unit , and the memory  of , respectively.","In a particular embodiment, the processing unit  includes one or more hardware processors, such as a general purpose processor  and an image processor . The general purpose processor  and the image processor  may be configured to execute sets of program instructions such as modules that are stored at and retrieved from the memory . For example, the general purpose processor  may execute the photo album module  and the image processor  may execute the image processing module .","The memory  is a tangible storage device that stores a plurality of image files , executable modules , and parameter data . The image files  can include a first representative image file , a second representative image file , and a third representative image file . One or more of the plurality of image files  may correspond to images that were captured by the image capture device  and processed at the processing unit  prior to storage at the memory .","In a particular embodiment, images captured by the image capture device  are stored as Joint Photographic Experts Group Opeg) format files and are associated with a corresponding exchangeable image file format (EXIF) tag, such as the representative EXIF tag  associated with the first image file . The EXIF tag  can include data values representative of various conditions under which a first image was captured or processed. For example, the EXIF tag  can include data indicating whether the first image was taken by the image capture device , a white balance, exposure index, and other conventional or custom parameters associated with the first image. The EXIF tag  enables images taken under similar conditions or having similar characteristics to be easily located at the memory .","The executable modules  include the photo album module , the interface and photo editing module , the image processing module , a parameter value comparison module , and a stored image count module . When executed at the processing unit , one or more of the executable modules  may access a portion of the parameter data , such as a parameter change history , one or more factory default parameter values , a count threshold , one or more default image processing parameter values , or any combination thereof.","The photo album module  may be executable by the processing unit  to enable a user to select an image from the plurality of image files  via the user interface . The photo album module  may be executable to receive a selection of an image, such as the first image corresponding to the first image file , to retrieve the selection from the memory , and to provide image data to the interface and photo editing module  for display.","The interface and photo editing module  may be executable by the processing unit  to display an image at a display device of the user interface  based on received image data, such as image data that is provided by the photo album module . The interface and photo editing module  may also be executable to provide one or more graphical controls at the user interface  to enable a user to conduct image editing operations of a displayed image.","The interface and photo editing module  may be responsive to a selection from the user interface  to adjust one or more image processing parameter values based on user modifications to the displayed image in a manner similar to the operation of the photo album application with image editor  of . For example, the interface and photo editing module  may receive a selection of an image processing parameter that the user wishes to modify. In response, the interface and photo editing module  may display an adjustable control, such as the adjustable control  of . Manipulation of the adjustable control may be received by the interface and photo editing module  as image modification data and in response the interface and photo editing module  may provide an adjusted parameter value to the processing unit  to be applied to the displayed image. The image processing module  may be executed to generate modified image data in accordance with the adjusted parameter value. The interface and photo editing module  may display the modified image data at the display device so that the user can observe an effect of manipulating the control on the displayed image.","The image processing module  may be executable to apply various image processing operations to received image data. The image processing module  may include various sub-modules, such as a parameter adjustment module , general image processing modules , and region of interest processing modules . The general image processing modules  may be executable to perform one or more operations such as black level subtraction, lens geometric distortion correction, lens rolloff correction, channel gains, luma adaptation, hue, saturation, intensity, sharpening, and adaptive spatial filtering. One or more of the general image processing modules  may operate based on corresponding values of the default parameter values .","The region of interest modules  may be executable to perform operations at particular regions of interest within an image. For example, a face blurriness detection module  may be executable to detect one or more face regions within an image and to perform an edge detection operation and to alert a user when the face region is determined to be undesirably blurry. To illustrate, the face blurriness detection module  may compare a ratio of a number of soft edges within the face to a number of hard edges within the face and to compare the ratio to a threshold value from the default parameter values . A memory color module  may be executable to locate one or more regions within the image that correspond to skin, foliage, sky, or white regions. The memory color module  may perform a skin tone enhancement operation to apply a gain to skin tone saturation in the detected skin regions, a blue sky enhancement operation to apply a gain to a blue saturation in the detected sky regions, a green foliage enhancement operation to apply a gain to green saturation in the detected foliage regions, a chroma suppression operation to reduce a chroma component in the detected white regions, or any combination thereof One or more of the face blurriness threshold value, the memory color saturation gain values, or values used by the chroma suppression operation may be stored with the default parameter values .","The image processing module  may be executable to apply one or more of the general image processing modules  and the region of interest processing modules  to image data received from the image capture device  to function as an image processing pipeline, such as the image processing pipeline  of . Alternatively, or in addition, one or more of the modules  and  may be selectively executed, such as in response to user input to adjust the default parameter values  via the interface and image editing module .","The parameter adjustment module  may be executable to apply one or more tests or conditions prior to committing a requested change to the default parameter values . For example, the parameter adjustment module  may provide an adjusted parameter value to the parameter value comparison module  to determine whether a history of changes to the parameter value is converging. As another example, the parameter adjustment module  may prevent a change to the default parameter value when the stored image count module  indicates that an insufficient number of comparison images are stored to adequately demonstrate to a user the effect of applying the change to previously saved images.","The parameter value comparison module  may be executable to compare an adjusted parameter value to a history of changes to the parameter value. The parameter value comparison module  may locate first, second, and third adjusted values of the parameter in the parameter change history . The parameter value comparison module  can determine if the variance among the values of the image processing parameter associated with the viewed images is within an acceptable value. When the variance exceeds the acceptable value, the image processing parameter value comparison module  may generate a result indicating that the change history of the parameter suggests that the user is not converging to a preferred value of the image processing parameter. In response, the user may be prompted to restore the image processing parameter to a factory default value or to a prior adjusted value. For example the parameter value comparison module  may compare a first adjusted value of a first image processing parameter with a second adjusted value of the first image processing parameter, compare the first adjusted value of the first image processing parameter with a third adjusted value of the first image processing parameter, and provide a warning in response to determining that the first adjusted value is substantially equal to the second adjusted value, or that the first adjusted value is substantially equal to the third adjusted value.","The stored image count module  may be executable to locate images within the plurality of image files  that were taken by the image capture device  and that would be affected by an adjusted parameter value. For example, when the adjusted parameter is the threshold value for the face blurriness detection operation , the stored image count module  may locate stored images that were not previously flagged as blurry but would be flagged as blurry if the adjusted parameter value were applied. As another example, when the adjusted value is a memory color saturation value, such as skin tone saturation, the stored image count module  may locate stored images taken with the same white balance and exposure as a current image (such as a displayed image), as well as any other applicable parameters used to determine how to find and modify the particular memory color. As another example, the stored image count module  may locate stored images substantially matching the current image's luma level and overall high-frequency component when an adaptive spatial filtering parameter value is being adjusted.","The stored image count module  may compare the number of stored images with similar characteristics that have been located to the count threshold , which may have different values for the different processing parameters. When the number of located images do not meet the count threshold  for the adjusted parameter, a message may be generated indicating that an insufficient number of comparison images were located to demonstrate the effects of the change to the user.","During operation, the system  may apply the various executable modules  to enable a user to tune various image processing operations while verifying that changes are responsibly applied and reversible or returnable to factory default settings. For example, a user may elect to view stored images via a selection at the user interface . The user may select a particular image to view via the photo album module , which may call the interface and photo imaging module . The user may decide that the displayed image is not satisfactory, and may select an option via the user interface  that causes the interface and photo imaging module  to walk the user through a number of options to determine which aspects of the image can be improved.","The interface and photo imaging module  may present a series of options to guide the user through various regions of interest. For example, the image processing module  may launch the face blurriness detection module  to locate one or more face regions in the image. For every face located in the image, the face may be displayed to the user and the user may be queried as to whether the face was too blurry and should have been flagged at the time of image capture, so that user could have retaken the picture. The images of the faces can be scaled based on a horizontal resolution of the display at the user interface  relative to a common display resolution, such as 1280 pixels for a conventional personal computer display. For example, when the system  is a portable device such as a phone with a 320 pixel horizontal resolution, each face may be scaled by a factor of four to emulate a sharpness of resolution that the user will experience after downloading the picture to a home computer.","If the user indicates that the a face is too blurry, the stored image count module  may be launched to determine whether a sufficient number of pictures stored at the memory  would be affected if the face blurriness threshold were to be reduced to a next incremental value. If so, the user may be presented with a sample, or all, of the faces of each of the located images, scaled according to the display resolution, and the user may be informed that each of the presented faces would have triggered a face blurriness warning at the new threshold value. The user may then indicate whether to implement the change or maintain the default value via a selection at the user interface .","Next, the image processing module  may launch the memory color module  to locate one or more skin tone regions in the image. The interface and photo editing module  may provide an adjustable control to change a saturation in the skin tone regions. If the user selects an adjusted value of the skin tone saturation, the stored image count module  may be launched to determine whether a sufficient number of pictures stored at the memory  have skin regions for the same white balance and exposure as the current image, as well as for any other parameters used to determine how to find and modify skin tone regions, and avoiding pictures at low light level or D65 for pictures taken under tungsten lighting. If a sufficient number of pictures are located, the user may be presented with a series of the located images showing an effect of the change to those images. For each located image, the original image may be displayed side-by-side with an adjusted image using modified image data generated by the memory color module  using the adjusted parameter. Based on user input, the change to the skin tone saturation may be accepted by the user or discarded. The process for evaluating changes to the skin tone region may be repeated for foliage, blue sky, and chroma suppression.","After evaluating the detected memory color regions, a check may be performed as to whether the image is over- or under-sharpened based on an adaptive spatial filtering algorithm. If the user elects to modify the sharpening, the memory  is searched for stored images having the same luma value and similar high-frequency components. A stored image may be displayed side-by-side with a modified version of the stored image that has been modified according to the proposed adjustment. The interface and photo editing module  may prompt the user with a message such as \u201cThis image was also sharpened the same amount due to similar characteristics. Are you still sure you want to change the camera's default setting? If this image is too \u2018noisy,\u2019 then we do not recommend changing this camera setting.\u201d The process may repeat for one or more additional image processing operations that may be adjusted.","If the user elects to make a change to any of the parameter values when the stored image count module  does not locate enough similar images to meet the count threshold , the user may be prevented from committing the change until a later time when enough pictures are available to demonstrate the effects of the change to the user. Alternatively, the user may be presented with a warning such as \u201cNormally we would show you several other pictures that would be changed had they been taken with this new setting, but you have not taken enough pictures yet. We recommend you wait until there are more pictures in the database before making this change.\u201d","Referring to , a particular illustrative embodiment of a system to capture, process, and display images is disclosed and generally designated .
