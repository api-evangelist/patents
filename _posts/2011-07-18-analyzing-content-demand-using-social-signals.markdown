title: Analyzing content demand using social signals
abstract: Software at an online contributor website receives a list of websites having online publications. The software gathers counts of user signals for each online publication on each of the websites on the list. And the software determines content descriptors for each of the online publications. The software then counts the online publications at each website associated with each of the content descriptors and counts the user signals at each website associated with each content descriptor. The software displays the content descriptors for each website in a graphic in a graphical user interface, where the size of each content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of online publications associated with the content descriptor and where the color of each content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of user signals associated with the content descriptor.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In order to attract audience and effectively compete, editors of websites hosting online publications often apply a content strategy that addresses questions such as the following: What should we write about? How many articles should we publish per day? How should we allocate resources between competing stories? Which stories should we promote? In the context of online publishing, content strategy also typically involves search engine optimization (SEO), e.g., using keywords in online publications that will result in high rankings in search results returned by search engines.","Social media optimization (SMO) is similar to SEO, but, as its name implies, involves optimizing online publications so that they are more easily disseminated through social networking and social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, bit.ly, etc.","Recently, social networking and social media websites have added social signals (e.g., Facebook likes, Twitter tweets, and bit.ly clicks) that allow users to socially express interest in content or share content with others. These websites have also exposed application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow the tracking of social signals.","At the present time, there is a paucity of tools that use SMO or social signals to facilitate content-strategy decisions.","In an example embodiment, a processor-executed method is described for evaluating content descriptors for online publications. According to the method, software at an online contributor website receives a list of websites having online publications. The software gathers counts of user signals for each online publication on each of the websites on the list. And the software determines content descriptors for each of the online publications. The software then counts the online publications at each website associated with each content descriptor and counts the user signals at each website associated with each content descriptor. The software displays the content descriptors for each website in a graphic in a graphical user interface (GUI), where the size of each content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of online publications associated with the content descriptor and where the color of each of the content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of user signals associated with the content descriptor.","In another example embodiment, an apparatus is described, namely, a computer-readable storage medium that persistently stores a program for evaluating content descriptors for online publications. The program might be part of the software at an online contributor website. The program receives a list of websites having online publications. The program gathers counts of user signals for each online publication on each of the websites on the list. And the program determines content descriptors for each of the online publications. The program then counts the online publications at each website associated with each content descriptor and counts the user signals at each website associated with each content descriptor. The program displays the content descriptors for each website in a graphic in a GUI, where the size of each content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of online publications associated with the content descriptor and where the color of each content descriptor in the graphic reflects the count of user signals associated with the content descriptor.","Another example embodiment also involves a processor-executed method for recommending topics to editors or contributors to an online contributor network. According to the method, software at an online contributor website receives a list of websites having online publications. The software gathers counts of social signals for each online publication on each of the websites, through one or more application programming interfaces, and determines keywords for each of the online publications. The software then counts the online publications at each website associated with each keyword and counts the social signals at each website associated with each keyword. The software recommends topics to editors or contributors to an online contributor network, based on the counts.","Other aspects and advantages of the inventions will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate by way of example the principles of the inventions.","In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the example embodiments may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, process operations and implementation details have not been described in detail, if already well known.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","103","101","104","104","105","105","105"]},"Personal computer  and the servers in website  might include (1) hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors (e.g., from the x86 family or the PowerPC family), volatile storage (e.g., RAM), and persistent storage (e.g., a hard disk), and (2) an operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Windows Server, Mac OS Server, etc.) that runs on the hardware. Similarly, in an example embodiment, mobile device  might include (1) hardware consisting of one or more microprocessors (e.g., from the ARM family), volatile storage (e.g., RAM), and persistent storage (e.g., flash memory such as microSD) and (2) an operating system (e.g., Symbian OS, RIM BlackBerry OS, iPhone OS, Palm webOS, Windows Mobile, Android, Linux, etc.) that runs on the hardware.","Also in an example embodiment, personal computer  and mobile device  might each include a browser as an application program or part of an operating system. Examples of browsers that might execute on personal computer  include Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. Examples of browsers that might execute on mobile device  include Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Android Browser, and Palm webOS Browser. It will be appreciated that users (e.g., content contributors such as writers, photographers, and\/or videographers) of personal computer  and mobile device  might use browsers to communicate with software running on the servers at website . In an example embodiment, one or more of the servers at website  might execute the software described in further detail below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["104","102","103"]},"As depicted in , software running on one or more servers at website  (e.g., an online contributor network) receives a list (e.g., from a file or a user) of websites having online publications (including e.g., stories or articles consisting of text, images, audio, and\/or video), in operation . It will be appreciated that such websites might be associated with entities such as the New York Times, the BBC, NPR, The Economist, Yahoo! Sports, Fox News, CNN, TechCrunch, etc. In operation , the software collects available counts (or similar quantitative measures) of social and other user signals for each online publication on each website. As used in this disclosure, a \u201csocial signal\u201d is a user signal associated with a social (networking, media, etc.) website and includes such things as Facebook likes or comments, Twitter tweets (defined broadly to include retweets), Hacker News upvotes, bookmarking-and-sharing (e.g., using a service such as AddThis), etc. Typically, a user creates a social signal by clicking on an icon (e.g., labeled \u201cLike\u201d for Facebook or \u201cTweet\u201d for Twittter) displayed on web page (e.g., by entering a command through a GUI widget). In an example embodiment, these social signals might be collected using application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed by the social websites themselves, e.g., the Facebook (REST) API, the Facebook Graph API, the Twitter API, bit.ly API, Bebo's Social Networking API (SNAPI), OpenSocial API, etc.","As used in this disclosure, \u201cother user signals\u201d are user signals such as timed or untimed pageviews (e.g., clicking on a URL and downloading the associated web page) or bookmarking (e.g., locally storing a URL for a web page) that indicate an interest in or engagement with a webpage. In an example embodiment, counts of such other user signals might be collected from websites that make signal counts available, e.g., the pageview counts made available by BusinessInsider, Gawker Network, Forbes blogs, Change.org, BleacherReport, BuzzFeed, etc. Or such user signals might be scraped as a count directly off of a web page (e.g., by parsing HTML or another markup language). In an alternative example embodiment, the software might collect social and other user signals, rather than counts of signals, and include functionality for tallying the signals into counts. It will be appreciated that both social signals and other user signals are a form of positive relevance (or interest and\/or engagement) feedback. In the case of social signals, the relevance feedback is express. In the case of other user signals such as pageviews or bookmarks, the relevance feedback is implicit or passive.","In operation , the software determines content descriptors (e.g., keywords in a webpage's title, body, and\/or metadata or, alternatively, brands) for each online publication on each website. For each content descriptor used at a website, the software counts the number of online publications at the website associated with the content descriptor and the number of social and\/or other user signals associated with those online publications, in operation . The number of such online publications might be thought of as the supply associated with the content descriptor, to use an economics analogy. Continuing the analogy, the number of such social and other user signals might be thought of as the demand associated with the content descriptor. Then in operation , the software causes the content descriptors for each website to be displayed in a graphic (e.g., an interactive word cloud or heat map) in a GUI for the online contributor network. In an example embodiment, the size of a content descriptor in the graphic might reflect the count of online publications at the website associated with the content descriptor (e.g., the larger the number of publications the large the content descriptor) and the color of the content descriptor might reflect the number of social and\/or other user signals at the website associated with the content descriptor (e.g., the larger the number of social signals the more the color the content descriptor is toward the red end of the spectrum rather than the violet end of the spectrum).","As noted above, the software determines content descriptors (e.g., keywords in a webpage's title, body, and\/or metadata or, alternatively, brands) for each online publication on each website, in operation . In an example embodiment where the content descriptors are keywords, the software might determine keywords by (1) eliminating stop words using a statistical measure such as tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) or (2) all words with a low idf. Alternatively, a restricted lexicon might be applied to determine content descriptors, e.g., as described in co-owned U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2009\/0254512 which discusses Peter Anick's Prisma technology.","In operation  of the process shown in , the software counts the number of online publications at the website associated with the content descriptor. It will be appreciated that this number is a measure of the frequency of coverage associated with the content descriptor. An alternative example embodiment might use some other measure of frequency of coverage, such as the total number of instances of the content descriptor in all online publications at the website.","Also as noted above, the software causes the content descriptors for each website to be displayed in a GUI for an online contributor network, in operation . The GUI might be similar to the dashboard used by the Yahoo! Contributor Network, which suggests topics to editors and\/or contributors. As described above a graphic such as an interactive word cloud or heat map might be used for these topic suggestions Examples of word clouds are describe below. However, in an alternative example embodiment, the content descriptors might simply be displayed as text, e.g., a list of keywords. It will be appreciated that such topic suggestions might be used to facilitate keyword-oriented SEO, in an example embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["104","102","103"]},"As depicted in , software  consists of four modules: (1) a link-spotting module ; (2) a user-signal crawler ; (3) a monitoring module ; and a visualization module . In an example embodiment, the link-spotting module  might receive as an input the list of URLs (uniform resource locators) for websites (e.g., New York Times, the BBC, NPR, etc.) having online publications, as described above with respect to operation  of . The link-spotting module  might then go to each of the websites on the list and gather the URLs for the web pages at the website, which would include the URLs for web pages containing online publications. In an alternative example embodiment, the link-spotting module  might use web-page metadata to determine which web pages at a website are likely to contain online publications. Or the list of URLs received by the link-spotting module might be for web-feed links (e.g., for Really Simple Syndication or RSS feeds). In such an embodiment, the web-feed links might be input to a feed reader that is a sub-component of the link-spotting module , in order to systematically gather new links for web pages that contain online publications. Here it will be appreciated that some web-link feeds (e.g., Feedburner and Pheedo) use proxy links (or URLs) in order to measure the clicks from feed readers. Consequently, the link-spotting module might convert proxy links to original links, in an example embodiment.","In an example embodiment, the URLs for web pages containing online publications go from the link-spotting module  to (1) the user-signal crawler  and (2) the monitoring module. User-signal crawler  might use these URLs to gather social signals by calling the public APIs for entities such as Facebook, Twitter, bit.ly, etc., as described above with respect to operation  of . In an example embodiment, user-signal crawler  might also use these URLs to gather other user signals (such as pageviews) directly from associated websites or indirectly by scraping the web pages associated with the URLs.","Monitoring module  might use the URLs received from the link-spotting module  to obtain updated counts for social and other user signals for a web page over time. For example, the monitoring module might re-crawl active URLs (or links) in a database every hour and compute a delta with respect to the previous crawl. Such time studies might be used to generate statistics (e.g., average lifespan) that are valuable for making resource and placement decisions regarding online publications at a website.","In an example embodiment, other components of the software  might perform the processing described above with respect to operations  and  in  (e.g., obtaining keywords from web pages and associating the keywords with social and other user signals). Using the counts output by this processing, the visualization module  might create a GUI graphic such as an interactive word cloud or heat map for display in a browser as described above with respect to operation  in . Examples of word clouds are described below. In an example embodiment, visualization module  might employ calls to Google Chart API when creating this GUI graphic.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["401","401","402","402","402","403","401","404","404"]},"As depicted in , keyword cloud  shows keywords for online submissions at the Hacker News website. It will be appreciated that keyword cloud  might be generated by the process depicted in the flowchart in . The spectrum  in  associates colors with the number of upvotes a keyword has on Hacker News. If a keyword is associated with \u201cfew upvotes\u201d, it is at the violet end of the spectrum . If a keyword is associated with \u201ca lot of upvotes\u201d, it is at the red end of the spectrum . The scale  relates word size with the number of submissions at the website that include the keyword. If only a \u201cfew submissions\u201d include the keyword, the size of the keyword in the word cloud is \u201csmall\u201d. If \u201ca lot of submissions\u201d include the keyword, the size of the keyword in the word cloud is \u201cbig\u201d. In word cloud , the keyword associated with the most submissions is keyword , \u201chn\u201d. However, keyword  has fewer upvotes than other keywords such as \u201cgoogle\u201d.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A and 5B","FIG. 2","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"],"b":["501","502"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["601","602"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 7A through 7D","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B"],"i":"Ediscope: Social Analytics for Online News ","b":["701","702","702"]},"Normalized graph  in  shows the average social activity for an article published on the Engadget website, in the first 68 hours after the article is published. As depicted in graph , the dark-colored rectangles represent Facebook actions, the medium-colored rectangles represent Twitter tweets, and the light-colored rectangles represent bit.ly clicks (e.g., clicks on bit.ly shortened URLs contained in, for example, Twitter tweets which are limited to a predefined number of characters). It will be appreciated that the leftmost rectangles represent social signals at the time of publication and the rightmost rectangles represent social signals after 68 hours have passed. As shown in graph , average social signals for an Engadget article show a non-linear decline during the 68 hours following publication. Graph  in  shows this decline for a specific Engadget article entitled \u201cBlackberry users running out of loyalty\u201d.","Generally speaking, it will be appreciated that the majority (typically, over 80%) of social activity occurs during the first 24 hours after a website publishes an online publication. It will also be appreciated that this fact has implications for the content strategies employed by editors and product managers working with online publications. In particular, it appears that currently-used tactics for content promotion (e.g., web feeds, front page placements, cross-linking, etc.) mostly drive the first-day viewership\/audience. In such an environment, weekly\/analytic\/evergreen content is not sustainable. Thus, if the editors\/product managers of a website want to produce online publications with a longer lifespan, they should depart from existing content-promotion tactics by, e.g., altering front page placements to include publications that are a day or two old.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 8A through 8E","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"i":"Ediscope: Social Analytics for Online News"},"The graphs in  show the number of Facebook actions and Twitter tweets per 1000 pageviews. As depicted in graph  in , the website Forbes Blogs averages approximately 4.61 Facebook actions per 1000 pageviews for all of its articles and approximately 5.13 Facebook actions per 1000 pageviews for non-top articles (e.g., all articles except the top 10 articles). Similarly, the website \u201cForbes blogs\u201d averages approximately 9.16 Twitter tweets per 1000 pageviews for all of its articles and approximately 11.86 Twitter tweets per 1000 pageviews for non-top articles. Table  in  shows similar data in tabular form. In particular, the second rows of table  in  show the social signals (Facebook actions, Twitter tweets, and bit.ly clicks) for all and non-top articles at the website \u201cForbes blogs\u201d. Generally speaking, it appears that the articles at the websites included in table  receive approximately 10 Facebook actions or Twitter tweets per 1000 pageviews, on average. Also, with the exception of Facebook actions at Gawker, the top articles have fewer social signals per pageview than the non-top articles.","It will be appreciated that the average number of social signals per pageview might be used to detect problems with social-signal widgets on web pages. For example, if the average number of Facebook likes per pageview is 7 per 1000 for stories associated with a particular content descriptor, but a web page associated with one of those stories is only receiving 2 Facebook likes per 1000 pageviews, the markup language\/code related to the like widget on that web page might be examined to see whether the markup language\/code contains a bug.","Table  in  shows the Pearson correlation coefficient (which can range from \u22121 to 1) between social signals (Facebook actions, Twitter tweets, and bit.ly clicks) and pageviews and between other social signals. As shown in table , the website \u201cForbes blogs\u201d has the following Pearson correlation coefficients for all articles: (1) 0.35 between Facebook actions and pageviews (FB\/PV); (2) 0.4 between Twitter tweets and pageviews (TW\/PV); (3) 0.63 between bit.ly clicks and pageviews (BT\/PV); (4) 0.34 between Facebook actions and Twitter tweets (FB\/TW); and (5) 0.63 between bit.ly clicks and Twitter tweets (BT\/TW). Similarly, the website \u201cForbes blogs\u201d has the following Pearson correlation coefficients for non-top articles (excluding the top 10 articles): (1) 0.12 between Facebook actions and pageviews (FB\/PV); (2) 0.34 between Twitter tweets and pageviews (TW\/PV); (3) 0.55 between bit.ly clicks and pageviews (BT\/PV); (4) 0.31 between Facebook actions and Twitter tweets (FB\/TW); and (5) 0.56 between bit.ly clicks and Twitter tweets (BT\/TW).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 8D","FIG. 8C","FIG. 8E"],"b":["804","804","803","805","805"]},"Generally speaking, it appears that the correlation between social signals and pageviews is approximately 0.5 for non-top articles. Recall that the Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from \u22121 (perfectly negatively correlated) to 0 (totally independent) to 1 (perfectly positively correlated). Thus, a value of 0.5 means that social signals are as close to perfect correlation with pageviews as they are to total independence from pageviews. Also, it appears that in 6 cases out of 8, Twitter tweets have a higher correlation to pageviews than do Facebook actions. And bit.ly clicks appear to be better correlated with Twitter tweets than with Facebook actions.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 9"],"i":"Ediscope: Social Analytics for Online News","b":"901"},"As shown in the first row in table , the feed for the TechCrunch website generated 182 articles. The top article received 32% of the Facebook actions and 4.6% of the Twitter tweets. The top seven articles received 61.5% of the Facebook actions and 16.8% of the Twitter tweets. The rest of the articles received 38.5% of the Facebook actions and 83.2% of the Twitter tweets.","Generally speaking, it appears that approximately 65% of Facebook actions and 25% of Twitter tweets are received by the top seven stories. That is to say, Facebook activity appears much more heavy-headed (as opposed to heavy-tailed) in terms of distribution than Twitter activity. Also, the website Yahoo! Upshot is the most heavy-headed blog in table . Approximately 40% of the Twitter tweets and approximately 25% of the Facebook actions are received by articles outside of the top seven articles, suggesting that the readership is not dedicated but rather reacts to story promotion. The website AllThingsD is also fairly heavy-headed, whereas the website Mashable and the website Wired appear to be heavy-tailed. At both the Mashable website and the Wired website, over 50% of Facebook actions and over 75% of the Twitter tweets are received by stories outside of the top 7 stories.","With the above embodiments in mind, it should be understood that the inventions might employ various computer-implemented operations involving data stored in computer systems.
