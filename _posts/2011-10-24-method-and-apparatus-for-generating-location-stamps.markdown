One area of interest is the development of location stamps for use in association with content such as documents, pictures, videos, audio files, messages, etc. Location stamps are typically used to provide location details regarding the content or to specify a particular point-of-interest corresponding to the location. Various location determination approaches may be used to determine the location details, including, internet protocol (IP) address lookup, browser based geolocation reporting, global positioning system (GPS) sensor detection, etc.","Unfortunately, non-mobile devices such as desktop computers are often not equipped with sensors to support more advanced detection approaches such as GPS detection. As for those devices featuring these sensors, many users disable the location detection features for privacy purposes. As an alternative, a browser or other application of the device for accessing content can identify the IP address; albeit the acquired address is not always an accurate depiction of the actual location of the device. Moreover, IP address information is often unreliable as different applications (e.g., browsers) report IP address information differently.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach for generating location stamps in response to a request from a device.","According to one embodiment, a method comprises receiving a request from a device for one or more location stamps. The method also comprises processing and\/or facilitating a processing of a hierarchy of one or more policies to determine one or more candidate location stamps in response to the request. The one or more policies cause, at least in part, a determination of the one or more candidate location stamps based, at least in part, on a cache history, a personal history, a reverse geocoding, a point-of-interest determination, a regional determination, or a combination thereof associated with the device.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises at least one processor, and at least one memory including computer program code for one or more computer programs, the at least one memory and the computer program code configured to, with the at least one processor, cause, at least in part, the apparatus to receive a request from a device for one or more location stamps. The apparatus is also caused to process and\/or facilitate a processing of a hierarchy of one or more policies to determine one or more candidate location stamps in response to the request. The one or more policies cause, at least in part, a determination of the one or more candidate location stamps based, at least in part, on a cache history, a personal history, a reverse geocoding, a point-of-interest determination, a regional determination, or a combination thereof associated with the device.","According to another embodiment, a computer-readable storage medium carries one or more sequences of one or more instructions which, when executed by one or more processors, cause, at least in part, an apparatus to receive a request from a device for one or more location stamps. The apparatus is also caused to process and\/or facilitate a processing of a hierarchy of one or more policies to determine one or more candidate location stamps in response to the request. The one or more policies cause, at least in part, a determination of the one or more candidate location stamps based, at least in part, on a cache history, a personal history, a reverse geocoding, a point-of-interest determination, a regional determination, or a combination thereof associated with the device.","According to another embodiment, an apparatus comprises means for receiving a request from a device for one or more location stamps. The apparatus also comprises means for processing and\/or facilitating a processing of a hierarchy of one or more policies to determine one or more candidate location stamps in response to the request. The one or more policies cause, at least in part, a determination of the one or more candidate location stamps based, at least in part, on a cache history, a personal history, a reverse geocoding, a point-of-interest determination, a regional determination, or a combination thereof associated with the device.","In addition, for various example embodiments of the invention, the following is applicable: a method comprising facilitating a processing of and\/or processing (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal, the (1) data and\/or (2) information and\/or (3) at least one signal based, at least in part, on (or derived at least in part from) any one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating access to at least one interface configured to allow access to at least one service, the at least one service configured to perform any one or any combination of network or service provider methods (or processes) disclosed in this application.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising facilitating creating and\/or facilitating modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based, at least in part, on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods or processes disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","For various example embodiments of the invention, the following is also applicable: a method comprising creating and\/or modifying (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality, the (1) at least one device user interface element and\/or (2) at least one device user interface functionality based at least in part on data and\/or information resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention, and\/or at least one signal resulting from one or any combination of methods (or processes) disclosed in this application as relevant to any embodiment of the invention.","In various example embodiments, the methods (or processes) can be accomplished on the service provider side or on the mobile device side or in any shared way between service provider and mobile device with actions being performed on both sides.","For various example embodiments, the following is applicable: An apparatus comprising means for performing the method of any of the claims.","Still other aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","Examples of a method, apparatus, and computer program for generating location stamps in response to a request from a device are disclosed. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","111","101","101","111","101","101","111","111","101","101"],"i":["a","n","a","n ","a","n "]},"A location stamp may include, for example, a set of data for describing a geographic location. By way of example, a location stamp may include coordinates data (e.g., longitude and latitude) or a geospatial coordinates. In addition, the location stamp may include information useful for deriving or deducing a physical location such as an internet protocol (IP) address. Typically, location stamps are associated with content capable of being generated and\/or accessed by the one or more UEs -, including documents, pictures, videos, audio files, messages, etc. As such, the stamps are generated as tags or metadata that is useful for providing location details regarding the content or to specify a particular point-of-interest for which the content is related.","Location stamps are widely used by device users for relaying location specific details regarding content. For example, a user of a mobile device with an integrated camera can generate a location stamp to be stored along with any photos they take at their favorite restaurant. Longitude and latitude coordinates of the restaurant location may be encoded as part of the (exchangeable image file format) EXIF properties of the photo. As another example, the user can post a document to a social networking site, shared storage location, or other network resource in association with a location stamp. Under this scenario, the location stamp is used as a parameter for subsequent retrieval, organizing or mining of the document. In some instances, the user creates the location stamp\u2014e.g., to convey an address, a city, a name of a venue or building\u2014by manually entering location details as one or more document property fields. While manual entry may be the most accurate means of generating a location descriptor for content, it is also tedious and time consuming for the user. This is especially true as the amount of content to be stamped increases.","In other instances, the user device may employ various location determination approaches for enabling auto-generation of a stamp, e.g., such as geotagging. Under this approach, location information is detected by way of one or more approaches by a calling application or service. Once detected, this information is then conferred to the calling application or service and used in generating a location stamp. The more accurate the location determination approach the more reliable the location stamp. Various techniques for determining the location information may include internet protocol (IP) address lookup, browser based geolocation reporting, global positioning system (GPS) sensor detection, cellular signal triangulation and Wi-Fi war driving database access. Unfortunately, these approaches tend to yield unreliable results or are limited to only select (but not all) user devices.","For example, an IP address lookup can be performed as the user accesses a communication network  via a browser application, document editor, or other tool via the device. Information derived from performing the lookup may include, for example, a hostname, country, region\/state, city, latitude, longitude, and telephone area code. Nonetheless, the IP address is related to but not necessarily representative of the actual location of the user at the moment of content access or generation. Also, because each application (e.g., browser) uses its own methodology to collect information about their networking environment, location results may vary from one application to the next. Hence, latitude and longitude coordinates as determined via one browser may vary in another. Still further, when the IP address as looked up corresponds to a proxy server or virtual private network, the actual IP address of the requesting user device cannot be found.","GPS sensor detection and cellular signal triangulation techniques require that the user device be equipped with one or more sensors, i.e., a GPS detection sensor, network detection sensor, etc. Unfortunately, non-mobile devices are not usually equipped with these sensors. Also, the information maintained in a database compiled as a result of Wi-Fi war driving is only as effective as the compilation of network locations maintained therein. However, outdated or inaccurate information can result in the return of unreliable location information to the requesting service and\/or user device.","Hence, if no latitude and longitude information can be determined via the various techniques, the user device is unable to effectively generate a reliable location stamp. Currently, there is no reliable solution for enabling a user to distinguish between: (a) a user device, such as a GPS enabled mobile phone, that knows its geolocation; and (b) a user device, such as a laptop of desktop computer, that can attempt to derive its geolocation.","To address this problem, a system  of  introduces the capability to generate one or more location stamps based on a hierarchy of one or more policies. In certain embodiments, a location stamping platform  is configured to interact with UE -to execute the one or more polices. By way of example, the policies may include various rules and settings for: (1) affecting the acquiring of location information; and (2) generating one or more location stamps based on the acquired location information. The policies are organized for execution hierarchically, so as to correspond to an order of derivation, determination and\/or generation of the one or more location stamps. In addition, the one or more location stamps are rendered to a user interface of UE -by the location stamping platform  as candidates for selection by a user in response to a request. The location stamps are also presented in accordance with the hierarchical order of execution of the one or more policies.","The hierarchy of policies corresponds to a processing scheme that accounts for various inputs. By way of example, the one or more policies include a processing of a cache history of the user device. The cache history may include stored and\/or prior used location stamps for being associated with content. In certain embodiments, the cache history is retrieved by way of an application programming interface (API) of an application that initiated a request for a location stamp. In other instances, the cache history may include the results of user searches, which can be used to provide a context for a current location stamp request (e.g., indicate or directly specify a location, points-of-interest to the user). It is noted that the cache history includes information corresponding to the current or most recent session\/activity of the user of the UE -. Still further, the cache history includes information corresponding to the current location of the UE -. The cache history is continuously updated by the location stamping platform  and cleared every time a new location of the UE  is determined.","The policies also call for the processing of personal history information related to the user, which includes previously used location stamps. In certain embodiments, the personal history information includes only those location stamps that correspond to a predetermined proximity threshold of the current location of the requesting UE . By way of example, the proximity threshold may be established as 300 meters from the current location. Under this scenario, if it is determined the device has moved to another location beyond 300 meters, the platform  is caused to clear the history. As a result, personal history information is collected relative to the generation of location stamps based on the new location. It is noted that the proximity threshold may be established by a provider of the location stamping platform  or alternatively by the user.","Another of the one or more policies calls for the execution of a reverse geocoding of location information (e.g., latitude, longitude). By way of example, the reverse geocoding is performed to render a readable address or place name. This policy execution permits the identification of nearby street addresses, places, and\/or area subdivisions such as neighborhoods, county, state, or country. It is noted the resulting address may be a high-level address, i.e., does not include a street number. This level of granularity of address information provides for a deeper level of exactness of location stamps.","A point-of-interest (POI) determination is also caused to be executed per the hierarchy of one or more policies, wherein the one or more location stamps correspond to the POIs accordingly. By way of example, the POIs may include a specific venue such as a restaurant, museum, business, landmark, park or other place corresponding to a particular location. Name information or other identification may also be associated with the location stamp for representing the POI. As such, POI based location stamps are determined to be, or fall within, range of a current location of the UE . In addition, a regional determination corresponding to a particular town may be determined per the hierarchy of one or more policies.","The location stamping platform  operates in connection with a UE -in response to a request for a location stamp. The request may be initiated by way of an application -of the UE -, such as a web browser, document editor or photo editor. In addition, the request may be initiated by way of a service available for access by the UE -, such as a social networking service, a data sharing site, or the like. Operating in connection with the application is a stamping module -, a module (optional) for enabling requests to be entered. In certain embodiments, the stamping module may also be used to facilitate a posting of content with respect to the location stamp. By way of example, the stamping module  may render a user interface for submitting a location stamp request and for facilitating the selection of one or more location stamps relative to a given location -of the user, etc. As such, the stamping module -of respective UE -may operate in tandem with the calling applications -or services for enabling the posting, publishing, accessing or sharing of content. In certain embodiments, the stamping module may also perform the equivalent executions of the location stamping platform . This includes the execution of APIs, operating system commands and web and user interface functions. Features of the stamping module -as it interacts with an application -are described more fully later on with respect to .","It is noted that the hierarchy of policies may be employed in the generation of location stamps for UE -of varying configuration. By way of example, the location stamping platform  may interact with devices having integrated sensors , such as a tablet or mobile phone with built-in GPS detection sensor(s). Alternatively, the location stamping platform  may be used in connection with more stationary devices such as, such as a laptop or desktop. When the user device is a mobile device, it can be transported to various locations -. The locations  may correspond to one or more geographic coordinates GPS detection measures. Furthermore, the one or more locations  may specify a particular place or venue. In certain embodiments, the one or more locations -may be configured to a communication network , such as by way of a router, proxy system, server or other means\u2014i.e., to enable a Wi-Fi connection. This is depicted by way of example with respect to location , which is shown as being connected to the communication network . As such, when a user of UE having a wireless detection sensor  approaches or enters the location , it may detect signals generated by the location. One or more location detection techniques, including signal triangulation, can be applied for detecting the location of the user equipment relative to the location ","While each location corresponds to a distinct set of geographic and\/or geospatial coordinates, they may be relatively close to one another. The location stamping platform  may be configured to generate one or more location stamps to account for locations  in close proximity\u2014i.e., location and . Hence, the platform  may generate and recommend location stamps based on whether a proximity threshold condition is fulfilled. For example purposes, the region  represents proximity where the location stamps are equivalent. The location stamps are different, however, outside of this region . Exceeding of the threshold may warrant generation of updated location stamps while a determined may be generated, based at least in part, in response to a proximity threshold generate location stamps support the stamping within a given proximity. In certain instances, the locations -may be within range of one another\u2014i.e., distinct restaurants next to each other, neighboring cities, etc.","As shown in , the system  comprises a user equipment (UE)  having connectivity to the location stamping platform  via a communication network . As noted previously, access to the location stamping platform  is facilitated by way of the application and stamping module . It is noted that the functionality of the stamping module  may be directly integrated into the application -for permitting network access to the location stamping platform . By way of example, the communication network  of system  includes one or more networks such as a data network, a wireless network, a telephony network, or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), a public data network (e.g., the Internet), short range wireless network, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network, and the like, or any combination thereof. In addition, the wireless network may be, for example, a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks, code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA), wireless fidelity (WiFi), wireless LAN (WLAN), Bluetooth\u00ae, Internet Protocol (IP) data casting, satellite, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), and the like, or any combination thereof.","The UE  is any type of mobile terminal, fixed terminal, or portable terminal including a mobile handset, station, unit, device, multimedia computer, multimedia tablet, Internet node, communicator, desktop computer, laptop computer, notebook computer, netbook computer, tablet computer, personal communication system (PCS) device, personal navigation device, personal digital assistants (PDAs), audio\/video player, digital camera\/camcorder, positioning device, television receiver, radio broadcast receiver, electronic book device, game device, or any combination thereof, including the accessories and peripherals of these devices, or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE  can support any type of interface to the user (such as \u201cwearable\u201d circuitry, etc.).","By way of example, the UE  and the location stamping platform  communicate with each other and other components of the communication network  using well known, new or still developing protocols. In this context, a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network  interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node, from generating and receiving physical signals of various types, to selecting a link for transferring those signals, to the format of information indicated by those signals, to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model.","Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises (1) header information associated with a particular protocol, and (2) payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols, the packet includes (3) trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet, its destination, the length of the payload, and other properties used by the protocol. Often, the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different, higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks, such as the Internet, typically include a physical (layer 1) header, a data-link (layer 2) header, an internetwork (layer 3) header and a transport (layer 4) header, and various application (layer 5, layer 6 and layer 7) headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["111","111","201","203","205","207","209","211","217","111","213","111","215"]},"In one embodiment, the authentication module  authenticates users and user equipment -for interaction with the location stamping platform . By way of example, the authentication module  receives a request to generate one or more location stamps based, at least in part, on location information regarding the request UE. Input is received on the basis of a registered or subscribed user. The subscription process may include a specification of data sources for sharing of experience information. In addition, various preferences and settings information may be established, including preferred points-of-interest, location of residence\/work, frequently visited locations, previously noted location stamps, etc. The subscription settings may be referenced to a specific user, user device, or combination thereof as profile data . Also, it is noted that the profile data may contain personal history information for use in generating one or more location stamps.","The authentication process performed by the module  may also include receiving and validating a login name and\/or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user (host) during a subscription or registration process with a provider of the platform . The login name and\/or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from UE  via a graphical user interface to the platform  (e.g., as enabled by user interface module ). Profile data  for respective subscribers may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively, the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as registration data with an IP address, a carrier detection signal of a user device, mobile directory number (MDN), subscriber identity module (SIM) (e.g., of a SIM card), radio frequency identifier (RFID) tag or other identifier.","Still further, the authentication module  may be configured to receive a request for initiating generation of one or more location stamps as candidates for selection by the user. This is performed pursuant to the subscription validation process. Upon receipt of a request, the authentication module  alerts the location determination module  of the request.","In one embodiment, the location determination module  determines the current location of the requesting user device based on available information. The location determination module  is also configured to activate a location detection function of the requesting device, if it is so equipped, in order to retrieve current location information accordingly. By way of example, the location determination module  performs an IP address lookup based upon the request as received from a UE, i.e., a device that is not equipped with location detection sensors. Based on the lookup, geolocation data including at least the longitude and latitude of the requesting device is determined. Under this scenario, the current stored location pursuant to the lookup is set by the location determination module  as the current location. This location information is then passed accordingly to the processing module .","As another example, the location determination module  may request current GPS coordinate data for determining the location. Under this scenario, precise location information is extracted and set as the current location. It is noted also, that the location determination module  may apply a combination of location determination approaches instead of or in addition to the above described, including cellular signal triangulation or accessing of a Wi-Fi access point database. The location determination module  returns at least a best available approximation of the current location, i.e., a basic latitude and longitude of the UE corresponding to the particular characteristics\/capabilities of the UE. By employing a combination of approaches, the location of both non-mobile and mobile devices may be more reliably determined pursuant to a request for generation of one or more location stamps. Moreover, context information may be gathered by the location determination module  for refining the location results. This includes, for example, determining a current position of the UE, gathering activity information, etc.","In one embodiment, the processing module  operates in connection with the location determination module  to process the location information based, at least in part, on a hierarchy of one or more policies . Moreover, the processing module  generates the one or more location stamps to be presented by the user interface module  as candidates for selection by a user. Generation of the location stamps by the module  is therefore based on the policies , the determined current location information and historic and\/or cached data regarding the requesting UE. The processing module  executes the policies  hierarchically, such that the order of execution corresponds to an order of derivation, determination and\/or generation of the one or more location stamps for presentment to a user. Hence, the processing module  also affects the type of location determination approach employed by the location determination module  for generating, acquiring and\/or determining location information. By way of example, the one or more policies  call for the processing module  to execute as shown with respect to Table 1 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"Location determination"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"IF (the last generated location stamp is < N units of time old) AND (the current location < M"},{"entry":"units of distance from previous location stamp);"},{"entry":"\u2002THEN use the last place stamp location"},{"entry":"\u2002ELSE use the current location"},{"entry":"Current stored location (as determined) is set to the place stamp (e.g., for non-mobile devices)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Location stamp generation"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Generate up to S location stamps based on personal history items shown (sorted by proximity"},{"entry":"to the current location or by recentness (i.e.,, newest first)"},{"entry":"Generate at least T but up to U point-of-interest location stamps sorted by proximity (i.e.,"},{"entry":"those closest to the current location first)"},{"entry":"Generate one location stamp based on the determined\/current longitude and latitude"},{"entry":"Generate one or more city-town location stamps sorted by proximity (i.e., those closest to the"},{"entry":"current location first)"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"As noted in Table 1, the policies include location determination policies as well as location stamp generation policies. In the latter portion of the policy table of Table 1, the one or more location stamps are generated. In the former, the policies are applied in conjunction with the operations of the location determination module  for affecting the acquiring and\/or determining of location information. A proximity and\/or time threshold may be established for affecting the rate of updating and\/or generating of location stamps relative to the determined current location of the UE. In certain embodiments, the user may also configure the processing module \u2014via the subscription process\u2014to restrict search results for generation of location stamps to within X units of distance (e.g., meters) from user's current position. By way of this restriction, the user is able to affect the range or scope of returned location stamp candidates","In certain embodiments, the hierarchy of one or more policies for generation of location stamps is based on the processing of the information types (by the processing module ) shown in Table 2 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"cache history information\u2014listed only while the UE is in the same location and\/or within the"},{"entry":"proximity threshold"},{"entry":"personal history information\u2014listed in increasing distance from current location; contains"},{"entry":"only places less than X units of distance from current location"},{"entry":"reverse geocoding results information\u2014listing of the high-level address (e.g. no street"},{"entry":"number) including neighborhood\/town\/city as extracted from reverse-geocoding of the current"},{"entry":"position; alternatively, point-of-interest data (e.g., POI 1) may be used for extraction (e.g., to"},{"entry":"save one round-trip)."},{"entry":"point-of-interest information\u2014listed in increasing distance from the current location; may"},{"entry":"include personal history data"},{"entry":"regional determination information (e.g., town)\u2014listed in increasing distance from the current"},{"entry":"location"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"It is noted that the order of the information types as shown in the table corresponds to the order of presentment of location stamps to a user interface by the user interface module . Per this hierarchical order, default selection for a location stamp is the top listing of results generated via the cache history information. If no cache history information is relevant or available, the next selection in order of presentment is the top location stamp generated via personal history information. When no personal history information is relevant or available, next in the list is the top selection produced as a result of the reverse geocoding results information followed by the regional determination information (if deemed useful). It is noted that the reverse geocoding results information may be employed to enhance the results of location stamps generated based on regional determination information (e.g., distinguish between different locales, municipalities, provinces, or sections of a common town).","Also, per Table 2, the point-of-interest information processed by the module  may include restaurants, museums, landmarks and particular venues of interest to the user for being represented as location stamps (or place stamps). Such interests may be established as part of the subscription process via the authentication module  or determined based on known\/historical search activity of the user of the requesting UE.","Historic data for generation of the location stamps, including personal history data and cache data, may be retrieved by way of a retrieval module , in certain embodiments.
