title: Method and business process to maintain privacy in distributed recommendation systems
abstract: A distributed recommendation system and method provides greater privacy for user's private data. Tasks of a recommendation system are distributed between wireless devices and network servers, to protect end users privacy. Greater privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces is provided for Internet service usage by wireless devices. The user's wireless device sends a current context-activity pair to a network server in response to either the user's selection of an activity or automatically, while protecting the user's privacy. The user's wireless device includes a service history log. The activities stored in the service history log include past recommendations made by the network server, past services used, prestored service preferences, and special requested service requirements. Context-activity pair information sent to the server protects user privacy and can include any combination of these activities. The server responds to an appropriate recommendation. New recommendations to users are made in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/854,635, filed May 15, 2001, entitled \u201cMethod And Business Process To Maintain Privacy In Distributed Recommendation Systems\u201d, assigned to Nokia Corp.","1. Field of the Invention:","The invention disclosed broadly relates to methods for providing Internet services and more particularly relates to improvements in mobile device accessing of Internet recommendation services.","2. Background Art:","Mobile phones and wireless personal digital assistants (PDAS) are able to access the Internet using I-Mode protocol, mobile IPv6 protocol or the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). Wireless devices can now access Internet applications such as headline news, exchange rates, sports results, stock quotes, weather forecasts, multilingual phrase dictionaries, personal online calendars, online travel and banking services, or download distinctive ringing tones. Broadband wireless networks make it possible for wireless devices to exchange multimedia messages that combine conventional text with much richer content types, such as photographs, images, voice clips, and video clips. Wireless devices can be used to pay bills online using the wireless device as a virtual wallet. Wireless devices can deliver useful and informative advertising and transaction services from online merchants. Wireless devices now also provide entertainment services, such as interactive adventure games, quizzes, and chess tournaments.","Recommendation systems use information of the activity histories or preferences of numerous users to produce useful recommendations for a single user. Existing recommendation systems use collaborative filtering methods to produce recommendations for an individual user by analyzing the actions and preferences of a group of individuals. As the use of information technology has become widespread in all areas of human life, the concerns of individuals over their privacy have increased. Specifically, most distributed recommendation systems were developed for landline Internet services, and the privacy concerns will significantly increase as the services are adopted for use by more personal, wireless devices.","What is needed is a distributed recommendation system that provides greater privacy for the user's private data. What is needed is a way to distribute the tasks of a recommendation system between wireless devices and network servers in a way that protects the privacy of end users. What is needed is a way of creating greater privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces for Internet service usage by wireless devices.","The invention is a distributed recommendation system that provides enhanced privacy for the user's private data. The invention distributes the tasks of a recommendation system between wireless devices and network servers, so as to protect the privacy of end users. The invention provides enhanced privacy for context-sensitive, adaptive, user interfaces for Internet service usage by wireless devices.","The invention enables a mobile phone or wireless PDA to use context inference techniques to sense the user's environment and in response, to provide a recommendation to the user that is appropriate to the user's perceived environment.","One aspect of the invention is a method that includes the steps of receiving sensor signals characterizing a current environment of a user's wireless device; processing the sensor signals with a context inference engine; outputting a current context result from the processing by context inference engine; and providing a recommendation to the user in response to the current context result. The step of providing a recommendation is embodied as programmed instructions executed in a network server. In accordance with the invention, context-activity pair information is sent to the server without any user identification.","As the user carries about the wireless device, its sensors automatically and continuously measure the geographic location and context of the device. The wireless device periodically transmits the current context in a message over the wireless network to the network server. There are several types of messages, each of which is distinguished by its own unique op code. When the wireless device sends a message containing the current context, the network server parses the op code and responds with information corresponding to the op code, the information being related to the current context. If the op code indicates that the message is a spontaneous message which is automatically transmitted by the device, then the network server responds with information such as a service category menu or prepaid advertising of local services related to the current context.","In another aspect of the invention, the user's wireless device includes a service history log. The activities stored in the service history log are divided into two major categories: past recommendations made by the network server and services. The category of services is broken into three sub-categories: past services used, prestored service preferences, and special requested service requirements. The term \u201cactivities\u201d refers to any of these four categories and sub-categories. The service history log stores four component databases: [1] past recommendations and context, [2] past services used and context, [3] prestored service preferences, and [4] special requested service requirements. Context-activity pair information sent to the server can include any combination of these activities.","The wireless device can automatically send messages with a unique op code designating that the message is an automatically transmitted message containing the device's past recommendations and context or the past services used and context, in addition to the current context. The network server parses the op code and uses the device's past recommendations and context or past services used and context to find similar recommendations in its database. The network server then responds with information customized to the user's perceived interests, the information being related to the current context. The database in the network server can include recommendations that have been made in the past to other users in similar contexts. The database can also include services that have actually been used in the past by other users in similar contexts. The network server can respond to the current user with recommendations based on past recommendations made to other users and past services used by other users.","The sensor signals characterizing the current environment of the user's wireless device can be, for example, positioning signals, touch signals, audio signals, compass signals, ambient light signals, ambient temperature signals, three-axis acceleration signals, time signals, or the device's operational mode signals.","In another aspect of the invention, the step of providing a recommendation is embodied as programmed instructions executed within a separate network server in response to context-activity pair signals received from the user's wireless device. A context-activity pair database is maintained by the server which associates context-activity pair information with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database. No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database. In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the context-activity pair database grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database.","Another aspect of the invention is providing the current context-activity pair to the server in response to either the user's selection of an activity or automatically, and then receiving an appropriate recommendation from the server. In accordance with the invention, recommendations received from the server by the wireless device are filtered to identify new or significant information. The filtering can be done using statistical usage information associated with the recommendations, user ratings associated with the recommendations, or other factors distinguishing one recommendation from another.","In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the current context information accompanying the activity information sent by the wireless device to the network server, is a metadata representation of the sensor signals characterizing the current state of the wireless device. A context inference engine in the network server is embodied as programmed instructions executed within the server. Where the processing power or memory capacity of the wireless device may be limited, the network server can make a more accurate determination of the mobile user's current context. The resultant current context computed by the server and the activity information received from the wireless device constitute the current context-activity pair. The context-activity pair database maintained by the server associates current context-activity pair with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database. No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database. In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the database grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database.","The portable wireless device  of  includes a context sensitive web services feature that enables the wireless device to use context inference techniques to sense the user's environment and in response, to provide recommendations to the user that are appropriate to the user's perceived environment. The portable wireless device  offloads to the network server  of , some of the computationally intensive computing necessary in context inference techniques.  is a network diagram that shows an example relationship between the user's portable wireless device , the wireless access point , the infrastructure network , the network server , and the third party service provider  interconnected over the Internet . The portable wireless device  can be a wireless mobile telephone, pager, two-way radio, smartphone, personal communicator, wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) or the like.","As the user carries about the wireless device , its sensors automatically and continuously measure the geographic location and context of the device. The wireless device periodically transmits the current context in a message over the wireless network to the network server . There are several types of messages, each of which is distinguished by its own unique op code. When the wireless device sends a message containing the current context, the network server parses the op code and responds with information corresponding to the op code, the information being related to the current context. If the op code indicates that the message is a spontaneous message which is automatically transmitted by the device , then the network server  responds with information such as a service category menu or prepaid advertising of local services related to the current context.","In , the user's wireless device  includes a service history log . The activities stored in the service history log  are divided into two major categories: past recommendations made by the network server  and services. The category of services is broken into three sub-categories: past services used, prestored service preferences, and special requested service requirements. The term \u201cactivities\u201d, as used herein, refers to any of these four categories and sub-categories. The service history log  stores four component databases: [1] past recommendations and context, [2] past services used and context, [3] prestored service preferences, and [4] special requested service requirements. The user's wireless device  includes application programs , current context state  and recommendation algorithms . An example is shown in  of the two component databases: [1] past recommendations and context and [2] past services used and context.","The wireless device  can automatically send messages with a unique op code designating that the message is an automatically transmitted message containing the device's past recommendations and context or past services used and context, in addition to the current context. The network server parses the op code and uses the device's past recommendations and context or past services used and context to find similar recommendations in its database. The network server  then responds with information customized to the user's perceived interests, the information being related to the current context.","The user of the wireless device  can also manually enter requests for menus and recommendations related to the current context. The wireless device  then sends messages with a unique op code designating that the message is a manual request by the user containing the device's past recommendations and context or past services used and context, in addition to the current context. The network server parses the op code and uses the device's past recommendations and context or past services used and context to find similar recommendations in its database consistent with the user's manual request. The network server  then responds with information customized to the user's expressed interests, the information being related to the current context.","The service history log  can accumulate data on past services used by the user of the device  in several ways. The service history log  can be programmed to capture on-line ticket purchase information for services. The service history log  can also be programmed to monitor the dwell-time of the device at scheduled events and to draw the inference that the user is in fact attending the scheduled event. The event and the current context are then stored in the database [2] past services used and context, in the service history log .","The network  formed by the wireless device , wireless access point , and infrastructure network  can be implemented as a digital wireless wide area network (WAN), based on architectures such as Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), IS-136 TDMA-based Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service (DAMPS), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), IS-95 CDMA-based cdmaOne System, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and broadband wireless architectures such as W-CDMA and Broadband GPRS. For more information on these digital wireless, wide area network architectures, see the book by Yi-Bing Lin, et al. entitled , John Wiley & Sons, 2001. The network  can also be a short-range wireless system connected to a wide area landline infrastructure network such as the Internet . Short-range wireless systems include both wireless personal area network (\u201cPAN\u201d) and wireless local area network (\u201cLAN\u201d). Both of these networks have the common feature of operating in unlicensed portions of the radio spectrum, usually either in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band or the 5 GHz Unlicensed-National Information Infrastructure (\u201cU-NII\u201d) band. Wireless personal area networks use low cost, low power wireless devices that have a typical range of ten meters. The best-known example of wireless personal area network technology is the Bluetooth Standard, which operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It provides a peak air link speed of one Mbps and a power consumption low enough for use in personal, portable electronics such as PDAs and mobile phones. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group, , Version 1.0B, Volumes 1 and 2, December 1999, describes the principles of Bluetooth device operation and communication protocols. Wireless local area networks generally operate at higher peak speeds of from 10 to 100 Mbps and have a longer range, which requires greater power consumption. Wireless local area networks are typically used as wireless links from portable laptop computers to a wired LAN, via an access point (AP). Examples of wireless local area network technology include the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Standard and the HIPERLAN Standard, which operates in the 5 GHz U-NII band. For more information on wireless LANs, see the book by Jim Geier entitled , Macmillan Technical Publishing, 1999. The network  formed by the wireless device , wireless access point , and infrastructure network  can use a wireless communications protocol, such as the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), the I-Mode protocol, or the mobile IPv6 protocol.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","114","116","120","120","130","140","100","122","124","125","126","128","132","134","125","100","140","166","192","142","100","140","140"]},"In , the user's portable wireless device  includes the microbrowser  which displays the Recommendation Web Services menu, to enable the user to navigate through the cards or pages being displayed and to select options that are programmed by the application programs .

An example is shown in  of the two component databases: [1] past recommendations and context  and [2] past services used and context . The embodiment of the database shown in  uses extensible markup language (XML) files to provide a coherent view of the wide variety of data that can be used to characterize a contexts, services, and recommendations. To specify the current context, XML tags are used to categorize each type of context data that characterizes the current context. The each unit context data is delineated by a beginning tag and an ending tag, forming an element. For example, the element \u201c<TEMPERATURE>10 degrees Celsius<\/TEMPERATURE>\u201d defines the category as temperature, and specifies the data as \u201c10 degrees Celsius\u201d. As another example, the element \u201c<LAT>38 degrees, 48 minutes North<\/LAT>\u201d defines the category as geographic latitude, and specifies the data as \u201c38 degrees, 48 minutes North\u201d. Another feature of XML is its ability to specify a hierarchy in the categories of data. For example, geographic location is normally specified as both a latitude and a longitude. The categories of data for latitude and longitude can be thought of as \u201cchild\u201d categories within the category for geographic location. XML expresses this hierarchy as follows:","<LOCATION>\n\n","<\/LOCATION >","A typical specification of the context for an activity stored in the service history log  would be, for example:","<CONTEXT>\n\n","<\/CONTEXT>","By expressing the context in the service history log  in XML, the stored expression is both human and machine readable, it defines the content, and it defines the hierarchical structure of the content. XML also separates the appearance of the content from the structure of the content, so that the content can be displayed in any format by using customized style sheets in each different type of display device. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) can provide flexible document presentation, enabling the content of an XML file to be displayed on the large display screen of a personal computer, as well as in the microbrowser . Messages exchanged between the wireless device  and the network server  can include XML files carried in the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messaging protocol or the SyncML synchronization protocol. For additional background on XML, see the book by Heather Williamson, , Osborne\/McGraw-Hill, 2001.","Both the wireless device  and the network server  interpret the tags of the XML elements in the XML file in the same way. This can be accomplished by incorporating the same XML tag parser in both the device recommendation algorithms  of the wireless device  and in the server recommendation algorithms  of the network server . In its simplest form, the XML tag parser can be a simple string comparison function that searches the XML file for XML tag strings, such as the beginning tag \u201c<LOCATION>\u201d and the ending tag \u201c<\/LOCATION>\u201d. When it finds the a particular beginning tag, it gets the data located between the beginning tag and the ending tag and passes the data as \u201clocation data\u201d to program subroutines that operate on location data. Such program subroutines include the database search routine in the server recommendation algorithms  in the server , that forms a query from the latitude and longitude data to search for recommendations for services in the database  having similar latitude and longitude values.","Another way for both the wireless device  and the network server  to interpret the tags of the XML elements in the XML file in the same way, is by means of a standard XML parser. The two principal, standard XML parsers are the Simple API for XML (SAX) event-based parser and the Document Object Model (DOM) tree-based parser. The principal difference between them is in the way the XML data is made available to the client application, such as the device recommendation algorithms . SAX is an event driven model, wherein the client application is continuously notified as the XML document features are recognized by the parser. As the SAX parser reads an XML file, it sends to the application program  information from the XML file in real time. Each time the parser sees a beginning tag, an ending tag, character data, or a processing instruction, it reports it to the client application. The entire XML file does not have to be read before acting on the data at the beginning of the file. The entire document does not have to reside in memory, which can be an advantage for the wireless device .","The Document Object Model (DOM) model parser is object based, on the other hand, wherein the entire XML document is parsed and stored as a hierarchical tree of objects that the client application can then randomly access. A document type definition (DTD) is available to both the wireless device  and in the network server , either being stored locally or at a server they can reference. A DTD is a set of declarations that specify the allowed order, structure, and meaning of the tags for a particular XML file. The XML file references the DTD that governs its order, structure, and meaning, at a specified location, such as the directory of the local filesystem, and its filename as a handle. Standard XML parsers are part of many operating systems now available. A DOM tree-based parser reads in the DTD and the XML file and converts the XML file into programming constructs accessible to the application logic. A document type declaration element must appear in the XML file to indicate the DTD to which the XML file complies and where to find it. It starts with \u201c<DOCTYPE\u201d and ends with \u201c>\u201d.

The DOM tree-based parser can read in the DTD of TABLE E and create the hierarchical tree data structure that serves as a template for the recommendation algorithm  in server . The recommendation algorithm  can then fill the nodes of the tree with recommendation data, such as ADDRESS data, AREA data, LAT data, and LON data. The DOM tree-based parser uses this newly created tree of data to create a corresponding XML recommendations file  of TABLE D, that conforms to the DTD of TABLE E. The recommendation algorithm  and the DOM tree-based parser, in effect, work together as a document generator. The Document Object Model (DOM) defines the characteristics of the XML file hierarchical tree data structure and an application programming interface (API) for manipulating it. A description of DOM is provided on the web site http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/DOM-Level-2-Core\/. For additional information on the Document Object Model and the XML file hierarchical tree data structure, see the book by Elliotte Harold, et al, entitled , O'Reilly & Associates, 2001.","In an alternate embodiment, the wireless device uses the SAX event-driven parser and the network server  uses the DOM tree-based parser. This arrangement confers the advantage of requiring a smaller memory allocation for the SAX parser in the wireless device  and yet it provides the capability of the DOM parser to construct the XML recommendations files  in the network server .","In another alternate embodiment, Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) can be used to display in the wireless device  the recommendations  in step  which are received from the network server . XHTML is a hybrid between HTML and XML specifically designed for network device displays. A subset of XHTML is XHTML Basic, which defines a document type that is rich enough to be used for content authoring and precise document layout, yet can be shared with wireless mobile devices  with small screens, such as PDAs and cell phones. XHTML Basic is the mobile adaptation of XHTML, and includes everything in XHTML except those capabilities, such as frames, that are not appropriate for devices with small screens. XHTML Basic is an XML-based standard, which allows the automatic parsing and transcoding of content through the use of Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT), part of the XSL style sheet language for XML. XSLT provides a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. Using XSLT, a system can automatically transform the same XML content into multiple markup languages depending on the browser . Through such transformations, content can be created for one type device and automatically transformed to appear on another type device. For example, the network server  can create its recommendations once in XML and use XSLT to dynamically convert it to XHTML Basic and HTML for presentation on mobile wireless devices .","XHTML Basic can used with cascading style sheets (CSS) to describe how documents are presented on screen in the browser . Through the use of CSS, document authors can control the presentation of documents without sacrificing device independence. The use of well-known standard HTML tags avoids storing multiple versions of content. The network server  does not need to provide for extra overhead for transcoding required to prepare content for an array of different markup languages. CSS enables a document author to specify the presentation of an application once for each type of device, by means of a corresponding style sheet. If the presentation needs to be changed at any time, the change is made once in the style sheet and the modification is dynamically reflected throughout all the pages in the network server . CSS separates the content of the document from the presentation. This allows creating browser-specific versions of the same content simply by creating a corresponding style sheet for each browser type. Then, when a user requests a page at the wireless device , the network server  server identifies the requesting device and returns the content with a link to the appropriate style sheet. The style sheet is downloaded once and cached by the browser  for use with subsequent pages, which speeds the rendering of all pages received from the network server . CSS enables every aspect of the appearance of the document, such as positioning, fonts, text attributes, borders, margin alignment, and flow, to be defined in the style sheet. A change to any aspect of the document's appearance needs to be made only once. CSS also gives carriers greater control over the look and feel of the services they provide through their wireless portal. The operator can use XHTML Basic to define a default style sheet for all devices it supports, which will ensure a basic look and feel consistent for all devices .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0112","num":"0141"},"figref":["FIG. 2F","FIG. 2F","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2F","FIG. 2G","FIG. 2E"],"b":["140","521","100","100","140","216","521","216","240","166","240","138","521","192","243","235","521","244","231","521","246","248","521","100","521","100","250","100","102","1","100","140","100"],"sub":["\u2014","\u2014"]},"Another example of the invention is when the user requests a location-based recommendation with the device . As discussed above,  shows the service history log  has accumulated data on past services used by the user of the device  and the contexts of those past services. The recommendation algorithms  automatically filters the service history log  and selects past services used by the user of the device  and the contexts of those past services, treating them as context-activity pairs. It is not necessary that these pairs of selected past services used and past contexts be related to the current context of the device . Two examples of these past pairs of selected past services used and past contexts are numbered [10] and [11] as follows:","[10] \u201clocation=xyz1; service=www.newsservice.com\/ . . . \/news.wml\u201d, and","[11] \u201clocation=xyz2; service=www.stockquotes.com\/ . . . \/quotes.wml\u201d.","The device  then sends these two automatically selected past pairs to the network server . The recommendation algorithms  filter out any reference to the user's ID before sending the pairs to the server. Then, device  then sends the current context \u201clocation=xyz3\u201d to the network server . The current context \u201cxyz3\u201d can represent the airport, for example. When the network server  receives the two example past pairs of selected past services used and past contexts, it stores them in its database . Past pairs such as these can be accumulated from many users as recommendation resource in the database  for use by many other users.

There are two ways that the user's device  can initiate sending the current context-activity pair to the server . The first way is shown in step  of , where the user's device  is programmed to automatically get the current context state  from the context inference engine , and to select an appropriate activity from the history log , and to send the current context-activity pair to the server . The activities can be past recommendations made by the network server , past services used, prestored service preferences, special requested service requirements, or any combination of these. The second way that the device  can send a context-activity pair is shown in step , where the user inputs a selection of an activity onto the request a recommendation sub menu shown in  or F.

An important feature of the invention is that the information transmitted to the network server  can be without any user identification, in order to preserve the privacy of the user's information. Often instead of single context-activity pair  a sample filtered by recommendation algorithm  of representative context-activity pairs and related service history items from log  is transmitted to recommendation algorithm . That is, message  is often a set of context-activity pairs and related service history items.","In an alternate embodiment of the invention shown in , Step \u2032 sends to recommendation algorithm  in server , a sample of representative context-activity pairs filtered by algorithm  and related service history items from log  as a set of context-activity pairs and related service history items.","In step  of , the network server  receives the context-activity pair  from the device , and processes the context-activity pair with the recommendation algorithms . The recommendation algorithms  match the context-activity pairs stored in the database  which are similar to the context-activity pair which was received from the device , and it accesses the associated recommendations for the matched context-activity pairs from the database . This can be seen to better advantage in  which shows an example of the context-activity pairs and associated services database  in the server .","Referring for a moment to , the user has selected at the wireless device , the activity of \u201cdining-restaurant\u201d. The current context is a particular local time and location, a particular light level, ambient temperature, speed and acceleration.

The corresponding associated service recommendations are shown in the middle column. For each respective service recommendation in the middle column, there is a corresponding number of times that that particular recommendation has been made to other users in the past, as shown in the right-hand column of FIG. A. The current context is 8:00 PM at night and therefore the service recommendations seen to be different from the service recommendations that would be made from the second row of the database  in FIG. A. In the second row it can be seen that the context-activity pairs deal with a morning timeframe at the same location. There, it can be seen that in the middle column for the second row, the recommendations are not the same as they were for the nighttime recommendations for the first row. Similar to the previous description, the right-hand column of  gives the number of times that each respective service recommendation has been made to prior users. The recommendation algorithms  in the network server  perform the matching operation and identify the first row in  as a match for context-activity pairs. Accordingly, the recommendation algorithms  in the network server  return the recommendations  to the user's wireless device . Those recommendations are the service recommendations shown in the upper row middle column of FIG. A. The number of times each recommendation has been made can also be transmitted in the recommendations . This is performed in the step  of the process diagram of FIG. C. The \u201cnumber of times recommended\u201d is only one of the measures which can be used to generate new recommendations. Other measures include parameters based on feedback.","Step  of  receives the recommendations  at the wireless device , and the recommendation algorithms  apply a filtering operation to the received recommendations to identify any new or significant information. New information can be determined by reference to the context-activity pairs and service history log  in device , which is shown in greater detail in FIG.  and in FIG. B. There it can be seen that in the past, this particular wireless device  has received old recommendations for two entries which are also part of the set of recommendations  now being received from the server . The recommendation algorithm  removes the two old recommendations shown in the top row middle column of  so that only the new recommendations received in the recommendations  from the network server  are to be displayed to the user in the wireless device . The recommendations algorithms  can make other determinations, for example it can examine the user's rating of the respective old recommendations as shown in FIG. B and can take the user's rating into consideration in the display of current recommendations to the user. The recommendation algorithms  in the wireless device  can also take into consideration the number of times that each respective recommendation has been previously recommended to other users, that information having been transmitted in recommendations  to the wireless device . Then in step  of , the wireless device displays the filtered recommendations to the user. Alternately, the wireless device can transfer the filtered recommendations to an application program for further processing.

The feedback is used to enhance the quality of later matching operations in step .","At the network server , as shown in , step  transitions to step  in which the new context-activity pairs and recommendations are added to the database . An important feature of this invention is that there is no user identification which is included in the database . Then step  of  computes usage statistics for the context-activity pairs in the database  and associates the usage statistics with the respective recommendations stored in the database . This information can have economic value to third party service providers such as the service provider . As is seen in , step  shows the third party service provider  purchasing selected data sets from the database  to be used for market research.","An alternate embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. D. In the alternate embodiment, the context-activity pair information  sent by the wireless device  in  to the network server , includes the metadata vector . Where the processing power or memory capacity of the wireless device  may be limited, the network server  can make a more accurate determination of the mobile user's current context by assisting in the further processing of the metadata vector .

A context inference engine  in the network server  of  is embodied as programmed instructions executed within the server . The resultant current context computed by the server  and the activity information received from the wireless device  in the context-activity pair , constitute the current context-activity pair. The context-activity pair database  maintained by the server  associates a current context-activity pair with appropriate recommendations made in the past to many users. As the system makes new recommendations to users in response to context-activity pairs submitted by their wireless devices, the server  gathers the new recommendations and adds them to its context-activity pair database . No user personal data is included in the context-activity pair database . In this manner, the variety, quality and pertinence of the recommendations in the database  grows as the recommendation system is used. As an added benefit, the server  compiles statistical usage information about the recommendations and stores this in the context-activity pair database .","The network process flow diagram of the alternate embodiment of  begins with either step  or step  in the user's wireless device .

In alternate step , the user can make an activity selection from the request a recommendation sub menu shown in  or F. Both steps  and  flow into step  in the user's wireless device . In step , the context inference engine  contacts the context inference engine  of the network server  shown in , and sends the metadata vector  and activity as the context-activity pair  to server . The process then flows to step  in the network server . The context inference engine  at network server  uses user information stored in the server in the user database  to make a more accurate determination of the wireless device's current context. Step  then flows to step , and the rest of the steps in the flow diagram of  are substantially the same as those described above for FIG. C. In this manner, the network server  can then assist the wireless device  in determining the wireless device's current context, as well as the server  sending the resultant service recommendations back to the wireless device .","Context Sensitive Web Services","The context sensitive web services feature enables a mobile phone or wireless PDA to use context inference techniques to sense the user's environment and in response, to provide recommendations to the user that is appropriate to the user's perceived environment. The feature offloads some of the computationally intensive computing necessary in context inference techniques, from the mobile user's wireless device to a server and to web sites on the Internet. The context sensitive web services feature maintains a personal profile of the mobile user's personal preferences in an online server or web site. The mobile user is provided with the ability to control access by application programs in the wireless device, to the user's private data. The context sensitive web services feature provide the mobile user with the ability to control any access to the user's profile by the online server or web site.","The mobile user's wireless device is equipped with a context inference engine for providing and awareness of the mobile user's context to application programs, including third party applications. Since the processing power and storage capacity is limited in typical wireless devices, the computational load and storage requirements of the context inference engine are distributed to a context inference server capable of processing the context data. The feature enables the mobile user to control which application programs in the wireless device are granted access to the user's private context information. A privacy control block in the wireless device grants or revokes access by application programs to the private context information, based on the mobile user's preferences stored in a privacy profile. The same privacy control and privacy profile is extended to the context inference server, thereby enabling the extension of the user's privacy control to any web server connected to the context inference server. The feature thus enables building an infrastructure for context sensitive applications and services within the wireless device and the server, while providing to the mobile user control over the privacy user's context information.","The Recommendation Web Services menu displayed by the microbrowser  in  is rendered by the WAP client program under the control of the application programs , which are shown in . If the UPDATE PRIVACY FEATURES session type is selected by the user, the Recommendation Web Services menu of  then presents to the user the UPDATE PRIVACY FEATURES sub-menu from which the user can select the following options:","[A] UPDATE PRIVACY FEATURES:\n\n","Option [1] of UPDATE YOUR PRIVACY PROFILE, leads to a second sub-menu shown in , which has the following options:\n\n","[a] Add a local program to permissions list","[b] Remove a local program from list","[c] Add a server program to permissions list","[d] Remove a server program from list","[e] Add a network program to permissions list","[f] Remove a network program from list.","Option [2] of UPDATE YOUR PERSONAL DATA, leads to a another sub-menu shown in , which has the following options:\n\n","[a] Update server database","[b] Update network database.","Option [3] of AUTHENTICATE A PROGRAM, leads to a another sub-menu shown in , which has the following options:\n\n","[a] Request program's public key certificate","[b] Verify certificate signatures","[c] Verify validity time","[d] Verify revocation status","[e] Check if certificate authority on trust list","[f] Flag program as authenticated.","The AUTHENTICATE A PROGRAM option calls the privacy control  of the wireless device  in FIG. . If an application program A, B, X, or Y has been verified for its acceptability by a trusted authority, then the trusted authority will have issued a digital certificate on a message authentication code (MAC) it has computed for the application program, which can be checked by the privacy control . As long as the privacy control  trusts the trusted authority issuing the digital certificate, authentication of the application program is straight forward.","Once the mobile user has verified the program's digital certificate and is satisfied that the application program will not subvert the integrity or security of the user's private data, the user can register the program. Registration is the granting by the user of access permission to the program, to access the current context of the user's wireless device and\/or to access other portions of the user's private data. There are several levels of permission that can be granted by the user in two categories, [a] when can the accesses take place and [b] what data can be accessed.","Option [4] of REGISTER A PROGRAM, leads to a another sub-menu shown in , which has the following options:\n\n","[a] When can the accesses take place","[b] What data can be accessed","For the first category of [a] when can the accesses take place, the highest level of permission in this category is that access can occur anytime and without notice. The lowest level of permission in this category is that access can only occur at specified times or under specified conditions, and only after notice to the user and specific authorization by the user. For the second category of [b] what data can be accessed, the highest level of permission in this category is to access unlimited datasets in the user's private data, including current context information, personal data entered by the user, the user's Internet usage history data, the user's Internet cookie data, and the user's application program usage data. The lowest level of permission in this category is that access of any data can only occur after notice to the user and specific authorization by the user. The user can configure any levels of permission in between the highest and lowest and make that the basis for the registration. The user can include the terms of registration in a digital certificate signed by the user and appended to the application program. This registration certificate can be presented by the program to the privacy control  prior to a proposed access event, the privacy control  to automatically verify the registration status of the program. The registration certificate can be constructed as follows.","The privacy control  can compute a message authentication code (MAC) and its own digital signature and append it as a certificate to an acceptable application program A, B, X, or Y. The privacy control  can include the terms of registration in the digital certificate. Then when the program requests access to the user's private data, the privacy control  can automatically check the MAC and its own digital signature to verify that the program has not been changed and the privacy control  can also automatically verify the registration status of the program. This is achieved by the privacy control  computing a hash value for the entire application program A, B, X, or Y (or some portion of it) and the terms of registration, and then forming a message authentication code (MAC) from the hash value. The privacy control  then uses its PKI private key to digitally sign the message authentication code (MAC). The terms of the registration, the MAC and the privacy control's digital signature are appended to the application program A, B, X, or Y as a registration certificate.","Then, whenever the application program A, B, X, or Y requests access to the user's context data or private data, the privacy control  will require the application program to present the registration certificate so that the privacy control  can check that the presented MAC compares with a computed MAC and that the presented digital signature is genuine. The privacy control  can then automatically grant access permission to the application program, in accordance with the terms of the registration.","Methods to generate and evaluate message authentication codes to insure the integrity of data are described in the book by Stephen Thomas entitled , published by John Wiley and Sons, 2000. Two example algorithms for message authentication are RSA's Message Digest (MD) and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), both of which are described in the book by Stephen Thomas. Another reference that goes into greater detail in its discussion of data integrity methods is the book by Bruce Schneier entitled \u20142published by John Wiley and Sons, 1996. Methods to generate and evaluate digital signatures to insure the source of the digital program are described in the book by Richard E.

This enables automatically processing the privacy check in the network Server  for access requests from web server . When the application program in the web server  requests access to the user's private data in the network server  or in the wireless device , the privacy control  in the network server  will require the application program in the web server  to present the registration certificate so that it can check the MAC and its own digital signature to verify that the application program has not been changed.

For instance the inferred current context of the device  may be \u201cIN THE USER'S POCKET\u201d, when a certain set of sensors input a specific combination of signals having a specific value range. As an example, the resulting inference of the current context by the Context Interference Engine  could be expressed in XML language format as follows:","<Context Inference Engine in Device>","<device placement>pocket <\/device placement>","<User Interface state>sleep mode <\/User Interface state>","<device location>in elevator  building  floor  <\/device location>","<API active actions>meeting starting on floor  room  <\/API active actions>","<\/Context Inference Engine in Device >","The Context Inference Engine  in the wireless device  can perform the context inference process with any of several methods. Different input information from the sensors can be weighted according to their relative value of importance appropriate for each environment condition or situation to be analyzed. Each sensor has it's own weight value. Alternatively, the weight values for each sensor for each environment condition can be learned from training sessions using, for example artificial neural networks (ANNs), self-organizing maps (SOMs), decision trees, fuzzy rule-based systems, or model-based systems such as Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). Combinations of two or more of the alternate methods can be used, depending on the application.","The Context Inference Engine  can continuously adapt its weights through adaptive and continuous learning methods, where the user teaches the wireless device  new environment conditions and names them. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be used, for example, to implement an adaptive and continuous learning method for the Context Inference Engine . Alternately, the wireless device  can be programmed to spontaneously recognize a changed scene by comparing it with known scenes. The user can teach the wireless device new environmental conditions and name them, using the adaptive and automatic learning capability of neural networks. Adaptive and continuous learning methods are computationally intensive and are appropriate candidates to place on the network server , which assists the wireless device , as discussed below.","The field of context inference has applied the principles of automated pattern recognition to processing diverse types sensor inputs. Speech recognition has been applied to processing speech signals and handwriting recognition has been applied to processing hand force and accelerometer signals. In the field of robotics, image recognition has been applied to processing digitized still and motion images, mechanical location recognition has been applied to processing laser and sonar range finder signals, and mechanical motion recognition to has been applied to processing inertial, acceleration, and heading signals. In the field of prosthetic devices, touch recognition has been applied to processing tactile sensor signals. In the field of medicine, automated diagnostic programs recognize various pathologies by processing bioelectric field signals, as well as the more traditional pulse, respiration rate, and body temperature signals. These diverse sensor signal recognition processes have the common feature that an initial training stage is conducted where sampled signals are equated with a statistical model for those signals.","The principles of automated pattern recognition for these diverse sensor inputs are exemplified by the techniques for recognizing speech patterns. A common technique used in speech recognition is Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). The term \u201cHidden\u201d refers to the probabilistic and not directly observable events which underlie a speech signal. HMM speech recognition systems typically use realizations of phonemes which are statistical models of phonetic segments having parameters that are estimated from a set of training examples. Models of words are made by chaining or linking appropriate statistical models of phonetic segments. The statistical models serve as standards which are to be matched with the unknown voice signals to be recognized.","Recognition of unknown voice signals requires sampling and digitizing the speaker's spoken phonemes. These digitized phonemes are then processed into metadata. The metadata is then compared with the standard statistical models of phonemes. The most likely matches are then the inferred speech recognition result.","Recognition consists of finding the most likely path through the set of word models for the input speech signal. HMM speech recognition decoding systems first need to be trained through an iterative process. The system must be exposed to training examples or words of a particular speaker's voice. A training word is analyzed to generate a framed sequence of acoustic parameters or statistical models. A valid or \u201cgood\u201d recognition occurs when the most likely path through the set of word models for the training word results in recognizing the correct training word.","Some useful references discussing the principles of Hidden Markov Models are:\n\n","To illustrate how Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be extended beyond speech recognition, an example is given here for touch recognition. In the training stage for touch recognition, tactile sensor signals are input from touching a tactile transducer to a rough texture, such as for example sandpaper. The tactile sensor signals are transformed into a statistical model of the input signal. The statistical model is stored as a standard in a computer memory under the handle \u201crough_texture\u201d. To expand the range of sensor signals that are included in the model for \u201crough_texture\u201d, several training sessions can be conducted, each with a different direction or pressure for touching the sandpaper, resulting in several different samples of the statistical model. The set of samples of the statistical model are stored as a standard under the handle \u201crough_texture\u201d. Other training sessions are conducted with a smooth texture, such as glass. The tactile sensor signals input from touching the tactile transducer to the smooth texture are transformed into a statistical model of the input signal and stored as a standard under the handle \u201csmooth_texture\u201d. Later, in the recognition mode, an unknown object is touched by the tactile transducer resulting in a sample tactile sensor signal. Recognition of unknown touch signals requires sampling and digitizing the touch transducer's signals. These digitized sensor signals are then processed into metadata. The metadata is then compared with the standard statistical models of \u201crough_texture\u201d and \u201csmooth_texture\u201d. The most likely match is then the inferred touch recognition result.","Combinations of two or more types of sensors can have their signals combined into an input metadata vector that characterizes a composite sampling event. The composite sampling event can be recognized using the principles of Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). An example composite sampling event can be the state of the health and fatigue of the user of a wireless device . For example, a wireless device  can be equipped with a tactile transducer which outputs tactile sensor signals in response to the hand force and pulse rate of the user who is gripping the wireless device . The wireless device  can be equipped with a temperature sensor which outputs body temperature signals in response to the user gripping the wireless device . Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) can be used to recognize a force\/temperature input metadata vector that characterizes the combination of the hand force and the temperature sensor signals resulting from a sampling event. A composite sampling event in this example can have an extended duration so that the force sensor can transduce the pulse rate of the user over a period of time.","In the training stage, the tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are output while the user is in a condition of good health and resting normally. The tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are combined into a force\/temperature input metadata vector which is transformed into a statistical model of the input signals. The statistical model is stored as a standard in the computer memory of the wireless device  under the handle \u201cgood_health_resting_normally\u201d. Other training sessions are conducted with the user in different states of health and fatigue. For example, the user may be training the wireless device  while working late at night at the office. The tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals resulting from holding the wireless device , are combined into a force\/temperature input metadata vector for the user in the condition of being in good health but fatigued. The force\/temperature input metadata vector is transformed into a statistical model of the input signals and stored as a standard under the handle \u201cgood_health_fatigued\u201d.","Later, in the recognition mode, as the user holds the wireless device , the tactile sensor signals and the force sensor signals are sampled. The Health\/Fatigue_State recognition consists of sampling and digitizing the touch transducer's signals. These digitized sensor signals are then processed into a metadata vector. The metadata vector is then compared with the standard statistical models of handle \u201cgood_health_resting_normally\u201d and \u201cgood_health_fatigued\u201d. The most likely match is then the inferred touch recognition result.","In accordance with the feature, this recognition result can be used by a health maintenance application program in the wireless device , to provide useful and appropriate information to the user. For example, a health maintenance program can process the recognition result, and in response, signal an alarm to the user and provide suggestions for medications to palliate the sensed fatigue. One problem with automatic recognition programs is that they are either relatively large or they call databases that are relatively large in comparison to the memory capacity of the wireless device .","Another aspect of the feature is the recognition result can be used by a supplementary application program in a remote server, to provide additional and more detailed useful and appropriate information to the user. For example, the server can access a large database of suggestions for medications to palliate the sensed fatigue of the user. The results of the search of the database can be returned to the wireless device . The server can also maintain a personal profile of the user's characteristics and preferences and it can use that profile in automatically formulate its query to the database. For example, the user's drug allergies can be stored in the server's database, to insure that recommendations are not made that will result in an allergic reaction by the user to the suggested medication.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0208","num":"0248"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["100","140","160","138","150","138","150","138","150"],"i":["SSL and TLS","Internet Cryptography"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0209","num":"0249"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["100","100","138","142","140","100","160"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0210","num":"0250"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["100","140"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0029","list-style":"none"},"li":["1.

Context Inference Client  may utilize customer database information in database  to enhance the context sensitivity capabilities of the web server . The contact to the network server  is done through a context awareness interface  to the Context Inference Server  in the network server .","Context Inference Server  registers the Web Services of the web server  through the privacy control  of the network server  to the Context Inference Engine . Privacy control  has a cached copy  of the Privacy Profile  of the wireless device . This enables processing of the privacy check in the network Server  for access requests from web server . The communication between web server  and network server  is secured using the Internet secure protocols such as HTTPS or SSL. The Context Inference Server  can publish its own service as a Web Service to other Web Services on the Internet, in which case the implementation of the interface  between web server  and network server  can be Extensible Markup Language (XML) messages carried in the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messaging protocol.","The Context inference Engine  in the network server  will receive processed sensor metadata vector  information and possibly some application API information originated from the Context Inference Engine  of the wireless device . The Context inference Engine  of the network server has user database  information of the behavior of the user and of the past usage of the wireless device. The Context inference Engine  of the network server may also have third party services available (such as instances offering content and\/or services) to be offered to potential users. What is offered to the user can also depend on the user profile . The nature of the Context inference Engine  information of the wireless device  that is conveyed to the Context inference Engine  of the network can be controlled with the privacy control  that is managed by the user of the wireless device . The user may thus fully or partly disable the Context inference Engine  of the network to control the amount of his\/her information that can be used by third party services. The privacy control  enables the user to control access by anyone to his\/her private information.","The Context inference Engine  of the wireless device receives an input from the API interface  from the applications A, B, X, or Y located in the wireless device . An example would be from a calendar application program indicating that a meeting is starting in 25 minutes time. As another example the calendar application program indicates that Lisa is having a birthday tomorrow into which you are participating. The Context inference Engine  of the wireless device can convey processed result information to the Context inference Engine  of the network server. Now in addition to the sensor information, information from the application programs A, B, X, or Y can also be used in the decision making of the Context inference Engine  of the wireless device. A combination of the sensor information and information coming from the application programs A, B, X, or Y can be processed by the Context inference Engine . The user's behavior or usage patterns can be detected from the sensor and recorded in a the user database, concerning the usage of the application programs. As previously discussed, the processing of this combined information from the sensors and from the application programs can be shared between the Context inference Engine  and the Context inference Engine .","The information transfer from the Context inference Engine  of the wireless device to the Context inference Engine  of the network server can be done in alternative ways. The system can be managed so that the current consumption and transfer capacity between the wireless device  and the network server  is taken into account. The context information does not always have to be collected so frequently that it would have to be periodically transferred to the network side  every few seconds. Depending on the application, the timing window applied to information transfer from the Context inference Engine  of the wireless device  to the Context inference Engine  of the server  can vary from seconds to minutes. If there were no event change or condition change in the environment of the wireless device , there would be no need to transfer information to the Context inference Engine  of the server . Additionally information can be temporarily stored in a buffer in the wireless device , which can then transferred less frequently to the network Context inference Engine . Packet based GPRS and UMTS can support the less frequent information transfer rates. Also, it is advantageous to send the network Context inference Engine  information from the wireless device  as an attachment, immediately subsequent to other signaling made to in the network direction from the wireless device , thus saving the radio transmitter of the wireless device  from having to be switched on again for transferring the Context inference Engine  information separately to the network server .","Returning to , the relationship is shown between the network server , the Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry , and a plurality of web site servers .

A Java servlet takes a request as input, parses the data, performs logic operations, and issues a response back to WAP protocol gateway . The Java runtime platform pools the Java servlets to simultaneously service many requests. Network interface  accepts request messages from WAP protocol gateway  and passes the information in the request to visit object  for further processing.

The small size of the microbrowser  and the small file sizes accommodate the low memory constraints of the portable wireless device  and the low-bandwidth constraints of a wireless network . The cards are written in the Wireless Markup Language (WML) which is specifically devised for small screens and one-hand navigation without a keyboard. The WML language is scaleable from two-line text displays on the microbrowser  of a cellular telephone, up through large LCD screens found on smart phones and personal communicators. The cards written in the WML language can include programs written in WMLScript, which is similar to JavaScript, but makes minimal demands on memory and CPU power of the device  because it does not contain many of the unnecessary functions found in other scripting languages.","The Nokia WAP Client Version 2.0 is a software product containing the components necessary to implement the WAP client on the wireless device .
