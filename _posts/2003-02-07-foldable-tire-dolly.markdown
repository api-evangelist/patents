{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described herein may be made, used and licensed by and for United States Government purposes without paying me any royalty.","This invention relates to dollies useful for the removal, moving and mounting of vehicle tires. More particularly, the dolly is useful in mounting and unmounting large vehicle tires from a vehicle.","The military uses a variety of tactical ground vehicles, all of which use large truck tires. When changing or rotating the tires the troops are required to lift and position the tires, which is a difficult and time-consuming job. It is particularly difficult for the smaller members of the armed services who may lack both the strength and height necessary to position the large tires on an axle which is a substantial height above ground level. Wheeled dollies useful for removing or mounting vehicle wheels are known in the art. Generally such devices are constructed with a mainframe having upright standards and a second frame supported on the mainframe, which holds a tire assembly and is movable vertically on the upright standards to lift and position the tire. Such devices are by nature heavy and bulky. The combination of weight and storage space required by such structures makes them unsuitable for use in military units, which are deployed throughout the world.","It would be desirable to have a folding, lightweight tire dolly that can be easily stored as part of the equipment for tire changing and rotation on a military vehicle. Such a device should be of simple construction, collapsible to minimum space requirement, and allow for easy loading of the tire on the dolly for transport. The dolly should also have means to allow the tire to be rotated on the dolly into a position where the holes in the wheel rim are aligned with the threaded axle studs on which the tire assembly is mounted.","The present invention provides a foldable tire dolly having the desired characteristics outlined above. The dolly is useful for moving and positioning a vehicle tire assembly consisting of a tire mounted on a normal wheel rim which is designed to be attached to the threaded studs of an axle assembly. The dolly of this invention has a rectangular base member, preferably adjustable in length, designed to accommodate tires of various sizes. The rectangular base member is further mounted on a plurality of casters that can be used to move the dolly over a variety of surfaces.","The rectangular base member has a pair of adjustable wings, which are hinged to opposite ends of the rectangular base member. The hinges allow one of the wings to be positioned to form a ramp so that a tire can be easily rolled onto the rectangular base member and the wing raised to a supporting position where in combination with the wing on the opposite end of the rectangular base member the vehicle tire assembly will be held in a centered position on the base member. Adjustable positioning members are associated with the wings and rectangular base member with one end of the positioning member being attached to the base member and the other end attached to one of the wings. The positioning members can be adjusted so as to hold the wings in contact with the tire to keep the tire from excessive movement on the base member. The positioning memberes also intersect the angle between the associated wing and the base member to hold the tire in position on the dolly during movement of the dolly with the tire.","The tire dolly of this invention has a plurality of bearing surfaces with at least one bearing surface being mounted on each wing and one bearing surface on the rectangular base member to allow rotation of the tire into position so the wheel rim can engage the threaded studs on the axle.","Referring to the accompanying drawing in which like numerals refer to like parts and initially to , a foldable tire dolly according to this invention is designated generally . The dolly has a rectangular base  composed or formed of two separate pieces  which abut each other near the centerline of the rectangular base . The two separate pieces  have two semi oval slots  incised into their upper surfaces so that when the pieces of the base member are brought into abutment there is an oval depression  formed in the upper surface of the rectangular base member . A complimentary oval shaped adjustable brace , sized slightly smaller than the oval depression , is nested in each of the oval depressions. Each of the oval braces  has two longitudinal oval apertures , one oval aperture being formed on each end of the individual oval brace. The longitudinal oval apertures  engage complementary internally threaded studs  located in and extending upward from the bottom surface of the oval depressions . The oval adjustable braces  can be secured in position by means of complementary threaded fasteners  and associated washers , by inserting the fasteners into the internally threaded studs  and tightening. As shown, the threaded fasteners  can be of a design to be tightened by hand obviating the need for special tools. When the threaded fasteners  are loosened, the two base pieces  can be moved closer together or further apart in order to adjust the rectangular platform  to the desired length. In this embodiment, each of the adjustable oval braces  has a bearing member  located near its center. The bearing member  shown is a sphere mounted in a complimentary housing located in the adjustable brace .","The rectangular base  is mounted on a plurality of casters , which allow the tire dolly  to be moved over the ground while carrying the tie assembly. The type of caster or wheel chosen can be determined by the ground over which the dolly is to be moved, softer soils generally requiring a wider caster to allow movement.","The rectangular base  has two wings  attached to the rectangular base member  one wing being attached to each end of the rectangular base. The wings  are fastened to the rectangular bade  by means of hinges , which allows the wings to rotate inward towards the rectangular base  to a point where the wing is in contact with the tire assembly loaded on the dolly . The wings  also have the edge hinged to the base undercut  so that the wing can rotate outward past horizontal to a position where the end of the wing opposite the hinge touches the ground this forms a ramp allowing a tire assembly to be rolled up the ramp on to the base member . This will eliminate lifting of heavy tire assemblies and thereby improves safety and lessens the chance of injury. Each of the wings  has at least one bearing member  on its surface to allow a tire assembly on the dolly  to be rotated on the dolly; this allows the wheel rim to be rotated so the holes in the rim align with the threaded studs on the axle.","A pair of adjustable arcuate braces  are formed of curved arms , . Arm  has one end firmly attached to its associated wing , and arm  has one end attached to its associated base member . Once the rectangular base  has been adjusted for width and the wings  are positioned so they are juxtaposed the tire, threaded fasteners  can be placed in a slot  in the arms ,  and secured with a complimentary nut . The resulting arcuate braces  not only position the wings  but provide a side support for the tire assembly to help keep the tire assembly on the dolly  as it is moved.","In , the dolly  of  is shown with a tire assembly  held in position with a tire  mounted on a wheel rim  ready for installation. The dolly  is then moved next to an axle , shown in , the axle having a plurality of threaded studs  to be used in mounting the wheel rim  on the axle. If the apertures  in the wheel rim  do not align with the threaded studs  the tire assembly  can be rotated to align the studs and the dolly  moved towards the axle  until the threaded studs extend through the wheel rim. Complimentary threaded nuts  are then tightened on the threaded studs  to hold the tire assembly in position. The dolly  can then be withdrawn as the bearing members  allow easy withdrawal.","Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In the accompanying drawing:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00010","num":"00010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
