{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to thin provisioning and tier management and, more particularly, to a method and an apparatus to save and restore tier information.","In recent years, thin provisioning has become popular. Thin provisioning is a method for allocating area for a storage subsystem that receives a write command to unallocated area. Currently, a storage subsystem migrates frequently accessed allocated area to fast and expensive media and migrates rarely accessed allocated area to slow and cheap media. As such, an area accessed by a program that runs only at specified times is not accessed and is moved to slow media when the program does not run. However, a problem with performance will occur when the program starts.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a method and an apparatus to save and restore tier information. In a specific embodiment, the storage subsystem records tier migration log information. The tier migration log includes the relationship between area and tier when the area is moved to a different tier. The storage subsystem moves the area to the original tier using the tier migration log information to restore the tier when the job starts.","An aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of tier management of data, in a system which includes a host, a network, and a storage system coupled to the host via the network, the storage system having a memory, a plurality of virtual volumes, a plurality of logical volumes, and a plurality of physical media. The method comprises performing a tier migration log information setup process which includes selecting an area specified by a virtual volume address and a logical volume address; determining a destination tier for the area based on a number of accesses to the area; and updating a tier migration log information by inputting the determined destination tier and a time; and performing a process using the tier migration log information to determine whether to migrate a specific area which includes loading a tier migration log from the tier migration log information by selecting a specific time; checking if a current tier of the specific area equals a destination tier specified by the tier migration log; and if the current tier is not equal to the destination tier, migrating the specific area to the destination tier.","In some embodiments, the method further comprises keeping the specific area in the current tier if the current tier is equal to the destination tier. The method further comprises storing logical volume information of the logical volumes, which includes logical volume name, logical volume address, media type, RAID group name, and RAID group address. The method further comprises storing virtual volume information of the logical volumes, which includes virtual volume name, virtual volume address, logical volume name, logical volume address, number of access, and access capacity. The method further comprises storing tier and media definition information, which includes tier, media type, and capacity threshold; wherein the current tier of the specific area is determined from the virtual volume information, the logical volume information, and the tier and media definition information. The destination tier is determined with reference to the virtual volume information and the tier and media definition information. A logical volume capacity is calculated from the logical volume address and the capacity threshold from the tier and media definition information; and the destination tier for the area is determined based on the number of accesses to the area and the logical volume capacity. The method further comprises storing tier destination information which includes virtual volume name, virtual volume address, capacity, number of access, access per capacity, current tier, and destination tier, that are organized in a descending order of access per capacity, wherein the tier destination information is created based on the virtual volume information and the media type from the logical volume information.","In specific embodiments, the tier migration log information includes log ID, time, and performance corresponding to the log ID and time, and further includes virtual volume name, virtual volume address, and tier corresponding to the virtual volume name and virtual volume address. The method further comprises, after one of a read access or a write access to an area, updating the number of access to the area. The tier migration log information is updated by inputting the determined destination tier and the time, and performance of access for the area. The performance of access is measured in one of IOPS (Input Output Operations Per Second) or BPS (Bits Per Second).","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a storage system of tier management of data is coupled with a host via a network and it comprises a processor; a memory; a plurality of virtual volumes; a plurality of logical volumes; a plurality of physical media; and a tier control module. The tier control module is configured to set up tier migration log information, which includes selecting an area specified by a virtual volume address and a logical volume address; determining a destination tier for the area based on a number of accesses to the area; and updating a tier migration log information by inputting the determined destination tier and a time. The tier control module is configured to determine whether to migrate a specific area using the tier migration log information, which includes loading a tier migration log from the tier migration log information by selecting a specific time; checking if a current tier of the specific area equals a destination tier specified by the tier migration log; and if the current tier is not equal to the destination tier, migrating the specific area to the destination tier.","Another aspect of this invention is directed to an interface for tier management of data by performing a tier migration log information setup process which includes selecting an area specified by a virtual volume address and a logical volume address, determining a destination tier for the area based on a number of accesses to the area, and updating a tier migration log information by inputting the determined destination tier and a time and performance of access for the area; and performing a process using the tier migration log information to determine whether to migrate a specific area which includes loading a tier migration log from the tier migration log information by selecting a specific time, checking if a current tier of the specific area equals a destination tier specified by the tier migration log, and if the current tier is not equal to the destination tier, migrating the specific area to the destination tier, wherein the current tier of the specific area is determined from tier and media definition information. The interface comprises computer readable program code devices for receiving, from a user, the tier and media definition information which includes tier, media type, capacity threshold, and default tier; displaying the received tier and media definition information on a tier management screen; and displaying an OK button for the user to activate to update the tier and media definition information displayed on the tier management screen.","In specific embodiments, the interface further comprises computer readable program code devices for displaying a restore point selection screen including a plurality of restore points each having a time and a performance of access for an area for a user to select one of the restore points with a time corresponding to the specific time; and displaying a RESTORE button for the user to activate to restore the selected restore point.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following detailed description of the specific embodiments.","In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the disclosure, and in which are shown by way of illustration, and not of limitation, exemplary embodiments by which the invention may be practiced.
