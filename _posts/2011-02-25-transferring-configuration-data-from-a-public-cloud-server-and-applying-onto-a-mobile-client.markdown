No. 61\/436,856, entitled \u201cTRANSFERRING CONFIGURATION DATA FROM A PUBLIC CLOUD SERVER AND APPLYING ONTO A MOBILE CLIENT,\u201d filed on Jan. 27, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","The subject technology relates in general to configuration management, and more particularly to transferring configuration data from a public cloud server and applying onto a mobile client.","In order for a client device having an embedded image to apply changes that persist across a reboot of the client device, manual installation of software or drivers and\/or a firmware update of the entire image may be needed. This process may involve downloading a customized image and installing the customized image on the client device. However, embedded images can be large in size, and thus, it may be impractical to download and install entire images just to apply changes to the images, especially when desired changes are frequent and\/or relatively minor, and\/or when there are a large number of client devices that require these changes, for example, in an enterprise environment.","Examples of methods and apparatus are provided for configuration management. For instance, examples of methods and apparatus are provided for, among others, obtaining a configuration file over a public network and applying a persistent configuration change to a windows-based embedded image with a write-filter running on a mobile client and obviating reinstallation of an entire windows-based embedded image onto the mobile client. The apparatus may include a retrieval module of the mobile client that facilitates locating a remote repository server containing the configuration file. The retrieval module facilitate obtaining the configuration file over the public network from the remote repository server while the write-filter is enabled, while obviating reinstallation of an entire windows-based embedded image onto the mobile client. The apparatus may include an apply settings module of the mobile client that, each time the mobile client boots up, applies a configuration change to the windows-based embedded image while the write-filter is enabled, based on the configuration file or another configuration file.","The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.","Overall System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","102","102","102","102","112","118","114","112","112","112","102","102","112"],"i":["a","b","c","d","e"]},"By way of illustration and not limitation, a client device  can represent a computer, a mobile phone, a laptop computer, a thin client device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable computing device, or a suitable device with a processor. In one example, a client device  is a smartphone (e.g., iPhone, Android phone, Blackberry, etc.). In certain configurations, a client device  can represent a cashier device, an audio player, a game console, a camera, a camcorder, an audio device, a video device, a multimedia device, or a device capable of supporting a connection to a remote server. In one example, a client device  can be mobile. In another example, a client device  can be stationary. According to one aspect of the disclosure, a client device  may be a device having at least a processor and memory, where the total amount of memory of the client device  could be less than the total amount of memory in a server . In one example, a client device  does not have a hard disk. In one aspect, a client device  may comprise flash memory instead of a hard disk. In one aspect, a client device may include one or more client devices.","In a preferred aspect, a client device  is a specific-purpose client device designed for a specific-purpose (rather than a general purpose). In a preferred aspect, a client device  is not a conventional personal computer (PC). In one aspect, a specific-purpose client device may be designed to perform one or a few pre-defined, dedicated functions. For example, a specific-purpose client device may be designed to perform less than 10 dedicated functions, less than 5 dedicated functions, less than 3 dedicated functions, or 1 dedicated function. A specific-purpose client device may be, for example, a client device designed as a cashier machine at a department store, a client device designed to carry out specific tests or measurements, a client device designed to carry out a specific medical application for diagnosis and\/or treatment of a patient, etc. A specific-purpose client device preferably includes a write-filter that is enabled during its normal operation so that if a user (e.g., a cashier, not an administrator) changes any configuration of an embedded image of the client device, such change does not persist across a reboot.","In one aspect, a server  may represent a computer, a laptop computer, a computing device, a database, an in-house server, a repository server, a configuration application server, a domain name system (DNS) server, a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server, a virtual machine (e.g., VMware\u00ae Virtual Machine), a desktop session (e.g., Microsoft Terminal Server), a published application (e.g., Microsoft Terminal Server) or a suitable device with a processor. In a preferred aspect, a server  is stationary. In another aspect, a server  can be mobile. In yet another aspect, a server  can be embedded. In certain configurations, a server  may be any device that can represent a client device. In a preferred aspect, the server  is not a client. In one aspect, a server  may include one or more servers, or functions of one or more servers.","In one example, a first device is remote to a second device when the first device is not directly connected to the second device. In one example, a first remote device may be connected to a second device over a communication network such as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), and\/or other network for remote operations.","When a client device  and a server  are remote with respect to each other, a client device  may connect to a server  over a public network  and\/or the corporate network , for example, via a modem connection, a LAN connection including the Ethernet or a broadband WAN connection including DSL, Cable, T, T, Fiber Optics, Wi-Fi, or a mobile network connection including GSM, GPRS, 3G, WiMax or other remote network connection. The public network  or the corporate network  can be a LAN network, a WAN network, a wireless network, the Internet, an intranet or other remote network. In one aspect, the public network  or the corporate network  may include one or more routers for routing data between client devices and\/or servers. A remote device (e.g., client device, server) on a network may be addressed by a corresponding network address, such as, but not limited to, an Internet protocol (IP) address, an Internet name, a Windows Internet name service (WINS) name, a domain name or other system name. These illustrate some examples as to how one device may be remote to another device. But the subject technology is not limited to these examples.","According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, the terms \u201cserver\u201d and \u201cremote server\u201d are generally used synonymously in relation to a client device, and the word \u201cremote\u201d may indicate that a server is in communication with other device(s), for example, over a network connection(s).","According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, the terms \u201cclient device\u201d and \u201cremote client device\u201d are generally used synonymously in relation to a server, and the word \u201cremote\u201d may indicate that a client device is in communication with a server(s), for example, over a network connection(s).","In one aspect of the disclosure, a \u201cclient device\u201d may be sometimes referred to as a client or vice versa. Similarly, a \u201cserver\u201d may be sometimes referred to as a server device or vice versa.","In one aspect, the terms \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cremote\u201d are relative terms, and a client device may be referred to as a local client device or a remote client device, depending on whether a client device is described from a client side or from a server side, respectively. Similarly, a server may be referred to as a local server or a remote server, depending on whether a server is described from a server side or from a client side, respectively. Furthermore, an application running on a server may be referred to as a local application, if described from a server side, and may be referred to as a remote application, if described from a client side.","In one aspect, devices placed on a client side (e.g., devices connected directly to a client device(s) or to one another using wires or wirelessly (e.g., using Bluetooth having a short range such as 35 feet or Infrared)) may be referred to as local devices with respect to a client device and remote devices with respect to a server. Similarly, devices placed on a server side (e.g., devices connected directly to a server(s) or to one another using wires or wirelessly (e.g., using Bluetooth having a short range such as 35 feet or Infrared)) may be referred to as local devices with respect to a server and remote devices with respect to a client device.","In some aspects, the server  may comprise a repository server , a DNS server , a DHCP server , and a configuration application server . Although the server  is shown as comprising all of these servers, one or more of these servers may be placed outside the server . In some aspects, one or more of these servers may be combined together as a single server. In some aspects, the server  may also be referred to as an in-house server because the server  may primarily operate to communicate with clients , , , and over a private network such as the corporate network . Boundary  may represent the boundary of this private network in which the in-house server  communicates with the clients , , , and . In some aspects, client device and are on the same domain (e.g., as represented by the dotted line ).","In some aspects, at least a portion of the server  may be accessible from the public network . For example, as shown in , the repository server  is accessible from the public network . Thus, the client device may communicate with the server  (e.g., the repository server ) via the public network .","According to various aspects of the subject technology, the clients  may each be running a windows-based embedded image, such as any of the Windows Embedded family of operating systems (e.g., Windows Embedded Compact, Windows Embedded Standard, Windows Embedded Enterprise, Windows Embedded POSReady, Windows Embedded NAVReady, Windows Embedded Server, etc.) or other suitable embedded images.","In general, an embedded image may comprise a write-filter that may prevent one or more changes applied to the embedded image from persisting across a reboot of a client device running the embedded image. For example, an embedded image may comprise a write filter to allow one or more changes applied to the embedded image with the write-filter enabled, to be discarded when the client device is shut down. In some embodiments, the term \u201cshut down\u201d may refer to shutting down a machine. In some preferred embodiments, the term \u201cshut down\u201d may refer to shutting down a machine. In another aspect, it may include logging off from a machine. In some embodiments, as used herein, the term \u201creboot\u201d or \u201crestart\u201d may include situations in which a user logs off and logs back into a client device, or a client device is shut down and then powered back on. In one example, if a user applies a new wallpaper to an embedded image running on a particular client device, the new wallpaper does not remain on the embedded image after that particular client device has rebooted.","The write-filter may be enabled to ensure that a user does not make any permanent changes (e.g., changes that persist across a reboot) to an embedded image of a client device. Enabling the write-filter is beneficial because it allows an administrator to maintain a uniform configuration for all the embedded images of the client devices in a particular system. If a user makes changes to an embedded image of one of the client devices, then only that particular client device needs to be rebooted to reset that embedded image back to the original configuration that is uniform with the other embedded images of the other client devices. Another benefit of enabling the write-filter is that it may prevent harmful changes from being applied permanently (e.g., applied across reboot) to an embedded image of a client device. For example, if a user of a client device accidentally downloads a virus that causes harmful changes to an embedded image of the client device, then only that client device needs to be rebooted to reset the embedded image back to the original configuration that was not harmed by the virus.","However, because of the write-filter being enabled, making a desired change that persists across reboot to an embedded image may be difficult. According to some approaches, in order to apply, to an embedded image, a change that persists across reboot, manual installation of software drivers and\/or a firmware update of the embedded image is performed to create a customized embedded image having the desired change. The customization may typically occur at the server side (e.g., at the server ), and the entire customized embedded image is deployed to a client (e.g., the client device ). Thus, customization of an embedded image may involve transferring an entire customized embedded image from a server  to a client device  and\/or installing the entire customized image on the client device . However, an embedded image can be large in size. For example, Windows embedded images may need a minimum flash size of 2 gigabytes (GB) (e.g., for the Windows Embedded Standard 2009) and a maximum of 4 GB (e.g., for the Windows Embedded Standard 7). Thus, transferring and installing images at such sizes may be impractical, especially when desired changes are frequent and\/or relatively minor or when it involves a large number of client devices.","For example, in a large cashier system comprising over 100 cashier machines as client devices, if an administrator wants to install a new cashier program on each embedded image running on each cashier machine, then the administer may need to create a customized embedded image having the new cashier program at a server, and then transfer the customized embedded image, from the server, to each cashier machine for installation. If the customized embedded image is large in size, then transferring this image to each of the 100 cashier machines would be cumbersome. Furthermore, if the administrator desires to make frequent changes, then a new customized embedded image may need to be transferred to each cashier machine each time a change is made.","According to various aspects of the subject technology, after boot up of a client device  is initiated, a change may be automatically applied to an embedded image of the client device  without intervention by a user of the client device , thereby making the change appear to the user to be persistent across a reboot of the client device . Thus, aspects of the subject technology obviate reinstallation of an entire embedded image with the change onto the client device , and the problem of downloading and\/or installing large images onto the client device  may be avoided. According to certain aspects, a configuration file may be used to apply such a change to the embedded image. The configuration file may contain information related to one or more desired changes to be applied to the client device . For example, the configuration file may contain instructions to apply the one or more desired changes, parameters related to the one or more desired changes, driver information related to the one or more desired changes, application information related to the one or more desired changes, and\/or other suitable information. In some aspects, a client device  may download a configuration file from a server  and\/or apply, to the embedded image of the client device , a configuration change based on the configuration file each time the client device  boots up. In one preferred aspect, transferring the configuration file and applying a configuration change in this manner is critical because any changes made according to the configuration file may appear to be persistent to a user of the client device  even though the changes may not be retained on the client device  when the client device  shuts down or is logged off (because of an enabled write-filter). Such an arrangement may make the client device  independent and self-provisioning, and therefore, transferring and\/or installing large customized images onto the client device  may be advantageously avoided.","According to certain aspects, the configuration file may be automatically obtained from a server . For example, the configuration file may be stored in the repository server . In some aspects, the repository server  may be a part of the configuration application server . In some aspects, the configuration file may be automatically obtained from the remote repository server  or a configuration history folder (e.g.,  in ) stored on the client device . In some aspects, the configuration file may be a default configuration file. In some aspects, the obtained configuration file may be compared to a previous configuration file that was last used to apply one or more changes (associated with the previous configuration file) to the embedded image. When the changes are successfully applied to the embedded image, such changes may be referred to as last successfully applied changes. For example, if a change is a modification of the screen resolution to 1680\u00d71050 pixels, and if the client device supports such a resolution, then the change would be successfully applied. In some aspects, a last successfully applied change may be understood as the change is compatible with, or is supported by, the embedded image and\/or a client device . If the obtained configuration file is the same as the previous configuration file, then the last successfully applied change is re-applied, and it would appear to the user that the change persists across reboot of the client device .","According to certain preferred aspects, providing an option of applying a last successfully applied change is beneficial because it ensures that at least one configuration change can be applied to an embedded image, especially if a new change that is desired to be applied is not compatible with, or is not supported by, the embedded image and\/or the client device . Furthermore, providing an option of applying a last successfully applied change is beneficial because it can allow a user to revert back to the last successfully applied change, especially if a new change that was applied is no longer desired.","According to various aspects of the subject technology, a configuration file may be an extensible markup language (XML) configuration file or any other suitable files. In a preferred aspect, a configuration file is an XML configuration file. In some aspects, an XML configuration file may refer to an XML-based configuration file. In some aspects, an XML configuration file may comprise some or all of the following types of settings: 1) remote desktop connections settings, 2) device settings, 3) operating system (OS) settings, and 4) common settings. The remote desktop connections settings, which may also be referred to as connections tags, may define settings for remote desktop protocol (RDP), independent computing architecture (ICA), VMware View, and other suitable remote desktop connections. The device settings may define settings for displays, keyboards, mice, networks, audio, power, wireless connections, or other suitable settings of a client device . The OS settings section may define settings for Aero, Firewall, a web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer (IE) or other suitable web browsers), one or more clocks, or other suitable settings of a client device .","According to certain aspects, a configuration file may conform to a suitable schema. For example, an XML configuration file may conform to an XML schema definition (XSD) file. XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document (e.g., an XML configuration file) conforms in order to be considered valid according to that schema. In some preferred aspects, using an XML configuration file is essential because it allows the XML configuration file to be validated against the XSD file to ensure that the XML configuration file is in a proper format that is compatible and\/or supported by a client device. The proper format can allow a configuration change based on the XML configuration file to be applied correctly to an embedded image of the client device. Without such a proper format, it may not be possible to apply the configuration change correctly. In some aspects, validating the XML configuration file using the XSD file before the XML configuration file is transferred and\/or applied can prevent a XML configuration file in an improper format from being unnecessarily transferred and\/or applied, thereby beneficially saving resources and time.","Overall Methods",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","202","204","206","102","112","104"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0088"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["1","300","102","302","304","300","306","300","308","102","104","112","102","102","102"],"i":["a ","a","a","a ","a","a ","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0090","num":"0089"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":["2","300","300","306","300","308","110","104","112","102","300","110","104","112","102"],"i":["b ","b ","b","b ","b","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0091","num":"0090"},"figref":"FIG. 3C","b":["301","302","1","302","2","302","3","310","4","1","108","2","106","3","112","102","4","102","102","102"],"i":["c","c ","d ","e ","c "]},"In one example, configuration data may be transferred from the server  to a client device , and then be applied on the client device . The configuration data may be transferred using any of Method B-, Method B-, and\/or Method B- (preferably in this order, or in another order). Otherwise, Method B- may be used. For example, if a client device  fails to connect to the server  using DHCP, DNS or local registry values, then configuration settings from a factory default configuration file may be applied. According to certain aspects, a module that implements method Smay be a part of a module referred to as Hagent_UI.exe.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 3D","b":["1","300","300"],"i":["d ","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":"FIG. 3E","b":["2","300","302","304","300"],"i":["e ","e","e","e "]},"In some aspects, a configuration file may specify whether to reset a previous state of the embedded image. If the configuration file specifies a reset be applied, then a default configuration is applied to the embedded image before a configuration change based on a new configuration file (e.g., a retrieved configuration file) is applied to the embedded image. This is beneficial in situations where a completely new configuration is desired while an old configuration is not needed anymore. For example, if a user of a client device changes from a first job to a second job within the same company but retains the client device for use, then the client device can be reset to completely remove any applications on the client device that were directed to the first job. A new configuration (e.g., adding applications directed to the second job) can then be applied to the client device. In some aspects, if the configuration file does not specify a reset, then the configuration change based on the new configuration is applied to the embedded image while disallowing the default configuration from being applied to the embedded image. Applying the new configuration while disallowing the default configuration from being applied is beneficial because it may allow new changes to be appended to an existing configuration of the embedded image.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0095"},"figref":"FIG. 3F","b":["3","300","302","304"],"i":["f ","f","f"]},"Client Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["102","430","406","408","410","412","414","416","418","422","424","426","428","430","402","404","426","420","410","412","414","102","428","102","118","114"]},"In a preferred embodiment, the modules (e.g.,  through ) are implemented in software (e.g., subroutines and code). In another embodiment, some or all of the modules may be implemented in hardware (e.g., an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), a Programmable Logic Device (PLD), a controller, a state machine, gated logic, discrete hardware components, or any other suitable devices) and\/or a combination of both. Additional features and functions of these modules according to various aspects of the present disclosure are further described in the disclosure.","In one example, an embedded image of a client device  may comprise the operating system module  and some or all of the following: modules , , , and .

A write-filter of the image may need to be disabled, software\/drivers may need to be installed, appropriate configurations may need to be set, and the write-filter may then need to be enabled. After this process, the firmware on the client may need to be pulled from a remote server. This firmware image may be of a large size and may need to be pushed to all the appropriate clients using the customized firmware change.","To prevent this process of a large firmware from being pushed on multiple clients over a network, drivers\/applications to be installed may be specified in a configuration file. In some aspects, the applications may also be stored along with the configuration file. As soon as a client boots up, a retrieval module (e.g., Hagent_UI.exe) may download the configuration file and use an apply settings module (e.g., ClientApp.dll) to parse the configuration file, check for differences (e.g., deltas) between a previous configuration file and the newly downloaded configuration file, and download and install an appropriate application\/driver.","Configuration Application Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0104","num":"0103"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["110","504","506","508","110","114"]},"Retrieving a Configuration File",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0106","num":"0105"},"figref":"FIGS. 6A through 8B","b":["1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0106"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["1","600","104","602","108","600","104","604","104","606","408","600"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0107"},"figref":["FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A"],"b":["408","426","408","104","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0109","num":"0108"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["\u201cDHCPServerTag\u201d=\u201c161\u201d","for server IP (e.g., IP address of a"]},{"entry":[{},"repository server where a configuration"]},{"entry":[{},"file is located)"]},{"entry":["\u201cDHCPPathTag\u201d=\u201c162\u201d","for the location of the configuration file in"]},{"entry":[{},"the server"]},{"entry":["\u201cDHCPUsernameTag\u201d=\u201c184\u201d","for a username to be used for"]},{"entry":[{},"authentication"]},{"entry":["\u201cDHCPPasswordTag\u201d=\u201c185\u201d","for a password for the username to be"]},{"entry":[{},"using for authentication"]},{"entry":["\u201cDHCPProtocolTag\u201d=\u201c183\u201d","for the type of protocol to be used in"]},{"entry":[{},"downloading the configuration file"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"The retrieval module  may also validate the DHCP tag values.

To achieve this objective, SMBs may perform four activities: 1) configuration management; 2) imaging; 3) packaging; and 4) scheduling. Aspects of the subject technology provide configuration management for SMBs. One objective of configuration management is for information technology (IT) administrators to easily configure their Windows based thin clients and get them configured for their users in the least amount of time possible. Currently, this may be done via customizations in the image, which may be pulled and then deployed. This can become time consuming because image files (e.g., Windows-based image files) are large. In addition, customization changes may occur frequently per user, and hence, this consuming process may need to be repeated. Aspects of the subject technology provide configuration management, wherein only a single image from the factory is installed onto the thin clients, while all customizations may be pushed from a single configuration file rather than an entire image.","According to certain aspects of the subject technology, a configuration manager may provide an out-of-box experience, supportability, and personalization. With respect to the out-of-box experience, upon IT administrators receiving embedded thin clients (e.g., Windows embedded thin clients), customers are able to boot directly into Windows, and have all global configurations pushed onto the Windows thin clients, from either a local or a remote source. A customer may also be able to create a configuration of their choice, by exporting an already configured image (via OS) or by using a configuration editor application (e.g., Configuration Application Module  and\/or ). In some aspects, the user or IT administrator does not have to update the image to get any general functionality working.","With respect to supportability, an IT administrator may be able to keep supporting changes in global or user configurations throughout the support lifecycle of a thin client. This may also apply to any configuration changes needed once the support lifecycle for a particular user is over. Features are provided that allow for the IT administrator to easily keep track of any configuration changes made on a particular device. Furthermore, in addition to configurations related to the device, the IT administrator may also change policies on the client that are configuration manager specific to allow for flexibility and fault tolerance.","With respect to personalization, upon a user logging into his\/her IT environment, thin clients may gather domain-joined user specific profile's configurations, either locally and\/or from a network. The granularity of OS, device, and network settings may allow for the user to have a completely personal experience on a thin client. The user may be productive the moment the user logs onto the thin client because the user-specific corporate or preferred configurations may have already been applied with little or no down-time.","The following scenarios may be implemented by the subject technology. In a first scenario, an administrator has three thin clients in his possession. He opens one thin client and configures this client as he desires (e.g., he may change the wallpaper, RDP connecting via TS, and IE favorites). He can export the configuration file and place it on an FTP server (which can be, for example, the repository server  and\/or the configuration application server ). He can then open the other two clients, connect them via an Ethernet cable and power the two clients up. The remaining two clients may pick the configuration posted on the FTP server through DHCP.","In a second scenario, an administrator has three thin clients that are powered up and already domain joined. Three separate configuration files for three users, respectively, have already been created. These configuration files have different wallpapers, RDP connections (through TS), and IE favorites from one another. The administrator may place the configuration files in respective user's specific folders on an FTP server (which can be, for example, the repository server  and\/or the configuration application server ). He may log in to the three clients as three different users. Each of the three clients may pick up the user configuration specific to the user.","In a third scenario, an administrator may receive a support request from a user to add a new browser favorite and to lower the display resolution (e.g., to 1280\u00d71024 pixels). The administrator may obtain the specific user configuration file, open it up using the configuration capture module , change the display resolution to the desired display resolution, and add in the web browser favorite. The administrator may save this configuration, and place the corresponding configuration file in the user's specific folder on an FTP server (which can be, for example, the repository server  and\/or the configuration application server ). The administrator may then ask the user to log off and log in again. The updated user settings may then be picked up by the thin client of the user using DHCP.","In a fourth scenario, an administrator may receive another support request from the same user in the third scenario. The user may not like the new resolution and request the old resolution to be re-applied. The administrator may then ask the user to open the control panel applet (e.g., the user interface application module ), click on the configuration history tab, click on the previous configuration history, and hit apply in order to return the user's settings back to the previous configuration.","In a fifth scenario, a user has a mobile thin client and would like to access his configuration from his home network. To achieve this, the specific user's configuration file is placed on an HTTP server (on DMZ) by the administrator (e.g., this contains the same configuration as the user.xml.) The user may log onto his thin client (e.g., which may be a laptop) and wait for the client to connect over wireless to the home network. The new updated user settings may be picked up by the mobile thin client by HTTPS on the home network.","In a sixth scenario, a user now has changed his office location permanently and no longer needs the thin client he is using. Thus, the administrator may take back the client. The administrator may configure the same client for another new user. The administrator may open up a stand-alone configuration manager (e.g., the configuration application module  and\/or ) and make relevant changes for that specific new user (e.g., settings related to RDP, IE, the wallpaper). The configuration file, as created or edited by the stand-alone configuration manager, may indicate that the thin client wipe out any previous settings before applying the settings from this particular configuration file. The administrator may copy the configuration file onto a USB key, open the control panel applet, select the import configuration option, select the local option, specify the path of the configuration file, and click on the \u2018Import\u2019 button. In this case, the existing thin client configuration may be wiped out, and the new configuration may be applied locally from a USB key.","According to certain aspects, a Windows thin client may obtain and apply configurations from remote locations (e.g., FTP server and\/or HTTP server) via DHCP, DNS, and\/or other suitable methods. In addition, an administrator may be allowed to place the location of the FTP or HTTP server via an IP address or a friendly name. An appropriate message (e.g., a balloon tip at the bottom right of a system tray of an OS) may be displayed to the user when a configuration is being applied (and hence the system state is being changed).","In some aspects, DHCP may be used by default when obtaining configurations from remote locations. If DHCP does not work via the default option tags, then the location (e.g., via the IP address or the friendly name) specific in the client may be used. If even the location specified in client does not work, then local default settings may be applied.","According to certain aspects, a thin client may also have the ability for an administrator to configure the client locally using user interfaces provided by the operating system and to export that configuration locally onto a flash or a USB drive.","According to certain aspects, a configuration manager, by default, may be able to push updated configurations to an already configured device. These updates may be subsets of a full configuration. When pushing updated configurations, only those settings that are part of the update may change without changing the overall state of the device. In some aspects, configurations being pushed on thin clients may also be able to reset (e.g., \u2018wipe-out\u2019) the existing configuration on the thin clients and then apply the new configurations. The particular configuration may depend on the \u2018reset\u2019 tag that comes from the configuration definition file. These features may be implemented, for example, using method S.","In some aspects, the configuration history may be exposed to an administrator per thin client. This may be the last five successfully applied unique configurations on a particular thin client, although more or less configurations may be stored in the configuration history (e.g., in the configuration history folder ). An administrator may be able to select any configuration exposed as part of the configuration history and successfully apply it. The configuration history may store configurations for domain-joined and non-domain-joined users. According to certain aspects, no two configurations in the configuration history may be the same (e.g., if the exact same configuration file is being applied over and over on the same thin client, multiple entries of the same configuration may not need to be stored within the configuration history and only the time stamp of the applied configuration may need to be updated).","According to certain aspects, an option to apply the last successfully applied configuration may be allowed. In some aspects, an application (e.g., the configuration application module  and\/or ) for IT administrators to create, view, and edit\/update configuration files may be provided to ensure ease-of-use in working with the number of settings\/configurations by providing a human readable format for all settings.","According to various aspects of the subject technology, a domain-joined user may be able to access or set his\/her preferred settings either locally or from a network. Local settings may be specific to hardware, such as preferred graphics resolution, keyboard\/mouse settings etc. Network level settings may be specific to user profile, the presentation layer, and domain. This may allow users to log in to the same terminal, and give each user a personalized experience reflective of the user's preferences for as long as the user uses that terminal.","Settings that may be applied on a client may fall into the following categories: 1) presentation layer settings (e.g., ICA, RDP, View, etc.); 2) device settings; and 3) OS settings. In some aspects, all chosen settings by an administrator may be applied when a system of clients is locked and before users see their desktops upon logging in. In some aspects, the settings may be applied in less than ten seconds.","With respect to presentation layer settings, a user's presentation layer environment and settings (e.g., .rdp file) may be placed on the user's desktop. An administrator may be able to allow a thin client to boot in a way such that the administrator-selected protocol may only be used as a connection broker upon logging in. This may ensure that the USB stacks support for View, RDP, and ICA do not conflict when using software such as HP remote graphics (e.g., RGS).","The following presentation layer settings for RDC (e.g., based on RDC 7) may be supported:\n\n","The following presentation layer settings for ICA (e.g., based on ICA 11.2) may be supported:\n\n","The following presentation layer settings for VMWare View may be supported:\n\n","According to various aspects of the subject technology, a primary purpose of OS settings may be to ensure that the operating system is in a best possible state for an end-user to use and be productive, and for an IT administrator to reduce support calls\/costs. Whenever applicable, the OS settings listed below may have volatile\/persist options. The volatile option may imply that the respective setting does not persist upon reboot, while the persist option may imply that the respective setting persists upon reboot.","According to certain aspects, the following OS settings may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to a web browser such as IE may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to a keyboard may be supported: keyboard repeat delay, repeat rate, and cursor blink rate.","The following OS settings with respect to mouse settings may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to IP v4 may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to wireless settings may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to audio settings may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings with respect to power settings may be supported:\n\n","The following OS settings may be supported:\n\n","According to various aspects of the subject technology, the configuration manager provided may provide two applications with user interfaces: 1) a stand-alone application (e.g., the configuration application module  and\/or ) and 2) a control panel applet (e.g., the user interface application module  comprising the configuration capture module , the retrieval module , the reset check module , the configuration comparison module , the apply settings module , and\/or the configuration history folder .)","In some aspects, the stand-alone application may be used primarily for creating and\/or editing configurations (e.g., based on the settings listed above), and also for viewing already created configurations. This application may run on various Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 (Professional and\/or Enterprise), WEST, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. In some aspects, the stand-alone application, when running on a PC or a server based Windows OS, may only run in create, edit, and view modes. In some aspects, when the stand-alone application is running on a Windows thin client, for example, two additional functions may be exposed: 1) capture thin client settings and display them in a human readable format; and 2) apply settings from any configuration file.","According to certain aspects, the stand-alone application may support configuration history functionality. For example, the last ten successfully created\/viewed\/edited configurations on a non-thin-client device may be stored, although a greater number or a fewer number of configuration histories may be stored. On a thin client device, the stand-alone application may leverage the last five successfully applied configurations (e.g., same as what is exposed in the control panel applet, as described below).","According to various aspects of the subject technology, the control panel applet may be used primarily for: 1) importing (applying) configurations from local and remote locations; 2) exporting current system configuration to a local flash or USB drive; and 3) viewing\/applying configurations stored in the configuration history (e.g., configuration history folder ). For importing (applying), an administrator may be able to provide the actual IP address or friendly name of a FTP\/HTTP server. For exporting, the configuration may be exported to a local storage or USB drive. However, the configuration may be exported to other suitable locations. For viewing\/applying, the configuration history may be exposed to an administrator per thin client, as discussed above. Furthermore, options to specify custom DHCP option tags may be available in this the control panel applet for vendor tag, port, protocol, IP address etc.","Example of Implementation of Subject Technology","According to various aspects of the subject technology, a configuration manager is provided that may be compatible with WES 7 clients, WES 2009 clients, or other suitable clients.

In some aspects, this path is ensured to be in the file-based write-filter exclusion list. A configuration history folder (e.g., a snapshots folder) may exist under c:\\Program Files\\Wyse\\ConfigMgmt, for example.

In the USB pen drive transfer scenario, a company may be a small unit and may be limited in monetary resources. In this case, the control panel applet can be used to configure devices. For example, an administrator may configure a device thin client with specific requirements. The administrator may want to deploy this to ten other thin clients. Thus, the administrator can open the control panel applet, export the configuration to a USB pen drive, plug that USB drive to another thin client, and import the configuration using the control panel applet.","In the stand-alone\/remote mode scenario, multiple clients may need to be configured from a remote repository. In this scenario, an administrator may select the remote option (e.g., as shown in ) and fill in the data related to remote IP and remote path. The administrator may select either FTP, HTTP, or HTTPs and click on a \u201cDownload and Apply\u201d button. These settings may be saved after clicking on the \u201cDownload and Apply\u201d button.

This application can be used to edit an existing configuration file as well. The created\/edited configuration file can be used to apply the configuration either in stand-alone mode or in remote mode.","According to certain aspects, the retrieval module  (e.g., which may also be referred to herein as Hagent_UI.exe) may be an engine that that runs at startup of a client device . This engine may look at the registry values under [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wyse\\ConfigMgmt] or other suitable registries. Depending on the protocol, the engine may import configurations. If the protocol is local, then an ActiveXML may mention a path of an XML configuration file to be applied.

If the remote settings are not configured (e.g., from the control panel applet), the connection fails, or the configuration file does not exist on the server, then the engine may fall back to the locally stored WES7Config.xml.","For example, on a server, using IIs, suppose an administrator sets CAPyramid as the virtual directory. Then the engine may expect a Wyse\\WES7 folder to be existing under C:\\Pyramid. Thus, if HTTP or HTTPs is selected and if login is local and no path is specified, then the engine may look for a configuration file named WES7Config.xml under C:\\Pyramid\\Wyse\\WES7.
