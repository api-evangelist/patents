title: Bioreactor processing method within a tank internally chambered to sequentially perform biological treatment and membrane filtration
abstract: Wastewater is delivered to a single tank of a bioreactor system to undergo biological treatment. After undergoing such biological treatment, the wastewater is centrifugally separated outside the tank into contaminated portions with lowered and increased concentration of solids therein to respectively undergo filtration within a small volume chamber of the tank and continuous return to a large volume chamber for biological retreatment during operation of the bioreactor system. Under different conditions of the wastewater delivered to the tank, one of the separated portions of the biologically treated wastewater is disposed of by direct discharge in by-pass relation to the small chamber when delivery thereof into the small chamber is interrupted under selective valve control.

No. 10\/263,287, filed Sep. 25, 2002.","This application benefit is a divisional application of U.S. Non Provisional application Ser. No. 10\/263,286 filed Sep. 25, 2002, entitled \u201cBIOREACTOR TANK INTERNALLY CHAMBERED TO SEQUENTIALLY PERFORM BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT AND MEMBRANE FILTRATION,\u201d now U.S. Pat. No. 6,752,921, incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates generally to bioreactor processing within a tank, involving filtration through membranes after biological treatment to remove solid contaminants.","Membrane bioreactor systems have been utilized on-board commercial vessels to treat influent waste such as wastewater derived from various sources so as to: (a) eliminate perturbations in flow and temperature, (b) reduce biochemical oxygen demand, (c) reduce total suspended contaminating solids and (d) reduce fecal coliform concentration. Such systems involve collection of raw, non-oily wastewater fed into a tank for processing by membrane filtration and biological treatment to induce growth of the aerobic bacteria therein, promoted by aeration and carbon dissolved in the wastewater embodied in the solids carried therein. The wastewater so processed is withdrawn with reductions in biological oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and fecal coliform concentrations.","The maximum organic and hydraulic load capability of such bioreactor systems is limited by size of bioreactor tanks, concentration of contaminating solids within the wastewater being processed and the number of membranes through which permeate filtration is performed. While performing filtration on wastewater with or near the maximum allowable solids concentration therein, in a bioreactor system having a reduced size for shipboard installation, fouling of the membranes associated therewith increases so as to limit their operational life and require frequent cleaning and\/or replacement. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to reduce temporary and permanent fouling of the membranes associated with such bioreactor systems so as to provide a more viable processing method, especially on-board sea vessels having limited installation space.","In accordance with the present invention, a single tank of a bioreactor system is internally partitioned into a volumetrically large chamber within which biological treatment of wastewater contaminated by solids suspended therein, is continuously performed, and a volumetrically small chamber within which membrane filtration is performed after the treated wastewater collected within the small chamber undergoes separation between portions thereof by a dewatering device, located outside of the tank. Separation of such portions of the wastewater respectively increases and lowers contamination so that the portion with lowered contamination may undergo the filtration into a cleansed effluent to be withdrawn. Such system involves maximized removal of suspended solids during processing of the wastewater contaminated under different conditions. Selectively controlled valve means is associated with the system in order to interrupt performance of the membrane filtration within the small chamber of the tank, while the separated portion with increased contamination is continuously recycled into the large chamber for biological retreatment. Also, some of the separated portion of the wastewater with the lowered contamination is disposed of by direct discharge through the dewatering device in by-pass relation to the tank, when the contamination condition does not require membrane filtration.","Referring now to the drawing in detail, apparatus of a bioreactor system  is illustrated in , involving use of a single collection tank  into which a contaminated fluent biomass, such as raw feed streams of non-oily wastewater, is fed through an inlet  under pressure of a pump  from sources , such as showers, sinks, toilets and urinals on-board a sea vessel within which the system  may be installed. Such wastewater feed streams enter a top  of the tank  through the inlet  for collection therein on opposite sides of a weir plate  internally partitioning the tank  into a volumetrically smaller chamber enclosing an assembly  of membranes immersed within wastewater having its contamination lowered and a larger volume chamber within which aeration by an aerator  promotes biological treatment. The wastewater with a lowered concentration of contamination solids inside the smaller chamber is filtered by permeation through the membranes of the assembly , under suction applied by a pump , to withdraw a permeate as a cleansed effluent, having substantially little or no contaminating solids therein. Biologically treated wastewater is recycled under pressure of a pump  from a bottom  of the larger chamber into the smaller chamber through a dewatering device , from which a portion of the wastewater with the solids concentration lowered is separated from another portion with an increased solid concentration as a result of centrifugation. The pump  withdraws the biologically treated wastewater from the bottom  of the larger volume chamber of the tank  underlying the aerator , so as to recycle the biologically treated wastewater outside the tank  through the dewatering device  for delivery of the separated portion thereof with the lowered solids concentration through a valve  into the smaller volume chamber of the tank , within which it undergoes membrane permeation. The wastewater portion having the increased solids concentration separated by the dewatering device  from the lowered solids concentrated wastewater portion, is continuously returned through a recycling conduit  from the dewatering device  into the larger volume chamber so as to elevate the suspended solids concentration therein, which undergoes biological retreatment. The wastewater undergoing such recycling, is maintained at a surface level within the larger chamber lower than that in the smaller volume chamber, as shown in . The wastewater within the smaller volume chamber accordingly overflows the weir plate  into the larger volume chamber as indicated by the curved arrow . By the membrane permeate filtration within the smaller tank chamber, the solids are finely separated therein, and withdrawn therefrom by the pump . The in-feed flow rate of wastewater into the tank  through the inlet  allows the aforementioned overflow  of the wastewater into the larger volume chamber, within which the wastewater surface is maintained at the lower level below the top of the weir plate , as shown in . By virtue of aeration within the larger volume chamber of the tank  by the aerator , aerobic bacterial growth is promoted during biological treatment so as to enhance the permeation through the membranes in the assembly  to more fully cleanse the wastewater being withdrawn by the pump  as an effluent.","The contamination of the wastewater to be processed, will depend upon the condition of the seawater through which a sea vessel travels, when the bioreactor system  is installed therein. With the seawater under restricted or regulated conditions during location of the sea vessel near shore for example, processing may not require or call for membrane filtration. Since processing by the bioreactor system  involves exposure of the wastewater after biological treatment in the large chamber to ultraviolet radiation by the aerator , system size and tank volume requirements are thereby reduced while successfully processing wastewater contaminated by a high solids concentration within the tank . Also, clarification of the collected wastewater at its expected and achievable delivery inflow rate into the tank  through the inlet , will be dependent upon the number of membranes within the assembly , which may accordingly be selected in order to accommodate needs such as the size of a crew on-board the sea vessel.","Because of the aforesaid lowering of solids concentration of a separated portion of the wastewater during passage through the dewatering device , the other separated portion of the wastewater with increased solids concentration is recycled by the pump  into the large chamber to undergo biological retreatment. Membrane permeation within the small chamber by the assembly  is thereby enhanced under certain contamination conditions of the wastewater delivered to the system . The recycling of wastewater into the small chamber through the valve  is interrupted under selective control as hereinafter explained, when filtration is not required so as to reduce membrane fouling within the assembly  and thereby prolong its operational life.","While a sea vessel within which the bioreactor system  is installed is being propelled through seawater under the aforementioned conditions that do not require solids separation by the membrane assembly  in order to sufficiently cleanse the wastewater, the aforesaid interruption in filtration is achieved by closure of the valve  so as to operationally isolate the small membrane chamber, while a discharge valve  is opened for direct compact disposal of the separated waste sludge portion of the wastewater from the dewatering device  otherwise delivered to the small chamber.","In accordance with functioning of the dewatering device  as generally known in the art, the aforementioned centrifugation is performed therein so as to separate the biologically treated wastewater into the two aforementioned portions, one of which has its solids concentration lowered by passage through a decanter, disk and vane-type centrifuge usually associated with dewatering devices. According to another embodiment, separation of the wastewater into the two portions involves use of dissolved air floatation by lift of solids under pressure of wastewater in-feed and aeration injection, followed by a release of tiny air bubbles adhering to the solids in response to a drop in pressure. The solids are thereby carried in bubbles to the top surface of the wastewater within the smaller in-tank chamber to overflow the weir plate  into the collected wastewater within the larger volume chamber of the tank , maintained at its lower surface level during operation of the bioreactor system .","The bioreactor processing method associated with the apparatus of the bioreactor system , as illustrated in  and summarized diagrammatically in , involves infeed of the wastewater from the sources  by the pump  through the inlet  into the larger volume chamber of the tank  for biological treatment, after which it is recycled by the pump  through the dewatering device  to change contaminating concentration of solids by separation of the wastewater into portions thereof that are respectively returned with increased solids concentration therein into the larger volume chamber through the conduit  for biological retreatment, and under selective control through the valve  the portion with lowered solids concentration is delivered into the smaller chamber so as to undergo membrane filtration within the membrane assembly . Under certain contamination conditions of the wastewater being collected in the tank , that do not require membrane filtration, the separated portions of the wastewater are respectively returned to the large volume chamber for continued biological retreatment, and discharged directly in by-pass relation to the small volume chamber through the opened valve  for disposal.","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
