The demand for rapid change of configuration and capacity is also driving the use of the network fabrics.","The network fabric has typically multiple paths between two nodes in a fabric to provide a load balancing feature and to improve fault tolerance of the network. A node in that has multiple outgoing ports distribute automatically incoming network traffics according to a rule. For example, in a fabric with symmetric topology, when an edge of the fabric receives an IP packet, it makes hash values from the set of the source IP address and the destination IP address of the received packet. The hash values have the same hash length with the number of the multiple paths in the fabric. Mapping the hash values with the multiple paths, the edge node transfers the packet via the corresponding path to the made hash value. In general, the number of the set of the addresses is larger than the number of the multiple paths. Therefore, the network traffics are distributed well randomly to the multiple paths.","However, a failure in a network fabric affects strongly network traffics that are randomly distributed to multiple paths in the fabric. In more detail, the failure affects multiple tenants using the fabric. As an example, we suppose the case of a Web system composed of a Web server, an application server, and an iSCSI target connected sequentially by the fabric. The Web system contains two network links. These two links could be distributed to the multiple paths of the fabric. When two Web systems are connected to and overwrapped on the fabric, one link failure can affect both of the two Web systems even if two links of a system are distributed to the multiple links. For example, as shown in , a link between a Web server and an application server of a Web system and a link between an application server and an iSCSI target of the other Web system can be assigned to the same physical link. Because each of the Web systems is affected even by a single-link failure, both of two tenants of the Web systems suffer a system failure and reduced system availability as shown in . As the complexity of tenant systems increases, the number of tenants affected by a link failure increases.","U.S. Pat. No. 7,903,654 B2 provides a packet classifier and a method for routing a data packet. It discloses load sharing with the routes under Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMPs) and, more specifically, a method of hardware support for ECMP by an indirect coupling between Content Addressable Memory (CAM) and Parameter Random Access Memory (PRAM). It does not address the issues regarding system level availability of the present invention.","Exemplary embodiments of the invention provide a technique to improve the system availability of the systems that have multiple links and are connected to a network fabric. A network fabric system is composed of a network manager and multiple network switches distributing incoming network packets to the multiple connected network switches and has one or more of the following features. The network manager manages memberships of systems, each of which is composed of one or multiple end nodes connected to the network fabric. The network manager also updates the system information according to its administrators' configuration via its management interfaces. The network manager also applies the system information to network switches that stand on the edge of the network fabric and that receive network packets from the above end nodes. The edge network switches distribute the received network packets to multiple paths in the network fabric according to the above system information.","The first embodiment of the present invention is a network fabric system that manages the system's membership according to IP addresses of end nodes connected to the network fabric. The second embodiment is a network fabric system that manages the system's membership according to Virtual LAN (VLAN) ID. The third embodiment of the present invention is a network fabric system that manages the system's membership according to Virtual eXtensible LAN (VXLAN) ID. The network manager configures virtual switches running to apply VLAN ID to VXLAN packets.","In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a switch comprises: a memory storing a first logical group which has a first plurality of IP addresses of a first plurality of ports and is assigned to a first ID (identifier), and a second logical group which has a second plurality of IP addresses of a second plurality of ports and is assigned to a second ID; and a controller controlling to cause a logical path of the first logical group to use a first physical path which is different from a second physical path to be used by a logical path of the second logical group, based on the first ID and the second ID.","In some embodiments, the first logical group is assigned to the first ID by correlating the IP addresses of the first plurality of ports in the first logical group with the first ID; and the second logical group is assigned to the second ID by correlating the IP addresses of the second plurality of ports in the second logical group with the second ID. The controller is configured, for each packet received, to: read a source IP address of the received packet; if the source IP address matches an IP address of the first plurality of ports or the second plurality of ports, determine whether the source IP address is assigned to the first ID or the second ID; if the source IP address is assigned to the first ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the first physical path; and if the source IP address is assigned to the second ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the second physical path; and if the source IP address does not match an IP address of the first plurality of ports and the second plurality of ports, read a destination IP address of the received packet, and determine whether the destination IP address matches an IP address of the first plurality of ports or the second plurality of ports; if the destination IP address matches an IP address of the first plurality of ports or the second plurality of ports, determine whether the destination IP address is assigned to the first ID or the second ID; if the destination IP address is assigned to the first ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the first physical path; and if the destination IP address is assigned to the second ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the second physical path; and if the destination IP address does not match an IP address of the first plurality of ports and the second plurality of ports, calculate a hash value of the source IP address and the destination IP address of the packet, and select an outgoing port according to an order of the hash value based on a correlation between order of hash values and order of paths through a network fabric.","In specific embodiments, the first logical group is assigned to the first ID by correlating VLAN (Virtual Logical Area Network) IDs of the first plurality of ports in the first logical group with the first ID; and the second logical group is assigned to the second ID by correlating VLAN IDs of the second plurality of ports in the second logical group with the second ID. The controller is configured, for each packet received, to: read a VLAN ID of the received packet; if the VLAN ID of the received packet matches a VLAN ID of the first plurality of ports or the second plurality of ports, determine whether the VLAN ID is assigned to the first ID or the second ID; if the VLAN ID is assigned to the first ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the first physical path; and if the VLAN ID is assigned to the second ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the second physical path; and if the VLAN ID does not match a VLAN ID of the first plurality of ports and the second plurality of ports, calculate a hash value of the VLAN ID of the packet and select an outgoing port according to an order of the hash value based on a correlation between order of hash values and order of paths through a network fabric.","In some embodiments, the first logical group is assigned to the first ID by correlating VNIs (VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible LAN) Network Identifiers) of the first plurality of ports in the first logical group with the first ID; and the second logical group is assigned to the second ID by correlating VNIs of the second plurality of ports in the second logical group with the second ID. The controller is configured, for each packet received, to: read a VNI of the received packet; if the VNI of the received packet matches a VNI of the first plurality of ports or the second plurality of ports, determine whether the VNI is assigned to the first ID or the second ID; if the VNI is assigned to the first ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the first physical path; and if the VNI is assigned to the second ID, determine an outgoing port for the packet based on the second physical path; and if the VNI does not match a VNI of the first plurality of ports and the second plurality of ports, calculate a hash value of the VNI of the packet and select an outgoing port according to an order of the hash value based on a correlation between order of hash values and order of paths through a network fabric.","Another aspect of the invention is directed to a computer-readable storage medium storing a plurality of instructions for controlling a data processor to manage network traffic. The plurality of instructions comprise: instructions that cause the data processor to store, in a memory, a first logical group which has a first plurality of IP addresses of a first plurality of ports and is assigned to a first ID (identifier), and a second logical group which has a second plurality of IP addresses of a second plurality of ports and is assigned to a second ID; and instructions that cause the data processor to control to cause a logical path of the first logical group to use a first physical path which is different from a second physical path to be used by a logical path of the second logical group, based on the first ID and the second ID.","Another aspect of this invention is directed to a method of controlling network traffic using a switch that includes a memory and a controller. The method comprises: storing, in the memory, a first logical group which has a first plurality of IP addresses of a first plurality of ports and is assigned to a first ID (identifier), and a second logical group which has a second plurality of IP addresses of a second plurality of ports and is assigned to a second ID; and controlling to cause a logical path of the first logical group to use a first physical path which is different from a second physical path to be used by a logical path of the second logical group, based on the first ID and the second ID.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the following detailed description of the specific embodiments.","In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the disclosure, and in which are shown by way of illustration, and not of limitation, exemplary embodiments by which the invention may be practiced.
