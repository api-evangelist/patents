{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY OF INVENTION","FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This non-provisional claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 to provisional application No. 61\/452,529, titled SOLAR ORIENTED SEMI-MOBILE GENERATION UNIT, filed on 14 Mar. 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.","This invention is directed to electrical power generation systems connected to an electric utility grid and stand alone power generation using solar photovoltaic energy.","Electrical power generation units, for example renewable energy systems such as solar photovoltaic systems, may be connected to an electrical utility grid and also be stand alone power generation, and may provide power to the utility grid. Customers can purchase solar photovoltaic systems, but require specialists to design and install the system. The solar installer designs the system integrating the solar photovoltaic panel, inverter and mounting elements for each individual facility. Subsequently, the installer or subcontractor usually labor installs the system. The solar photovoltaic power generation system may exhibit large variations in design, install and cost of the system at the facility because of area, interconnection, sighting and accessibility, as well as installation costs. Most solar system installations have considered mostly gabled roof tops as locations for the solar system installation. Due to gabled roof orientation being inappropriate for solar orientations at the facility, these facilities may be deemed insufficient for solar power generation. Solar units that are mounted on the ground or flat roof can be oriented to face the sun and can be integrated as part of the ground landscape. If changes or expansion of the system becomes necessary, the installer must re-design or make labor-intensive modifications and calculations to adjust the system to the current needs.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to a solar electrical power generation device, including one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units, each unit can include an adapter to electrically connect to other units, a moveable and adjustable frame supporting at least one of the one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units and an electrical storage device being capable of storing electrical power generated from the one or more power source units. The frame can be moveable from between sites and within a site. The frame can be adjustable to increase or decrease a unit angle in relation to the sun. The units can be capable of connecting to a utility grid or serving as a stand-alone electrical power system, e.g., off the utility grid. In an example, a prefabricated device can mean a standard, single type of device.","Embodiments also relate to a method for generating solar electrical power, including selecting one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units, positioning the one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units on a moveable and adjustable frame, electrically connecting the one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units to one or more of a utility grid, residence, commercial business or electrical storage device and generating solar electrical energy and distributing the energy to one or more of a utility grid, residence, commercial business or electrical storage device.","Embodiments also relate to a method for ordering and designing a site installation of solar electrical power devices as a system for a site. The method can select one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units, position the one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units at the site, e.g., on a moveable and adjustable frame or permanently installed. The method can designate which device is positioned where and provide a layout of the devices inclusive of position and order of installation. In an example, the order of how the power devices are connected to one another in a serial layout or parallel layout with a single electrical output to the load. The method can be used at short-term sites in response to emergency conditions, such as national disasters or military excursions. The method further can set forth how the one or more prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source units are electrically connected to one or more of a utility grid, residence, commercial business or electrical storage device and generating solar electrical energy and distributing the energy to one or more of a utility grid, residence, commercial business or electrical storage device or other energy consumer. The method can further rely on topographical information stored in a database to determine an installation layout. The method can also store the path of the sun and its angel of incidence through the time of day and the days of the year. A customer can be queried by the method, e.g., using a computing system, to input the desired location, the peak power desired, the time and date of peak power and for other pertinent information. The method can confirm at least some of this data input by a customer using data stored or at least accessible by the system.","Embodiments relate to a solar power module system including two or more solar power modules. Each module includes a prefabricated solar photovoltaic power source unit, an electrical adapter; and one or more controllers. Each module is capable of independently generating solar electrical energy and distributing the energy to a utility grid, as a stand-alone system or connecting to another module to form a larger generating system. While the solar power modules can be standardized, the layout of a plurality of solar power modules for an installation site can be individually designed.","The present invention is described with reference to the attached figures, wherein like reference numerals are used throughout the figures to designate similar or equivalent elements. The figures are not drawn to scale and they are provided merely to illustrate the invention. Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide an understanding of the invention. One skilled in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. In other instances, well-known structures or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the invention. The present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and\/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention.","Embodiments of the present invention relate to modular, cost- and design-efficient solar power source units. Embodiments integrate the design and labor off site and deliver prefabricated modular units to the site. Such a design process can reduce installation costs. In an example, the units are of a standard design, e.g., a single design or a limited number (less than ten) designs for a standard installation by the present methods and systems described herein. Multiple units or modules can make up the solar generating system. These systems can be both grid connected and stand alone systems. The solar power units can be connected together to provide a single power output to a load. In an example, one solar power unit is a designated controller to control the output, e.g., signal matching, impedance matching, and control of the other solar power units.","An electrical power generation unit which is connected to an electrical utility grid may be coupled to an energy storage system. In solar photovoltaic power generation, orientation to the sun can be critical to the power generated in various examples. A solar power generating system includes solar module (or panel), inverter and mounting device. The solar power generating unit can be a standardized design, e.g., a single design for all installation layouts, a few designs for all layouts (\u201cfew\u201d can be equal to or less than five or can be equal to or less than three). While the layout at an installation or for each facility is individually designed, the solar power generating unit is a single design or one of the few designs. The layouts of the generating system, as a whole, typically are not duplicated.","Embodiments of the present invention utilize prefabricated solar modular units, in combination with \u201cquick coupled\u201d or \u201cplug and play\u201d electrical connections between units. A single unit is self sufficient to be either grid connected or supply power through battery storage. Each unit can comprise an entire solar power solution or be quickly and easily combined to provide increased electrical output. Moreover, one of the solar modular units can operate as a master to the other units, which operate as slaves. The master unit can be the last in the connected chain of solar modular unit. All the components for power generation may be included in a single module, such as a quick connect to grid breakers, snow removal device, position change for solar orientation, tilting mechanism for optimum solar orientation, storage, inverter and solar panels. Each prefabricated solar unit is stand alone and has the elements of direct current power (DC Power) and alternate current power (AC Power) integrated that can be grid connected as well as standalone systems to power remote and independent facilities. The unit or module can be prefabricated to interact with a number of existing electrical configurations possibly present at a future installation facility or site. For example, the unit can be configured to interact with split phase 120\/240V, 3-phase 208V or 3-phase 480\/277V. A transformer may be utilized to achieve the adaptations on site. The modules can also include an identification code that forces one unit to be a master and the others to be the slaves to the master unit.","This invention is both portable and stationery. The portability can be made using a simple wheel and cart approach or trailer (wheels and hitch for pulling behind vehicle) or mounted on a truck bed to deliver to an installation site. The stationery configuration can be made using concrete foundation footings, anchors, ballasts and the likes. The deployable system harvests available solar and is highly adaptive and portable. Most renewable energy systems are developed with a precise location in mind and then designed for optimal harvesting potential for that specific location. This present invention standardizes the entire solar system and can be easily connected and deployed into buildings or traditional brick and mortar structures and also for Forward Operating Bases (FOBS) and Main Operating Bases (MOBs).","Referring to , a schematic view  of a solar electrical generation system is shown, according to some embodiments. One or more solar electrical power source units  are in electrical contact through connection , such as an adapter. The one or more units  may be supported by frame , such as a moveable and adjustable frame. The units  can be connected in series or in parallel, for example. Each unit may include its own dedicated controller , such as an inverter or a microinverter. In this embodiment, if one unit would malfunction or short out, the controller would prevent the entire string or system of units from going off-line. The units  may be connected to electrical control and regulation components, such as junction box  and optional inverter . The controller  can include electrical connections to output electrical power to solar panel maintenance device, e.g., snow removal devices, wipers, cleaners, communication devices, etc. Such an output can be DC power to power DC motors. With an installation of a plurality of units , the units  are connected together. In an installation, the units  are electrically connected to each other, e.g., a daisy chain or serial connection. The units  can be electrically connected together in a sequence or in a ring. In a further example, some units can be connected in sub-rings with each ring having a master device with such master devices connected together to an installation master unit that will output an electrical signal from the entire group of electrical power generating units . Other than a full, single loop, systems which contain internal loops cannot be called daisy chains. In another installation, the units  are connected linearly with the master unit being at an end of the line and connected to the power system at the installation site.","An optional meter  may be positioned between the electrical control devices and electrical panel  to monitor electrical generation. The electricity generated by the units  may be distributed  to the facility (e.g., home, dwelling, disaster relief center, business or military installation), to a utility grid  or to an electrical storage device . A meter  may be positioned in the system to measure electrical distribution to the utility grid .","The adapter  can be a quick coupling or connect mechanism, outlet or electrical wire and plug, for example. The unit comes with a quick connect mechanism which is an adapter (both female and male) that can be connected through conductors and grounding to utility grid systems. The unit can also be a stand alone system wherein there are outlets in the unit from which the loads can be supplied at the supply voltage and power. The adapter  can conform to rules for connection of the male and female pairs of the adaptors between units  and the other electrical connections. Such rules can force a one-way direction of flow of electrical power from one unit to the next unit until the final unit connects to an external electrical system. These adapter connection rules can also simplify the installation of the units  and improve safety. The adapter  can include a safety enclosure to prevent most people from accessing the electrical connections. The enclosure can further prevent weather from faulting the adapter connection.","The controller  can be one as described in U.S. Published Patent Application 2011\/0012429, filed Sep. 13, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. However if the material incorporated by reference conflicts with the present disclosure, the present disclosure controls interpretation of the present application. The controller  can include at least two power stages, each power stage of the at least two power stages capable of converting DC input power to DC output power; and a controller for dynamically selecting, based on a first DC power, one or more power stages of the at least two power stages for converting the first DC power to a second DC power, for example. The controller  can dynamically select a flyback mode from a plurality of flyback modes for operating the one or more power stages. The flyback mode may be selected based on an input voltage to the at least two power stages. Additionally, the plurality of flyback modes includes a regular flyback mode and a quasi-resonant flyback mode. The controller  can also include an output circuit coupled to the at least two power stages for converting the second DC power to AC power.","The controllers  of the units  can also include a code or identification that labels that controller as either a master device or a slave device. The master controller controls the output from the units  to the panel  or other load. The master controller can sample the electrical signal at the panel  or other load and match the electrical signal from the units  to the signal at the panel  or load. When the units  having the controller are connected together through the adapters, each controller can send its identification code through the connections. The master unit's controller  then registers each of the other units as connected in this installation, which can be a chain as described herein.","The controller  on the master unit can sense an output electrical waveform at the controller's adapter, which is the interface to the exterior electrical system. The waveform being sensed is the exterior electrical system waveform and can sense the voltage, frequency and\/or the phase. The controller  can then establish a reference waveform that matches the sensed waveform. The controller  then controls an output current waveform of the units  (of the entire installation of units) that track the reference waveform. The controller  continues to sense the signal from the exterior electrical system and will revise the reference waveform and, hence its output waveform. If there is a significant difference in the reference waveform and the sensed waveform the controller can stop outputting an electrical waveform to reset the reference and maintain a match with the electrical signal to which the unit is connected.","The master controller  can establish a predetermined current, e.g., a current that will not exceed the rating of the connections, wires, lines, or the exterior electrical system. The output current of the electrical signal from the master controller  tracks the predetermined current. The voltage at the adapter that connects the controller to the exterior electrical system is sensed. If the sensed output voltage is outside a set voltage or waveform range, then electrical output from the master controller  is interrupted or disconnected from the exterior electrical system, e.g., the utility grid or the building electrical system. The master controller , after the output signal is interrupted, can resume output after a few cycles or seconds of the exterior electrical system. The controller  can also take into consideration appropriate regulatory requirements, after the grid is reconnected and a sinusoidal voltage is re-imposed at adapter of the master controller .","The controller  of the solar units  can further include other circuitry that operates to provide safety improvements. The circuitry can serve as a bypass circuit for electrical current through an individual solar unit from a second unit to a third unit, which are both electrically connected to the unit . The circuitry forms a parallel circuit relative to photovoltaic cells. The controller  can sense when a unit  is not supplying power and that unit can be bypassed and can send a request for service. In an example, the circuitry can include a power relay selecting between three positions, bypass, power from current photovoltaic cell only, and combining the electrical energy from upstream units  and the current unit and outputting same downstream.","Referring to , a perspective side view  of a solar electrical generation device is shown, according to some embodiments. A power unit  can be mounted on frame . The frame  can be moveable, such as by utilizing wheels  or a trailer frame. A wheeled unit allows ease of delivery to a site as such a wheeled unit can be loaded on to a train bed or truck bed with ease. Wheeled units can also be moved by small vehicles such as trucks, tractors, ATVs, etc. A unit with wheels allows maneuverability at the installation site using common vehicles that can engage a frame, e.g., using a standard hitch connection. The frame  can also be weighted so that the device has sufficient weight hold the solar electrical energy producing device in the upright position as shown in . In an example, the legs that extend down to the ground hold over half the weight of the solar electrical energy producing device. The frame  can be a standardized frame that holds the photovoltaic panel. In an example, the frame  can be a fixed frame, which is unfolded or constructed from a kit sent to the installation site. The frame can include pipes, angle iron, box metal or rods. In an example, the frames are all of a single design to standardize the installation of the energy producing unit. The frame can be set in a direction facing the path of the sun, generally parallel to the south when the device is in the northern hemisphere. The angle  of the unit in relation to the sun may be adjusted by a tilting mechanism  integrated or attached to the frame  and connected to the energy generation panel. The tilting mechanism  can tilt the face of the photovoltaic panel, e.g., the array of cells, in at least one direction and in an example in two directions. The photovoltaic panel is typically planar and can be tilted in the X-axis, Y-axis, and\/or Z-axis in various embodiments. The frame  can be set in a fixed position once adjusted or subsequently adjusted numerous times. A snow removal device  can be optionally integrated into the frame  or one or more power source units , for example.","Snow removal device  can be powered by a hand crank (e.g., a manually powered device). In an example, the snow removal device  operates automatically, e.g., non-manually. The snow removal device can be operated by wind power or electrical motor. The snow removal device  can be a blower that uses air flow or air pressure, e.g., compressed air, which removes snow from the face or the electricity-generating panel. The snow removal device  can be a mechanical snow remover, e.g., brush, wiper, bar, cloth or other configuration. If a wiper, brush, cloth or other similar device, the mechanism can move vertically along the face of the panel. In a specific example, the mechanism starts at the top of the panel and then moves vertically down the face of the panel and pushes the snow off the bottom of the panel. In a further example, the mechanism can move horizontally across the unit face to remove snow. A compressed air device can be positioned at one or more perimeters of the unit to force the snow in one or more directions, such as downward. In an example, a heater heats the air output by the blower such that heated air is used to remove the snow from the face of the panel. A heating device, such as heated tape, may be implemented around one or more of the perimeters of the unit to melt snow. Each snow removal device  can be powered directly from the local power grid or the local power system. In another example, the snow removal device  is be powered each unit's controller. The devices  can be powered by a system inverter, as an option. By operating the snow removal device, the snow is forced off the panels within a short duration of time. The snow removal device  can be mounted directly on one or more units  or on each frame , for example. The snow removal device  can be configured to remove snow without touching or scratching the unit face (i.e., panels), such as by brushing or wiping within about 1-2 mm of the surface, without physical contact with the face. In a further example, a track is mounted to the front face of the solar power generating devices and the snow removal devices can travel along the track to remove the snow. The track can be positioned along one edge of the unit so that the track and the snow removal device minimally, if at all, interfere with the sunlight impinging on the unit. In a further example, the track can extend off the front face of the unit to remove the snow removal device from the front face.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"],"b":["3100","3110","3110","3100","3110"]},"The electrical power generation unit  also includes an energy storage system, for example, a rechargeable battery  () capable of storing electrical power delivered to the energy storage system as stored energy. Other examples for energy storage can also be used, e.g., a mechanical store, a flywheel, and\/or a closed cycle fuel cell. The energy storage system  is furthermore capable of delivering the stored energy in the form of electrical power. In one realization of the instant embodiment, the energy storage system  can have a maximum capacity for the stored energy. In one realization of the instant embodiment, the energy storage system  is capable of delivering a desired amount of electrical power up to a stored energy delivery rate limit. The delivery rate limit can be a function of the unit , rate of battery output. In a further example, the rate limit is a function of the load or local power system.","Electrical power can be delivered from the power source  to an electrical utility grid , depicted schematically in  and  as electrical utility conductor, through a generated power source meter and switch . The generated power delivery switch  is capable of controlling an amount of electrical power from the power source  delivered to the electrical utility grid . The power delivery switch can be part of a controller at a solar panel unit. The switch  can be programmed to deliver a power signal that matches the power at the connection point, e.g., electrical power panel at a building or a utility power signal. In an example, the switch  is programmed at a remote location prior to delivery of the power source  to the installation site. The embodiment can also include a secondary power generator  to aid in a simulated grid connected system as in . The purpose of the secondary power generator is to supply grid frequency appropriate for the power source and switch . In an example, the switch  includes circuitry to sample the electrical signal to which it is connected and match the signal output from electrical power generation device, e.g., power source . In a further embodiment, the switch is part of the master controller to control the output signal to a load. The slave type solar panel units can be without a switch.","The electrical power generation unit  can also include a snow removal device  that engages the surface of the photovoltaic panel to remove debris, such as snow, from the surface of the photovoltaic panel. The snow removal device  can include a wiper that travels on the panel and can include a rubber blade that engages the surface. The wiper may include a cloth that engages the surface. The wiper can pivot from a single point, e.g., the bottom or side of panel. In another example, the wiper extends along then entire width of the panel. The wiper can travel down the photovoltaic panel to remove snow. In an example, the wiper is positioned so that it does not directly contact the surface of the panel but is closely adjacent face, e.g., within a \u00bc inch. The snow removal device can, in an example, include a heat source, e.g., a heating tape or a blower that can blow warm air on the face of the photovoltaic panel. The snow removal device  requires energy to operate. The energy can come from the controller. In another example, the power is supplied from a separate electrical circuit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["400","401","401","401","401","401","402","401","401","401","401","401","402","401","401","400","401","401","402","401","401","401","401","402","404","400","404","400","404","400"]},"A snow removal device  is positioned on the electrical power generation system . In the illustrated example, a snow removal device  is positioned along a longitudinal side of each solar module A-E. The snow removal device  can also be positioned along the other (left in ) longitudinal side of each solar module A-E. In other examples, the snow removal device  is positioned along the shorter sides of each solar module A-E. As shown in  the shorter side is along the top or the bottom of solar modules A-E. If the snow removal device  is positioned along the bottom edge of the solar modules A-E, then the snow removal device can include a gutter to direct water away from the remainder of the snow removal device  and\/or direct the water to a drain and away from the solar module A, . . . , E, respectively. The controller can control operation of the snow removal device  using instructions received from a remote device or from weather information sensed at the location of the system . The controller can also control the electrical energy output of the system , e.g., up to one kilowatt and less than 15 amps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","501","502","501","401","401","501","501","502","501","501","501","509"]},"Referring to , a perspective view of modular solar power source units mounted on a frame is shown (see  for a front view), according to some embodiments. Individual solar electrical power source units A-D can be mounted on a frame  in a position and angle to maximize exposure to the sun on a daily basis (dawn to dusk angle positioning), seasonal basis or both, for example. Each unit can comprise an electrical adaptor, such as a quick coupling adaptor . The frame  can be trailer or portable unit, such as by utilizing wheels . The frame  can be fixed in place by removing the wheels  or setting a lock mechanism on or near the wheels . In an example, the frame include leveling jacks (not shown), e.g., at each corner of the frame. The jacks can operate to level the frame or tilt the face of the power source units A-D toward the sun. In a further example, the jacks lift the wheels off the ground to assist in at least semi-permanently fixing the position of the frame and, hence, the power source units A-D.","A module can be an individual unit or group of units . Frame supports  and  position the units A-D at the desired angle. Frame bed  can be horizontally tiltable as well. The frame bed  can impart structural rigidity to the frame, either during operation, during transport or both. The frame bed  includes components that when connected together provide rigidity between the lateral side members of the frame and between the side and the front or rear support structures of the frame. Additionally, the frame bed  can support additional equipment, such as the tilting mechanism , for example. Other additional equipment can include satellite positioning, navigational devices (e.g., Global Positioning System devices), other disaster relief devices and supplies.

Solar electrical energy is then generated  and distributed to one or more of a utility grid, residence, commercial business or electrical storage device.","Selecting  can include making a selection according to one or more of the following factors: cost, space, existing electrical support system, position relative to the sun and electrical needs of a facility. The number of units chosen can be initially determined by one or more of these factors. The positioning of the units can be used in selecting the units. As these factors change, one or more additional units or modules may be added to the system with little to no design or re-design costs and minimal installation required.","Selecting  can include requesting the quantity of power desired by the ordering customer, for example, over a computing network. Selecting can also include requesting the location of the installation site. The location can be input as a street address and then matched to a database that includes longitude and latitude data that corresponds to the input street address. The selecting process can further access a topographical map of the land at the proposed installation site. Such topographical data and longitudinal\/latitudinal data can be stored in a local database in a memory accessible by a computing machine. The selecting can still further access visual images of the installation site, e.g., from GOOGLE\u2122 street view or with satellite imagery. This data can be used in the position step, discussed below. If the selecting step determines that there may be an issue with the selection of the number of solar units as selected by the customer, based on any of this data, the selecting step can alert a person to review the order in essentially real-time, e.g., using electronic communication methods to communicate with the orderer who input information into the computing machine executing instructions for at least part of the selecting step, and remote from the installation site.","Selecting  can include determining available incentives for installation of solar energy producing devices and environmentally friendly energy production. The incentives can include rebates from manufacturers or tax incentives (e.g., tax credits) from local, state, of Federal governments. The various incentives can be stored in a database accessible to the order fulfillment computing devices and used to select the appropriate solar modules and devices for installation to maximize the incentives.","Positioning  can include mounting or attaching the units to the frame.

The layout scheme will further include the order of leveling and connection of the solar power generating unit(s) and initial testing of the solar power generating unit(s) as a complete install prior to brining the solar power generating unit(s) online with the building power system or the utility grid. If the installation scheme is for disaster relief efforts, then the layout scheme will include advise on checking for debris or flooding possibility and other possible on-site issues that should be reviewed prior to or while installation is being performed.","Electrically connecting  includes electrically connecting through an adapter, for example. Adapters can be quick couplings , outlets or electrical plugs. Adapters can be male or female depending on each unit's position in a series or string.

The net metering control apparatus  can further include circuitry to match the output signal to a load other than the grid . The load can be an electrical motor, AC alternator, or other electricity user. In an example for North America, the sine wave signal local to the solar module or the net metering apparatus , e.g., at grid , switch , switch  or switch  is sampled. The average frequency for this sine wave is 60 Hz. The output to the grid is matched to the sine wave. The circuitry can include a sniffer circuit that detects the phase and voltage of the signal on the grid. The circuitry can further include a reference oscillator circuit to actively control frequency and power output to achieve the desired line voltage and frequency to match the grid signal.","It will be recognized that the load on the grid may periodically change in frequency, current draw and\/or voltage, the net metering apparatus  can sense these changes and change the output signal to the grid. In another example, the grid is a DC load and the net metering apparatus  will match the power needed but need not match the frequency.
