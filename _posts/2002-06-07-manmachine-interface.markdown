Section 119, to the following applications:\n\n","This patent application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of priority, under 35 U.S.C. Section 120 or 365(c), to application number: PCT\/GB00\/04749, filed on Dec. 8, 2000.","The present invention relates to a man-machine interface, and in particular to a man-machine interface for domestic appliances requiring an inexpensive yet reasonably sophisticated interface.","White goods appliances typically include a low cost interface including one or more mechanical buttons or switches which physically make or break a circuit and one or more rotatable knobs having, typically, a finite number of discrete orientations. Such knobs typically control a potentiometer such that each different orientation causes the potentiometer to present a corresponding resistance to a detector circuit which thereby detects the state of the knob, converts this to a digital value and communicates this to a controlling microprocessor which takes the appropriate action. Alternatively, the knob could be connected to an energy regulator including a bi-metallic strip which bends as it heats or cools to make or break on electrical contact, especially in the case of an electric cooker.","There are a number of problems with such an interface. A physical shaft connects the potentiometer or energy regulator to the outside knob. It is very difficult to seal around such a shaft and so there is usually a risk of contaminants such as water, soap, dirt, etc. gaining access to, and therefore possibly damaging, the potentiometer and the associated electronics. Also, in the case of kitchen equipment, there may be health risks caused by the entrapment of fat or food particles around the shaft. Furthermore, if the knob is to be mounted onto the side of a box in which the potentiometer or energy regulator is mounted, a hole must be preformed (e.g. by drilling) in the correct location on the side of the box for receiving the potentiometer shaft. Similarly, with mechanical push buttons, suitable holes must be preformed through the side of the box where the push buttons are to be mounted. This means that if a manufacturer wishes to produce a similar appliance but with a different arrangement of switches and knobs etc, a new box with different preformed holes must be manufactured, leading to increased manufacturing costs.","The present invention seeks to provide an alternative man-machine interface for such domestic appliances.","According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a man-machine interface for an appliance having multiple user-settable control options, the user interface comprising sensing means for remotely sensing one or more target elements to obtain positional information thereabout, and user actuable control elements including one or more target elements, wherein the appliance is operable to select a control option in dependence on the sensed position and\/or orientation of the user actuable control elements.","Such a man-machine interface permits the electronics or electrical control equipment of the appliance (or at least of the man-machine interface) to be located within an easily sealed box such that contaminants to which one or more of the user-actuable control elements are exposed cannot leak into the sealed box. Furthermore, since no holes need to be preformed to receive the user-actuable control elements, different arrangements of the user-actuable control elements may be affixed to the same sealed box. This permits a single model of a particular type of appliance to employ a large number of different man-machine interfaces each of which may be tailored to provide an intuitive interface for the particular function of the appliance to be controlled via that particular interface. Furthermore, different models of a similar appliance may be manufactured using the same sealed box, the different models being distinguished by differences in the man-machine interfaces.","The man-machine interface may include an inductive sensing arrangement wherein the sensing means includes one or more sensing coils and the target elements include one or more inductive target elements which include a magnetic (or electro-magnetic) field modifying element such as a resonant circuit. An advantage of using an inductive sensing arrangement is that the inductive target elements such as resonant circuits may be manufactured very cheaply. A further advantage is that the same processing circuitry which is used to process signals generated in the inductive sensing coils associated with the man-machine interface may also be used to process similar signals generated by further inductive sensing coils used, together with associated further target elements, to detect values of one or more parameters describing the internal functioning or state of the appliance. For example, the same processing circuitry may be used to monitor the speed of rotation of a motor, the amplitude and frequency of vibration of a washing machine drum, or the level of water within the drum of a washing machine, in addition to monitoring user actuable elements of a man-machine interface. Furthermore, the inductive sensing means can also be used to provide a secure electronic lock or electronic user identification system by recognising a user identification puck comprising a plurality of target elements in a specified positional relationship to one another.","Alternatively, or in addition, the sensing means may include one or more simple contactless magnetic switches such as reed switches which are arranged to respond to the position of one or more user actuable elements which include a magnetic field altering element such as, for example, a bar magnet. Such an arrangement has the advantage of being inexpensive and robust. However, alternative contactless magnetic devices could be used such as those which rely on the Hall effect or which employ Giant MagnetoResistance (GMR).","Preferably, the user-actuable control elements are mounted so as to provide tactile sensory feedback to the user. For example, a knob having a plurality of protrusions or indents may be mounted onto a surface having corresponding indents or protrusions such that the user feels a series of clicks as the knob is rotated. Such an arrangement will increase user confidence that the interface is operating correctly. One advantage of such an arrangement is that the feel and sound of the clicks can be finely tuned so as to give the user optimal feedback (and quality perception) independently of the electrical contacts required by prior art knobs which may be subject to conditions of bounce or electrical sparking.","The sensing coils forming part of the inductive sensing means may be combined with additional circuitry to permit data signals transmitted by a transponder (and most preferably a passive transponder) to be received, demodulated and communicated to a microprocessor. Such downloaded data can be used to set the control settings of the appliance in accordance with the received data, to reconfigure the appliance, to present information to the user, etc.","One advantage of the present invention is that it enables an inexpensive, simple, robust, easily fitted fascia plate to be used to provide all (or at least a large number of) the user-visible aspects of a man-machine interface. For many domestic appliances (such as washing machines), the internal operating elements of a number of different models are very similar, if not identical, and the main distinguishing features between different devices are the user-visible aspect of the man-machine interface. Therefore, by providing the user-visible aspects of the man-machine interface on a separate, essentially modular, component which may be fitted to the rest of the device at a very late stage in the manufacture of the device (even, for example, at a retail outlet), a manufacturer is able to produce a much wider range of \u201cdifferent\u201d models at a much lower cost than that at which it is currently possibly to produce just a small range of \u201cdifferent\u201d models, where each different model must be modified slightly to accommodate the different man-machine interfaces.","In many cases, a very simple, intuitive, robust fascia plate may be provided which satisfies all of the functionality required of the device to which it is fitted. Such an example is described in the third embodiment. Alternatively, the amount of control which a user can exercise over a device may be increased greatly by providing a number of different overlays, each of which may be designed to provide a convenient and intuitive means for allowing the user to input controlling information to the device (in effect taking advantage of the simplicity with which multiple man-machine interfaces may be applied to a device if remotely sensed user actuable elements are employed). The first embodiment described below is an example of such an application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0056"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","10","14","10","12","12","14","16","1","20","10","20","1","100","20"],"i":"a"},"The Man-Machine Interface (MMI)  includes a book  of six loose-leaf ring-bound graphical interface panels , , , , ,  three of which are left panels , ,  and three of which are right panels ,   and which are mounted on a backing plate . The backing plate  is removably affixed to the top of the sealed box  by means of press fit peg fittings , , , . The MMI  also includes a fascia plate  which is removably affixed to the front surface of the sealed box  by means of press fit peg fittings , , , . The fascia plate  includes: a transparent portion  through which nine LEDs \u2013 may be viewed; an on\/off button  for turning the machine between a ready to wash ON state and a standby or \u201coff\u201d state; an open door button  for allowing the drum door  to be automatically opened; a fascia plate ID puck  for identifying the type of fascia plate  currently attached to the sealed box ; and a magnetic temperature control knob  which is rotatable between five different discrete orientations and which, in this embodiment, is used to set the temperature of the wash. As shown in , the temperature control knob  includes an arrow for indicating to the user the current orientation of the temperature control knob  and hence the current temperature setting.","To operate the washing machine  using the MMI , a user loads the drum  with clothes to be washed, closes the drum door  and loads washing powder into the soap drawer . The user then selects an appropriate left panel , ,  depending on the nature of the clothes to be washed. If for example the clothes are made of cotton, the user pulls over onto the fascia plate  both the third and the second left panels ,  to leave the front surface of the second left panel (which is marked cotton) facing the user, with the first left panel  (which is for use when washing woolen garments) remaining on top of the backing plate  (this is the position shown in ). The user then turns the temperature control temperature control knob  until the arrow is pointing towards the desired temperature, as indicated on the second left panel  facing the user.","The user may then select further control options using the right panels , , . For example, with the first right panel , the user can set the duration of various subprogrammes, or simply select either a quick wash or a normal wash; or with the second right panel , the user can specify how the spin cycle is to be performed; or with the third right panel , the user can set a timer  so that the wash programme is carried out at some user specified time in the future (eg. such that the washing programme will finish just before the user returns home from work). To manipulate the controls on any of the right panels, the user simply places the panel into its operative position and then manipulates the appropriate slider bars, buttons and\/or switches provided on those panels (to be described in greater detail below) into the appropriate positions for selecting the desired options. Once the user has set the appropriate control options, the washing cycle can be started by pressing the ON\/OFF button . This will cause the washing machine to either commence washing or to move into a timer-on standby mode (indicated by an LED  as described in greater detail below) and await the designated time before automatically commencing the selected washing programme.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","c ","a","e","e"],"b":["2","210","260","200","210","210","211","350","300","211","350","210","212","210","20","210","213","213","210","300","213","210","300","213","300"]},"The user ID puck (not shown) is used to identify the user to the control system (not shown). Each legitimate user of the machine carries their own individual user ID puck with them and places it in the marked area when they wish to use the machine. The machine  will not function unless a valid user ID puck is detected; this provides security against unauthorised use of the machine. When the machine is sold, ten user ID pucks are provided and five of these only permit low temperature washes to be executed to prevent inexpert users from inadvertently damaging clothes by washing them at an inadvertently high temperature.","The first right hand panel  is a wash programme control panel. As shown in , the panel  includes three sub-programme end time control slider bars ,  and . The first slider bar  is a pre-wash duration slider bar which comprises a puck which is slidable within a track . As shown, a printed scale is provided along the track which marks off 0 minutes up to 2 hours in 20 minute intervals. The user may select the end time of the pre-wash sub-programme by sliding the puck along the track until it comes into registry with the desired end time along the printed scale. A similar slider bar arrangement and is provided for the main wash sub-programme end time control and a slider bar and is provided for a rinse sub-programme end time control. In the example setting shown in , the pre-wash has been set to end after 0 minutes (i.e. there will be no pre-wash), the main wash has been set to end after 40 minutes (so the main wash will have a duration of 40 minutes) and the rinse has been set to end after 1 hour and ten minutes (so the rinse will last for 30 minutes).","The first right hand panel  also includes an embedded identifier puck  which is used to indicate to the control system (not shown) that panel  is currently in the operative position. The panel  also includes a panel on\/off switch  which comprises a puck which is slidably mounted within a track . The switch  can adopt either one of two distinguishable states depending upon the position of the puck within the track . The positions along the track corresponding to these two different states of the switch  are marked \u201cCONTROL ON\u201d and \u201cAUTO\u201d respectively. When the puck is in the position marked \u201cCONTROL ON\u201d, the settings of the sub-programme end time control slider bars are taken into account by the washing machine . When the puck is in the \u201cAUTO\u201d position the settings of the sub-programme end time control slider bars ,  and  are ignored and the washing machine  instead operates using pre-stored default settings for the end times of the sub-programmes. The panel  also includes a quick wash select switch  which comprises a puck which is slidably mounted within a track such that the position of the puck within the track determines which one of two states the switch  is in. The positions along the track are marked \u201cNORMAL\u201d and \u201cQUICKWASH\u201d respectively. When the panel on\/off switch  is located in the \u201cAUTO\u201d position, the washing machine  will consider the position of the quick wash select switch  and it will set the durations of the sub-programmes either to the normal default settings if puck is positioned next to the \u201cnormal\u201d marking or it will set the durations of the sub-programmes to the quick wash default settings if the puck is positioned next to the \u201cquick wash\u201d marking.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"b ","b":["230","240","230","230","210","231","350","232","233","230","231"]},"The second right panel  is a spin control panel including a spin control grid arrangement , an embedded panel identifier puck , a panel on\/off switch  and a max spin slider bar . The spin control grid arrangement  has seven rows marked \u201cREST\u201d, \u201c500\u201d, \u201c700\u201d, \u201c900\u201d, \u201c1100\u201d, \u201c1300\u201d and \u201c1500\u201d and ten columns marked \u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d, \u201c4\u201d, \u201c5\u201d, \u201c6\u201d, \u201c7\u201d, \u201c8\u201d, \u201c9\u201d and \u201c10\u201d. A grid of upstanding pegs  is formed, integrally with the plastics material from which all of the panels  to  are formed, such that each marked row is bordered by two rows of pegs and each marked column is bordered by two columns of pegs. Between any four pegs, a marker puck \u2013may be removably affixed to locate the marker puck at the intersection of any marked column with any marked row. To programme the spin control grid arrangement , a user places one or more of the marker pucks in the desired locations to specify how many minutes (as marked out along the x-axis) a machine should spend at the spin rate marking the intersecting row (as marked out along the y-axis). For example, in the configuration illustrated in , the first marker puck has been placed at the intersection of the third row marked \u201c700\u201d and the second column marked \u201c2\u201d indicating that the spin cycle should commence with a spin at 700 rpm for 2 minutes; the second marker puck has been placed at the intersection of the fifth row and the third column indicating that after spinning at 700 rpm for 2 minutes, the drum should be spun at 1100 rpm for a further 1 minute; the third marker peg has been placed at the intersection of the seventh row and the fourth column indicating that the final part of the spin should be for 1 minute duration at 1500 rpm. In the configuration illustrated, the fourth and fifth marker pucks  d,  e are located in a holding arrangement  which stores unused pucks. The panel on\/off switch  is similar to the panel on\/off switch  of the first right hand panel  such that if the panel on\/off puck is in the \u201cAUTO\u201d position, the spin control grid arrangement  will be ignored and instead the setting of the maximum spin speed slider bar  will be taken into consideration. The maximum spin speed selection slider bar  is similar to the slider bars , ,  of the first right hand panel  and has six settings of \u201c500\u201d rpm to \u201c1500\u201d rpm at 200 rpm intervals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 2","i":"c","b":["250","260","250","210","230","251","350","300","252","253","251","211","210"]},"The third right hand panel  is a timer control panel having: a clock arrangement  including a minute hand and an hour hand ; an AM\/PM switch ; a day-of-the-week slider bar ; an embedded panel identifier puck ; a panel on\/off switch ; and a time set switch . The AM\/PM switch  is used to indicate whether the time shown by the clock arrangement  is morning or afternoon and the day-of-the-week slider bar  indicates the day of the week such that the washing machine  of the present embodiment may be set to come on up to seven days in advance. The timer control panel  can therefore be used to programme the washing machine  to come on at a specified future time by setting the clock arrangement , the AM\/PM switch  and the slider bar  to the desired time and day such that when this user set time and day matches an internal clock and day indication, the washing machine runs the desired wash programme. The panel on\/off switch  determines whether the timer is to be used or not and the set switch  is operable to set the current time and day of the internal clock and day indicator. To do this, a user manipulates the hands of the clock arrangement  to show the current time and ensures that the correct day of the week is indicated on the day-of-the-week slider bar  and sets the AM\/PM switch  according to whether the current time is AM or PM. The user then slides the puck of the set switch  against the bias of spring and holds the puck in this position for a predetermined period before releasing the puck whereupon the washing machine will update its internal clock and day according to the set time all day.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"i":["d","a","a ","g"],"b":["300","300","301","306","20","310","311","319","401","409","311","312","313","314","315","316","317","318","319","350","351","350","351","350","100","300","320","330","300","340","300","20","300","360","300","210","260","360","300"]},"As will be described in more detail below, in this embodiment, the man-machine interface  is an inductive based interface in which all of the pucks and switches described above include a resonator operating at a respective predetermined resonant frequency and in which a set of excitation and sensor coils are provided behind the fascia panel  for sensing the position and orientation of the pucks and switches. In response to the sensed pucks and their position and orientation, the control system for the washing machine (not shown) controls the washing machine accordingly. For example, when both the third left panel  is located against the fascia panel  and the second left panel is located against the third left panel , the sensor coils of the MMI  will be able to detect the presence of both the panel identifying puck  and the panel identifying puck . The control system can therefore ascertain that the second left panel  is currently active and sets the control temperatures associated with the positions of the temperature control knob  accordingly. Similar determinations can be made with respect to the right panels and the moveable pucks associated therewith. As the reader will appreciate, by providing such inductive based pucks, no through holes are required in the sealed box  between the interface panels and the control electronics. Therefore, the MMI  is less susceptible to the ingress of water and other contaminants. Further, as will be appreciated from the general description given above, the exact operation of the washing machine can be controlled more easily by a user. Further, since the fascia panel and the control panels may be removed, a different fascia panel  and control panels may be mounted onto the washing machine to provide the user with different control options. In this case, the control system (not shown) would have to store different control data for the different fascias. The appropriate data for the currently connected fascia would then be retrieved from memory based on the fascia plate identification puck  which is detected by the sensor coils of the MMI .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0070"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":["e ","e"],"b":["400","100","400","20","300","400","401","409","400","411","415","350","351","350","411","415","351","400"]},"The PCB  also includes a block of ferrite material  located on the underside of the PCB  so as to be substantially in registry with the marked areas , ,  on the left panels , ,  which are for receiving a user ID puck. The PCB  also has formed thereon three (labelled A, B and C) x-y sensing tablets , , . Each x-y tablet comprises a number of coils which may be excited, in a manner described in greater detail below, to enable the position and\/or orientation of the pucks and switches in registry with the particular tablet to be sensed. In this embodiment, each of the three x-y tablets are identical in structure.","IG.  is a schematic block diagram of the washing machine  illustrating sensing elements , , , , , , , , ,  to  and , a control unit  and controlled elements ,  , \u2013 and . The block diagram illustrates how information from the sensing elements is passed to the control unit which in turn generates controlling signals for controlling the controlled elements. As shown, the sensing elements include a number of coils which are used in inductive position sensing of targets and two additional blocks of sensing elements, namely the interface LEDs \u2013 and a temperature sensor . The coil sensing elements include: the A, B and C x-y tablet coils , , ; water level sensing coils ; drum-door-open sensing coils ; soap-drawer-open sensing coils  drum-shaft-rotation sensing coils  and motor-shaft-rotation sensing coils ; and drum-mass-and-vibration sensing coils .","As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art of inductive position sensing, the various sensing coils , , , , , , , ,  generate signals which, in this embodiment, are selectively received by the control unit  and processed to determine the position and\/or orientation of the pucks, sliders, switches etc. The control unit  then takes the appropriate control action based on the determined positions and\/or orientations. In the case of the MMI A, B and C x-y tablets , , , this positional and\/or orientation information is used to identify the values of various user settable parameters which in turn is used to configure the washing machine  to perform a washing programme in accordance with the parameters set by the user.","The water-level sensing coils  generate signals from which the control unit  identifies the position of a floating puck which is indicative of the amount of water in the drum. This positional information is then used to control the amount of water added to or removed from the drum  during a washing programme.","The drum-door-open sensing coils  and soap-drawer-open coils  generate signals which are indicative of the position of corresponding resonant pucks mounted on the drum door and the soap-drawer. The control unit  then processes these signals to determine whether the drum door  and soap drawer  respectively are closed or open. In this embodiment, this information is used by the control unit  to ensure that a washing programme is not commenced until the drum door  and the soap drawer  are both closed. In this embodiment, the control unit is also able to identify what type of soap drawer is fitted by detecting the resonant frequency of the corresponding puck. This enables the control unit  to automatically ensure that it adapts its behaviour to account for different types of soap drawer and ways of inserting soap into the machine to accommodate differences in this respect between different market countries.","The drum-shaft-rotation sensing coils  and the motor-shaft-rotation sensing coils  are mounted around the drum shaft (not shown) and motor shaft (not shown) respectively and generate signals which indicate the speed of rotation of corresponding pucks mounted on the drum shaft and motor shaft respectively. The control unit  then processes these signals during the washing programme to obtain the speed of rotation of both the drum shaft and the motor shaft which it can correct accordingly if necessary, or stop and indicate a fault if belt slippage is detected.","The drum mass and vibration sensing coils  generate signals indicative of the position of a resonant puck which is attached to a bearing unit supporting the drum . The control unit  then processes these signals to determine, during a washing programme, the weight of the drum and hence the weight of the contents of the drum. In the present embodiment, the measured weight of the clothes in the drum is used to determine how much water should be used during the programme to provide an automatic \u201chalf-load\u201d function. The control unit  also processes these signals to determine the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the drum (in the present embodiment in the vertical direction only) which is used to reduce the speed of rotation of the drum if the energy of the vibrations exceeds a predetermined maximum value, and, in the present embodiment, to activate a load re-arrangement sub-cycle in which the drum is rotated back and forth in an attempt to distribute the clothes within the drum more evenly. Note that to measure the angle of rotation forwards and backwards during the rearrangement cycle to correspond to previously calculated optimum values, the drum-shaft-rotation sensing coils  are used.","As shown, in , the controlled elements include the drum motor  which is controlled by the control unit  in a conventional manner and will not be described further. The drum motor  drives a drive shaft which is connected via a drive belt to the drum shaft which is connected to the drum . The drum shaft and drum  are rotatably supported by bearing surfaces which are mounted on a suspension which absorbs vibrations of the drum during its rotation at a high speed. This reduces the amount of vibration transmitted to the main body  and sealed box .","The controlled elements also include water solenoid valves  which are controlled by the control unit  to control the flow of water: a) into the drum ; b) through the soap drawer compartment ; and c) out through a waste outlet (not shown). The operation of these solenoid controlled valves  is controlled by the control unit  in accordance with the control parameters which specify the details of the particular washing programme. A water heater  is controlled by the control unit  to heat the water contained within the drum  to the temperature in accordance with temperature profile parameters of the particular washing programme.","The controlled elements also include the interface LEDs \u2013 which are also controlled by the control unit . The LEDs are mainly used to indicate what particular sub-programme of a complete wash programme the washing machine  is performing at any one time. Thus LED  indicates that the machine is currently executing a prewash sub-programme; LED  indicates that the washing machine is currently executing a main wash sub-programme; LED  indicates that the washing machine is currently executing a hold and rinse sub-programme; LED  indicates that the washing machine is currently executing a spin operation; LED  indicates that the washing machine is currently executing an anti-crease sub-programme; and LED  indicates that the washing machine  has finished its washing programme and is waiting for the user to open the door  and remove the washed clothes from the drum . LED  is a general \u201cON\u201d indicator to indicate that the machine is switched on; LED  indicates that the machine is in a \u201cTIMER-ON\u201d standby mode and will turn on automatically at a future time, set using the timer control panel ; and LED  indicates that a fault with the operation of the machine has been detected so that the user may contact an engineer to have the machine serviced. An example of an occurrence which, in the present embodiment, causes the fault LED  to be illuminated is the detection, by the control unit , that the drum shaft is rotating at a slower speed than the motor shaft, which indicates that the drive belt connecting the motor shaft, to the drum shaft is slipping.","The control unit  also controls a drum door release solenoid  which (when activated by the control unit ) causes a catch, which normally operates to hold the door in a closed position, to release the door , allowing it to spring outwardly under the biassing force of a spring (not shown) which is energised by the user closing the door .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIGS. 4","i":["a ","d "],"b":["4","100"]},"A brief description of the form of the coils used for determining the x position will now be given with reference to and . As shown, each of the coils  and  extends in the x direction over the entire active length of the tablet (which in this embodiment is 80 mm) and over the entire active width of each tablet (which in this embodiment is also 80 mm). In this embodiment, the coils  and  are arranged to provide an output signal whose amplitude varies approximately sinusoidally with the relative position of a resonating puck that is within the sensing range (out of the page) of the coils ,  along the x direction of the x-y tablet , , .","Referring to , the coil  extends in the x direction and is shown as comprising a single period having two alternate sense loops and giving the coil a period or pitch (\u03bb) of 80 mm.","The coil  shown in is also formed by a single period of alternating sense loops , \u2032 and and therefore has the same pitch (\u03bb) as coil .

The puck  and sensing coils  are mounted relative to one another such that the resonator  within the puck  is always within sensing distance of the sensing coils , and, as the drum moves up and down, the puck  moves up and down along the measuring path of the sensing coils .","In the present embodiment, the drum  tends to move a greater distance up and down than the bearing supporting the drum shaft such that the bearing also rotates slightly as the drum moves up and down. By placing the puck  at the end of the cantilever , in addition to the puck  following any vertical linear movement of the bearing, the rotational movement of the bearing is also converted into a related circumferential movement of the puck  having a large vertical linear component such that the sensing arrangement of the present embodiment may also detect this rotational movement of the bearing which will be proportional to vertical movement of the drum. The relationship between linear movement of the puck  as detected by the sensing coils  and vertical movement of the drum  is determined by experiment. In the present embodiment, a simple threshold of a maximum acceptable vibration of the drum at different frequencies is correlated by experiment with the detected frequency and amplitude of vibration of the puck . If, during a washing programme, this correlated or threshold amplitude of vibration is exceeded for any frequency of vibration, then corrective action is taken by the controller  to reduce the vibrations. Such corrective action firstly comprises stopping rotation of the drum and then rotating the drum backwards and forwards a few times to try and level out the load before continuing with the washing programme. If this strategy is unsuccessful (ie the threshold amplitude of vibration is still exceeded), then the speed of rotation of the drum is reduced until the measured amplitude of vibration falls below the threshold amount.","In the present embodiment, the frequencies of vibrations which represent a large amount of energy (and are therefore potentially problematic) tend to be less than 50 Hz. In the present embodiment, the resonant frequencies of the pucks are of the order of 2 MHz and approximately ten pulses or periods of an excitor coil are required at the resonant frequency to get the resonator within each puck to resonate with sufficient energy to permit its position to be detected. Even allowing two orders of magnitude for time taken to measure the induced voltage signal in each sensor coil and allowing for several different measurements to be made with different coils, the maximum sampling frequency (ie the maximum frequency with which the position of a target may be detected) is of the order of 2 kHz which is ample for obtaining accurate information about both the frequency and the amplitude of the vibrations made by the drum .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0095","num":"0103"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["h ","g","a "],"b":["560","570","571","550","571","560","570","571","571","571","570","700","550"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0096","num":"0104"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"i":["a ","a ","a ","a","e ","b","a","e "],"b":["350","300","350","350","355","355","354","354","353","345","352","300","350","300","300","350","356","356","357","357","300","350","354","350","411","415","351","350"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0105"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["700","700","800","740","740","800","700","400"]},"The control unit  also includes a reed switches control block  which monitors the status of each of the reed switches \u2013 to determine if they are on or off and communicates this information to the microprocessor unit .

If no reed switch is on or if two or more reed switches are on, it is assumed that the temperature control temperature control knob  is not in an allowable position and the knob position parameter is set to the default value of 0 (which corresponds to the temperature control temperature control knob  being in its first upwardly pointing off position).","The operator identifier parameter is shown in the third row of the table of . As shown in the second column, in the present embodiment this may take any one of eleven different values, which correspond to no user ID present and ten different possible user ID pucks.

If three such targets are detected, their relative positions are checked with those of ten different possible configurations which are stored in a lookup table and if a match is found, then the corresponding value for the operator-identifier parameter is retrieved from the lookup table.","The right panel identifier parameter which is shown in the fourth row of the table of  is used to identify which right panel , ,  is in its operative position. The value of this parameter is set in a similar way to that of the left panel identifier parameter except that the panel identifier pucks are searched for using the C x-y tablet  with an x position of less than or equal to 5 units and a y position of less than or equal to 2 units.","The fifth row of the table of  contains a set of positional parameters indicating the position of each of the twelve pucks , , , , , , , , , , ,  which may be located in registry with, and therefore detected by, the B x-y tablet . Each of these pucks contains a resonator having a different one of the resonant frequencies f\u2013f.

These relate to the six switches , , , , ,  each of which contains a puck containing a single resonator having a respective different one of the resonant frequencies f\u2013f. Each parameter specifies the position of the switch. The values of these parameters are stored in non-volatile memory such that if a puck corresponding to one of these switches cannot be detected, the parameter keeps the same value as it was given the last time the puck was detected. If a corresponding puck to one of the switches is detected, the position of the puck is used to establish the position of the switch and the parameter is set to this established position.","The seventh row illustrates a fascia-identifier panel parameter. In the present embodiment, this can take any one of  possible different values to allow up to 100 different fascia plates  to be recognised by the control unit  (one default value indicates that no recognised fascia plate  is fitted). This parameter is set in a similar way to the operator identifier parameter except that the C x-y tablet  is used and the lookup table of possible relative positions of detected resonators is much greater.","The last row of the table of  contains fascia-switch parameters. These specify the states of the push button switches , . The on\/off button  contains a puck having a resonator with a resonant frequency of fand the open door button  contains a puck with a resonator having a resonant frequency of f. If either of these pucks is detected in registry with the C x-y tablet , then the corresponding parameter is set to 1 to indicate that the switch is on, otherwise it is set to 0 to indicate that it is off.","In the present embodiment, the control unit  also checks to see if the drum door  and soap drawer  are open and sets the values of corresponding parameters appropriately.","Further parameters indicating the temperature of the water within the drum , the speed of rotation of the drum, the weight of the drum, the level of water within the drum, the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the drum, the speed of the motor, etc are also set. However, in the present embodiment, the interface parameters contained in the table shown in  (plus the parameters indicating whether the drum door and soap drawer are open and a parameter indicating the mass of the drum) are updated regularly before a washing programme is commenced, and then not at all while a washing programme is being executed. Conversely, the parameters indicating the state of the machine (in particular the ones requiring frequent sampling of the position of a puck such as the speed of rotation of the motor shaft and drum shaft and the amplitude and frequency of vibration) are not updated at all unless a washing programme is being executed whereupon they are updated regularly.","As will be apparent from the above discussion, in order to update the values of the interface parameters, it is necessary to perform regular determinations of the positions of various pucks. As noted above, a single such determination can be made at a frequency of greater than 2 kHz. In the present embodiment, to update all of the interface parameters takes approximately 35 determinations which means that a complete update of all of the parameters can be performed at a rate in excess of 50 Hz. In the present embodiment, while the machine detects variations in the interface parameters, it continually scans through making all determinations to continually update all of the interface parameters. As noted above, this can be done in excess of 50 Hz which is sufficiently frequent to appear to be instantaneous as far as the user is concerned. If, while the machine  is not executing a washing programme, no change in an interface parameter is detected for more than 2 minutes, the machine enters a sleep mode in which each interface parameter is updated only once every few seconds. When a change in position of a detected puck is noted, the machine  \u201cwakes up\u201d and commences scanning through updating all of the interface parameters continuously.","In the present embodiment, the overall architecture for the controlling software is that the various parameters (i.e. the interface parameters and the parameters indicating the internal state of the machine) are updated in the manner described above and the values held by these parameters are accessible to the main controlling computer programme which controls the overall operation of the washing machine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0128"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["05","10","700","350","320","16","12","10","20","10","20","30","1","30","40","1","40","50","30","40","50","55","1"]},"The above described first embodiment may be modified to include functionality for permitting radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders to communicate data to the washing machine .

However, similar interfaces may be used in wide variety of domestic appliances such as, for example, central heating controllers, security systems, access control systems, lighting control systems, freezers, chillers, air handling units, video cassette recorders, thermostats, dryers, food processors, etc. Furthermore, similar interfaces may also be applied to non-domestic systems such as ticketing machines, photocopies, burners, boilers, compressors, submersible pumps, medical infusion pumps, energy diagnostic systems, statistical process control systems, musical instruments, audio mixing desks, medical equipment, fluid control valves, marine devices, etc.","In the first embodiment described above, pucks including resonant circuits are detected using a pulse echo technique in which the resonators are energised and then the signal from the resonators is detected after the excitation signal has been removed. However, other types of sensing technique may be used such as, for example, a continuous excitation technique in which the signals from the resonators are detected at the same time as the excitation signal is applied to the excitation coil.","The embodiment described above gives an example of the sensing coils being formed on a printed circuit board which is located so as to be in registry with the fascia plate when fitted. However, the sensing coils may be formed using many different techniques such as etching, conductive ink printing or wire bonding, and the sensing coils may be mounted or formed on a number of different surfaces. For example, it may be advantageous in some circumstances to form the coils directly on the reverse side of a fascia plate to be mounted onto an appliance or to form the coils on the inside surface of a sealed box, the corresponding outside surface of which is to have a fascia plate mounted thereon. In such cases, it may be particularly convenient from a manufacturing point of view to print the coils onto such surfaces using layers of conductive and insulating \u201cinks\u201d.","The first embodiment described above gives an example of a puck (the user ID puck) which is held in place by means of a magnet and which is removable to enable restrictions on resetting of the washing machine for security, safety, aesthetic and cleaning reasons. As an alternative example, in a safety relevant piece of equipment such as an industrial scale gas burner, only approved technicians may be provided with a set of removable pucks so that only they may programme or configure the equipment. Such configuration may be achieved, for example, using pucks which are inductively or magnetically detectable and are marked so as to represent open or closed relays as used in ladder logical programming of control systems. The first embodiment described above could be modified by including sensing coils and associated puck for monitoring or verifying the position of the solenoid controlled water valves.","A man-machine interface including both remotely sensed user actuable elements and traditional technologies such as liquid crystal displays and switches may be advantageous in certain applications. A conventional mechanical switch may for example be used as an enter data key.","The first embodiment gives an example of a convenient way of programming a time varying profile in the case of the second right panel  for controlling how the spin cycle varies over time. A similar interface may be used with many different applications such as, for example, a central heating control system, a home lawn sprinkler control system or a security control system over a 24 hour period.","Other types of remote position sensing could also be used. For example, capacitive sensing could be employed as could optical or acoustic techniques. However, these techniques are generally less preferred because they tend to be more expensive and less robust than simple inductively sensed pucks. In particular, optical techniques require line of sight between a remotely sensed element and a sensing element and this places more constraints on the design of the device. Also, capacitive, ultrasonic and acoustic techniques suffer from the presence of excess moisture or variations in the moisture content of the ambient atmosphere.","Many different types of magnetic effects can be employed to perform the remote sensing function. In particular, Hall effect, magnetoresistive, giant magnetoresistive, colossal magnetoresistive and other solid state contactless magnetic sensing technologies could be employed. As regards inductive sensing of resonators, many different similar techniques are known and commercially available. For example, the following companies all manufacture remote inductive sensing apparatus which could be adapted for use in the present invention: Saitek, Wacom, Kollmorgen, Kanto Seiki.","By including two or more resonators in a known relative position to one another, within a puck, it is possible for the x, y, z and z-rotational positions and orientations of a single puck to be sensed (by z direction is meant the distance perpendicularly away from a sensing surface on which a flat two-dimensional set of windings has been formed as in the x-y tablets described above\u2014as noted above, the z-position can be measured to a certain extent by measuring the strength of a received signal from a single resonator as it comes into range). The way in which these different positions and orientations may be measured is described in WO98\/58237 discussed above. By using most or all of these, a single puck may be used to provide a large amount of data input in an intuitive manner.","Because the surface onto which a fascia plate is attached may be fully sealed and enclosed, remote sensing man-machine interfaces such as those described above are particularly useful for underwater, waterproof or extreme temperature applications where traditional keypads displays and cable connectors are problematic. Additionally, problems with traditional technologies for use with MMI's such as potentiometers can be overcome, as can problems arising from temperature changes (since ratiometric readings may be taken). Additionally, using remote sensing of user actuable elements overcomes difficulties associated with conventional user interface technologies which require close tolerance alignment or line of sight connections between the user actuable elements and an electronic component contained within the device.","In the above described embodiments, the fascia plates are removably attached to their respective appliances by means of releasable snap-fit mechanisms. However, other means may be used for removably attaching fascia plates (or user actuable elements) to their respective appliances. For example, magnetic attraction could be used by including permanent magnets either in the appliance or the fascia plate and co-operating ferrite or magnets in the fascia plate or appliance respectively. Alternatively, other releasable mechanisms could be used such as textile hook-and-loop materials, non-setting glues or adhesive putties, nuts and bolts, etc.","The concept of a user ID puck can be applied to many different applications. For example, a domestic hifi system may come with a number of different user ID pucks, one for each member of a family who uses the hifi system. Different control settings of the hifi system may then be stored in correspondence with the different users and the hifi system may automatically adjust its settings whenever a new user ID puck is affixed to the system. If the user ID pucks are carried by each of the users (for instance, on a key ring) then the pucks can also provide some degree of security since the hifi system may be prevented from operating unless a validly recognised user ID puck is supplied. Such functionality would then make it difficult for a thief to steal and then operate the system since he would also need the \u201ckey\u201d puck. Such security can be further increased by using more sophisticated RFID transponders which are able to engage in two-way challenge and response encrypted data signal interchanges (for example using private\/public key encryption techniques etc.).","Another application of \u201ckey\u201d or \u201cID\u201d pucks is in the control of multiple zones (for example different zones within a building for purposes of a heating, ventilating, air-conditioning (HVAC) or a security system. By designating a different puck for each zone, a single interface can be used for adjusting the controls for each individual zone simply be ensuring that the puck for the correct zone is located on the interface. In the case of a domestic heating system, an automatically controllable radiator which may be remotely controlled using either a wireless signal or a powerline carrier signal transmission using the mains electricity supply within the house, can be separately programmed by providing a designated puck for each such automatically controlled radiator. In this way, a radiator located in a living room may be programmed to not come on in the morning but only to come on in the evening, for example.","Instead of using ID or key pucks, a fascia plate or similar element may be capable of recognition by the appliance to which it is fitted simply by virtue of the positions and\/or other detectable characteristics such as resonant frequencies of pucks mounted on the fascia plate as part of user actuable elements such as knobs, sliders, 2D curvilinear markers, buttons, etc mounted on the fascia plate.","An interface having remotely sensed user actuable elements may be particularly useful for controlling a shower. In such a case, it will be possible for the user actuable elements to be mounted on both sides of a sensing surface so that the shower may be controlled either inside the shower cubical or outside the shower cubical. One way of achieving this is to use user actuable elements which are magnetically attached to the sensing surface and which magnetically attract one another so that as one is moved the other moves as well. Complicated shower programmes may be intuitively set and different user ID pucks can be used to remember preferred time temperature profiles.","Similar \u201crecipe\u201d pucks to those described above could also be used to provide preprogrammed time temperature profiles.","In the above described embodiments, each fascia plate includes a fascia plate identification puck which identifies the type of fascia plate attached to the appliance. This permits the functionality of an appliance to be modified or enhanced simply by modifying the fascia plate without having to modify the basic underlying machine. However, instead of including an identification puck, the machine may be able to simply recognise which fascia plate is attached by detecting the position and characteristics of any remotely detectable user actuable elements contained on the fascia plate.","RFID transponders may also be used as a means of enabling relatively sophisticated data to be easily input to the device, for example to update the appliance's control software (e.g. for enhancing its functionality or fixing bugs).","Where a user actuable puck is attached to a sensing surface by means of a magnet, it is possible and advantageous, to include a small magnet within the user actuable element and include a larger piece of ferrite material (which is considerably cheaper than a permanent magnetic) on the other side of the sensing surface, such that a single puck may be magnetically secured to the sensing surface in a number of different positions.","An inductive position sensing technique may be used to measure temperature in adverse conditions by using a bimetallic strip having a resonant circuit affixed to the free end thereof, and whose position may be tracked via a pair of quadrature linear sensor coils. Alternatively some of the above described inductive position sensing techniques for monitoring the interval status of the washing machine of the first embodiment could be replaced with more conventional arrangements. For example, instead of measuring the water level using a floating puck, a sealed pipe could be placed in pressure communication with the water in the drum and a flexible membrane attached to the end of the closed pipe. Movement of the membrane as the pressure changes could be detected either using a remote sensing technique or using a more conventional method such as an attached strain gauge to measure the pressure in the sealed pipe and hence the level of water within the drum.","Other types of resonators could be used to those described above. For example, 45 magnetostrictive resonators could be used. Furthermore, harmonic generators which generate harmonics of the excitation signal could be used (such harmonics are then detected by the MMI). Furthermore, other magnetic field affecting elements could be used such as simple short circuit coils without an associated capacitor but having varying inductances by varying the number of turns; metallic \u201cscreens\u201d of various shapes and sizes or permeable elements such as ferrite.","In all of the above mentioned remote sensing techniques, the remotely sensed item may be thought of as generating a signal. Thus even where a simple metal screen is used for detection by the effect it has on a surrounding magnetic field, the screen will generate eddy currents which attempt to resist the change in the surrounding magnetic field, and it is the effect which these eddy currents have which is remotely detected. Similarly, where an object is detected optically or acoustically, it is the reflected energy which is detected and this reflected energy can be thought of as a re-radiated or generated signal."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["In order that the present invention may be better understood, embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"c "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":"d "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0030"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIGS. 2"],"i":["e ","a ","d; "],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0031"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","e ","e; "],"b":"4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"],"i":["f ","e; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 4","i":"g "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIGS. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":"5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"i":["c ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":"d "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":["e ","d "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":"f "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":["g ","f "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"i":"h "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2"],"i":["a ","d; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 2","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"i":["b ","d ","a","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 11","i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 12","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"i":["b ","a; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 12","FIG. 12"],"i":["c ","b; "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 13","i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 13"],"i":["b ","a"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
