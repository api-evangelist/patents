{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to user interfaces in mobile communication devices. Particular aspects of the invention relate to methods of providing skins for the user interface of a mobile communication device.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","With some software written for desktop and laptop computers, various aspects and features of the user interface, such as graphical elements, icons, animations, colors, texture, fonts, sounds, etc., can be easily changed all at the same time. The changes can be accomplished using data files referred to as \u201cskins\u201d, which can be easily downloaded from the Internet and installed without altering the functionality of the software. Skins are available for the Netscape 6 web browser at www.netscape.com, and for the Windows operating system software and various applications software at www.topdesktop.com. Most of the skins are available for free. Even for a skin that is only available for a fee, there is nothing to prevent the skin from being copied and forwarded or distributed to others without payment to the party originally providing the skin. This inhibits the development of an effective commercial market for skins.","The circumstances for customization or personalization are quite different in the field of mobile communications devices, such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), web pads, pagers, cordless telephones, handheld computers, etc. Customization of the user interface is limited to ringing tones, screen savers and simple logos, usually determined by a user profile maintained by the operator of the wireless communication network which the device accesses for communications, and\/or exchangeable covers and keypads for the housing of the device such as described in EP 1091540.","Mobile communications devices have been growing rapidly in computing power and can now perform many functions in addition to voice telephony (such as a phonebook, personal organizer, etc). In particular, they are capable of requesting, receiving and displaying information consisting of alphanumeric text or graphics. An example of alphanumeric text is a short message service (SMS) in GSM, which permits the user to send and receive short text messages transmitted through a cellular public land mobile network (PLMN). More recently, mobile communications devices have been developed which allow the user to access documents or graphics data from the Internet or elsewhere using the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) over wireless communication networks.","WAP enabled devices allow information to be accessed from various remote servers offering data services such as banking, stock quotes, and weather forecasts. Data content is provided in a markup language, such as wireless markup language (WML) or extensible hypertext markup language (XHTML). WML is configured to allow data to be displayed as a deck of individual cards which are of a size suited for display on the relatively small display screen typical. A micro-browser software application is typically provided in the mobile communication device to receive the data and display it in different screens. The user interface of the mobile communication device provides some way for the user to navigate between different display screens.","Since mobile communications devices typically use displays of relatively small size and\/or resolution, the degree of user satisfaction depends greatly on the ability to display data in a manner preferred by the user. Since mobile communication devices are typically battery powered, they generally use black and white displays rather than color displays which consume more power. This creates also a disadvantage insofar as color cannot be used to enhance the user interface.","Because of the relatively fixed architecture of mobile communications devices, a user cannot install or change software and there are no skins or other possibilities for the user of a mobile communications device to alter the display of information as there are in the field of desktop or laptop computers. Customization of the user interface according to user preference is limited to ringing tones, screen savers, logos and the use of exchangeable covers for the housing of the device, such as described in EP 1091540.","The present invention addresses mobile communications devices, software applications and micro-browsers thereof which are disadvantageous for at least the reasons recognized above. There are several different aspects to the invention, some of which may be practiced without the others.","One aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of allowing graphical elements of a screen display of a mobile communication device to have animations, colors, texture and fonts changed in order to match them to current trends or to the color and texture of the phone. In particular, the invention is directed to a method of providing skins for mobile communication devices so that the graphical elements of the display can be changed as easily as they are in a desktop or laptop computer.","In another aspect of the invention, a copy protection scheme is provided for the skins of mobile communication devices. This enables an economically sustainable market for their creation and distribution and a payment system so that a user of a mobile communications device can easily arrange for payment when a new skin is installed on this device.","While the foregoing and following written and illustrated disclosure focuses on disclosing several embodiments, it should be clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation. The embodiments are described with respect to a cellular phone. However, they may be practiced with respect to any type of mobile communication device.","The phone preferably contains software including a set of software components that enables it to communicate with a wireless communication network, various software applications and a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) so that software components and applications can work together on the mobile device. In particular, the software includes a browser for the World Wide Web that enables it to render a display on a screen as described below. However, the invention however is not limited to such a set of software modules or APIS, to implementation in a particular wireless communication network or to particular specifications, such as Wireless Access Protocol (WAP).","Mobile Phone",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","2","3","4","5","6","6","3","10","2","7","7","0","9"],"i":["a ","b"]},"The keypad  additionally comprises two soft keys  adjacent the underside of LCD , two call handling keys , a navigation key  for navigating the cursor in display , a key  for switching between numbers and letters for the twelve alphanumeric keys in the first group  of keys, and a \u201cclear key\u201d  for clearing one or more letters from the display. The two soft keys  preferably comprise manually depressible buttons. Their functionality can be pre-programmed depending upon the task performed. The functionality of the two soft keys  depends on the state of the phone and navigation through display  using navigation key . The functionality attributed to the two soft keys  is displayed as soft key function legends in separate fields in the display  just above the respective soft keys . The two call handling keys  according to the preferred embodiment are used for establishing a call or a conference call, terminating a call or rejecting an incoming call.","The navigation key  is an up\/down key placed centrally on the front surface of the phone between the display  and the group of alphanumeric keys . When pushed upwardly, it scrolls up. Conversely, when pushed downwardly, it scrolls down. In use, an active or focus region is provided on the display which, as explained in more detail later, can be modified. The focus region may be delineated by a rectangular box which is moved around the display. It can be provided in different ways, such as a region highlighted with a different intensity or color from the rest of the display, an underlining of a menu option or by means of a pointer movable across the display in the manner of a conventional mouse pointer. Hereby the user will be able to control this key by simply pressing the up\/down key using their thumb. Since many experienced phone users are used to one-hand control, it is a very good solution to place an input key, requiring precise motor movements. Thus, the user may place the phone in the hand between the finger tips and the palm of the hand. Hereby, the thumb is free for inputting information.","Navigation key  may comprise a three-way roller which is manually depressible inwardly of the handset, in the direction of arrow , to perform a \u201cselect\u201d function. Alternatively, it may be configured as a five-way roller (not shown) so as to perform additional right and left scrolling functions, a roller ball, a pivot device to scroll for LCD, a touch pad or other navigation device of the type used in laptop computers.","Mobile Phone Hardware Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["10","10"]},"Mobile phone  has a transmitter\/receiver circuit , which is preferably a standardized transceiver adapted to operate according to cellular standards, connected to a processor unit  and communicatively connecting it to a cellular communication network (not shown). The phone is preferably adapted for communication via a wireless communication network, e.g., a cellular network, but it may also be adapted for a cordless network. For example, it may be adapted for use in connection with a GSM network, CDMA network, TDMA network, or other kinds of cellular networks and various forms of cordless phone systems or in dual band phones or tri-mode phones accessing sets of these systems\/networks. Although not shown in , mobile phone  may also have a standard infrared (ir) or Bluetooth wireless port enabling it to directly receive data from another device via a wireless connection.","Speech signals received through transmitter\/receiver circuit  are A\/D converted in an A\/D converter (not shown), fed to audio part  (preferably a codec configured to process signals under the control of processor unit ) and encoded so as to produce analog signals fed to speaker  (and\/or an ear-piece) through an amplifier (not shown). Audio part  receives analog signals from microphone , after being amplified by an amplifier (not shown) and A\/D converted in an A\/D converter (not shown), encodes and transfers the encoded signals to processor unit  for transmission through transmitter\/receiver circuit . The audio part  also decodes the signal, which is transferred from the processor unit  to the earpiece  via a D\/A converter and amplifier (not shown).","Audio part  is also able to give an output of a ring tone to the buzzer . The ring tone can be stored in either of the memories , and is recalled when the transmitter\/receiver circuit  receives an incoming signal, by means of the processor unit . Thus, the ring tone is recalled from the memory, forwarded to audio part , and the ring tone is generated as an output from the buzzer ","Processor unit  is connected to, and has an interface associated with, random access memory (RAM) and to Flash ROM . Other memory (including ROM) may also be provided, either separate from or integrated with RAM . It is also connected to a power supply, such as a battery. Processor unit  also has an interface with a smart card, preferably SIM card  containing mobile subscriber identity and removably received in a SIM card holder (not shown), a display driver  connected to LCD , and keypad . It receives instruction signals from keypad  and soft keys  and controls LCD .","There may be an input\/output (I\/O) unit (not shown) configured for any or all of the parts connected to processor unit . During operation, the processor unit  monitors the activity in the phone and controls the display  in response thereto. Therefore, it is the processor unit  which detects the occurrence of a state change event and changes the state of the phone and thus the display text. A state change event can be caused by the user activating the keypad, including navigation key , and these types of events are called entry events or user events. However, the network communicating with the phone may also cause a state change event. This type of event and other events beyond the user's control are called non-user events. Non-user events comprise status change during call set-up, change in battery voltage, change in antenna conditions, message on reception of SMS, etc.","Mobile Phone Software Architecture","Processor unit  also supports software in the phone. A variety of software applications, including software modules, are stored in Flash ROM (or other persistent storage of mobile phone , but are not shown in  for the sake of convenience. The software can be ported to and integrated into mobile phone  at or near the time of manufacture or by the operator of a wireless communication network having appropriate facilities, but the user does not necessarily have the same rights to install the software as the manufacturer or the operator.","Mobile phone  can have any software architecture, but the example known as Intelligent Software Architecture (ISA) is shown in . Operating system  has a communication manager  controller by processor unit . Communication manager  handles the communication between a number of software applications  and a number of servers . Software applications . to .and servers . to .communicate under control of the communication manager . Software applications .\u2013.use the services from the servers  to build features, and to present the features to the user via the user interface panels.","The server  controls a resource and provides an interface that allows other entities to access the controlled resource. Each server  controls, for example the user interface setting, the audio, etc., but only accesses the resource when requested via communication manager . A server may use services provided by one or more other servers as part of its own services, but the server does not present information to the user via the user interface panels.","A subsystem  is an autonomous part of the software, with a special service interface to the other subsystems. Subsystems  may include a number of subsystems .\u2013., such as GSM software ., SIM software . and energy management .. The hardware drivers  are the interface to the hardware resources shown in .","Operating System Embodiment","As shown in , there may be a plurality of UI skin servers .\u2013.. Although one or more of UI skin servers .\u2013.may be included when the mobile phone  is manufactured, it is preferable that at least the data file(s) associated with a skin can be downloaded from a server in or communicating with a wireless communication network through transmitter\/receiver circuit  and under control of processor unit . Furthermore, the user of mobile phone  is preferably also able to arrange for payment of such a downloaded skin data file in a method interacting with and supported by the data skin file downloading server.","One or more of UI skin servers .\u2013.may contain a copy-forbidding flag in the skin data to prevent subsequent copying of the associated skin to other devices. Alternatively, copy protection can be provided by a separate digital rights management (DRM) server .. This DRM server .can be implemented for a specific software application, such as a web browser as described later, or it may be implemented as an extension to operation system software  with an API to provide communication access to a plurality of different software applications. In the latter operating system embodiment, DRM server .provides DRM support for skin type personalization for all software applications having an API interface to DRM server .. Also, implementation of DRM as an extension in operating system software  allows full use of all security mechanisms otherwise provided by operating system software . In this way a common skin can be provided for a plurality of software applications, thus resulting in a theme for the user across all applications similar to that presently possible in desktop computer systems.","Browser Embodiment","Although an implementation using operating system software  is possible, an implementation in a specific software application, such as web browser . shown in , can be more self-contained and simple. In such an embodiment, the digital rights management can be included in and specially adapted for the particular software application. This is advantageous for a web browser application which provides for the easy transfer of data back and forth, such as to and from the Internet, which allows for easy distribution of unauthorized copies.","Designed to closely model the World-Wide Web architecture, specifications of, for example, the standard naming model, content typing, content formats, protocols, etc., have been developed for a general-purpose application environment for wireless mobile communication devices having limited CPU speeds, memory battery life, display size, and a wide variety of input devices. WAP is a set of specifications, promulgated by the WAP Forum (www.wapforum.org), which defines the interfaces between mobile communication devices and wired Internet devices.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["10","100","10","102","100","102","103","104","102","103","104","102","103","104","105"]},"The Wireless Application Environment (WAE) model of WAP is based on the WWW client-server model and includes all elements of the WAP architecture related to application specification and execution. It specifies an application framework for wireless mobile communication devices with the goal of enabling network operators, device manufacturers, and content developers to develop differentiating services and applications in a fast and flexible manner. Specifically, the WAE application framework specifies networking schemes, content formats, programming languages, and shared services. Software components - to - in mobile phone  correspond to elements specified in the WAE application framework. The Operating System (OS) Service Application Programming Interface (API) - (drawn to the left) of software components - to - allows the components to interact with the operating system of mobile phone . WAE does not specify any particular user agent, but only specifies the services and formats required to ensure interoperability among the various possible implementations of WAP. Furthermore, it assumes an environment in which one or more user agents providing a specific functionality may operate simultaneously.","The software modules consist of various components corresponding generally to User Agent Layer -, Transport Layer (Loader Layer) -, Wireless Application Protocol Stack - and OS Service API - in . The software modules preferably allow mobile phone  to browse WML content, XML content, XHTML content and other types of content, execute WMLScript, receive and display Push messages, and receive and display Wireless Bitmap (WBMP) graphics. The browser may support various combinations of markup language standards.","For the second browser embodiment now described, it is preferable that the browser supports at least XML and XSL style sheets. The XML specification is preferable because it separates content and data presentation. The skins are preferably created in XML by using one or more style sheets to adapt the skin to function to display data on LCD  of mobile phone . Additionally, the skin may be adapted to be best suited for a certain phone or type of mobile communication device (including type of display capabilities, such as size and resolution, as well as certain type of user navigation and control, such as navigation and select keys , a touch sensitive display, etc.).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["20","21","20","10","20","20","10","23","22","10","20","20","20"]},"The XSL style sheet  can be located in the mobile phone, but it or other types of style sheets may be located at server . If a device dependent style sheet is located in mobile phone , then the final XSL transformation  is performed by mobile phone . At mobile phone , the XML parser  in browser . applies the processor of the terminal to translate the XML (or WML) format document of the user interface skin data file in a manner suitable for the user interface application . Alternatively, parsing can be performed in server  to make the skin ready on the network side to be used by the user interface of mobile phone  as soon as the skin is received without any processing.","Instead of transmitting an XML document from server  to mobile phone , alternative files include, but are not limited to, WML, HTML or metadata. As an example, the metadata may be compatible or backward compatible with the specifications for the Resource Description Framework (RDF) promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). (See http:\/\/www.W3.orq\/TR\/REC-rdf-svntax for model & syntax and http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/CR-rdf-schema-20000327 for schema.) RDF provides for the use of multiple identification and identification references within a single document, the establishment of naming and linking conventions and definitions for the interpretation of attributes. RDF thus makes it possible to provide different metadata for different applications. It enables, for example, classification of a browser's pages. In the context of providing skins to a mobile communication device, the user interface of a software application may have particular obligatory syntax sections for which metadata vocabulary rules can be defined. For example, the skin may have a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to a site, such as Club Nokia, in certain points therein. This may be used in conjunction with DRM control ., where DRM control .does not permit a copy of a skin to be kept when the user obtains a different mobile phone or mobile communication device. For example, a skin created as an RDF document may require that, after contact is made to a URL address and there is payment of usage and\/or other DRM rights, the skin is then translated to be ready for a software application and it's the user interface from then on.","An important aspect of the embodiments is to be able to provide DRM protected skins to mobile communication devices. For example, a skin can be sold so that it can be installed on any type of mobile phone or mobile communication device existing at that time or at any time in the future. This has the advantage that the user can become accustomed to their skin and, if the user begins to use another mobile phone or mobile communication device, the user can transfer the skin to the other mobile phone or mobile communication device. Of course, the skin data file is not actually transferred. The server maintains a record of the skin transaction and downloads the skin data file to the other mobile phone or mobile communication device without requiring, for example, additional payment. Alternatively, the skin can be sold with restrictions that the skin can be installed on only one type (or one set of types) of mobile phone or mobile communication device. The pricing of the skin may vary according to the restrictions and maximize revenue to the supplier of the skins.","Furthermore, a mobile phone or mobile communication device may have a passive skin area and an active skin area. This is possible if the mobile phone or mobile communication device has a large touch sensitive or cell structured display, preferably over almost all its cover area on the front and\/or back. The passive skin area is the area where replaceable covers may be exchanged as described in EP 1091540. The active area skin is the user selection area having, for example, a context bar.","In a particular embodiment, a method of providing skins involves offering a plurality of skins which match a respective plurality of exchangeable covers on a mobile phone. For example, there is known from EP 1091540, a method in which each one of a set of exchangeable phone covers have a respective identification unit which identifies the cover when installed on the phone. However, the method involves modifying, for example, the display of functions for softkeys according to the layout of the softkeys on the phone. In this embodiment, the identification of the cover is also use to adapt and\/or upgrade the skin for the browser and\/or other software applications of the mobile phone. This advantageously improves the user interface in such a way that a new skin is available for the mobile phone at about the same time as a new cover is installed on the phone. The identification unit may either invoke a skin already in the mobile phone or the identification unit may initiate a download procedure from a server as described above. The skin associated with a newly installed cover can be used after the cover is changed to a cover which does not have an associated skin.","While the foregoing has described what are considered to be example embodiments, it is understood that various modifications may be made therein and that the invention may be implemented in various forms and embodiments, and that it may be applied in numerous applications, only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim all such modifications and variations."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
