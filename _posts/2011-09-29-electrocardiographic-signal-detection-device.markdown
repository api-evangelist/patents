{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","REFERENCE NUMBERS","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a continuation of International application No. PCT\/JP2009\/070333, filed Dec. 3, 2009, and which claims priority to Japanese Patent application No. 2009-090203, filed Apr. 2, 2009, and Japanese Patent application No. 2009-213372, filed Sep. 15, 2009, the entire contents of each of these references being incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","The present invention relates to an electrocardiographic signal detection device for detecting an electrocardiographic signal from a living body.","There is known an electrocardiographic signal detection device for extracting the activity of a human heart as an electrocardiographic signal, and acquiring biological information, such as electrocardiographic data, based on the electrocardiographic signal for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, etc. of heart diseases.","That type of electrocardiographic signal detection device is classified into a large-scaled device that is used by doctors in medial institutions, e.g., hospitals, and a portable device that is used by ordinary persons in homes.","The large-scaled electrocardiographic signal detection device includes, for example, a desktop computer having a sophisticated processing function to analyze the electrocardiographic data, a plurality of, e.g., twelve, electrodes connected to the computer through respective cables, a desktop display device for monitoring electrocardiographic waveforms, etc., and a printer for printing out the electrocardiographic waveforms, etc. A doctor, for example, attaches the electrodes to the legs and arms of a subject (examinee) lying on a bed, and operates the computer. Responsively, the electrocardiographic signal detection device detects the electrocardiographic signal of the subject and precisely performs an analysis of the electrocardiographic data, etc., thereby generating professional information that is directly useful for, e.g., diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia (irregular pulse), angina pectoris (stricture of the heart), etc.","On the other hand, the portable electrocardiographic signal detection device includes a small-sized housing capable of being lifted up by one hand. An IC chip, a memory, etc., which have the function of performing a simplified analysis of the electrocardiographic data, are contained in the housing. Several, e.g., two or three, electrodes, a small-sized liquid crystal display panel, an operating button, etc. are arranged on an outer surface of the housing. A user puts the fingers or the palms of the hands on the electrodes of the electrocardiographic signal detection device and then operates the operating button. Responsively, the electrocardiographic signal detection device detects an electrocardiographic signal of the user and generates electrocardiographic data, etc. Although the electrocardiographic data generated by the small-sized electrocardiographic signal detection device is simpler than that generated by the large-sized electrocardiographic signal detection device described above, the former data is also useful as, e.g., information for notifying a doctor of symptoms of heart diseases, such as palpitation (see Patent Documents 1 to 3).\n\n","The electrodes employed in the above-described electrocardiographic signal detection device of the related art are each made of, e.g., metal including silver-silver chloride. When the electrocardiographic signal is detected, the electrodes are brought into direct contact with the human skin. After the detection of the electrocardiographic signal, the electrodes may be left to stand for a long time in some cases while the electrodes are exposed to open air in a state that moisture, etc. attributable to the contact with the human skin are kept adhering to the electrodes.","Therefore, if the electrocardiographic signal detection device is held in a poor management situation, there is a risk that durability may be reduced due to deterioration of the electrodes. Also, there is a risk that when an electrocardiogram is measured using the deteriorated electrodes, accuracy of the measurement may be degraded.","In the above-described portable electrocardiographic signal detection device of the related art, the plurality of electrodes need to be arranged on an outer surface of the housing such that the user can easily make contact, e.g., the fingers or the palms contact with the electrodes. Thus, a space sufficient to arrange the electrodes in a desired layout has to be secured on the outer surface of the housing. For that reason, it is difficult to realize a further reduction in size of the electrocardiographic signal detection device.","The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above-described problems, etc., and an object of the present invention is to provide an electrocardiographic signal detection device, which can improve durability and which can reduce a device size.","To achieve the above object, the present invention provides an electrocardiographic signal detection device comprising at least one pair of electrodes for detecting electrical signals of a living body, an insulating film disposed on the at least one pair of electrodes, the insulating film has a contact surface which is a surface opposite to a surface being in contact with the at least one pair of electrodes and the contact surface is to be contacted with the living body, a differential amplifier for generating an electrocardiographic signal by differentially amplifying the electrical signals of the living body, which are detected through capacitive coupling between the living body contacted with the contact surface of the insulating film and the at least one pair of electrodes, and an arithmetic processing unit for obtaining biological information based on the electrocardiographic signal generated by the differential amplifier.","According to the present invention described above, since the insulating film is disposed on the electrodes and the electrical signals relating to the electrocardiographic signal are detected through capacitive coupling between the electrodes and the living body, the electrodes and the living body are avoided from directly contacting with each other, and the electrodes are not exposed to open air. As a result, moisture, etc. can be prevented from adhering to the electrodes, and deterioration of the electrodes can be suppressed. It is hence possible to enhance durability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device and to prolong the service life thereof.","Also, the present invention provides an electrocardiographic signal detection device comprising a housing, a display window provided in the housing, at least one pair of electrodes disposed on a surface of the display window, made of a transparent electroconductive material, and detecting electrical signals of a living body, an insulating film disposed on the at least one pair of electrodes, made of a transparent insulating material, the insulating film has a contact surface which is a surface opposite to a surface being in contact with the at least one pair of electrodes and the contact surface is to be contacted with the living body, a differential amplifier for generating an electrocardiographic signal by differentially amplifying the electrical signals of the living body, which are detected through capacitive coupling between the living body contacted with the contact surface of the insulating film and the at least one pair of electrodes, an arithmetic processing unit for obtaining biological information based on the electrocardiographic signal generated by the differential amplifier, a display panel disposed in the housing and displaying display information through the display window, the at least one pair of electrodes, and through the insulating film, and an information display circuit for displaying the display information on the display panel.","According to the present invention described above, since the transparent electrodes are formed on the surface of the display window and the transparent insulating film is formed on the electrodes, the electrodes having good durability can be arranged in overlapped relation to a display area of the display panel without impeding the display information on the display panel. As a result, a size reduction and a longer service life of the electrocardiographic signal detection device can be realized at the same time.","Also, the display information indicating a manner of measuring an electrocardiogram, a posture in the measurement, etc. can be displayed in overlapped or adjacent relation to the electrodes in a screen of the display panel. Therefore, operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device can be improved, thus enabling even an ordinary person to easily perform electrocardiographic measurement.","Further, operating buttons utilizing a touch panel, a photosensor for photo-plethysmography, etc. can be arranged below the electrodes. Accordingly, an electrocardiographic signal detection device having a smaller size and a more sophisticated function can be realized.","Moreover, the present invention provides the electrocardiographic signal detection device further comprising a touch panel disposed at an underside of the display window and adapted for entering input information through the display window, a drive circuit for driving the touch panel, and a control unit for controlling the arithmetic processing unit in accordance with the input information entered through the touch panel.","According to the present invention described above, the following advantageous effect can be obtained in addition to the above-described advantages. Since the contact between the living body and the insulating film disposed on the electrode is detected with the touch panel, the operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device can be improved. Thus, a function convenient for a general user can be realized, for example, in point of automatically starting the detection of the electrical signals relating to the electrocardiographic signal at the same time as when user's fingers are brought into contact with the insulating film disposed on the electrodes.","Still further, the present invention provides an electrocardiographic signal detection device comprising a housing, a display window provided in the housing, an operating button disposed on the housing, a first electrode disposed on the operating button, made of an electroconductive material, and detecting an electrical signal of a living body, a first insulating film disposed on the first electrode, at least one second electrode disposed on a surface of the display window, made of a transparent electroconductive material, and detecting an electrical signal of the living body, a second insulating film disposed on the at least one second electrode, made of a transparent insulating material, and having one surface, which is positioned oppositely away from the other surface being in contact with the at least one second electrode and which serves as a contact surface to be contacted with the living body, a differential amplifier for generating an electrocardiographic signal by differentially amplifying one electrical signal of the living body, which is detected through capacitive coupling between one part of the living body contacted with the contact surface of the second insulating film and the at least one second electrode, and the other electrical signal of the living body, which is detected through capacitive coupling between another part of the living body contacted with the contact surface of the first insulating film and the first electrode, an arithmetic processing unit for obtaining biological information based on the electrocardiographic signal generated by the differential amplifier, a display panel disposed in the housing and displaying display information through the display window, the at least one second electrode, and through the second insulating film, and an information display circuit for displaying the display information on the display panel.","According to the present invention described above, since not only the contact between the living body and the insulating film disposed on the electrode, but also the operation of the operating button can be detected at the same time, the operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device can be improved. Thus, a function convenient for a general user can be realized, for example, in point of automatically starting the detection of the electrical signals relating to the electrocardiographic signal when the user presses the operating button while keeping the finger in a state contacted with the insulating film disposed on the electrode.","Also, the above-described electrocardiographic signal detection device according to the present invention further comprises a touch panel disposed at an underside of the display window and adapted for entering input information through the display window, a drive circuit for driving the touch panel, and a control unit for controlling the arithmetic processing unit in accordance with the input information entered through the touch panel.","According to the present invention described above, since the contact between the living body and the insulating film disposed on the electrode is detected with the touch panel, the operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device can be improved in addition to the above-described advantageous effects.","In the electrocardiographic signal detection device according to the present invention, the at least one pair of electrodes are connected to input terminals of the differential amplifier for differentially amplifying the electrical signals of the living body, which are detected through capacitive coupling between the living body and the at least one pair of electrodes, at least one clamp circuit including at least one high-impedance element is connected to the input terminal of the differential amplifier, a potential at a connected end of the clamp circuit is fixedly held constant, and an impedance when looking at the differential amplifier from the connected end of the clamp circuit is set to be larger than an impedance of the clamp circuit.","In trying to detect the biological signal through the capacitive coupling between the electrode and the living body, if an input impedance when looking at the differential amplifier from the electrode is low, a loss in a frequency band of the electrical signal of the living body is increased and the electrical signal cannot be detected.","In contrast, according to the present invention described above, since the clamp circuit is constituted by using the high-impedance element and the impedance when looking at an input terminal of the differential amplifier from the connected end of the clamp circuit is set to be larger than the impedance of the clamp circuit, the loss in the frequency band of the electrical signal of the living body can be reduced. Further, since a reference potential at, e.g., the input terminal of the differential amplifier or in a stage upstream thereof can be fixedly held, variations in a central potential of the electrical signal of the living body are reduced. As a result, an SN (Signal to Noise) ratio is increased and the electrical signal of the living body can be stably detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0051"},"b":["1","41","61","81","91","101"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0002","num":"0052"},"b":["2","42","62","82"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0003","num":"0053"},"b":["4","42","62","82"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0004","num":"0054"},"b":["5","43","63","83"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0005","num":"0055"},"b":["8","44","64","84"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0006","num":"0056"},"b":"9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0007","num":"0057"},"b":["10","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0008","num":"0058"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0009","num":"0059"},"b":"12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0010","num":"0060"},"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0011","num":"0061"},"b":"22"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0012","num":"0062"},"b":"23"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0013","num":"0063"},"b":"24"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0014","num":"0064"},"b":"25"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0015","num":"0065"},"b":["45","65","66","85"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0016","num":"0066"},"b":["46","47","67","68","86","87"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0017","num":"0067"},"b":["48","49","69","70","89"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0018","num":"0068"},"b":"88"},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0019","num":"0069"},"b":["94","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0020","num":"0070"},"b":["94","111"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0021","num":"0071"},"b":["105","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0022","num":"0072"},"b":["105","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0023","num":"0073"},"b":["106","122"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0024","num":"0074"},"b":["106","122"]}]}}}},"Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings. At the outset, a first embodiment of the present invention is described.","In , an electrocardiographic signal detection device  according to the first embodiment of the present invention is a portable device, which can perform simplified electrocardiographic measurement and which can be readily lifted up by a user with one hand.

In more detail, the thumbs of both the user's hands, which are contacted with the contact surfaces A of the transparent insulating film  on the transparent electrodes  and , and the transparent electrodes  and  are capacitively coupled to each other, and the biological signals are transferred from the thumbs to the transparent electrodes  and , respectively. The biological signals having been transferred to the transparent electrodes  and  are input respectively to the filter units  in the processing circuit unit  through the current carrying lines , the signal terminals of the connectors , and the connecting lines .","Subsequently, the filter units  reduce noises mixed in the biological signals, and the baseline variation suppression unit  suppresses variations in respective baselines of the biological signals.

Therefore, the human fingers, etc. are not directly contacted with the transparent electrodes  and , and the transparent electrodes  and  are not exposed to open air. Accordingly, moisture, etc. can be prevented from adhering to the transparent electrodes  and , and deterioration of the transparent electrodes  and  can be suppressed. As a result, it is possible to enhance durability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device  and to prolong the service life thereof.","Also, in the electrocardiographic signal detection device , electrodes for detecting the biological signals are constituted as the transparent electrodes  and  each made of the transparent material, and the transparent electrodes  and  are arranged on the upper surface of the display window  in overlapped relation to the liquid crystal display screen of the display panel . Since the electrodes for detecting the biological signals are constituted as the transparent electrodes, spaces for the arrangement of the electrodes can be secured at positions overlapping with the display panel , and flexibility in selecting places where the electrodes are arranged can be increased. Further, since the transparent electrodes  and  are arranged at the positions overlapping with the display panel , a space for arrangement of other components (such as the operating buttons), which are to be arranged on the outer surface of the housing , can be easily secured.","Accordingly, the size of the electrocardiographic signal detection device  can be reduced as illustrated in . In addition, an area of the display screen of the display panel  can be increased, and the degree of freedom in design of the electrocardiographic signal detection device  can also be increased.","Moreover, since the transparent electrodes  and  are arranged on the surface of the display window , the guidance information , the arrow marks , etc. can be displayed adjacent to the transparent electrodes  and , and the operating button images  can be displayed in overlapped relation to the transparent electrodes  and , as illustrated in . As a result, operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device  can be improved so that even an ordinary person is able to easily perform the electrocardiographic measurement.","For example, the arrow marks  and the operating button images  can inform the user of the positions where the thumbs are to be placed, and the guidance information  can notify the user of, e.g., a time during which the thumbs are to be kept at rest in the state put on the contact surfaces A. Therefore, the user can perform the electrocardiographic measurement with no need of carefully reading a manual of the electrocardiographic signal detection device .","In the electrocardiographic signal detection device , the contact between the user's thumbs and the contact surfaces A of the transparent insulating film  on the transparent electrodes  and  is detected through the touch panel , and the operations of detecting the biological signals, generating the electrocardiographic signal, and computing the electrocardiographic data, etc. are automatically started in response to the result of the contact detection. As a result, the operability of the electrocardiographic signal detection device  can be improved.","The user can start the electrocardiographic measurement just by bringing the thumbs into contact with the contact surfaces A of the transparent insulating film  on the transparent electrodes  and . Hence, the user can be avoided from the necessity of performing intricate operations, such as manually starting the measurement and then quickly placing the fingers on the electrodes, or such as placing the fingers on the electrodes and then moving the finger away from the electrode to start the measurement.","Further, the small-sized electrocardiographic signal detection device  enables an ordinary person to readily perform the electrocardiographic measurement in daily life. The daily electrocardiographic measurement can be easily promoted by adding the function of a device that is frequently used in daily life, e.g., a cellular phone, a portable terminal, a portable game machine, or a car navigation system, to the electrocardiographic signal detection device  (for example, by embodying the present invention as a cellular phone equipped with the function of the electrocardiographic measurement).","The first embodiment has been described above, by way of example, in connection with the case where the two transparent electrodes  and  are arranged within the upper surface of the display window  in its forward-side portion closer to the user.

Be it noted that the same components in the fifth embodiment as those in the first embodiment are denoted by the same symbols and description of those components is omitted.","As illustrated in , an electrocardiographic signal detection device  according to the fifth embodiment of the present invention includes a processing circuit unit . As in the processing circuit unit  in the first embodiment, the processing circuit unit  includes two filter units  (described below), the baseline variation suppression unit , the differential amplifier , the arithmetic processing unit , the control unit , etc.","The filter units  are disposed in the input terminal side of the processing circuit unit . In more detail, input terminals A of the filter units  are connected respectively to the transparent electrodes  and  through the current carrying lines , the signal terminals of the connectors , and the connecting lines . Also, output terminals B of the filter units  are connected respectively to input terminals of the differential amplifier  through the baseline variation suppression unit . The filter units  reduce noises in the biological signals that are detected through capacitive coupling between the human thumbs and the transparent electrodes ,  when the human thumbs are brought into contact with the contact surfaces A of the transparent insulating film  on the transparent electrodes  and .","The filter units  are each constituted by, e.g., a low-pass filter (LPF). In more detail, as illustrated in , the filter units  are each constituted, for example, by a Sallen-Key circuit including an operational amplifier C, first and second resistances D and E connected in series between a non-inverting terminal of the operational amplifier C and the input terminal A, a first capacitor F connected between a junction between the first and second resistances D, E and an output terminal of the operational amplifier C, and a second capacitor G connected between the non-inverting terminal of the operational amplifier C and a ground. An inverting terminal and the output terminal of the operational amplifier C are connected to each other. In such a configuration, the cutoff frequency of the filter unit  is determined depending on resistance values R and R of the resistances D and E and capacity values C and C of the capacitors F and G.","A clamp circuit  is connected to the input terminal A of the filter unit . The clamp circuit  includes a ground A serving as a DC constant-voltage source, and diodes B and C each connected between the ground A and the input terminal A and serving as a high-impedance element. In such a configuration, the diodes B and C are connected in series in a mutually confronting state such that forward directions of the diodes are opposed to each other. Thus, cathodes of the diodes B and C are connected to each other, an anode of the diode B is connected to the ground A, and an anode of the diode C is connected to the input terminal A.","Therefore, the diode B has a reverse characteristic for an electrical signal at a voltage higher than the ground voltage and serves as a high-impedance element having a resistance value R of, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more. On the other hand, the diode C has a reverse characteristic for an electrical signal at a voltage lower than the ground voltage and serves as a high-impedance element having a resistance value R of, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more. The clamp circuit  fixedly holds a reference potential at the input terminal A, i.e., at the connected end of the clamp circuit , to be constant as the ground voltage.","Herein, the impedance when looking at the differential amplifier  from the connected end of the clamp circuit  is set to a value larger than the impedance (resistance value R) of the clamp circuit . In more detail, the impedance of the clamp circuit  is primarily determined by the resistance value R in the reverse characteristics of the diodes B and C. Also, the resistance value R is generally set to a value smaller than 1 G\u03a9 or more that is the input impedance at the non-inverting terminal (input terminal) of the operational amplifier C in the filter unit . Accordingly, the impedance when looking at the differential amplifier  from the transparent electrodes  and  is determined by the resistance value R of the diodes B and C.","In view of the above point, the resistance value R of the diodes B and C will be discussed below. When the biological signals are measured through capacitive coupling between the living body and the transparent electrodes ,  as in the electrocardiographic signal detection device , a loss caused at the input terminal A of each filter unit  depends on an electrostatic capacity value C between the living body and each of the transparent electrodes ,  and the resistance value R of the clamp circuit . Therefore, unless the electrostatic capacity value C and the resistance value R are appropriately selected, a loss is caused in a frequency band of the biological signal.","In this embodiment, each of the transparent electrodes  and  has a size comparable to that of a finger tip, i.e., a contact portion of the living body. Accordingly, the transparent electrodes  and  are each in a rectangular shape with one side having a length of about 10 mm to 30 mm or an elliptic shape with a diameter of about 10 mm to 30 mm. Further, the transparent electrodes  and  are each covered with the transparent insulating film  having a thickness of about several \u03bcm to several tens \u03bcm. Hence, the electrostatic capacity value C generated between the living body and each of the transparent electrodes ,  is about 70 pF to 600 pF.","In order to enable the biological signal to be detected with respect to the electrostatic capacity value C, it is required to reduce distortion of the waveform of the biological signal and to reduce the influence of radiation noise. Those requirements are satisfied when the resistance value R is larger than a value indicated by a boundary line X in . In other words, those requirements are satisfied when the resistance value R falls within a region B in .","More specifically, when the resistance value R falls within a region A in , the loss in a frequency band of 0.1 to 200 Hz of the biological signal is increased as represented by a characteristic line a in . In that case, as illustrated in , distortion of a biological signal S is increased in comparison with an ideal biological signal S having no loss, and an appropriate biological signal cannot be detected.","On the other hand, when the resistance value R is near the boundary line X in , the loss in the frequency band of 0.1 to 200 Hz of the biological signal is reduced as represented by a characteristic line x in . In that case, as illustrated in , the distortion of the biological signal S is reduced and the waveform of the biological signal S comes closer to that of the ideal biological signal S. Further, since the resistance value R is larger than that in the region A, the influence of radiation noise NG is reduced. Accordingly, it is difficult to detect the detailed waveform of the biological signal, but a peak of the biological signal can be detected.","When the resistance value R falls within the region B in , the loss in the frequency band of 0.1 to 200 Hz of the biological signal is further reduced as represented by a characteristic line b in . In that case, as illustrated in , the waveform of the biological signal S is changed substantially in the same manner as that of the ideal biological signal S, and the distortion of the biological signal S and the influence of the radiation noise NG are further reduced. Consequently, the resistance value R needs to be held within the region B in  in order to reduce both the distortion of the biological signal and the influence of the radiation noise NG. In other words, the resistance value R requires to be, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more.","In the case of an ordinary resistance element used in a clamp circuit, a resistance value is about several M\u03a9 at maximum and a high impedance at the above-mentioned level of 100 M\u03a9 or more cannot be obtained. Therefore, when the ordinary resistance element is used, the distortion of the biological signal S is increased and the SN ratio is reduced. On the other hand, in the clamp circuit  according to this embodiment, the high impedance of 100 M\u03a9 or more is realized as the resistance value R by utilizing the reverse characteristics of the diodes B and C.","More specifically, in this embodiment, the voltages of the biological signals generated depending the sizes of the transparent electrodes  and  are each about 1 to 2 mV. In that case, when the diodes B and C are connected to each other in oppositely faced relation as illustrated in , the generated voltage of 1 to 2 mV is applied as a reverse voltage to one of the diodes B and C due to the reverse characteristic thereof. However, the breakdown voltage of each of the diodes B and C is usually about 1 V. Thus, since the reverse voltage is sufficiently lower than the breakdown voltage, no electric currents flow through the diodes B and C. As a result, each of the diodes B and C functions as the high-impedance element of, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more. In this embodiment, therefore, the biological signal S can be detected as a satisfactory signal having smaller distortion and a higher SN ratio.","The externally mixed radiation noise NG primarily includes noise (50 Hz or 60 Hz) from a commercial power supply and noises (200 Hz or higher) at higher harmonics of the commercial frequency (i.e., at integer multiples of 50 Hz or 60 Hz). The noise from the commercial power supply is applied to the two transparent electrodes  and  in the same phase, and hence the noises detected through the two transparent electrodes  and  are canceled off by the differential amplifier . The other noises of 200 Hz or higher are removed by the filter units . Accordingly, the cutoff frequency of each of the filter units  is set to an appropriate value of 200 Hz or higher.","The thus-constructed fifth embodiment of the present invention can provide substantially the same advantageous effects as those in the above-described first embodiment. In trying to detect the biological signal through the capacitive coupling between each of the transparent electrodes ,  and the living body, if the impedance when looking at the differential amplifier  from the transparent electrodes  and  is low, the loss in the frequency band of the biological signal is increased and the biological signal cannot be detected. Also, if the reference potential at the input terminal A of the filter unit  is not fixedly held, variations in a central potential of the biological signal are increased and stable measurement of the biological signal is difficult to realize. In contrast, according to the fifth embodiment, since the reference potential at the input terminal A of the filter unit , which is positioned in the stage upstream of the input terminal of the differential amplifier , can be fixedly held by the clamp circuit , variations in the central potential of the biological signal can be reduced.","Further, since the clamp circuit  is constituted by the diodes B and C each serving as the high-impedance element and the impedance when looking at the input terminal of the differential amplifier  from the connected end of the clamp circuit  is set to be larger than the impedance (resistance value R) of the clamp circuit , the loss in the frequency band of the biological signal can be reduced. In addition, since the reference potential on the side upstream of the differential amplifier  can be fixedly held by the clamp circuit , variations in the central potential of the biological signal are reduced. As a result, the SN ratio is improved and the biological signal can be stably detected.","A sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to . Be it noted that the same components in the sixth embodiment as those in the first embodiment are denoted by the same symbols and description of those components is omitted.","As illustrated in , an electrocardiographic signal detection device  according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention includes a processing circuit unit . As in the processing circuit unit  in the first embodiment, the processing circuit unit  includes two filter units , the baseline variation suppression unit , the differential amplifier , the arithmetic processing unit , the control unit , etc.","Input terminals A of the filter units  are connected respectively to the transparent electrodes  and , and output terminals B of the filter units  are connected respectively to the input terminals of the differential amplifier  through the baseline variation suppression unit . Further, almost like the filter units  in the fifth embodiment, for example, the filter units  are each in the form of a low-pass filter that is constituted by a Sallen-Key circuit including an operational amplifier C, first and second resistances D and E, and first and second capacitors F and G. The filter units  are disposed in the input terminal side of the processing circuit unit  and reduce noises in the biological signals.","A clamp circuit unit  is connected to the input terminal A of each of the filter units . The clamp circuit unit  includes two first and second clamp circuits  and .","As illustrated in , the first clamp circuit  includes a ground A serving as a first DC constant-voltage source, and a diode B connected between the ground A and the input terminal A and serving as a first high-impedance element. In such a configuration, an anode of the diode B is connected to the ground A, and a cathode of the diode B is connected to the input terminal A. Therefore, the diode B has a reverse characteristic for an electrical signal at a voltage higher than the ground voltage and serves as a high-impedance element having a resistance value R of, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more.","On the other hand, the second clamp circuit  includes, e.g., a drive voltage source A for the operational amplifier C, which serves as a second DC constant-voltage source, and a diode B connected between the drive voltage source A and the input terminal A and serving as a second high-impedance element. In such a configuration, an anode of the diode B is connected to the input terminal A, and a cathode of the diode B is connected to the drive voltage source A. Therefore, the diode B has a reverse characteristic for an electrical signal at a voltage lower than a drive voltage Vcc provided by the drive voltage source A and serves as a high-impedance element having a resistance value R of, e.g., 100 M\u03a9 or more.","Herein, the impedance when looking at the differential amplifier  from connected ends of the clamp circuits  and  is set to a value larger than the impedance (resistance value R) of the clamp circuits  and . In more detail, the resistance value R in the reverse characteristics of the diodes B and B, which defines the impedance of each of the clamp circuits  and , is set to a value smaller than 1 G\u03a9 or more that is the input impedance at a non-inverting terminal (input terminal) of the operational amplifier C in the filter unit .","The clamp circuits  and  fixedly hold a reference potential at the input terminal A, i.e., at the connected ends of the clamp circuits  and , to a constant voltage that is determined in advance between the drive voltage Vcc and the ground voltage.","The thus-constructed sixth embodiment of the present invention can provide substantially the same advantageous effects as those in the above-described first and fifth embodiments. In particular, with the sixth embodiment, since the plural clamp circuits  and  are connected to the input terminal A of the filter unit , the reference potential at the input terminal A of the filter unit  can be set to any desired value between the ground voltage in the first clamp circuit  and the drive voltage Vcc in the second clamp circuit . Consequently, the reference potential at the input terminal A of the filter unit  can be set to an appropriate value in consideration of an amplifiable range of the operational amplifier C in the filter unit , the magnitude of the biological signal, and so on.","In the above-described clamp circuit  according to the fifth embodiment, the two diodes B and C are arranged with their cathodes connected to each other. However, the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. For example, as in a clamp circuit  according to a seventh embodiment illustrated in , two diodes B and C connected to a ground A may be arranged with their anodes connected to each other. Alternatively, a set of the diodes B and C or the diodes B and C oppositely faced to each other may be connected plural in series. Those arrangements of the diodes B and C according to the fifth embodiment and the diodes B and C according to the seventh embodiment can also be applied to the diodes B and B (high-impedance elements) of the clamp circuits  and  according to the sixth embodiment.","In the above-described clamp circuits  and  according to the sixth embodiment, the high-impedance element is constituted by the single diode B or B. However, the present invention is not limited to such a configuration. For example, as in clamp circuits  and  according to an eighth embodiment illustrated in , plural diodes B and plural diodes B may be connected in series to a ground A and a drive voltage source A, respectively, in such a way that forward directions of those diodes are oriented in the same direction. In that case, respective adjacent two of the diodes B and the diodes B are interconnected with a cathode of one and an anode of the other connected to each other. Such an arrangement can reduce reverse currents flowing through the diodes B and the diodes B, and can easily increase the resistance values of the clamp circuits  and .","In the fifth to eighth embodiments, the diodes B, C, B, B, B, C, B and B are employed as the high-impedance elements. Instead of the diodes B, C, B, B, B, C, B and B, however, bipolar transistors may be employed, for example, in the form that a base and a collector of each bipolar transistor are short-circuited so as to utilize a base-emitter characteristic. Alternatively, a gate and a source of a field effect transistor may be short-circuited so as to utilize a gate-source characteristic.","As another example, a high-resistance element, a high-resistance semiconductor film, or the like may also be used as the high-impedance element. The high-resistance semiconductor film can be formed by any of such processes as sputtering, CVD, MBE, and vacuum deposition, but some other suitable film forming method may be used instead. One example of the high-resistance semiconductor film is an oxide semiconductor film, but another type of high-resistance semiconductor film can also be used. Further, the high-impedance element may be obtained by forming an insulator substrate made of, e.g., silicon, gallium or arsenic, and by reducing the resistance of the substrate. The resistance of the substrate can be reduced, for example, by adding impurities to the substrate with, e.g., thermal diffusion or ion implanting.","In the above-described sixth embodiment, the same first and second clamp circuits  and  (i.e., the same clamp circuit unit ) are connected to each of the transparent electrodes  and . However, the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. For example, different clamp circuit units may be connected to the two transparent electrodes, respectively. In that case, a first DC constant-voltage source of a first clamp circuit connected to one of the transparent electrodes and a first DC constant-voltage source of a first clamp circuit connected to the other transparent electrode may have different potentials from each other. Similarly, a second DC constant-voltage source of a second clamp circuit connected to one of the transparent electrodes and a second DC constant-voltage source of a second clamp circuit connected to the other transparent electrode may have different potentials from each other. Further, respective resistance values R of the diodes B and B in the clamp circuits  and  may differ from each other.","While, in the fifth and sixth embodiments, the filter units  and  for removing the radiation noises are constituted as active filters including operational amplifiers C and C each having the high input impedance, the filter units may be each constituted as a passive filter not including the operational amplifier.","In the above-described fifth or sixth embodiment, the clamp circuit  or the clamp circuits  and  are connected to each of the transparent electrodes  and  employed in the first embodiment. However, the present invention is not limited to such an arrangement. For example, the clamp circuit  or the clamp circuits  and  may be connected to the electrodes , , , ,  and  employed in the second to fourth embodiments.","In the above-described embodiments, the electrodes , , , , etc. for detecting the biological signals (electrocardiographic signal) are disposed on, e.g., the upper surfaces of the display windows , ,  and , or on the upper surfaces of the operating buttons , ,  and , which are attached to the housings , ,  and  of the electrocardiographic signal detection devices , , , ,  and .
