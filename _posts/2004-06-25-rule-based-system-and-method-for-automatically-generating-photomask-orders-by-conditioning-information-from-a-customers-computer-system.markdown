{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/209,254, filed Jul. 30, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,842,881, and is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/099,622, filed Mar. 14, 2002.","The present invention generally relates to a rule based system and method for automatically generating photomask orders in a specified format, and more particularly, relates to a software-based application which automatically generates photomask orders in a specified format through the use of templates and rules which guide a user through the process of generating a photomask order in a complete and accurate manner. The rules and templates are established based on the requirements of a particular standard (e.g., SEMI P10) or propriety photomask order format and are organized and stored in a manner which can be adapted to meet the criteria of both modified and new photomask order formats now known or hereinafter developed. Additionally, the system and method of the present invention provides for the ability to generate new photomask orders using existing photomask order data.","Photomasks are high precision plates containing microscopic images of electronic circuits. Photomasks are typically made from very flat pieces of quartz or glass with a layer of chrome on one side. Etched in the chrome is a portion of an electronic circuit design. This circuit design on the mask is also called \u201cgeometry\u201d.","A typical photomask used in the production of semiconductor devices is formed from a \u201cblank\u201d or \u201cundeveloped\u201d photomask. As shown in , a typical blank photomask  is comprised of three or four layers. The first layer  is a layer of quartz or other substantially transparent material, commonly referred to as the substrate. The next layer is typically a layer of opaque material , such as Cr, which often includes a third layer of antireflective material , such as CrO. The antireflective layer may or may not be included in any given photomask. The top layer is typically a layer of photosensitive resist material . Other types of photomasks are also known and used including, but not limited to, phase shift masks, embedded attenuated phase shift masks (\u201cEAPSM\u201d) and alternating aperture phase shift masks (\u201cAAPSM\u201d).","The process of manufacturing a photomask involves many steps and can be time consuming. In this regard, to manufacturer a photomask, the desired pattern of opaque material  to be created on the photomask  is typically defined by an electronic data file loaded into an exposure system which typically scans an electron beam (E-beam) or laser beam in a raster or vector fashion across the blank photomask. One such example of a raster scan exposure system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,737 to Collier. Each unique exposure system has its own software and format for processing data to instruct the equipment in exposing the blank photomask. As the E-beam or laser beam is scanned across the blank photomask , the exposure system directs the E-beam or laser beam at addressable locations on the photomask as defined by the electronic data file. The areas of the photosensitive resist material that are exposed to the E-beam or laser beam become soluble while the unexposed portions remain insoluble. In order to determine where the E-beam or laser beam should expose the photoresist  on the blank photomask , and where it should not, appropriate instructions to the processing equipment need to be provided, in the form of a jobdeck.","After the exposure system has scanned the desired image onto the photosensitive resist material , as shown in , the soluble photosensitive resist material is removed by means well known in the art, and the unexposed, insoluble photosensitive resist material \u2032 remains adhered to the opaque material  and . Thus, the pattern to be formed on the photomask  is formed by the remaining photosensitive resist material \u2032.","The pattern is then transferred from the remaining photoresist material \u2032 to the photomask  via known etch processes to remove the antireflective material  and opaque materials  in regions which are not covered by the remaining photoresist \u2032. There is a wide variety of etching processes known in the art, including dry etching as well as wet etching, and thus a wide variety of equipment used to perform such etching. After etching is complete, the remaining photoresist material \u2032 is stripped or removed and the photomask is completed, as shown in . In the completed photomask, the pattern as previously reflected by the remaining antireflective material \u2032 and opaque materials \u2032 are located in regions where the remaining photoresist \u2032 remain after the soluble materials were removed in prior steps.","In order to determine if there are any unacceptable defects in a particular photomask, it is necessary to inspect the photomasks. A defect is any flaw affecting the geometry. This includes chrome where it should not be (chrome spots, chrome extensions, chrome bridging between geometry) or unwanted clear areas (pin holes, clear extensions, clear breaks). A defect can cause the customer's circuit not to function. The customer will indicate in its defect specification the size of defects that will affect their process. All defects that size and larger must be repaired, or if they can not be repaired, the mask must be rejected and rewritten.","Typically, automated mask inspection systems, such as those manufactured by KLA-Tencor or Applied Materials, are used to detect defects. Such automated systems direct an illumination beam at the photomask and detect the intensity of the portion of the light beam transmitted through and reflected back from the photomask. The detected light intensity is then compared with expected light intensity, and any deviation is noted as a defect. The details of one system can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,563,702 assigned to KLA-Tencor.","After passing inspection, a completed photomask is cleaned of contaminants. Next, a pellicle may be applied to the completed photomask to protect its critical pattern region from airborne contamination. Subsequent through pellicle defect inspection may be performed. In some instances, the photomask may be cut either before or after a pellicle is applied.","To perform each of the manufacturing steps described above, a semiconductor manufacturer (e.g., customer) must first provide a photomask manufacturer with different types of data relating to the photomask to be manufactured. In this regard, a customer typically provides a photomask order which includes various types of information and data which are needed to manufacture and process the photomask, including, for example, data relating to the design of the photomask, materials to be used, delivery dates, billing information and other information needed to process the order and manufacture the photomask.","A long standing problem in the manufacture of photomasks is the amount of time it takes to manufacture a photomask from the time a photomask order is received from a customer. In this regard, the overall time it takes to process a photomask order and manufacture a photomask can be lengthy, and thus, the overall output of photomasks is not maximized. Part of this problem is attributable to the fact that many customers who order photomasks often place their orders in a variety of different formats which are often not compatible with the photomask manufacturer's computer system and\/or manufacturing equipment. Accordingly, the photomask manufacturer is often required to reformat the order data and condition it into a different format which is compatible with its computer system and\/or manufacturing equipment, which can take a great deal of time, and thus, delay the time it takes to manufacture a photomask.","In an attempt to address these problems, the photomask industry has developed various standard photomask order formats in which photomask orders should be placed. For example, the SEMI P10 standard is one standard format used in the manufacture of photomasks. Additionally, a few semiconductor manufacturers have developed their own proprietary photomask order format in which photomask orders are to be placed, rather than adopting a standard format. These standard and proprietary photomask order formats were created so that photomask orders would be received from customers in a uniform format, thereby reducing the overall time it takes to manufacture a photomask.","Although the use of such standard and\/or proprietary photomask order formats are useful in reducing the time it takes to manufacture photomasks, many semiconductor manufacturers have been reluctant to place their photomask orders in such standard and\/or proprietary formats for a variety of reasons. For example, the SEMI P10 standard order format is quite complicated and requires the customer placing the order to have a sophisticated working knowledge of the requirements associated with such standard. Since many semiconductor manufacturers do not manufacture photomask, such manufacturers may not have the resources, time or ability to learn the intricacies of such standard format. Thus, semiconductor manufacturers often provide a photomask manufacturer with photomask order data in an unorganized and often incomplete manner. As a result, the photomask manufacturer is required to parse through this data and organize it in a useful format (e.g., in the SEMI P10 format). Additionally, in those instances where incomplete photomask order data is provided to a photomask manufacturer, such manufacturer will be required to request the missing information from the customer. As a result, a great deal of time is often wasted in the process of obtaining a complete and accurate photomask order, and thus, the overall time that it takes to manufacturer a photomask can be greatly delayed. There has been a long felt need in the field of photomask manufacture for a customer side system and method for automatically generating a complete and accurate photomask order in a standard and\/or proprietary format.","In the past, AlignRite Corporation (a predecessor organization to Photronics, Inc.), attempted to expedite the delivery of the electronic data through the use of an Internet based delivery system. However, although the AlignRite System was capable of rapid delivery of the photomask data from a customer to the computer system of the photomask manufacturer and was capable of validating the accuracy of this data in real time, this prior system did not provide for the automated generation of photomask order data in a single standard and\/or proprietary format. In this regard, once the data was received from the customer, standard modifications to the data would also have to be entered manually by operators. Each time a manual change would have to be entered, the risk of human error increased and the overall length of the job would be extended.","Others have disclosed systems in which manufacturing and billing data are down-loaded over the Internet and verified on-line automatically. One such system is described in PCT Publication Number 02\/03141, published on Jan. 10, 2002 to DuPont Photomask, Inc. More particularly, the DuPont Publication discloses a system in which photomask order data is entered on-line by a customer and transmitted to a photomask manufacturer for processing. In this system, a customer is prompted to enter photomask order data. Such data is transmitted to a photomask manufacturer, who in turn performs a diagnostic evaluation of the data. If any data is incomplete or inaccurate, the system sends a message to the customer notifying him of such error. Thereafter, the user must correct the error. After the data has been validated by the manufacturer (and corrected when necessary), the manufacturer processes this data and puts it into a standard (or proprietary) format, such as the SEMI P10 standard format.","Although useful for diagnostic purposes, the system of the DuPont PCT Publication does not prevent errors from being entered in a photomask order. In this regard, this system is only able to identify errors in a photomask order after the order has been entered by a customer and transmitted to a photomask manufacturer. Upon receiving the order, the photomask manufacturer validates the order information, and if it detects an error, sends an error message to the customer and prompts the customer to correct such error. Additionally, this system does not place the entered photomask order data into a standard format until after it has been validated and received by the photomask manufacturer. In other words, the manufacturer is required to condition the data entered by a customer into a standard format for manufacture. As a result, a great deal of time is wasted correcting the customer's data entry mistakes and converting the data into a standard format. Thus, there is a long felt need for a system and method which generates photomask orders in a standard and\/or proprietary order format and prevents errors during data entry and prior to transmission to a photomask manufacturer.","After the manufacturing steps described above are completed, the completed photomask is sent to a customer for use to manufacture semiconductor and other products. In particular, photomasks are commonly used in the semiconductor industry to transfer micro-scale images defining a semiconductor circuit onto a silicon or gallium arsenide substrate or wafer. The process for transferring an image from a photomask to a silicon substrate or wafer is commonly referred to as lithography or microlithography. Typically, as shown in , the semiconductor manufacturing process comprises the steps of deposition, photolithography, and etching. During deposition, a layer of either electrically insulating or electrically conductive material (like a metal, polysilicon or oxide) is deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer. This material is then coated with a photosensitive resist. The photomask is then used much the same way a photographic negative is used to make a photograph. Photolithography involves projecting the image on the photomask onto the wafer. If the image on the photomask is projected several times side by side onto the wafer, this is known as stepping and the photomask is called a reticle.","As shown in , to create an image  on a semiconductor wafer , a photomask  is interposed between the semiconductor wafer , which includes a layer of photosensitive material, and an optical system . Energy generated by an energy source , commonly referred to as a Stepper, is inhibited from passing through the areas of the photomask  where the opaque material is present. Energy from the Stepper  passes through the transparent portions of the quartz substrate  not covered by the opaque material  and the antireflective material . The optical system  projects a scaled image  of the pattern of the opaque material  and  onto the semiconductor wafer  and causes a reaction in the photosensitive material on the semiconductor wafer. The solubility of the photosensitive material is changed in areas exposed to the energy. In the case of a positive photolithographic process, the exposed photosensitive material becomes soluble and can be removed. In the case of a negative photolithographic process, the exposed photosensitive material becomes insoluble and unexposed soluble photosensitive material is removed.","After the soluble photosensitive material is removed, the image or pattern formed in the insoluble photosensitive material is transferred to the substrate by a process well known in the art which is commonly referred to as etching. Once the pattern is etched onto the substrate material, the remaining resist is removed resulting in a finished product. A new layer of material and resist is then deposited on the wafer and the image on the next photomask is projected onto it. Again the wafer is developed and etched. This process is repeated until the circuit is complete. Because, in a typical semiconductor device many layers may be deposited, many different photomasks may be necessary for the manufacture of even a single semiconductor device. Indeed, if more than one piece of equipment is used by a semiconductor manufacturer to manufacturer a semiconductor device, it is possible more than one photomask may be needed, even for each layer. Furthermore, because different types of equipment may also be used to expose the photoresist in the different production lines, even the multiple identical photomask patterns may require additional variations in sizing, orientation, scaling and other attributes to account for differences in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Similar adjustments may also be necessary to account for differences in the photomask manufacturer's lithography equipment. These differences need to be accounted for in the photomask manufacturing process.","While the prior art is of interest, the known methods and apparatus of the prior art present several limitations which the present invention seeks to overcome.","In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a rule-based system and method for automatically generating a photomask order into one or more standard and\/or proprietary formats, wherein the rules can be adapted or modified to meet any number of different standard and\/or proprietary formats now known or hereinafter developed.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rule-based system and method for automatically generating a photomask order into one or more standard and\/or proprietary formats, wherein the system and method requires a user to follow a set of rules associated with a standard and\/or proprietary format for photomask orders.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rule-based system and method for automatically generating a photomask order into one or more standard and\/or proprietary formats, wherein an order is generated by merging existing photomask order(s) and\/or templates containing photomask data into a single, new order.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rule-based photomask order system and method for reducing photomask order and data entry times.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rule-based photomask order system and method for reducing transcription errors associated with the manual entry of photomask orders.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a rule-based photomask order system and method for increasing the overall output of photomasks being manufactured.","It is another object of the present invention to solve the shortcomings of the prior art.","Other objects will become apparent from the foregoing description.","A system for generating photomask orders in a specified format according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention includes at least one template or order for entry and storage of photomask order data, wherein the at least one template or order is created based upon requirements of a specified photomask order format, at least one set of rules corresponding to the at least one template or order, wherein the set of rules includes instructions which insure that a user enter complete information into the at least one template or order as required by the specified order format, a graphical user interface associated with the at least one template or order, wherein the user can access the at least one template or order to enter photomask order data and create an order in a specified format, and a data processing mechanism for importing electronic information from external media into the at least one template or order.","A system for generating photomask orders in a specified format according to another exemplary embodiment of the invention includes at least one template or order for entry and storage of photomask order data, wherein the at least one template or order is created based upon requirements of a specified photomask order format, at least one set of rules corresponding to the at least one template or order, wherein the set of rules includes instructions which insure that a user enter complete information into the template or order as required by the specified order format, and a data-processing mechanism for accessing one or more external sources of electronic information, wherein the one or more sources of electronic information are accessed through a data service system.","A method for generating photomask orders in a specified format according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention includes generating at least one order for the storage of photomask order data, wherein the at least one order is created by entering data into one or more templates governed by at least one set of rules, and accessing electronic information from an external database by a data processing mechanism to incorporate the electronic information into the one or more templates.","A method for generating photomask orders in a specified format according to another exemplary embodiment of the invention includes generating at least one order for the storage of photomask order data, wherein the at least one order is created by entering data into at least one template governed by at least one set of rules, accessing electronic information from a data service, and incorporating the electronic information into the order.","A processor readable storage medium according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention contains processor readable code for programming a processor to perform a method including the steps of generating at least one order for the storage of photomask order data, wherein the at least one order is created by entering data into at least one template governed by at least one set of rules, accessing electronic information from a data service, and incorporating the electronic information into the order.","The present invention relates to a computerized rule-based system and method for automatically generating photomask orders in a specified format, wherein a photomask customer desiring to place an order for a photomask is guided through the process of entering an order in a complete and accurate manner in accordance with the requirements of the specified order format. To carry out these functions, the system and method utilizes the following four components to generate a photomask order into a desired format: (1) templates in which data is entered; (2) rules for converting the data entered in the templates into a specified standard and\/or proprietary format; (3) a method for using templates to create a photomask order in a specified format; and (4) a separate set of rules for validating photomask order against a specified standard format. Software is implemented in this system to associate specific templates with specific rules to ensure that a customer enters complete and accurate photomask order information. Likewise, software is implemented in the system of the present invention to associate specific photomask orders with specific rules to ensure that a customer enters complete and accurate photomask order information.","Before describing this software, it is first necessary to describe the manner in which the templates, orders and rules are stored and organized. More particularly, the system includes a server and an external data storage media stored on the server. Rules and templates for facilitating the entry of photomask order data and for generating an order are stored in the external storage media. The external data storage media may be a variety of different types of storage media, including, but not limited to, a relational database, an object-oriented class, an XML file and other similar storage media now known or hereinafter developed. By maintaining the storage media external to the system and by providing flexibility in the type of storage media that can be used with the system and method of the present invention, a variety of different users and automated systems may operate the system dynamically across a variety of different platforms.","In a preferred embodiment, a set of templates and orders are created based on the requirements of a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format. In this regard, the templates and orders are organized as a hierarchy of components and subcomponents, wherein each component and subcomponent is defined by the requirements of a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format. For example, a particular photomask order format may require that the mask data component include certain subcomponents, such as a title, barcode and pattern data, to name a few. Each of these subcomponents may have further detailed subcomponents (\u201cchild component\u201d). For example, the pattern data component, which is a subcomponent of the mask data component, may have a set of child components associated therewith. Depending upon the requirements of the standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format, these child components may have additional subcomponents as well, which can in turn, have their own subcomponents and so forth and so on. Each component and subcomponent is defined by a set of attributes (e.g., binary, string, integer, real number, date, Boolean, list, etc.). Since templates are used to create photomask orders, the rules (discussed in more detail below) associated with a given template can be can be a subset of the rules associated with the photomask order that is created from the template. This will allow the user to leave certain information or components out of a template in the event that such information changes for each new order created from the given template. Table 1 demonstrates an example of how the components and subcomponents of the templates and orders may be organized according to a standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Order",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Supplied Pattern Data"]},{"entry":[{},"Pattern Group"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pattern Placement"]},{"entry":[{},"Mask Data",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Title"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Barcade"]},{"entry":[{},{},"OPC Definition"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Array Registration"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Measure File"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Registration"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Die to Data"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Die to Die"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Surface Definition"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Visual Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Pattern"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Critical"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Dimension"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Die to Die"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Die to Data"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Field"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"Patten"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Critical"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Dimension"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Die to Die"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Die to Data"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Inspection"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Templates and orders may be created manually using a graphical user interface. Templates and orders may also be automatically created or modified using information from other, external media, including, but not limited to, non-formatted text files, XML files, or some type of data storage device or mechanism. For example, a customer's computer may include such files, databases or other electronic information that would be useful in creating a new template or order or providing missing information for an existing template or order. A data-processing mechanism may be used to import necessary information from these external media into new or existing templates or orders. For example, a translation or mapping software could be used to convert the customer's files or databases into a format which would be needed for the application. A commercially available example of such software is Data Junction, a visual design tool for rapidly integrating and transforming data between hundreds of applications and structured data formats. However, any appropriate commercial or proprietary translation or mapping software could be used to accomplish this task. The external information may be imported into the templates or orders either locally to the order processing system, or via an existing network connection, like a wide area network or local area network or internet, etc. They may also be accepted by other known techniques such as FTP protocol, e-mail, http, proprietary protocols, or any other known protocols that may be available to transfer the information.","Once generated, either in whole or in part, in one embodiment of the disclosed system, the orders and\/or templates may be transferred or accessed by different users of the system of the present invention, or different systems of the present invention. For example, one user at a customer may e-mail or otherwise transfer a template or order to a different user at that customer or a different customer so that the transferred template or order could be used to make a new or modified template or order. Of course, such transfer may occur by other methods of transfer such as FTP protocol, transferring on disk or other storage medium, etc.","When making a photomask order, customers may not have access to, or knowledge of, all required information to complete an order. In the past, the lack of such information would delay the order completion process and require that such information be manually collected from appropriate sources.","Under one embodiment of the present invention, such information is automatically retrieved, at least in part, from other sources which have the required information and require little, or no input on the part of the customer. For example, in the event that the information required to be entered into an order which are governed by a first set of rules is unavailable to the customer, the data processing mechanism of the present invention can access a data-service that will provide the capability to search for this required information. An example of such a data-service would include ServiceObjects, which enables users to simultaneously access Internet sites, databases, intranets and other internal and external resources as if the content existed in a single location and to package information, such as shipping information, in a format that can be accessed by other programs. In this example, the application would send a data query to the data-service seeking specific shipping options that may be available for the photomask being ordered. The data-service would in turn, send the requested information back to the application, which would then provide such information to the customer using the application. Other types of data-services could also be used for such information such as logistics, inventories, supply characteristics, equipment availability, run times, tool up time, level loading, capacity information, or any other such information that a customer would desire in order to prepare a specific photomask order.","The data-service may be either locally on the customer's computer or network or remotely located from the customer's order processing system, and may itself access data from any number or type of remote computer systems (e.g., the logistic vendor's computer system, the parts supplier's computer system, the equipment supplier's computer system, the photomask manufacturer's computer system, etc.) who publish in an interface known to both the application software and the data-service, and can use any number of acceptable protocols, including, for example, SOAP, XML, XML-RPC, ebXML, HTML, etc. The data-service may search (e.g., by query) these remote systems for the information not available to the customer, and if available, retrieve such data. Optionally, the data-service can be configured to verify data, if so desired. The data-service's search mechanism may be configurable based on the user's desired information (e.g., logistics, supply, processing time, etc.) which can be based on any number of possible parameters (e.g., costs, time, customer name, mask size, stepper equipment to be used, etc.) provided by the user's system.","All operations performed by a person via a graphical user interface may also be performed, at least in part, in an automated manner; that is to say without human interaction. The invention may provide access to this functionality via a plain-text instruction set or command line. A plain text instruction set is a high level programming language which can be interpreted into the application programming interface to instruct the application to perform a series of operations. For example, a command line stating \u201creplace device name \u2018Device A\u2019 with device name \u2018Device B\u2019\u201d could be sent to the system by a user at the customer's network, or automatically as detailed above. When the system receives this command line, it would replace the device name in a specific template or order with the new device name. Of course, this is merely one example of how an instruction set could be used, and is not meant to be limiting within the scope of the present invention. Custom modules may be created for use on the customer's system to access this instruction using any programming language capable of producing an ASCII or binary file and executing an operating system command. Automated implementation will allow access by authorized users to any authorized system via an existing network connection. Typical security measures such as firewalls, log-ins, passwords, etc. can be used to protect the confidentiality of the database and mask ordering system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["110","100","130","100","120","120","120","140","150"]},"The execution of any task in an automated manner, may include alert notification of any system failure or process invalidation based on either sets of rules. Notification is configurable by the end user, and may be in the form of email, messaging, log files or database entries. In one embodiment, the notification feature automatically generates a message sent to a distribution list of the names of people who will be involved in the ordering of the photomask. This distribution list can be established by any predetermined criteria. Once the message is generated, each person on the distribution list may be automatically notified that an order for a photomask has been generated. Such notifications may include e-mail, beepers, mobile telephones, etc. This automatic notification process can be set up anywhere in the Customer's Network or even the Manufacturer's Network and be triggered by any step that the Customer desires. This example should not be treated as limiting to the present invention and is merely illustrative of the type of notification system that can be incorporated with the present invention.","Upon notification of the preparation of a new or modified photomask order, the present invention can automatically forward the order to the photomask manufacturer, if no errors are present, or may wait for authorization from a user of the customer system. If errors are identified, the customer may then manually edit the order to fix such errors, and continue to process the order in a normal manner.","In another embodiment, an incomplete photomask order may be generated which includes design information in a format which can be transferred to the photomask manufacturer's processing system to allow the photomask manufacturer to verify the validity, feasibility and\/or desirability of the design. For example, a customer may transfer a partial photomask order including fracture instructions which could then be transmitted to the photomask manufacturer to be analyzed for validity, feasibility and\/or desirability of the proposed design. This could be done either automatically as described above, or manually. If automated, the system could upon receipt of information regarding a proposed partial photomask order generate the information necessary to submit fracture instructions to a photomask supplier for further analysis and evaluation. Upon submission of the information, the photomask manufacturer may then also propose alternative designs which may be more feasible or desirable from the manufactures'perspective or otherwise. The results of the photomask manufacturer's analysis may then be transmitted to the customer computer system for further consideration by the customer on whether to go forward with the order or modify the proposed order.","Preferably, each template and order is stored in a database, but may also be stored in other locations. A search engine may be provided on which users can search for a particular template or order stored in the database. Using the search engine, the user can locate the appropriate templates that are needed to generate a photomask in a particular order format. Once such templates are located, data relating to a photomask order is entered by a user (typically, a photomask customer desiring to place an order for a photomask). The user can also use the search engine to locate existing photomask orders for the purpose of completing the data entry or modifying their content, as described below.","As noted above, a customer may not have sufficient knowledge of the requirements of a particular photomask order format, and thus, may not enter all necessary information required by such standards to complete an order. Additionally, customers are prone to making data entry errors, and thus, may provide inaccurate information. Accordingly, a first and second set of rules are established and stored on the system to ensure that the customer enters complete and accurate data into the templates and orders, as required by a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format.","In the preferred embodiment, the first set of rules are established to ensure that a user inputs all necessary data to output a complete photomask order, as specified by a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format. Preferably, the first set of rules are established based on the requirements of a selected photomask order format. In this regard, the first set of rules dictate whether data \u201cmust\u201d be input, \u201ccan\u201d be input and\/or \u201cmust not\u201d be input into each component and subcomponent of a template or order, as dictated by the specified photomask order format. Additionally, the first set of rules should be configured such that they will require the user to enter information into any other components which are required (as set forth in a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format) to complete a photomask order.","Thus, for example, referring to Table 1, a particular standard order format may require, with respect to the \u201cPattern\u201d template, that for all EAPSM orders: placement data and critical dimensions data must be provided; die to die inspection data may be provided; and die to data cannot be provided. Accordingly, rules are established and associated with the appropriate templates (and components and sub-components) which require that: 1) the user \u201cmust\u201d include placement data and critical dimension data; 2) the user \u201ccan\u201d include die to die inspection data; and 3) the user \u201cmust not\u201d include die to data inspection data. Accordingly, in this example, when a user seeks to create an order for an EAPSM using the system and method of the present invention, the rules will: 1) require the user to input placement and critical dimension data; 2) permit (but not require) a user to enter die to die inspection data; and 3) preclude a user from entering die to data inspection. Additionally, the selected order format may require that in addition to Pattern Data, Array Registration data must also be entered to complete a photomask order. Accordingly, the first set of rules would also be configured such that once the user has completed entering all the pattern data, the user will be guided to the \u201cArray Registration\u201d template and be prompted to enter all required data into that template (and any other corresponding subcomponents of that template) as well. Similarly, if the standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format requires the entry of data into any other templates to complete a photomask order, the first set of rules will guide the user to such other templates after the user has entered all data into the Array Registration template, and prompt the user to enter all required data into such template(s). Once the user has entered data in all required templates, the user will be permitted to finalize the template (subject to entering data according to the second set of rules as discussed below).","Thus, as should be apparent, the first set of rules of the present invention ensure that the user enters the necessary information into the appropriate templates as required by a particular standard and\/or proprietary format to generate a photomask order. Put another way, the rules guide a user through the process of entering photomask order data to ensure that all necessary order information is entered into the templates.","Additionally, the system and method also provide for a second set of rules which ensure that a user inputs data in an accurate and proper format, as specified by a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format. As noted above, each component and subcomponent of a template is defined by a set of attributes (e.g., binary, string, integer, real number, date, Boolean, list, etc.). Thus, in a preferred embodiment, a second set of rules are established for each template and order that indicates to the user whether the data entered into a particular template or order \u201cmust\u201d, \u201ccan\u201d and\/or \u201cmust not\u201d have a particular attribute, as required by a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format. For example, referring to Table 1, a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format may require that: 1) the data entered into the placement template \u201cmust\u201d be an integer; 2) the data entered into the title template \u201ccan\u201d be a string; and 3) the data entered into the critical dimension template \u201cmust not\u201d be a string. Accordingly, a rule is established for the placement template which: 1) requires the user to enter an integer in the placement template; 2) allows the user to enter a string into the title template; and 3) prevents the user from entering a string into the critical dimension template. Thus, as should be apparent, the rules of the present invention ensure that the user enters the appropriate type of information into each template as required by a particular standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format to generate a photomask order. Put another way, the second set of rules only permit the user to enter a certain type of data into a template, and thus, reduce the possibility of there being design errors and\/or data entry errors in the process of placing a photomask order.","In a preferred embodiment, the first and second set of rules described herein are created and stored separately. As noted above, the rules may be stored either internal or external to the system in any different number of dynamic formats (e.g., as a database, an object-oriented class, an XML file, etc.) so that the system may be adapted to run on any number of platforms, depending the preferences or a user and\/or automated system. It should be noted, however, that a single set of rules can be created and stored, provided that such single set of rules both ensures that a user both enters complete photomask order information (as described with reference to the first set of rules) and enters accurate photomask order information (as described with reference to the second set of rules). Further, the first and second set of rules may be combined as a single set of rules in a similar manner.","As noted above, the present invention includes a function to associate specific first and second sets of rules with specific templates, to ensure that a photomask order is generated in a complete and accurate manner. In the preferred embodiment, this functionality is provided in the form of a software-based application installed on the computer of an entity desiring to place an order for a photomask, such as a semiconductor manufacturer. Unlike the prior art, this software is not dependent on a given photomask manufacturer's manufacturing process. Rather, the software of the present invention can be deployed as a stand-alone secure application, a network distributed application or a web-based \u201cthin-client\u201d application. Preferably, the software is utilized in a client-server system, wherein a graphical user interface (e.g., the client) connects to and retrieves data from a database on the server. In all cases, the customer running the software of the present invention is not required to access and\/or login to any external local area network of a photomask manufacturer to place an order.","The manner in which the software of the present invention associates specific rules with specific templates is now described. In particular, since the templates are hierarchical collections of data, each element of a template is interpreted by an associated software object. In the preferred embodiment, rules are embedded within the software objects and are responsible for the assembly of the data entered in the templates. These rules are constraints or instructions, such as an algorithm, and typically relate to one or more attributes of the software object. Accordingly, with this arrangement, it is possible to enter a complete and accurate photomask order as the rules and templates are appropriately associated with each other.","Additionally, the system is preferably configured to permit the rules and templates to be separately updated should the need arise. In this regard, the current standard photomask order format is known as the SEMI P-10 standard format. However, it is anticipated that as technological advances are made, a new standard format may be developed to cover these advances, and thus, replace the current SEMI P-10 standard format. Additionally, there are currently many other international standard order formats that are used by photomask manufacturers overseas. As with the SEMI P-10 format, it is expected that these international formats will also change or be replaced over time. Thus, the system of the present invention provides for the ability to update the rules and templates to meet these changes. More particularly, the first and second sets of rules are preferably stored as separate files from each of the templates, which are in turn also each stored as separate files. By keeping the rules and templates separate, any modification to one will have no effect on the other. In this regard, when the rules or templates are modified, there will be no need for a correlative code change to a corresponding element where none would be indicated by the proximate feature modification. Additionally, by storing the rules and templates separately, the possibility of the occurrence of a system seize-up (e.g., where unanticipated changes to an embedded or inner-nested element might cause an unanticipated failure) can be avoided. In this regard, if rules and templates were not stored separately, independent modification would be impossible. Each existing template, of which there could be thousands, would then have to be modified individually to include the new rules. Thus, as should be readily apparent, the system and method of the present invention is not limited to any one particular standard format, but rather can be easily adapted to conform to the requirements of any current or newly developed standard photomask order format. Similarly, a customer may change its proprietary order format to meet any changes associated with new developments or improved technologies.","To modify the rules, software objects are established such that the rules contained therein may affect one or more of its attributes, its children or other rules contained within it. In this regard, the rules are established such that only certain specified attributes are affected by rules. Thus, since the software objects, like templates, are hierarchical in nature, they know both their parent and children. Accordingly, any time a child object is modified, it notifies its parent of the area, rules or attributes impacted by the change. As a result, any change made anywhere within the hierarchy of rules is propagated through the entire family. Accordingly, the rules have the capability to enforce the addition of, or the removal of, any child element of the parent. Thus, within the application, each object is individually updateable through subsequent releases of the software. Additionally, object parents maintain a standard collection for each type of child element, which can be added or removed while the template is being constructed.","Templates can also be modified in response to a modification of a standard and\/or proprietary photomask order format which requires the addition of new attributes and\/or subcomponents to be added to hierarchy of orders and templates. In such instances, the new relationships are defined for affected components and\/or subcomponents and new rules are dynamically added to the existing rule schema.","To illustrate these features of the present invention, the following example is now described. The current Semi P-10 standard requires that a photomask order include, among other things: Mask Order[ ], Mask Set [ ], Mask Definition [ ], and Pattern Definition[ ]. Thus, according to this requirement, the following templates would be established: SemiOrder Template, SemiMaskSet Template, SemiMask Template and SemiPattern Template. Additionally, a first and second set of rules for each of these templates would be established which dictate whether data must be entered into each of the templates and the type of data that can be entered into such templates. However, at a later point in time, the Semi P-10 standard may be replaced by a new standard that requires a CD component. Thus, the existing templates (e.g., SemiPattern) could be modified to include, for example, a CD component to conform to a modification of the metrology aspect of the SEMI P-10 standard. Additionally, a new template could be created to conform to any newly added aspects (e.g., registration) of the new SEMI standard. Similarly, the already existing first and second set of rules could be adapted to meet the changes associated with the modified CD component aspect of the current SEMI P-10 standard. Additionally, a new set of first and second set of rules could be created to conform to the new registration feature of the new SEMI standard.","Another aspect of the present invention is that it provides for the ability to generate new photomask orders by: (1) merging data into a new order from an already existing template having data contained therein; (2) merging data into a new order from an already existing order having data contained therein; or (3) merging data into a new order from already existing templates and orders. In this regard, whenever a user enters data into either a template or creates an order, such template and\/or order is saved on the system of the present invention. Thereafter, a user is able to access the already existing templates and\/or orders and use the data saved therein to generate a new order. By providing a user of the system of the present invention with the ability to merge data from already existing orders and\/or templates, the process for entering photomask order data is greatly reduced, thereby reducing the overall time it takes to manufacture a photomask order. Each of the three methods for merging data into an order is described below.","In one embodiment, to create a new order from an existing template(s), the user is prompted to create a new, blank order. Next, the user is provided with the option of selecting templates and\/or orders which were created and saved from a previous photomask order. Depending upon the type of photomask to be manufactured from the new order, the user selects and loads the most relevant template(s) stored in the relational database. The selected template is displayed to the user with previously entered data. For each non-null object within the template (e.g., the object contains data), the user may either select the previously entered data into the new order or over-write this data with new data. Additionally, to the extent that a particular object within a template is null (e.g., it is already empty), the user may enter appropriate data within that object. Next, the rules established for this order operate as described above to ensure that data is accurately and completely entered. Thereafter, the software processes this information and generates a new order based on this information.","The process for creating a new order from an already existing order is similar to the process of creating a new order from an already existing template. In this embodiment, to create a new order from an existing order(s), the user is prompted to create a new, blank order. Next, the user is provided with the option of selecting templates and\/or orders which were created and saved from a previous photomask order.

Additionally, to the extent that a particular object within an order is null, the user may enter appropriate data within that object. Next, the rules established for this order operate as described above to ensure that data is accurately and completely entered. Thereafter, the software processes this information and generates a new order based on this information.","In yet another embodiment, to create a new order from both an existing template(s) and order(s), the user is prompted to create a new, blank order. Next, the user is provided with the option of selecting templates and\/or orders which were created and saved from a previous photomask order. Depending upon the type of photomask to be manufactured from the new order, the user selects and loads the relevant template(s) stored in a relational database.

Additionally, previously saved orders may also be merged into the same order. In this regard, the user can select and load previously placed order(s) stored in a relational database. The selected order is displayed to the user with previously entered data. For each non-null object within the order (e.g., the object contains data), the user may either select the previously entered data into the new order or over-write this data with new data.

Next, the rules established for this order operate as described above to ensure that data is accurately and completely entered. Once all of the appropriate templates and orders have been merged into the new order, the software processes this information and generates a new order based on this information.","Now that the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in detail, various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art.
