title: Tunable architecture for aircraft fault detection
abstract: A method for detecting faults in an aircraft is disclosed. The method involves predicting at least one state of the aircraft and tuning at least one threshold value to tightly upper bound the size of a mismatch between the at least one predicted state and a corresponding actual state of the non-faulted aircraft. If the mismatch between the at least one predicted state and the corresponding actual state is greater than or equal to the at least one threshold value, the method indicates that at least one fault has been detected.

The two main objectives of the U.S. Government's Aviation Safety Program are to develop and demonstrate technologies that reduce aircraft accident rates, and develop technologies that reduce aviation injuries and fatalities when accidents do occur. Fault detection, isolation, and reconfiguration (FDIR) for flight control continues to be an active area of research in the aerospace community. To date, a wide variety of technologies have been demonstrated in high-fidelity simulations (that is, simulations with minimal distortions) and in actual flight tests with various levels of success.","For model-based aircraft fault detection, a mathematical model of the aircraft is used. Model-based fault detection is based on comparing measurements from the aircraft with corresponding error predictions from the aircraft model (that is, residual processing). In real life situations, the comparison of these signals is not trivial. This is due to the fact that (typically) there are imperfections in most mathematical flight simulation models coinciding with multiple sources of aircraft measurements errors. Therefore, any fault detection algorithms require fast and reliable processing in the presence of modeling and measurement errors.","The following specification addresses an architecture and tuning procedure for aircraft fault detection. Particularly, in one embodiment, a method for detecting faults in an aircraft is provided. The method involves predicting at least one state of the aircraft and tuning at least one threshold value to tightly upper bound the size of a mismatch between the at least one predicted state and a corresponding actual state of the non-faulted aircraft. If the mismatch between the at least one predicted state and the corresponding actual state is greater than or equal to the at least one threshold value, the method indicates that at least one fault has been detected.","Like reference numbers and designations in the various drawings indicate like elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","104","106","102","102","104","106","104","104","104","110","110","112","104","104","114","114","116","118","118","120","120","122","122","104","104","124","124","126","104"],"sub":["1 ","2 ","1 ","2","1 ","2","1 ","2","1 ","2 ","1 ","2"]},"The flight deck  further includes a flight display .

The flight deck control model  models operational behavior of the flight simulation block  so that any mismatch is reduced in actual movements versus predicted movements of the non-faulted aircraft model block . The flight deck control model  reconfigures control of the flight deck  in real-time based on a tunable fault detection algorithm and a fault isolation algorithm. The tunable fault detection algorithm is described further below in connection with . By incorporating the tunable fault detection algorithm, the flight deck control model  maintains a required level of fault detection for at least the aircraft faults discussed above with respect to .","In operation, the control law block  and fault detection block  receive one or more flight commands from the flight command block .

In one implementation, the fault isolation block  estimates the change in H(\u0394H) for every fault that the fault detection block  detects using a recursive least squares (RLS) estimator. The RLS estimator receives a processed state of the aircraft , one or more control surface position measurements of the aircraft , and one or more angular accelerations of the aircraft  from the fault detection block . The fault isolation block  isolates at least one fault when the estimate of \u0394Hconverges. Once the at least one fault is isolated, the fault isolation block  updates the control law block  with a reconfigured control law (that is, reconfigures the Hif matrix).

The fault detection block  determines a difference (that is, an error) between measured and estimated angular accelerations to produce a residual signal (as further discussed in detail below with respect to ). The residual signal is subsequently compared to a fault detection threshold within the fault detection block . When the residual signal is greater than the fault detection threshold, a fault is flagged on the flight display block . As further discussed in detail below with respect to , the fault detection block  tightly bounds one or more differences between predicted states and actual states of the non-faulted aircraft . The fault detection block  is further responsible for substantially minimizing missed fault detections and reducing false alarms.
