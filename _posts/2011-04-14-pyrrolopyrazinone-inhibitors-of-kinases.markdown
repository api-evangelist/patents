Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/324,882 filed Apr. 16, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","Eukaryotic cells divide by a directed, step-wise process referred to as the cell cycle. Cells must first replicate their DNA in S phase before separating their sister chromatids in mitosis (karyokinesis) and splitting off into two daughter cells (cytokinesis). In mammalian cells, DNA replication must be initiated at multiple sites (replication origins) throughout the genome to ensure that all the genetic material is duplicated prior to mitosis. To maintain genome integrity, DNA must be replicated only once per cell cycle, and so this process is highly regulated and governed by checkpoints. Before replication is initiated, origins must be licensed through the formation of pre-replication complexes (pre-RCs) in early G1. Formation of pre-RCs involves the step-wise binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to origins followed by the binding of the loading factors Cdc6 and Cdt1. These proteins then recruit the putative DNA replicative helicase complex, MCM2-7. Once this pre-RC is formed, replication initiation requires the activation of S-phase-promoting serine\/threonine kinases, Cyclin\/Cdks and Cdc7\/Dbf4. These kinases consist of an enzymatic subunit (CDKs and Cdc7) and a regulatory sub-unit (Cyclins for CDKs; Dbf4 or Drf1 for Cdc7). They phosphorylate multiple MCMs in pre-RCs in a sequential manner, thereby activating the helicase and recruiting other DNA replication factors (Cdc45, GINS complex, etc.) for DNA synthesis (for reviews, see Kim et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2006; Lau et al., 2007; Stillman, 2005). MCM2 Serine-40 and Serine-53 are well-characterized phosphorylation sites for Cdc7\/Dbf4 (Cho et al., 2006; Montagnoli et al., 2006; Tsuji et al., 2006).","Inhibiting regulators of replication initiation, such as Cdc6, Cdc7\/Dbf4 or Cdc7\/Drf1, has lethal consequences in cancerous cells, whereas normal cells are able to arrest and resume normal divisions once initiation activity is restored (Feng et al., 2003; Montagnoli et al., 2004; see Lau and Jiang, 2006, for review). Small molecule inhibitors of the protein kinase Cdc7 are thus attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in cancer, inflammation and other cell proliferative disorders.","The present invention has numerous embodiments.

A carbocyclyl may be a single-ring (monocyclic) or polycyclic ring structure.","A carbocyclyl may be a single ring structure, which typically contains from 3 to 8 ring atoms, more typically from 3 to 6 ring atoms, and even more typically 5 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of such single-ring carbocyclyls include cyclopropyl (cyclopropanyl), cyclobutyl (cyclobutanyl), cyclopentyl (cyclopentanyl), cyclopentenyl, cyclopentadienyl, cyclohexyl (cyclohexanyl), cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, and phenyl. A carbocyclyl may alternatively be polycyclic (i.e., may contain more than one ring). Examples of polycyclic carbocyclyls include bridged, fused, and spirocyclic carbocyclyls. In a spirocyclic carbocyclyl, one atom is common to two different rings. An example of a spirocyclic carbocyclyl is spiropentanyl. In a bridged carbocyclyl, the rings share at least two common non-adjacent atoms. Examples of bridged carbocyclyls include bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-enyl, and adamantanyl.

Examples of aryls include phenyl, naphthalenyl, and indenyl.","In some instances, the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix \u201cC\u2014C-\u201d, wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus, for example, \u201cC-C-alkyl\u201d refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further, C-C-cycloalkyl means a saturated hydrocarbyl ring containing from 3 to 8 carbon ring atoms.","The term \u201chydrogen\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a hydrogen radical, and may be depicted as \u2014H.","The term \u201chydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014OH.","The term \u201ccarboxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014OH.","The term \u201camino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014NH.","The term \u201chalogen\u201d or \u201chalo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means a fluorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014F), chlorine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Cl), bromine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014Br), or iodine radical (which may be depicted as \u2014I).","If a substituent is described as being \u201csubstituted\u201d, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","If a substituent is described as being \u201coptionally substituted\u201d, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.","This patent application uses the terms \u201csubstituent\u201d and \u201cradical\u201d interchangeably.","The prefix \u201chalo\u201d indicates that the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, haloalkyl means an alkyl substituent in which at least one hydrogen radical is replaced with a halogen radical. Examples of haloalkyls include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated).","The prefix \u201cperhalo\u201d indicates that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is replaced with independently selected halogen radicals, i.e., each hydrogen radical on the substituent is replaced with a halogen radical. If all the halogen radicals are identical, the prefix typically will identify the halogen radical. Thus, for example, the term \u201cperfluoro\u201d means that every hydrogen radical on the substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with a fluorine radical. To illustrate, the term \u201cperfluoroalkyl\u201d means an alkyl substituent wherein a fluorine radical is in the place of each hydrogen radical.","The term \u201ccarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014.","The term \u201caminocarbonyl\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means \u2014C(O)\u2014NH.","The term \u201coxo\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means (\u2550O).","The term \u201coxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an ether substituent, and may be depicted as \u2014O\u2014.","The term \u201calkylhydroxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-OH.","The term \u201calkylamino\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means -alkyl-NH.","The term \u201calkyloxy\u201d (alone or in combination with another term(s)) means an alkylether substituent, i.e., \u2014O-alkyl.
