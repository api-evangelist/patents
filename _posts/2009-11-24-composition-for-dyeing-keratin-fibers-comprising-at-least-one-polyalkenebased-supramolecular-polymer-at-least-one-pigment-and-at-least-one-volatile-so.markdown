{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/118,028, filed Nov. 26, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application also claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119 to French Patent Application No. FR 0857936, filed Nov. 24, 2008, the contents of which are also incorporated herein by reference.","The present disclosure relates to a composition for dyeing keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes, comprising at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent, wherein the weight ratio of the at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer to the at least one pigment has a value greater than 0.25.","In the keratin-fiber dyeing field, it is already known practice to dye keratin fibers by various techniques using direct dyes for nonpermanent colorations or dye precursors for permanent colorations.","Nonpermanent dyeing or direct dyeing consists in dyeing the keratin fibers with dye compositions containing direct dyes. These dyes may be colored or coloring molecules that have an affinity for keratin fibers. They may be applied to the keratin fibers for a period of time necessary to obtain the desired coloration, and then rinsed off.","The conventional dyes that may be used are, for example, nitrobenzene, anthraquinone, nitropyridine, azo, xanthene, acridine, azine or triarylmethane dyes, or natural dyes.","Some of these dyes can be used under lightening conditions, thereby making it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair.","It is also known practice to dye keratin fibers permanently by oxidation dyeing. This dyeing technique consists in applying, to the keratin fibers, a composition containing dye precursors such as oxidation bases and couplers. Under the action of an oxidizing agent, these precursors will form at least one colored substance in the hair.","The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colors to be obtained, and the colorations resulting therefrom are generally permanent, strong and resistant to external agents, for example to light, bad weather, washing, perspiration and rubbing.","In order to be visible on dark hair, these two dyeing techniques may require prior or simultaneous bleaching of the keratin fibers. This bleaching step, carried out with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or persalts, may result in appreciable degradation of the keratin fibers, which may impair their cosmetic properties. The hair then may have a tendency to become coarse, more difficult to disentangle and\/or more brittle.","Another dyeing method consists in using pigments. Specifically, the use of pigment at the surface of keratin fibers generally makes it possible to obtain visible colorations on dark hair, since the surface pigment masks the natural color of the fiber.","The colorations obtained via this dyeing method may have the drawback of being removed as soon as the first shampooing operation.","Thus, the present disclosure relates to a composition for dyeing keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes, which may make it possible to obtain colored coatings that are fast with respect to shampoo and\/or to the various attacks to which the hair may be subjected, without degrading the keratin fibers and\/or while keeping the hairs perfectly individualized.","Accordingly, disclosed herein is a composition for dyeing keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes, comprising at least one polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer, at least one pigment and at least one volatile solvent, wherein the weight ratio of the at least one supramolecular polymer to the at least one pigment is greater than 0.25, for example ranging from 0.3 to 20, or for example from 0.4 to 10, or for example from 0.5 to 5.","The compositions in accordance with the present disclosure may make it possible to obtain, on keratin fibers, colored coatings that make it possible to obtain a shampoo-fast visible coloration on all hair types, for example on dark hair, while at the same time preserving the physical qualities of the keratin fiber. Such a coating may be, for example, resistant to the external attacks to which the hair may be subjected, such as blow-drying and perspiration. It may make it possible, for example, to obtain a smooth, uniform deposit. Moreover, it has been observed, surprisingly, that the hairs may remain individualized, and may be styled without problems.","As used herein, the term \u201cindividualized hairs\u201d is intended to mean hairs which, after application of the composition and drying, are not stuck together (or are all separate from one another) and therefore do not form clumps of hair, since the coating is formed around virtually every hair.","Another aspect of the present disclosure is also a process for dyeing keratin fibers, for example human keratin fibers such as the hair or the eyelashes, using this composition.","One aspect of the present disclosure is also the use of this composition for obtaining a colored coating on the hair.","In the subsequent text, unless otherwise indicated, the limits of the ranges indicated are included in the ranges.","Polyalkene-based Supramolecular Polymers","As used herein, the term \u201cpolyalkene-based supramolecular polymer\u201d is intended to mean a polymer comprising, in its structure, at least one polyalkene part and at least one part comprising at least one group capable of forming at least three H-bonds, such as at least four H-bonds.","In at least one embodiment, the at least one polyalkene part is chosen from poly(ethylene-butylene)s, polybutadienes and polyisoprenes.","In at least one embodiment, the polyalkene-based supramolecular polymer(s) of the disclosure may be obtained by condensing at least one polyalkene polymer functionalized with at least one reactive group (a), with at least one graft functionalized with at least one reactive group (b), wherein the at least one reactive group (b) is capable of reacting with the at least one reactive group (a), and wherein the at least one graft comprises at least one group capable of forming at least three H-bonds, such as at least four H-bonds.","For example, the at least one functionalized polyalkene polymer can be chosen from those of formula:\n\nHX\u2014R\u2014X\u2032H\n","wherein XH and X\u2032H are reactive groups, with X and X\u2032, which are identical or different, chosen from O, S, NH or NR, Rrepresenting a C-Calkyl group. In at least one embodiment, X and\/or X\u2032 denote O;","R represents a homopolymer or a copolymer derived from at least one monounsaturated or polyunsaturated C-Calkene, such as C-C, alkenes; in one embodiment, R is chosen from poly(ethylene-butylene)s, polybutadienes and poly-isoprenes.","Poly(ethylene-butylene)s are copolymers of 1-butene and of ethylene, which can be represented schematically by the series of the following units:\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014] and [\u2014CHCH(CH\u2014CH)].\n","The polybutadienes may be 1,4-polybutadienes or 1,2-polybutadienes, which can be respectively represented schematically by the series of units below:\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014CH\u2014] (1,4-polybutadienes)\n\n[\u2014CH\u2014CH(CH\u2550CH)\u2014] (1,2-polybutadienes).\n","For example, the polybutadienes can be 1,2-polybutadienes.","For example, the functionalization may be carried out at the end of the chains. The term \u201ctelechelic polymers\u201d is then used. The functionalizing groups can be attached to the polyalkene polymer via linkers, such as linear or branched C-Calkylene groups.","The at least one poly(alkene) part may be hydrogenated so as to avoid the risks of crosslinking.","The at least one poly(alkene) part may comprise, in its structure, other units derived from other monomers. As comonomers, exemplary mention may be made of styrene.","For example, the polymeric backbone(s) may be chosen from hydroxyl-terminated polydienes, which in at least one embodiment are hydrogenated, and hydroxyl-terminated polyolefins.","These hydroxyl-terminated polydienes are defined, for example, in French Patent No. FR 2 782 723. In at least one embodiment, they are chosen from the group consisting of homopolymers and copolymers of polybutadiene, of polyisoprene and of poly(1,3-pentadiene). They are oligomers with a number-average molecular mass of less than 7,000, and in at least one embodiment ranging from 1,000 to 5,000. For example, they can have a terminal hydroxyl functionality ranging from 1.8 to 3, such as in the region of 2.","Exemplary mention may be made of the hydroxylated polybutadienes sold by the company Elf Atochem under the trademarks POLY BD R-45HT and POLY BD R-20 LM, which may be used hydrogenated. Exemplary mention may also be made of di-OH hydrogenated (1,2-polybutadiene)s, such as the GI3000 of Mn=2600-3200 and the GI2000 of Mn=1800-2200 sold by the company Nisso.","Use may also be made of \u03b1,\u03c9-hydroxyl-terminated polyolefins, homopolymers or copolymers, such as:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0037"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"8.04mm","wi":"41.83mm","file":"US07951207-20110531-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The supramolecular polymers of the present disclosure have, in their structure, at least one graft which carries at least one group capable of forming at least three H-bonds, such as at least four H-bonds.","These groups capable of forming at least three H-bonds may comprise, for example, at least three functional groups, such as at least four, chosen from the following formulae:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0040"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"50.46mm","wi":"60.11mm","file":"US07951207-20110531-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"These functional groups may be classified in two categories:\n\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0043"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"20.07mm","wi":"64.60mm","file":"US07951207-20110531-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0006","list-style":"none"},"li":"and H-bond-acceptor functional groups such as the groups:"}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0045"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"44.37mm","wi":"53.85mm","file":"US07951207-20110531-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"The groups capable of forming at least three H-bonds form a basic structural element comprising at least three functional groups, such as at least four functional groups, capable of establishing H-bonds.
