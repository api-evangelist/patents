{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 10\/259,276 filed Oct. 11, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,192,538, which is the national phase of PCT International Application No. PCT\/PCT\/JP2001\/01578 filed on Mar. 1, 2001, which designated the United States and on which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7120. This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 (a) to Patent Application Nos. 2000-111018; 2000-204539; 2000-204540 and 2000-204541, respectively, filed in Japan on Apr. 12, 2000; Jul. 6, 2000; Jul. 6, 2000 and Jul. 6, 2000, respectively. The entire contents of each of the above documents is hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention relates to an antistatic composition, and more particularly to an antistatic composition in which the bleeding-out is difficult to occur, and whose electric resistivity and formability are good. Further, the present invention relates to an antistatic composition which can be widely used in the field of melt-formable forming materials, and which is decomposable with microorganisms. The antistatic composition of the present invention is suitable for applications requiring high-degree antistatic treatment, including applications such as packaging and conveyance of electronic and electric parts.","The antistatic compositions have widely prevailed in the industrial world, and have been utilized in various applications. As the antistatic compositions, there are, for example, compositions in which resins and\/or elastomers are highly filled with conductive fillers such as carbon black. Such compositions have been widely utilized mainly in the industrial field.","Further, electrostatic prevention type antistatic compositions in which electrostatic prevention type antistatic resins having surfactants or hydrophilic segments in their structure are polymer alloyed have also widely prevailed, and have been widely applied to various applications.","In recent years, antistatic polymer materials have prevailed in packaging of IC chips, and these materials have also been diversified from general-purpose plastics to engineering plastics. Further, measures for electrostatic prevention of precision instruments and relating instruments thereto have become increasingly important. As for the conductive fillers, carbon fiber, graphite, metal-coated fillers, metal fiber and the like as well as carbon black have been widely properly used depending on their purpose and function.","However, the conductive fillers have the inherent problem that the mechanical characteristics of polymers are deteriorated, or that forming is difficult.","In particular, into so-called thermoplastic elastomers having flexibility, the addition of the conductive fillers causes the problem that the flexibility (rubber elasticity), a material characteristic, is impaired. In some cases, the elastomers become very brittle by aging, which causes an extreme reduction in elongation to result in easy breakage.","Polyester elastomers have excellent characteristics such as high strength, wear resistance, oil resistance, chemical resistance and the like, and can be said to be representative of the thermoplastic elastomers. Although the polyester elastomers have flexibility, they generally have high hardness compared to the other elastomers, and have been widely used for applications from automobiles and home electric appliances including industrial members to convenience goods. In particular, they have been used mainly in applications requiring high hardness. As the conductive fillers added to the polyesterelastomers, carbon black has been generally used. However, there is the inherent problem that carbon black added is unevenly distributed in specified phases, thereby deactivating the rubber elasticity to become brittle as materials, or that the conductivity fluctuates depending on the treatment conditions. Further, the addition of carbon black has raised the problems of deteriorated conductive performance due to a reduction in wear resistance and poor design caused by color limitation to black.","As a method for obtaining antistatic properties using no conductive filler, there is a method of adding a so-called low-molecular type hydrophilic surfactant. Further, a modifying method according to a glycol-based polymer material and an ion such as a mixture of an alkylene glycol copolymer resin and an ionic electrolyte is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 2-284967 and the like. However, the low-molecular type hydrophilic surfactant has problems with regard to persistency of the effect, heat resistance, bleeding-out, high resistivity and the like. Further, the mixture of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin and the ionic electrolyte has the problem that the bleeding-out easily occurs by concernment of temperature and moisture, because a terminal of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin has a hydroxyl group. Furthermore, the amount to be added is limited by the presence of a hard segment crystalline component of the polyester elastomer, so that there is the problem that the resistivity of the composition does not reach a sufficient level.","Further, thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers have excellent wear resistance and mechanical strength, and are widely applied. Conductive polyurethane elastomers containing conductive fillers also prevail. In recent years, with the spread of precision instruments, higher antistatic functions have been required, and the conventional antistatic level has become insufficient. The thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers compounded with the conductive fillers represented by carbon black are excellent in conductivity, but bring about a reduction in flexibility and processability. Besides, they have the problem of the dropout of the conductive materials due to a reduction in wear resistance and the problem of poor design caused by color limitation to black.","Further, as for antistatic compositions as materials for IC trays, which have hitherto been used for package of IC chips, weight saving, thinning and downsizing have come to be studied, and strength and high rigidity tend to be required. Furthermore, for the identification of the kind of IC and the like, it is also required that design such as coloring is given to trays and carrier tapes. Carbon black generally used in the conductive fillers is economical, and provides compositions having low resistivity. However, the color is limited to black, and generally, a problem arises with regard to processability, material strength and the like. Accordingly, carbon black has been usually used as composite materials compounded together with various modifying materials.","Antistatic agents include surface activity type ones giving the function by allowing them to bleed on surfaces, and ones allowing the function to be exhibited by polymer alloying hydrophilic polymer materials referred to as so-called polymerty peantist aticagents. In the polymer type antistatic agents, permanent antistatic performance is imparted to thermoplastic resins by polymer alloying with the hydrophilic polymers, and the industrial utility value thereof is high. However, it is required that the alloyed antistatic resins are added in relatively large amounts, and many antistatic resins are hydrophilic segments and have flexibility. Accordingly, the rigidity of the materials is lowered, and the deformation problem of formed articles arises. Although it has been tried to modify these resins by using them in combination with inorganic fillers, glass fiber or the like, flashing, weld marks, flash marks, shagginess and the like are developed on the surfaces of formed articles, resulting in insufficient surface smoothness. The hindrance to surface smoothness causes wide variations in surface resistivity value, or exerts effects on contact states of electronic and electric parts, thereby inhibiting the antistatic functions.","In these compositions, the surface resistivity value considered to be an antistatic level is usually up to 10to 10\u03a9\/sq.","In recent years, by an increase in performance and capacity of ICs, LSIs and the like, a characteristic of 10\u03a9\/sq. or less has come to be required as the electric characteristics required for the package application such as trays, and the so-called conventional antistatic region level has become insufficient. Ones constituted by carbon black has been overwhelmingly used. As for these, characteristics generally required are also strength and elastic modulus in bending, and inorganic fillers are generally added in relatively large amounts in order to meet the requirements (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Sho) 59-96142). However, mica, talc and the like widely used as the inorganic fillers are added in relatively large amounts, so that materials constituted by the conductive fillers have the problem that variations in conductivity become wide, as well as the problem that deterioration of processability and impact-resistant strength and the like are promoted.","On the other hand, in order to prevent deterioration of these strength characteristics, chopped fibers such as glass fiber, carbon fiber and the like are used in combination in some cases. Although these chopped fibers are effective for imparting rigidity and strength, the surface smoothness of formed articles such as flashing, weld marks, flash marks, shagginess and the like is not satisfied. Further, with deterioration of the surface state of the formed articles, the contact with instruments becomes insufficient, which hinders leakage of charges.","In recent years, it has become important to impart antistatic properties to rubber, and in order to achieve this, there is known a method of coating a surface of a formed article with an antistatic agent such as a surfactant, or a method of kneading an antistatic agent therein. However, in the former method, the antistatic properties are significantly deteriorated with the elapse of a long period of time, so that it is difficult to put to practical use as highly antistatic rubber having persistency. On the other hand, in the later method, there is the problem that the antistatic agent bleeds out on the surface of the formed article, or the problem that the antistatic effect is reduced, because of poor compatibility of the antistatic agent with the rubber.","Further, a method of kneading carbon black, carbon fiber or the like in rubber has also been proposed. According to this method, the above-mentioned problem can be solved, because of persistency of the antistatic properties and electrostatic prevention. However, the problem that the rubber hardness becomes high to impair flexibility is encountered, in addition to the new problem that coloration can not be freely conducted.","Here, as a problem for solving dispersibility and compatibility of these problems of the antistatic rubber composition, there is proposed a method of compounding an antistatic plasticizer and rubber. This is a method in which the antistatic properties are given to the plasticizer for chlorine-containing resin, which is a component indispensable to various kinds of processes. For example, a vinyl chloride composition containing an antistatic plasticizer comprising lithium perchlorate is illustrated, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Sho) 64-9258 and Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 2-255852.","However, the addition of a perchlorate such as lithium perchlorate arises the problem that the heat stability of a vinyl chloride-based resin is impaired. Further, the addition thereof to chlorine-containing rubber such as chloroprene rubber arises the problem that the heat stability is impaired.","Further, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 9-227743 proposes a method of adding a plasticizer and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide to a vinyl chloride-based resin, thereby providing a transparent conductive composition. This composition is a transparent conductive composition, so that it can be easily colored. However, this composition has the problem that it turns burned umber on heating at 120\u00b0 C. for 90 minutes to lose the transparency and the conductivity, because of its poor heat resistance. Further, this composition has the problem that the plasticizer bleeds out.","The synthetic resins synthesized from petroleum starting materials are represented by polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyesters, polyamides and the like, and have been widely used from essential commodities of life to industrial products. The convenience and economical efficiency of these synthetic resins come to largely support our life, and the synthetic resins have surely become the basis of the petrochemical industry.","Therefore, the amount of production of the synthetic resins domestically produced amounts to about 15,000,000 tons per year, and they are discarded in prodigious quantities amounting to about one third thereof. Accordingly, waste disposal by burning and reclamation had already reached the critical limit. In recent years, movements such as resource recovery, recycling and the like have been intensified, and the synthetic resins are newly added in the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law enforced from 2000. It is therefore predicted that strong and effective recovery and reusing of the synthetic resins are required. However, in view of the synthetic resins produced in prodigious quantities every year, situations where recycling is difficult, such as the use in applications where recovery is difficult, are left.","Further, synthetic resin products scattered in the natural environment has become significant from year to year, which cause serious social problems such as an increase in necessity of wildlife protection and destruction of living environments.","Such problems over the environment have attracted more attention from year to year, and the central government including the Ministry for the Environment and respective local governments have been driven by the necessity for seriously taking measures to meet the situation.","In the synthetic resin market, movements to demands for decomposability of the resins in the natural environment have been intensified, and biodegradable resins have been developed which are decomposed and made to resource in the course of time even when thrown away outdoors. On the other hand, from measures against toxic gases generated in burning the synthetic resins, synthetic materials nearer to natural materials have been desired, and also as part of the burning measures, demands for the biodegradable resins have risen.","The biodegradable resins are resins degradable with microorganisms in the soil, seawater, rivers and lakes, and expansion to applications in which recycling of synthetic resin wastes is inefficient and economically poor has been rapidly spread. Also as for measures against scattered trash, the value of the biodegradable resins has been increasingly recognized, and it is expected that the utilization thereof is hereafter further widened.","At present, construction of commercial composts proceeds in various locations. On the other hand, the sale of composts for domestic use toward individual consumers also starts. Thus, expansion of the biodegradable resins has been expected in various locations. Also in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the practical application investigative committee has started, and movements toward the promotion of the biodegradable resins have been intensified. Further, viewing worldwide, a massive market is predicted to appear in which a considerable part of demands for the synthetic resins on the scale of an annual production of 100,000,000 tons is occupied by the biodegradable resins. In the 21st century, serious expansion of the biodegradable resin market is surely predicted.","As biodegradable materials and environmentally low load type materials which are in practical use at present, there are known aliphatic polyesters, modified starch, polylactic acid, various composite materials in which these resins are used as matrixes, polymer alloys and the like. Of these, the aliphatic polyester resins have high biodegradability, and has been widely studied as packaging materials.","On the other hand, packaging materials subjected to so-called antistatic treatment are required for packaging electronic and electric materials. In recent years, however, materials more excellent in antistatic ability have been required in order to increase the capacity of semiconductors and to prevent electrostatic destruction of precision instruments.","Measures to electrostatic charges have hitherto been conducted by compelxing according to the addition of surfactants or persistent polymer type surfactants. However, many of the packaging materials made of synthetic resins, which have been subjected to so-called antistatic treatment, become discarded wastes after the packaging and conveying functions have been performed. Although the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law has prevailed and recycle systems have been enforced in recent years, many of the packaging materials are still difficult to be recovered, and disposed by way of such as burning and reclamation. In such a situation, ecologically concerned materials have come to be necessary also for packaging materials requiring high antistatic functions, and measures have been studied by various techniques.","Many of the biodegradable resins are hydrophilic ones, which include, for example, cellulose acetate, poly-caprolactone, polyvinyl alcohol and the like, and functionally have antistatic characteristics. However, the antistatic properties depend on the environmental humidity, so that the variation in antistatic performance becomes wide. Further, there is also proposed a method of adding conductive fillers such as carbon black and the like, thereby imparting and stabilizing antistatic performance. However, the use of the conductive fillers limits color tones to black, so that there is the problem that the use as packaging materials make it difficult to identify internal products, or that forming processing is difficult to allow the resistivity to fluctuate according to the forming situation.","Further, there is also reported the case that the addition of carbon black to a biodegradable resin generally reduces the biodegradable function.","Cases of static prevention using the biodegradable materials are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 9-263690, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 11-039945 and the like. However, in such static prevention, there are problems that it is necessary to mix the conductive fillers in relatively large amounts, so that the material themselves are apt to become hard and brittle, that the color tones of the products are limited to black, so that identification of the inside is impossible when the products are used as packaging materials, and that the antistatic properties are lost according to forming conditions, particularly, physical functions in stretching processing.","Further, when the surfactants are added to the biodegradable resin materials, thereby imparting the antistatic properties, problems are encountered with regard to persistency of the effect, wide variations in time showing the effect, durability such as environmental humidity dependency and the environment used.","In the meantime, polyamide resins are excellent in wear resistance, chemical resistance and heat resistance, and have been widely used. However, the developments of polyamide compositions high in electric insulation and excellent in conductivity have been expected.","Further, polyamide elastomers have excellent wear resistance and mechanical strength, and are widely applied. Conductive polyamide elastomers containing conductive fillers also widely prevail. In recent years, with the spread of precision instruments, higher antistatic functions have been required, and the conventional antistatic level has become insufficient. The thermoplastic polyamide resins and the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers compounded with the conductive fillers represented by carbon black are excellent in conductivity, but bring about a reduction in flexibility and processability. Besides, they have the problem of the dropout of the conductive materials due to a reduction in wear resistance and the problem of poor design caused by color limitation to black.","On the other hand, one in which the so-called hydrophilic surfactant is used as a conductive material, the mixture of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin family and the ionic electrolyte (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication (Hei) 2-284967) and the like are proposed. However, the bleeding-out easily occurs according to the temperature and moisture, because the terminal of the copolymer has a hydroxyl group, and problems arise with regard to surface stains and persistency of the effect.","The present invention has been made against the background of such conventional technical problems, and an object thereof is to obtain an antistatic composition in which the bleeding-out of an electric conductive substance is little, and whose antistatic property and formability are good.","First, the present invention relates to an antistatic composition (hereinafter

The above-mentioned elastomer is preferably one having a soft segment and a hard segment. The soft segment achieves the effect that an elastomer molecular chain moves easily resulting in the lower glass transition temperature (Tg) of the elastomer.

Further, the polyester\/polyether type can also be synthesized by the ester exchange reaction and the ring opening reaction, using dimethyl terephthalate, 1,4-butanediol, \u03b5-caprolactone and the like as starting materials.","The polyurethane elastomer used as component (J) of the present invention is an urethane group-containing thermoplastic elastomer, and a straight chain multi-block copolymer of a polyurethane as a soft segment which is obtained by the reaction of a long-chain glycol with an isocyanate and a polyurethane as a hard segment which is composed of a short-chain glycol and an isocyanate. A crosslinking agent (chain extender) is also used as needed.","Here, according to the general classification of the long-chain glycols based on the kind, polyether-based glycols include polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide and a copolymer thereof, polyester-based glycols include a polyadipate, a polylactone and a polycarbonate, and aliphatic glycols include polybutadiene, polyisoprene and the like.","Further, as the short-chain glycol, there is generally used an aliphatic glycol such as ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol or 1,6-hexanediol, an alicyclic glycol such as cyclohexanedimethanol, and an aromatic glycol such as hydroquinonebis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether.","On the other hand, as the above-mentioned isocyanate, there is used 4,4\u2032-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), 2,4\u2032 & 2,6-toluene diisocyanate (TDI) or the like.","Further, as the above-mentioned crosslinking agent (chain extender), there is used an aromatic diamine such as 3,3-dichloro-4,4-diaminophenylmethane (MBOCA).","In addition, an aliphatic polyester resin having a low glass transition temperature and the like are available as component (J).","Among the polyester elastomers, the polyetheresteramide is particularly preferred as component (J).

Also for these, it is possible to produce the pelletized starting material by selecting them according to the form and purpose of the composition and productivity, followed by melt kneading.","Further, the composition of the present invention can also be used as a powder type obtained by dry blending of the compounding materials it is also possible to produce a starting material of a powder type mixture by dry blending, using the preliminary mixer used in the processing of the above-mentioned pelletized compound.","Furthermore, the composition of the present invention may be one obtained by using a pelletized compound as a master batch, which is obtained by melt kneading parts of the above-mentioned various polymers, components (B) and (J) as essential element, component (A) and (L) may be added and another constituent component such as component (C) and (K) as needed, and mixing it with the remaining polymer components. For example, in preparing the first composition, a master batch in which component (B) is previously added to component (J) mixed with component remainder (J) or (L), further other component such as component (C) and\/or (K) are able to added as needed.","Using the composition of the present invention, all forming methods can be applied. That is to say, in forming articles, the composition is melted with each forming machine, and forming processing by various forming machines such as extrusion forming including contour extrusion, injection forming, blow forming, calender forming, vacuum forming and emboss forming is possible. As the typical forming machines for injection forming, extrusion forming and the like, ones having ordinary specifications generally used can be employed.","In the antistatic composition of the present invention, the form of the composition is generally pelletized. However, on the ground that component (C) is usually a liquid, a method of directly adding it to the melt kneader without passing it through the preliminary mixer may be used.","For example, in the case of injection forming, it is possible to use an ordinary injection forming machine. In general, the use of the pelletized compound provides a good finish of a formed article, and a stable physical performance.","When aliphatic polyesters is used as component (A), it is necessary to pay attention to moisture absorption of the starting materials in all forming processing procedures, and preliminary drying and measures against the moisture absorption during forming are important. Insufficient drying causes foaming of a melt composition resulting in the deterioration of the appearance and mechanical characteristics of a formed article. Further, there is also a fear of the deteriorated appearance of a formed article due to a fall inviscosity byhydrolysis. When the film-like formed article is manufactured from antistatic composition of present invention, 0.3 percent by weight or less of the content of water is preferable.","It is desirable to conduct preliminary drying by either method of a hot air type and a vacuum type before forming, and to prevent moisture absorption with a hopper dryer or the like during forming.","The antistatic compositions of the present invention can be suitably used for the antistatic measures of the above-mentioned machine parts, automotive parts, sports goods, office automation equipment, the home electric appliance field, the electric and electronic fields, other various parts, packages, tubes, coverings and the like, making use of their excellent characteristics.","The present invention is illustrated with reference to examples and comparative examples below, but the present invention is not limited by these examples.","Parts and percentages in examples are on a weight basis unless otherwise noted.","First Composition (Components (J)+(B))","Various types of components used in examples and comparative examples were as follows:","Component (J);","(J-1) :Thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer (PANDEX T-1190 (Tg: \u221240 to \u221245\u00b0 C.) manufactured by DAINIPPON INK & CHEMICALS INC.,)","(B) Metal salt;","Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide Li.N(CFSO)","Preparation of Test Pieces","Sample pellets were molded into each test piece with an injection molding machine of a mold clamping pressure of 80 tons\/cm. The molding conditions were as follows. Cylinder temperature: 220\u00b0 C. Mold temperature: 30\u00b0 C.","As for measurements of physical properties, measurements of the following physical properties were made, after the test piece was controlled at room temperature (23\u00b12\u00b0 C.) and a relative humidity of 50% for 24 hours.","The Tensile Strength and Elongation","The tensile strength and elongation were measured in accordance with JIS K7311.","Volume Resistivity Value(Antistatic Property)","Measurements were made in accordance with SRIS 2301 in the following manner.","Using an injection molded test sample with 6 (width)\u00d76 (length)\u00d70.3 (thickness) (cm), both ends of the plate were coated as electrodes with a conductive coating to a width of 1 cm. Then, the volume resistivity value between both the electrodes was determined. The unit in the following tables is \u03a9\u00b7cm.","Evaluation of Bleeding-Out","A sample plate with 6 (width)\u00d76 (length)\u00d70.3 (thickness) (cm) was prepared by using a filmgate, and allowed to stand at a temperature of 40\u00b0 C. and a humidity of 90% for 7 days. The state during that period was visually observed, and evaluated based on the following criteria:","\u229a: The case that no bleeding was observed.","\u25ef: The case that the bleeding was slightly observed, but it was on a level of no problem for use.","\u0394: The case that the bleeding was a little observed, and there was a bit of a problem for use.","X: The case that the bleeding was considerably observed to be nonusable.","Antistatic polyurethane elastomers were prepared based on compounding formulations described in the following tables 1 and 2, and evaluated.","Here, directly formable composition obtained by dry blending was prepared by supermixer.","As for a method for preparing kneaded pelletized compositions, the antistatic polyurethane elastomer compositions were each melt mixed with a 47 mm twin-screw extruder of which screws rotates in the same direction at 190\u00b0 C. Each strand-like melt mixture extruded from a die was cooled in a water bath, and passed through a cutter to prepare pellets of the antistatic polyurethane elastomer composition.
