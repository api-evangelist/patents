No. 13\/164,135, filed Jun. 20, 2011, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Routing Customer Support Softphone Call,\u201d invented by Oliver Ilagan, and assigned to the assignee hereof.","This disclosure generally relates to information handling systems, and more particularly relates to a system and a method for providing customer support using an information handling system.","As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and\/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems. Information handling systems and associated software applications play a central role in nearly every aspect of commerce, from research and development to sales and marketing.","The use of the same reference symbols in different drawings indicates similar or identical items.","The following description in combination with the Figures is provided to assist in understanding the teachings disclosed herein. The following discussion will focus on specific implementations and embodiments of the teachings. This focus is provided to assist in describing the teachings and should not be interpreted as a limitation on the scope or applicability of the teachings. However, other teachings can certainly be utilized in this application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","110","120","110","111","120","111","120","121","110","130","121","120","121","110","120"]},"Systems and methods disclosed herein can improve the quality of customer service and thereby improve the customer's experience when interacting with a business. In an embodiment, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology combined with a client based softphone application allows a customer to speak with a customer support representative using their personal computer or another type of device. In particular, a customer's call can be routed to a preferred customer support representative queue based fully or in part on information derived automatically by a voice communication routing system. In an embodiment, the interest or intent of a customer may be automatically derived based on a particular website page to which the customer has navigated. In another embodiment, customer or product information can be obtained from the customer's computer system and an appropriate customer service representative queue can be selected based on this information. In still another embodiment, a customer who is browsing a web page may be conditionally presented with a graphical \u201cCall Now\u201d button based on information acquired by the voice communication routing system . For example, display of a Call Now button can be suppressed until sufficient information about the customer's intent has been determined. In response to pressing the Call Now button, the softphone application can be launched at the customer's information handling system to allow the customer to speak directly with a support representative automatically selected by the voice communication routing system . While the systems and techniques disclosed herein are ideally suited for supporting interactions between an organization and its current or prospective customers, they can be applied equally well to any organization or individual wishing to provide access to a live support staff. For simplicity, these techniques are described in the context of a technology product supply company providing call center customer support services.","The voice communication routing system  disclosed herein is configured to route calls from individuals to specific support representative queues or support personnel based on a variety of routing criteria. The number and scope of the specific criteria can be selected based on the type of organization offering the customer support, the type of product or service being supported, the type of customer, and the like. For example, the routing system  can determine that a customer possesses a service agreement, a warranty, and the like, and route the call accordingly. In another embodiment, a call can be routed to a service queue having escalated priority based on information determined by the routing system . For example, queues providing specialized or premium support capabilities can be selected based on a customer's sales volume, account balance, contractual obligations, and the like. Routing criteria can be represented by one or more routing variables. In an embodiment, routing variables include a variable name and one or more values that can be exclusively associated with the variable. For example, a variable name may be \u201ccustomer-type,\u201d and the customer-type variable name can be associated with values including \u201cbusiness,\u201d \u201cconsumer,\u201d \u201cgovernment,\u201d and the like. In addition, each variable may include a default value, and may further include an \u201cunset\u201d value. In an embodiment, a variable name and a corresponding value can be stored in the form of a name-value pair. For example, the name-value pair \u201ccustomer-type=consumer\u201d indicates that the variable \u201ccustomer-type\u201d is associated with the value \u201cconsumer.\u201d In an embodiment, the voice communication routing system can route softphone calls to a preferred support representative queue based on one or more name-value pairs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["210","111","110","111","215","210","210","220","230","240","121"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["310","320","320","220","320","330","340","320","320","321","322","323","330","321"]},"In an embodiment the softphone  can be displayed within a new browser window for URL , as shown in . In another embodiment, the softphone  can be an applet displayed at a dedicated window autonomous from the browser, such as a pop-up window. In still another embodiment, the softphone  can be displayed at the originally displayed web page . Furthermore, additional or intermediate pages can be displayed prior to establishing a call. For example, one or more pages can be displayed for the purpose of installing and configuring software, acquiring additional information from the customer, validating collected customer information, and the like.","Prior to initiating the call to customer service, the voice communication routing system  can determine whether the user's computer is properly configured to support the softphone application. For example, the routing system can determine whether the user's computer includes a prerequisite microphone and headphone\/speaker equipment. In addition, the routing system can determine if the other software needed to implement the softphone application is installed and properly configured. For example, the softphone application may utilize Flash\u2122 or Java\u2122 software, which may need to be downloaded, installed, and configured at the user's computer. In an embodiment, information handling system can include integrated or pre-installed software, such as HTML5 or another device specific software application that is configurable to support a smartphone application. Configuration of the softphone application may include adjusting the volume of sound provided to the user's headphones, adjusting gain (amplification) applied to signals received at the user's microphone, and the like. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the softphone application  can be implemented using another application program or protocol that supports voice communication. For example, an information handling system can support one or more standard or proprietary device specific software applications, including operating systems, application programming interfaces, and the like. Furthermore, the web page  and the web page  can represent another type of display interface capable of displaying a Call Now button and executing a softphone application. For example, a television device can display a Call Now button and provide a softphone application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"],"b":["121","400","401","121"]},"An organization may chose to organize support representative personnel based on their particular expertise. A customer's call can be routed to an appropriate service representative queue based on information collected by the routing system . In other words, the routing system  can classify a caller based on one or more parameters. For example, row  at table  includes a variable name \u201cCaller Type,\u201d which may be associated with one of a set of values including \u201cBusiness,\u201d \u201cConsumer,\u201d or \u201cUnset.\u201d The routing system  can determine a value to be associated with the Caller Type variable based on the particular web page to which a user has navigated, based on a menu item selected by a user, in response to a prompt displayed at a web page, based on a Unique Identifier, or by another method. If the user type has not yet been determined, a value of Unset may be assigned to the Caller Type variable name. In an embodiment, each variable name can be associated with a default value that can be used to route a call. For example, if the Caller Type has not been determined (value is Unset), the routing system  can be configured to categorize the user as a consumer based on a default value assigned to the variable Caller Type, and route the call accordingly.","Another criterion that an organization may find useful for routing customer support calls is a type of product. Row  includes a routing variable \u201cProduct,\u201d which can be assigned a value of \u201cDesktop PC,\u201d \u201cNotebook PC,\u201d \u201cTelevision,\u201d or \u201cUnset.\u201d The Product routing variable can be automatically assigned a value based on the web page currently displayed by the user's web browser, based on the user's navigation history, based on a browser cookie, based on other information, or a value can be determined based on a response by the user to a prompt. A softphone call can be routed to an appropriate representative queue based on the value associated with the Product variable. As described above, the Product variable name can be assigned a value of Unset to indicate that the intent of the user has not yet been determined, in which case a call can be routed based on a default value. For example, a call may be routed to a service representative responsible for Desktop PC devices if the value of the Product routing variable is Unset.","Row  at table  includes a routing variable \u201cIssue Category,\u201d which can be assigned a value of \u201cSales,\u201d \u201cLease,\u201d \u201cOrder Status,\u201d or \u201cUnset.\u201d Row  includes a routing variable \u201cRegion,\u201d which can be assigned a value of \u201cNorth America,\u201d \u201cCanada,\u201d \u201cEuropean Union,\u201d or \u201cUnset.\u201d The number of routing variables and the number of corresponding values that are supported by a particular routing system can vary based on the size of the organization, the degree of specialization required of a service representative, or based on other factors. The routing variables and values included at the table  are merely examples of criteria that can be evaluated to advantageously route a softphone call to an optimal service representative queue. For example, a routing variable \u201cAgent Extension\u201d can be assigned a value indicating a telephone number of a specific service representative, such as a representative that has had previous interaction with a customer, and a call can be routed with the Agent Extension variable heavily or exclusively weighted. The likelihood that a support representative can promptly address a customer's needs may be increased if the customer's intent can be determined with greater precision. Furthermore, a customer's satisfaction with the service may be improved if the call can be routed to an appropriate service representative queue with minimal delay and with minimal prompting for additional customer information. Accordingly, the voice communication routing system  attempts to automatically determine information about a user's intent without directly querying the user for that information.","The routing system  may determine other information about a user that is not specifically used to route a call to an appropriate service representative queue, but can nonetheless be used by a support representative to better serve a customer. This information can be maintained as variable names having corresponding values. For example, a variable \u201cCustomer Name\u201d can be assigned a value that is the name of the customer, and this information can be forwarded to the customer support representative when a call is initiated. Additional supplemental information can include a telephone number associated with the customer placing the softphone call, prior service records associated with the customer, account information, diagnostic information obtained from the customer's device or from business records, and the like. In an embodiment, a Unique Identifier associated with a caller can be used to retrieve information about the caller or a specific device, and the information can be forwarded to a service representative.","In an embodiment, some or all of the routing variables and additional information can be forwarded to the customer support representative as a string of name-value pairs. For example, the routing system  can assemble an information string:","Unique Identifier=12345& Caller Type=Business&Product=Unset","The information string can be provided to a selected service representative and the information can be formatted and displayed for convenient reference by the representative. The information string can include some or all of the routing variables and some or all of the information variables that are maintained by the routing system . In an embodiment, the name-value information string can be transmitted from one server, such as the web server  of , to another server that is responsible for facilitating routing of calls by appending the information string to a URL using HTTP POST protocol. In another embodiment, some or all of the routing information and additional information can be stored at a database for later retrieval.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["500","501","502","503","504","121"]},"The flow proceeds to block  where voice communication application software is installed and configured at the user's computer if such an application is not already present. In addition, the website software can be configured to verify that the user's computer is equipped with a microphone and speakers or headphones, and to assist the user with calibrating their sound parameters such as speaker volume and microphone gain. For example, a website software application can request that the user speak into their microphone and to adjust a speaker volume using a slider displayed at the webpage. Once the softphone application is properly configured, the user can click on a Call button, which initiates a softphone connection between the user and the support representative that has been determined by the routing system based on the previously acquired information. The flow proceeds to block  where the user can speak with a live customer support representative. The method  illustrates only one example scenario in which a user may establish a softphone connection with a customer support representative, wherein a representative queue has been specifically selected based on information automatically acquired by the call routing system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["121","600","500","121","600","601"]},"The flow proceeds to block  where a Call Now Button can be displayed on the web page that is presently being viewed by the user. In an embodiment, display of the Call Now button can be conditional based on one or more factors. For example, softphone based customer support can be restricted to a specific class of user, such as a customer possessing a product support contract. For another example, a web server can be configured to display a Call Now button only after determining that a call center queue or wait time is sufficiently short. Another criterion for determining whether to display a Call Now button can be a network bandwidth presently available between the customer and equipment administering the call center. For example, a minimum data rate of 64 Kbs may be required to provide acceptable sound quality of a softphone voice communication system. For still another example, an organization may chose to provide softphone based customer support based on strategic business interests, call center backlog, and the like.","In the event that the customer's computer is not equipped with a microphone, or the computer is otherwise not configured to support a voice communication application, a telephone number can be displayed at the customer's computer and the customer can place a conventional telephone call for assistance. In an embodiment, a unique customer identification code can be displayed at the customers browser display. The customer identification code can be associated with customer information that has been previously acquired by the call routing system. In the event that a customer must utilize a conventional telephone call to speak with a representative, the customer can recite the identification code to a support representative, who can use the number to immediately receive the stored customer information. Thus, the support representative need not take time to collect information about the caller during the telephone conversation.","The method  continues at block  where the web server determines that a user has clicked the Call Now button, in which case the flow proceeds to block  where the server displays a web page to facilitate installing and\/or configuring a softphone application program to operate at the customer's computer, as described above. The flow proceeds to block  where a softphone application user interface is displayed, such as the user interface shown at . The flow proceeds to block  where the call routing system  can optionally solicit additional information from the customer. For example, if further information is needed to identify an appropriate service representative queue, the customer can be presented with an automated IVR system wherein the customer responds to vocal queries by clicking corresponding numerical buttons at a keypad displayed by their web browser. In addition, the web server can optionally retrieve system information from the customer's computer. For example, the call routing system  can retrieve a Unique Identifier that is stored at the customer's computer and use the code to fetch product or customer information from an information database maintained at the organization. Once the call routing system  has collected enough information to properly route the customer's call, the flow proceeds to block  where a Call Now button is displayed at the customer's browser. The flow proceeds to block  where the call routing system selects a preferred customer support representative queue based on the previously acquired information. In addition, the server can forward some or all of the acquired customer information to a representative at the selected queue. The flow proceeds to block  where a communication channel is established between the customer and the representative using the softphone application program. After completing the call, a follow-up email can be sent to the customer to provide a record of the call and specifics like a session identification or ticket number, to identify the agent or account manager that handled the call, or to inquire whether the customer is satisfied with the service. Moreover, the email can be provided with a Call Now button having a customized URL or other path such that the recipient may reestablish voice contact with the same agent.","A situation may arise where the customer is unable to utilize a softphone application or simply prefers to speak with a service representative using a conventional telephone. For example, the customer's computer may not be equipped with a microphone or headset, or the customer may be intimidated by or otherwise uncomfortable with the softphone application. In such a situation, the customer can be offered an option to receive a conventional telephone call initiated by the telecom infrastructure and matched to the proper queue or agent. As described above, the voice communication routing system  can automatically identify the customer's specific intent and identify an appropriate representative. In an embodiment, the routing system  can prompt the customer for a telephone number and forward the telephone number to the selected representative along with other acquired customer information that the representative can use to efficiently satisfy the customer's needs. In another embodiment, a call-back using a conventional telephone may be preferred in the event that all appropriate representatives are presently busy and an anticipated wait time exceeds a predetermined interval. In still another embodiment, a customer can specify a desired time or date to receive a call from the system. In yet another embodiment, a Call Me button can be displayed at a web page adjacent to, or in place of, a Call Now button.","Because the customer support call is facilitated by a web browser or a similar device specific software application, interaction between a customer and a support representative can include more than voice communication using a softphone application. For example, a support representative can initiate display of information at the customer's computer, such as tutorial videos, options for downloading software or product documentation, pop-up display windows, and the like. Documents and other information can be transferred from the representative to the customer or from the customer to the representative using push\/pull software applications available to the web browser. Alternative communication channels can be provided while a customer is connected with a service representative, such as text chat, email, and the like. For example, a caller can be provided with a telephone number and extension corresponding to the specific service representative to whom the caller is speaking. In addition, targeted advertisements can be displayed at the customer's computer. During the time that a customer is connected with a support representative via the softphone application, various browser controls and hyperlinks may be disabled so that the customer cannot accidentally navigate away from the softphone application until the call is completed.","Much of the equipment and software infrastructure associated with a conventional call center can be leveraged to implement the call system disclosed herein. For example, an existing data center including packet session boarder controllers (SBCs), session initiation protocol (SIP) trunk services, automated call distributor (ACD) systems, voice portal systems, load balancers, and the like can be utilized without significant modification. For example, the addition of Flash Media Gateway (FMG) servers or similar devices can provide a bridge between existing web servers and the call data center.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["700","700","701","121"]},"In an embodiment, the value of a Unique Identifier can be automatically retrieved from a customer's computer system by the routing system  using remote system management techniques. For example, the Windows operating system supports Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), Windows Remote Assistance, ActiveX protocols, and other communication protocols for retrieving information from a user's computer. In another embodiment, an information handling device supporting a Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) may provide mechanisms whereby platform firmware can be directly accessed by an interface provided by the operating system associated with the customer's computer. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that much of the information stored at the organization's database may be retrieved directly from the customer's computer. Furthermore, an organization may connect with a customer's computer to update and verify information maintained at the organization's database.","Having determined the customer's Unique Identifier, the flow proceeds to block  where an appropriate customer service representative queue can be selected based on the retrieved code. For example, the Unique Identifier may be a service code can be used to differentiate between a private consumer and a corporate account and route the softphone call accordingly. For another example, service representatives may be classified based on their experience or training with particular products, and a support representative best qualified to efficiently provide support to the customer can be selected based on the service code. Once a preferred representative queue has been selected, the flow proceeds to block  where voice communication can be established between the customer and a representative associated with the selected queue using a softphone application running at the customer's web browser.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","800","801","802","121","803","804","805"]},"In this particular example, the navigation history of the customer is used to indicate the degree of interest that the customer may possess, or perhaps a frustration level, having failed to reach a web page to satisfy their needs. Furthermore, a Call Now button can be conditionally displayed based on other criteria. For example, display of a Call Now button may be suppressed if the routing system  determines that a call center queue exceeds a predetermined length, so as not to frustrate the customer with an excessive call hold time. For another example, a Call Now button can be displayed only after determining that a customer viewing the web page possesses a premium service contract. An organization may conditionally display a Call Now button based on strategic business interests, for example a promotion or sale of a particular product. For still another example, the call routing system  can determine whether the customer's computer hardware, software, or communications network can support a softphone application. For example, the routing system  can determine whether the customer's network connection can support a transmission rate deemed necessary to provide acceptable sound quality. In an embodiment, the routing system  can determine whether the customer's computer is equipped with a camera and display a Call Now button accordingly.","As described above, the routing system  can automatically acquire significant amounts of information concerning the customer and their intentions. Additional information useful for determining the customer's intent can be acquired using directed questions or prompts presented to the customer. The routing system  can provide these prompts to the customer using text messages, synthesized voice messages, prerecorded voice messages, a menu system, and the like. Similarly, the routing system  can include voice recognition capabilities to interpret customer responses to the prompts. This acquired information can be evaluated and used by the routing system to determine whether a Call Now button should be displayed at the web page presently displayed by the customer. For example, the Call Now button can be withheld until the routing system  has accumulated a prerequisite amount of information about the customer. In an embodiment, having provided a Call Now button, and in response to activation of the Call Now button by a customer, some or all of the acquired information can be used to route a customer's call to an appropriate support representative queue. In another embodiment, some or all of the acquired information can be forwarded to a selected representative.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 4"],"b":["900","900","901","902","121"],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["Caller Type=Consumer","Product=Desktop","Product category=High Performance","Issue Category=Sales"]}}}},"In an embodiment, the routing system  can differentiate between a variable value that has been explicitly determined and a variable value that has been deduced based on anecdotal means. For example, a name-value pair can include syntax cues that distinguish between information provided directly by a customer or obtained by means of a Unique Identifier and interpreted or default values.","The flow proceeds to block  where a Call Now button is displayed at the webpage currently displayed by the customer. At block  voice communication can be established between the customer and a preferred customer support representative, the representative associated with a support queue selected based on the value of one or more routing variables. By automatically determining some or all of a customer's intentions or needs, a service representative can be selected to receive the softphone call that is best qualified to address those needs.

The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d shall also include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding, or carrying a set of instructions for execution by a processor or that cause a computer system to perform any one or more of the methods or operations disclosed herein.","In a particular non-limiting, exemplary embodiment, the computer-readable medium can include a solid-state memory such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more non-volatile read-only memories. Further, the computer-readable medium can be a random access memory or other volatile re-writable memory. Additionally, the computer-readable medium can include a magneto-optical or optical medium, such as a disk or tapes or other storage device to store information received via carrier wave signals such as a signal communicated over a transmission medium. Furthermore, a computer readable medium can store information received from distributed network resources such as from a cloud-based environment. A digital file attachment to an e-mail or other self-contained information archive or set of archives may be considered a distribution medium that is equivalent to a tangible storage medium. Accordingly, the disclosure is considered to include any one or more of a computer-readable medium or a distribution medium and other equivalents and successor media, in which data or instructions may be stored.","Information handling systems provide fundamental services in nearly every aspect of business. For example, information handling systems can be used by businesses to automate manufacturing processes, implement product design tools, support marketing and sales, and the like. Information handling systems, such as personal computers, mobile communication devices, and the like, are equally prevalent in our personal lives. It is only natural that an increasing amount of commerce is being conducted via information handling systems. Today, an internet web site may provide the primary interface between a business and their customers. While a great deal of business activity can be automated, there will always remain the need for customers to speak directly with a personal representative of an organization. Electronic mail correspondence may be sufficient in many cases, but the highest quality of customer service is typically provided by direct communication with a representative via a telephone. However, the cost and logistics of maintaining human support personnel at a large business or corporation can be considerable. As a result, businesses have adopted one or more practices to address this problem. One solution is to out-source customer support responsibility to a customer service call-center, which is often located overseas to reduce manpower costs. Another common solution is to transfer customer calls to a recording system or to another form of automated reception service.","The systems and methods disclosed herein provide significant benefits when compared to conventional techniques. For example, in existing enterprises, customer calls are typically routed to an appropriate customer support representative only after soliciting information from the customer to determine the nature of the customer's intention. For example, customer calls may be answered by a pre-recorded message system configured to prompt the customer to select specific options from a menu. An IVR system may allow a user to select from a predetermined set of options by speaking words, simple phrases, or numbers, or by pressing keypad numbers on their telephone that correspond to desired options. The customer's call can then be routed to a human operator or to a voice mail box based on the customer's responses to the options provided by the automated system. Unfortunately, this process can be both tedious and ultimately unsatisfactory to the customer. For example, in a typical business a customer may be expected to provide responses to approximately seven individual questions before the IVR system can adequately determine the customer's intent and subsequently route the customer's call to a representative best able to provide satisfactory support.","There are considerable benefits of the disclosed system over current practices. The traditional IVR selection procedure can be eliminated or the number of questions required to fully determine the customer's intent can be significantly reduced because this information can be derived through multiple techniques prior to the time that a customer initiates a call to a support representative. By quickly directing the customer to an ideal representative, the customer's experience and satisfaction is greatly improved. Furthermore, by reducing the average hold time (AHT) and by increasing the likelihood of providing first call resolution (FCR) of the customer's needs, costs associated with customer service can be reduced.","Placement of a Call Now button is not limited to the body of web page or display interface provided by a device specific software application. For example, a Call Now button can be incorporated at an Internet search engine, at a social media site, within a mobile device application, banner advertisements or pop-up display windows, Email documents and Email viewers, interactive television programs, and the like. In response to selection of the Call Now button by a user, a call can be routed to a selected service representative based fully or in part on information determined by the voice communication routing system .","Although only a few exemplary embodiments have been described in detail above, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the embodiments of the present disclosure.
