{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to audio devices, and more particularly to systems and methods that facilitate audio on demand and mobile audio devices.","Mobile audio is an important form of entertainment and information today. Mobile audio devices are often utilized in automobiles, at the gym, jogging and the like. People have come to rely on mobile audio devices (e.g., car radios, portable compact disc players, portable cassette players and the like) for entertainment and information content. Entertainment content generally relates to music, songs, radio talk shows, other various forms of entertainment and the like. Information content generally relates to information reports and\/or updates such as news reports, traffic reports, weather reports and the like. However, this content is often not available when desired by a user.","As an example, traffic reports may not be received often enough to be of value for a typical commuter. The commuter needs to have current traffic reports to make travel decisions and if that information is not received in time or missed (e.g., by a user being distracted by traffic during a traffic report), the commuter cannot necessarily make proper decisions. News and weather reports can also lose value if not obtainable as\/when desired by a user.","For entertainment, mobile devices can provide music or other forms of entertainment by utilizing a mobile device with a tuner to receive entertainment via radio broadcasts (e.g. AM and\/or FM). Just as with information, desired entertainment may not be provided when\/as desired. Radio stations are typically divided into certain styles of music allowing choice of style. However, current songs may not be desirable or there may be a commercial playing preventing a person from receiving desired content.","Conventional mobile audio devices can typically play audio media such as, compact disc audio (CDDA), cassette tapes and the like. However, these media fail to provide a substantially large collection of music. Additionally, the physical storage required for these media can be extensive. Finally, changing currently playing content can be difficult and\/or even hazardous while driving a car or other activity.","There are some digital audio devices that expand the size of available entertainment content such as MP3 players. However, these devices require a large amount of configuration and control, which can be difficult to perform while driving. Alternately, playlists can be manually generated, in advance, to play desired content. However, such playlists can be time consuming to generate and cannot be readily generated by a user driving an automobile. Additionally, entertainment content desired can vary or change from the time the playlist(s) is manually generated to the time the playlist is utilized on the device.","Thus, current mobile audio devices can fail to timely provide entertainment and\/or information content for users. Additionally, current mobile audio devices can be difficult for a user to employ to obtain desired content.","The following is a summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not intended to identify key\/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","The present invention provides a large-capacity user-defined audio content delivery system. The system delivers uninterrupted music and delivers information content (e.g., news) by evaluating and encoding an input audio stream while outputting another stream. Undesirable audio content (e.g., advertisements and unwanted news) are not present in the output audio stream as only desired portions of information content are stored for playback on demand. The invention also includes a user interface that is simple enough to facilitate utilization of the audio system in an automobile and employs standard hardware available in typical computing and\/or personal digital assistant equipment. Additionally, the audio system can be portable (e.g., as portable as a personal digital assistant) and can be updated in real time or off line via a personal computer.","The present invention facilitates utilization of information content and entertainment content. Information content is captured and can be accessed to provide current reports such as news, traffic and weather reports. Entertainment content can be scanned to efficiently determine a user's preference function and then to identify media items (e.g., songs) according to the user's preference function.","The user interface provided by the present invention allows a user to select audio content by selecting a scan button and\/or listen to current information reports by selecting at least one of a news button, weather button and a traffic button. The selection of the scan button initiates a scan function that permits a user to indicate desired listening preferences and to identify and play content similar to the indicated preferences. The selection of the news button, the weather button or the traffic button initiate playback of a current report.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative of various ways in which the invention may be practiced, all of which are intended to be covered by the present invention. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.","The present invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present invention.","As used in this application, the terms \u201ccomponent\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and\/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and\/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and\/or distributed between two or more computers.","It is to be appreciated that, for purposes of the present invention, any or all of the functionality associated with modules, systems and\/or components discussed herein can be achieved in any of a variety of ways (e.g. combination or individual implementations of active server pages (ASPs), common gateway interfaces (CGIs), application programming interfaces (API's), structured query language (SQL), component object model (COM), distributed COM (DCOM), system object model (SOM), distributed SOM (DSOM), ActiveX, common object request broker architecture (CORBA), database management systems (DBMSs), relational database management systems (RDBMSs), object-oriented database management system (ODBMSs), object-relational database management systems (ORDBMS), remote method invocation (RMI), C, C++, practical extraction and reporting language (PERL), applets, HTML, dynamic HTML, server side includes (SSIs), extensible markup language (XML), portable document format (PDF), wireless markup language (WML), standard generalized markup language (SGML), handheld device markup language (HDML), graphics interchange format (GIF), joint photographic experts group (JPEG), binary large object (BLOB), other script or executable components).","Turning now to , a mobile audio system  in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is depicted. The system  facilitates user enjoyment and employment of media in accordance with the subject invention. The system  affords for delivery of uninterrupted media (e.g., music, news) as well as desired media via evaluating and encoding an input media stream while outputting another stream. More particularly, undesired media\/content (e.g., advertisements and unwanted news) are not present in the output audio stream as only desired portions (e.g., subsets) of content are stored for playback on demand. Information content can be captured and accessed to provide current reports such as news, traffic and weather reports. Entertainment content can be scanned to efficiently determine a user's preference function and then to identify media items (e.g., songs) according to the user's preference function.","The system  includes a user interface , a controller , a tuner , a storage component , a high speed interface , a media database  and a sound system . The system  facilitates receiving and enjoying entertainment and information content. Current information content (e.g., news, weather, traffic and the like) and entertainment content (e.g., music) is obtainable on demand.","The user interface  is operative to enable a user to select, control and obtain content to be received and played. The user interface generally includes a control for selecting desired entertainment content and desired information content. The entertainment content includes sources such as music and\/or audio books. The information content includes sources such as weather, traffic, news and the like. The controller  is generally operative to control the system . The controller  interfaces and\/or controls other components of the system .","The high speed interface  is connected to the controller  and is connected to the external media source . The connection to external media source  can be intermittent. The high speed interface  is an interface that permits sufficient data transfer rates for the media items stored in the external media source  while external media source  is accessible. Media in external media source  can be copied into the media database  when external media source  is available. The high speed interface  can be implemented utilizing a mechanism such as a universal serial bus (USB), firewire, infrared and the like. Furthermore, networking technologies (e.g., wired and wireless) can also be employed for the high speed interface . Any suitable transfer rate can be employed for the high speed interface  so long as the media items can be accessed in a timely fashion. Some exemplary suitable transfer rates are 1 Mbit\/s, 10 Mbit\/s and 100 Mbit\/s.","It is appreciated that the external media source  can be detached and removed from the system , swapped with another media source, be reattached to the system, and the like and still be in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, one or more additional media sources can be connected to the high speed interface  to add and\/or modify the entertainment content available to the system .","External media source  can be comprised of devices such as compact disks (e.g., MP3 CDs), digital video disks (DVD), portable storage devices (e.g., hard drives), flash memory (e.g., smart media, compact flash, memory stick, multimedia memory and the like), personal digital assistants and the like. Alternatively, external media source  can be resident on the hard drive of a separate computer. In this case, the high speed interface is a network (either wired or wireless).","The media database  stores, maintains and provides a collection of media items (e.g., songs). The collection of media items can be relatively large. For example, a music collection of about  conventional compact discs in compact disc digital audio (CDDA) format can comfortably be compressed into about 5 Gbytes of data and stored on the media database . Additionally, the media database  also maintains metadata for respective media items. The metadata provides descriptive information and\/or characteristics about the media item in the collection. The metadata includes information that characterizes the media item(s) and can include, for example, artist, song title, movie title, author, genre (e.g., folk, jazz, new wave, rock and the like), album and the like. In some aspects of the invention, the media item(s) include or incorporate metadata (e.g., via a tag or block of information at a specific location in a file) such as, for example, ID3 tags which include information characterizing digital audio files (e.g., mp3). Alternately, metadata can be generated for the media item(s) by analyzing aspects of the seed items such as, tempo, volume, instruments, vocals, in order to determine appropriate metadata for the respective media item(s). Additionally, metadata can be entered (e.g., by a user) for respective media item(s). Additional descriptions of metadata that can be employed with the present invention are provided with  and elsewhere in the description.","The tuner  is operative to selectably provide audio streams or audio content (e.g., analog or digital) to the controller . The tuner  is selectable via the user interface , the controller  and\/or another external user interface (not shown) to select one of a plurality of stations or broadcasts. Generally, the tuner  can receive broadcasts (e.g., AM and\/or FM radio broadcasts, satellite radio broadcasts, network broadcasts and the like) and obtain audio content from those broadcasts. The tuner  is configurable for turning on, turning off, selecting a particular station or broadcast, turning on at a specified time, turning off at a specified time and the like. Typically, respective broadcasts provide varying information and\/or entertainment content (e.g., news radio stations, top 40 stations, sports talk radio stations and the like).","The storage component  permits short and\/or long term storage of recorded content from the tuner . The recorded content is typically in a suitably compress format and can be accessed and\/or provided as needed. Generally, a smaller amount of storage (e.g., about 15 Mbytes) can be employed for storing content from tuner  since the recorded content is substantially comprised of relatively short clips of information content (e.g., news reports, weather reports, traffic reports and the like). Information content (e.g., content that mostly contains voice) can generally be compressed more than other types of content such as songs or music and thus utilizes less storage space. Storage  can also be used to store media database .","The sound system  receives an audio stream (e.g., analog or digital) and \u201cplays\u201d the audio stream. The sound system  can be of a number of suitable devices such as, car radio, speaker system and the like. Furthermore, the sound system  can receive other audio streams from other components such as CD players, other tuners, car stereos, audio devices and the like. The sound system  can be configured to decode or decompress the audio stream and also, to provide the stream in digital and\/or analog format.","As stated supra, the controller  is generally operative to control the system . The controller  interfaces and\/or controls other components of the system . Additionally, the controller  receives user input from the user interface  and initiates a desired function (e.g., provide entertainment content and\/or information content). Generally, the controller  receives directives to perform the following functions: scan entertainment content, provide news content, provide weather content, and provide traffic content. It is appreciated that alternate aspects of the invention can perform other, similar functions.","The scan entertainment content function is performed by playing segments of a sub-collection of the media database , also referred to as candidate seed items, until a user cancels the scan or indicates a desired media item or desired seed item. Segments that are bypassed (e.g., not selected as desirable by a user) are deemed to be undesirable media items or undesirable seed items. A segment that a user indicates as desirable is a desirable seed item. Subsequent to obtaining the desirable seed item, a playlist is generated that includes media items from the collection similar to the desirable seed item and dissimilar to the undesirable seed item(s). The playlist generally includes references or pointers to the media items, not the media items themselves. After being generated, the playlist is played by transferring (e.g., streaming), in the determined order, media items indicated by the playlist to the sound system .","The segments played are typically about 10 seconds each, but alternate aspects of the invention can utilize various lengths of time. Additionally, the segments are obtained so as to be representative of the media item and should be long enough to allow a typical user to correctly associate the segment with the associated candidate seed item (e.g., song). Generally, a more representative segment can be at a location of the song besides the beginning. A database of segment identifiers that indicate representative segments can be employed to obtain appropriate segments. Additionally, segments can simply start 30 seconds into a song. Other suitable approaches can be utilized with the invention. The sub-collection (the list of candidate seed items) is a selected subset of the media collection. Typically, the sub-collection is a small number of media items (e.g., 20 songs). A first element of the sub-collection is randomly selected. However, the first element should have a sufficient amount of metadata and have a sufficient amount of similarity to other media items (e.g., sub-genre) to allow it to serve as a seed for generating a playlist (as explained below). The second element of the sub-collection is chosen so as to be substantially dissimilar to the first element. Subsequent elements are iteratively chosen so as to be dissimilar to several previous elements. Thus, the effect is that a user is more likely to identify a desirable song faster. As an example, some possible elements could be a first element of a hard rock type, a second element of classical music type, a third element of dance music type and so on. Additional details on selecting elements for the sub-collection are described infra.","As discussed supra, bypassed segments are deemed to indicate undesirable media items, also referred to as undesirable seed items and a selected segment (e.g., by a user clicking a scan button while that segment is playing) is deemed to indicate a desirable media item, also referred to as a desirable seed item. Thus, zero or more undesirable seed items are obtained and one desirable seed item is obtained. It is appreciated that alternate aspects can include additional desirable seed items (e.g., by a user clicking a scan button for desirable items and pressing and holding the scan button for a final desirable seed item).","After obtaining the seed item(s), a preference function is generated based on the undesirable seed items and desirable seed item. The preference function represents a user's desired and undesired entertainment content. Individual items of the media collection are then compared with the preference function to identify those items that are similar or in relation to that desired by the user.","The provided information function, discussed supra, includes a request for information content such as, news, traffic and weather. Typically, the request is initiated by a user selecting or clicking an appropriate button (e.g., a weather button). On receiving such a request, a recent or most recent recorded report of a requested type is played via the sound system . For example, on receiving a request for a weather update, a recently recorded weather report is played for the user.","The controller  also receives and records information content such as, news, traffic and weather. The controller  interfaces with the tuner , and determines when a particular report is occurring, records the report and stores the report in the storage component . Typically, information reports (e.g., weather update) occur on a regular basis (e.g., every 10 minutes or so) or have an associated signature (e.g., jingle). Thus, one possible approach to recording respective subsets of broadcasted media is to \u201cturn on\u201d and select the appropriate broadcast at the regular or expected time. Once time for the broadcasted media has elapsed, the recording of the media subset is ended. Another approach is to continuously scan one or more broadcasts for identifying jingles or signatures. On identifying a signature, a corresponding media is recorded until an ending signature is detected or a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. Other suitable approaches for scheduling and recording media can be utilized and still be in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, information such as tables of schedules, identifying jingles, electronic programming guide and the like can be maintained in the storage component  in order to facilitate recording media. This information can be periodically updated via the high speed interface  or the tuner  (via a selected broadcast).","Finally, the recorded form of the media is in, or is converted to, a suitable compressed format prior to storing. Some exemplary suitable compressed formats are MP3, Windows Media Audio and the like. Additionally, only a number of recent recorded broadcasts are typically maintained for a given information type. For example, the last 2 traffic reports can be maintained and previous traffic reports discarded, thus conserving storage space for the storage component . It is appreciated that information content, such as traffic reports, can become unnecessary or less desirable after a certain amount of time (e.g., yesterday's traffic report is substantially irrelevant to today's traffic report).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100","200"]},"The user interface  includes selectable user items: a scan button , a news button , a weather button , and a traffic button . The user items can be implemented in a number of suitable means. The user interface  can be a \u201ctouch sensitive\u201d screen (e.g., liquid crystal display (LCD)) wherein a user selects an item by touching the display in an area defined by the various items (e.g., scan button ). Additionally, the user interface  can include a series of physical push buttons wherein a user selects an item by pushing a corresponding button.","The scan button  is selected to initiate a scan of entertainment content (e.g., media items). Segments of a subset of a collection of media items are played for a user. The segments are relatively short (e.g., 10 seconds) versions of respective media items, but long enough to permit a user to decide whether or not the media item is desirable. On a user identifying a segment as desirable, the user selects the scan button  a second time so as to identify the respective media item as desirable (e.g., a desirable seed item). The desired media item continues playing without interruption. Segments that are played without the user indicating them as desirable (e.g., selected the scan button a second time), are deemed to be undesirable seed items. Subsequently, a preference function is generated based on the desirable and undesirable seed items. This preference function is then compared with remaining media items (e.g., media items that have not been played) to generate a playlist of items that include media items (e.g., songs) that are similar to the desirable seed item and dissimilar to the undesirable seed item(s). Media items identified in the playlist are played, in order, after the desired media item is done playing.","The news button  is selected to initiate playback or a current news report. The current news reported is recorded and stored and then accessed on the news button  being selected. The current news report can include typical news information such as, but not limited to, world news, business news, top stories, sports news, entertainment news, political news, and the like. The weather button  is selected to initiate playback of a current weather report. The current weather report is recorded and stored in a similar fashion to the current news report. The weather report can include typical weather information such as, local temperatures, local forecast, regional forecast, extended forecast, current conditions (e.g., temperature, precipitation, . . . ), and the like. The traffic button  is selected to initiate playback of a current traffic report. The current traffic report is recorded and stored in a similar fashion to the current news report. The traffic report can include typical traffic information like, traffic flow, construction reports, accident reports, and driving conditions.","Turning now to , a system  that facilitates recording and playing information content in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is depicted. The system  includes a recording component , the recording component  comprising a content analyzer , a playback component , a tuner  and a storage component . The system  is operative to selectively record desired broadcasts (e.g., information content) and playback or provide those broadcasts on demand.","The tuner  is configured to selectably provide audio streams or audio content (e.g., analog or digital) to the recording component . The tuner  can be controlled via a user interface (not shown), the recording component  and\/or another external user interface (not shown) to select one of a plurality of stations or broadcasts. Generally, the tuner  can receive broadcasts (e.g., AM and\/or FM radio broadcasts, satellite radio broadcasts, network broadcasts and the like) and obtain audio content from those broadcasts. The tuner  is configurable for turning on, turning off, selecting a particular station or broadcast, turning on at a specified time, turning off at a specified time and the like. Additionally, the tuner  is operative to select and provide audio content for multiple broadcasts simultaneously (e.g., can provide separate audio streams for a news and weather report occurring simultaneously on two distinct stations). Typically, respective broadcasts provide varying information and\/or entertainment content (e.g., news radio stations, top 40 stations, sports talk radio stations and the like).","The storage component  permits short and\/or long term storage of recorded content from the tuner , via the recording component . The recorded content is typically in a suitably compressed format and can be accessed and\/or provided as needed. Generally, a relatively small amount of storage (e.g., about 15 Mbytes) is utilized for storing content from tuner  since the recorded content is substantially comprised of relatively short clips of information content (e.g., news reports, weather reports, traffic reports and the like). Information content can generally be compressed more than other types of content such as songs or music and thus utilizes less storage space.","The playback component  receives an audio stream (e.g., analog or digital) or content from the storage component  and \u201cplays\u201d the audio stream. The playback component  can be a of a number of suitable devices such as, car radio, speaker system and the like. The playback component  can receive other audio streams from other components such as CD players, other tuners, car stereos, audio devices and the like. The playback component  can be configured to decode or decompress the audio stream and to provide the stream in digital and\/or analog format.","The recording component  receives and records information content such as, news, traffic and weather from the tuner . The recording component  interfaces with the tuner , and determines when a particular media is occurring, records the media and stores at least a subset of the media in the storage component . Typically, information reports (e.g., news update) occur on a regular basis (e.g., every 10 minutes or so) or have an associated jingle. Thus, one possible approach to recording respective media is to \u201cturn on\u201d and select the appropriate broadcast at the regular or expected time. Once time for the report has expired, the recording of the report is ended. Additionally, the content analyzer  continuously scans one or more broadcasts (e.g., several stations) for identifying jingles (e.g., a starting jingle). A jingle is a commonly utilized \u201csignature\u201d for news reports by radio stations. On identifying a jingle, a report is recorded until the content analyzer  detects an ending jingle and\/or a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. The detection of a jingle can be accomplished with a stream audio fingerprinting system, such as that described in the paper \u201cExtracting Noise\u2014Robust Features from Audio Data\u201d by C. Burges, J. Platt, and S. Jana, appearing in ICASSP 2002, pages 11021\u201311024. Other suitable approaches for scheduling and recording reports can be utilized and still be in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, information such as tables of schedules, identifying jingles, electronic programming guide and the like can be maintained in the storage component  in order to facilitate recording reports. This information can be periodically updated via a suitable mechanism such as the tuner  (via a selected broadcast). In an alternate aspect of the invention, the content analyzer  is trainable so that a user can initiate training for a currently playing report.","The recorded reports are then compressed to a suitable compressed format prior to storing. Some exemplary suitable compressed formats are MP3, Windows Media Audio and the like. Then, the newly recorded report is stored on the storage component and a previously recorded report of the same type is discarded (e.g., previous traffic report replaced by new traffic report). Alternate aspects of the invention can maintain a number of recent recorded broadcasts a given information type. For example, the last 2 traffic reports can be maintained and previous traffic reports discarded. By discarding previously recorded reports, storage space is conserved thereby reducing implementation costs.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","400","400","402","404","406"]},"The scan list engine  is operative to receive the user input comprising a first input and a second input. The user input is generally provided via a suitable user interface (not shown). The first input initiates a scan operation and the second input identifies a desirable media item (e.g., seed item) and ends the scan operation.","The scan operation is performed by playing segments of a sub-collection of the media collection, stored in the media database , until a user cancels the scan or indicates a desired media item or desired seed item via the second input. Segments that are bypassed (e.g., not selected as desirable by a user) are deemed to be undesirable media items referred to as undesirable seed items.","The seed item(s) are received by a playlist generator  that generates the playlist that includes media items from the collection similar to the desirable seed item and dissimilar to the undesirable seed item(s). The playlist generally includes references or pointers to the media items. After being generated, the playlist is played by transferring (e.g., streaming), in a specified order, media items indicated by the playlist to the playback component . The playlist is generated by computing a preference function that accounts for desirable and undesirable seed items. Additional approaches that the playlist generator  can employ to generate a playlist from seed item(s) are disclosed infra. Further, a graphical representation of a preference function is depicted in .","Referring once again to the scan list engine , the segments played are typically about 10 seconds each, but alternate aspects of the invention can utilize various lengths of time. Additionally, the segments are identified so as to be representative of the media item. A more representative segment can be at a certain location of the song. A database of segment identifiers can be employed to obtain appropriate segments. Additionally, segments can simply start 30 seconds into a song. Other suitable approaches can be utilized with the invention.","The sub-collection, also referred to as candidate seed items, is a selected subset of the media collection and is typically a small number of media items (e.g., 20 songs). A first element of the sub-collection is randomly selected. However, the first element should have a sufficient amount of metadata and have a sufficient amount of similarity to other media items (e.g., sub-genre) to allow it to serve as seed for a playlist (as explained below). The second element of the sub-collection is chosen so as to be substantially dissimilar to the first element. Subsequent elements are iteratively chosen so as to be dissimilar to several previous elements. Thus, the effect is that a user is more likely to identify a desirable song faster. As an example, some possible elements could be a first element of a hard rock type, a second element of classical music type, a third element of dance music type and so on. Additional details on selecting elements for the sub-collection are described infra.","One approach to obtaining the sub-collection is described here, however other suitable approaches can be employed and still be in accordance with the invention. A temporary list of media items is initialized. A number of media items are randomly selected from the media database  (e.g., 20 songs) and added to the temporary list. It is appreciated that a larger number of media items can be utilized (e.g., even the whole collection), however a smaller number of media items can accelerate the process. Media items that do not have or contain metadata (e.g., unknown artist, unknown title) are then removed from the temporary list. Additionally, uncommon media items are removed from the temporary list. Then, similarities are computed for respective media items in the list to all other media items in the list of candidate seed items. Then, a next item for the list of candidate seed items is chosen by identifying a media item from the temporary list that is least similar to all previous item on the list of candidate seed items. The process is then iterated a number (e.g., 40) of times.","The uncommon media items are those media items that are not similar to a minimal number of other media items. One approach is to determine whether a media item is similar to at least 5 other media items (e.g., has 5 other media items in its subgenre) and if it is not, the media item is deemed uncommon and removed from the temporary list.","It is appreciated that identity for media items is not necessarily fully known. For example, a media item may have a known artist or author, but it cannot be identified specifically. For this case, similarity of an item with missing track to another item can be obtained by computing an average of similarity for known items by the artist to the other item. The following equation can be employed to compute this average: \n\n","where N is a number of media items by artist(the known artist of the first item), and K is a similarity function between two known items. N can be all items known by the first artist, but is typically limited to a maximum number (e.g., 200) so as to decrease computations.","Another special case is where there are 2 unknown media items for 2 known artists (artistand artist). The following equation can be employed to compute a similarity value between the 2 unknown media items by computing an average for the known artists. \n\n","where N is a number of known media items by artistand M is a number of known media items by artistand K is again a similarity function between two known items. N and M can be all known items for the respective artists but is typically a limited to a maximum number (e.g., 30) so as to decrease computations.","In the determination of uncommon media items, supra, the subgenre for media items with uncertain identity must be sometimes computed. The computation of subgenre for such media items is described here, and is similar to the computation of similarity for such items which uses a specific K function. Namely, the subgenre similarity between two known items is 1 if they have the same subgenre, 0 otherwise. The subgenre between two partially known items is thus computed by the procedure described supra for this definition of K. A media item is considered uncommon if the sum of its subgenre similarities to the rest of the media database  is less than a pre-determined threshold (e.g., 5).","As discussed supra, bypassed segments are deemed to indicate undesirable media items, also referred to as undesirable seed items and a selected segment (e.g., by a user clicking a scan button while that segment is playing) is deemed to indicate a desirable media item, also referred to as a desirable seed item. Thus, zero or more undesirable seed items are obtained and one desirable seed item is obtained. It is appreciated that alternate aspects can include additional desirable seed items (e.g., by a user clicking a scan button for desirable items and pressing and holding the scan button for a final desirable seed item).","After obtaining the seed item(s), a preference function is generated based on the undesirable seed items and desirable seed item. The preference function represents a user's desired and undesired entertainment content. Individual items of the media collection are then compared with the reference function to identify those items that are similar or in relation to that desired by the user. A more in depth description of computing a preference function is described infra.","Turning now to , an example of information associated with a media item  is illustrated. The exemplary information associated with the media item  includes a pointer  (e.g., universal resource locator, filename, . . . ) indicating the location of the media item  and permitting access to the media item. Alternately, the metadata can be included with media item  itself (e.g., by a 128 bit tag at the end of a file). Although the present invention is described primarily in relation to songs or audio, it is to be appreciated that the media items can include, but are not limited to, songs, movies, music videos, documents, books, poems, images (e.g., photographs), for example. The media item  is also associated with a unique track identifier  and a unique artist identifier . The media item  is also associated with identifying metadata . For a song, the identifying metadata  may include an artist name , an album name  and a track name . By way of illustration, the artist name  may be the name of a solo artist who performed a song or the name of a group that performed the song and an associated list of group members. By way of further illustration, the album name  may be the name of the album on which the song appeared and other information like the release date of the album. The track name  can include the name of the song, the length of the song, the amount of time between the first note of the song and the first lyric (if any) and the size (e.g., in kilobytes) of the song, for example. Such metadata (e.g., artist, album, track) can be employed to generate unique identifiers. Since the metadata can vary between metadata databases, inexact matching between items may be required. The unique identifiers can refer, for example, to one or more rows in a reference metadata database. In the case of a song, an item identification process attempts to assign a unique track identifier (e.g., ) and a unique artist identifier (e.g., ) to media items to facilitate, for example, accessing, storing and\/or manipulating songs identified by the unique identifiers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","610","620","630","600","610","620","630","600","610","620","630"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIGS. 7","FIGS. 7\u20139","FIG. 7","FIG. 8","FIG. 9","FIG. 4"],"b":["8","9","700","701","801","802","803","701","702","703","900","904","701","702","703","801","802","803","900","404"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["1000","1000","1030","1032","1034","1000","1020","1022","1026","1028","1050","1050","1050"],"sub":["1 ","M "]},"The playlist generating system  can accept as input seed item(s) and\/or seed item identifier(s)  (e.g., from the scan list engine  of ).

In one example of the present invention, the user data store  and the playlist generating system  reside on a client system. The similarity system  may access the user data store  and a reference metadata data store  to make the determination of similarity.","Turning now to , a similarity subsystem  is depicted that computes a similarity value  in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. The similarity subsystem  can be employed to, for example, generate playlists and\/or to generate a sub-collection of media items (e.g., for use by the scan list engine  of ). N seed items are compared to a candidate item from a collection or library by comparing each seed item individually to the candidate item by similarity metric(s)  to obtain a similarity value(s) . The similarity value  is a value that indicates similarities between the candidate item and a respective seed item. A suitable scheme, such as is described in further detail with respect to , is utilized to obtain the similarity metric(s) . The similarity value(s)  computed for each seed item is then multiplied by N weights ; alpha, alpha, . . . alphaand then summed together to produce a final similarity value  which can then be employed with system  of , system  of  (e.g., playlist generator ) and\/or other suitable systems for generating playlists in accordance with the present invention. Generally, if the similarity value  exceeds a threshold amount, the candidate item is added to a playlist and if it does not, it is not added to the playlist. Subsequently, a next candidate item, if present, is then processed by the subsystem .","The weights  can be generated via a variety of suitable approaches. One suitable approach is to simply assign the respective weights  as +1. This approach results in the similarity value  that is an average of the respective similarity metric(s) . Another approach is to assign the respective weights  as +1 for indicating that a seed item is desirable (e.g., by selecting a scan button during a segment) and as \u22121 for indicating that a seed item is undesirable (e.g., by not selecting the scan button during a segment). This approach produces the similarity value  that is a function of desirable and undesirable seed items. Yet another approach is to assign the respective weights  by selected values from a range (e.g., +1 to \u22121). The respected weights  can be selected or input by a user (e.g., by a user selecting a weight for an added or removed item). Thus, larger weights (in absolute value terms) have more of an effect on the final similarity value  than smaller weights.","However, it is possible that one or more of the seed item(s) are also candidate items. Thus, the weights are computed such that if the candidate item is the same as one of the desirable seed items (e.g., added), the resulting similarity is exactly 1 while if the candidate item is the same as one of the undesirable seed items (e.g., removed), the resulting similarity is exactly 0. Alternatively, if the user has expressed a non-binary target preference (between 0 and 1), then the resulting similarity should match the target preference. This computation can be represented as a linear system. Let the vector b=1 if the ith seed item has been added, 0 if it has been removed (or, more generally, b=the target preference value for the ith seed item). Then, let Kbe the matrix of similarities produced when the similarity metric  is applied to the ith and the jth seed items. Then, assuming that the matrix Kis invertible, the \u03b1(weight corresponding to the jth seed item) can be solved by solving the linear system: \n\n","Given the seed item(s), Eq. 1 is only required to be solved once to obtain \u03b1since it is a linear system. If the matrix Kis not invertible, other methods can be employed to obtain a solution. One method is to add a small offset to the diagonal of Kto make it invertible: \n\n","Additionally, other methods, such as singular value decompositions can be utilized to obtain the solution.","It is also appreciated that the subsystem  can be employed by a component or system to generate a sub-collection of media items for use in implementing a scan function described supra.","Turning now to , a block diagram of a similarity subsystem  and a similarity value generator  employed in computing a similarity value  is depicted. The similarity subsystem  accepts as inputs a seed item feature vector  and a candidate item feature vector . While  refers primarily to feature vectors and feature vector similarity processing, it is to be appreciated that other similarity analysis techniques may be employed in accordance with the present invention. In one example of the present invention, the seed item feature vector  includes fields encoding information relating to genre, subgenre, genre, style, mood, vocal coding, rhythm type and rhythm description. Similarly, the candidate item feature vector  also includes fields encoding information relating to genre, subgenre, genre, style, mood, vocal coding, rhythm type and rhythm description. Thus, the similarity subsystem  can compare the feature vectors using suitable techniques (e.g., attribute-wise comparison) to produce a difference vector . For example, if the seed item feature vector  and the candidate item feature vector  both code information relating to seven attributes, the difference vector  would indicate differences and\/or similarities among the seven attributes (e.g., a seven bit or seven attribute vector). The difference vector  is then employed as an input to a similarity value generator  that can employ the difference vector  as an index into a similarity value data store  to produce the similarity value . The similarity value data store  can store, for example, a lookup table that can be employed to translate the difference vector  into the similarity value . In one example of the present invention, the similarity value data store  contains correlation values that were generated by machine learning techniques applied to similarity processing involving difference vectors generated from seed item feature vectors and candidate item feature vectors.

In some aspects, the approximate time can be entered by a user. Alternately, a table of scheduling information (e.g., electronic program guide) can be employed to determine the approximate starting time. The approximate time should be an amount of time before an expected starting time so as to ensure that the start of the report is captured. The report is generated or broadcast via a particular station or channel (e.g., FM channel, AM channel, satellite channel, network address, and the like). Thus, a channel that carries or plays the information report is analyzed at . Generally, the analyzing of the channel begins at the approximate starting time. The channel is analyzed to identify signature jingles that indicate a start of a report or broadcast (e.g., news update, traffic report, weather report, . . . ).

The scan function is a request for playing segments in order to obtain a user's desired characteristics (e.g., music preferences) and to generate a playlist and\/or play media items (e.g., songs) that match those preferences. Typically, the scan function is initiated via a user interface by a user. A collection of candidate seed items are generated at . The collection is a portion of a media collection and is typically at least partially randomly determined and is generated such that successive candidate seed items in the list are substantially dissimilar (e.g., not alike). A current segment, which is a small portion of a respective candidate seed item, is played at . Then, the current segment, and thereby the associated candidate seed item, is selected as either desirable or undesirable at .

A selected number of randomly selected items are obtained from a media collection at . A typical number that can be employed is 20 randomly selected items. Media items without metadata are removed from the randomly selected items at . Without metadata that indicates characteristics of a media item, it is difficult to identify media items similar to an item without metadata. However, it is appreciated that alternate aspects of the invention can analyze such items and approximate similarities for such item(s). Additionally, uncommon media items are removed from the randomly selected items at . An example of an uncommon media item would be a song whose subgenre does not match many other song subgenres in the media database . Subsequently, similarities (e.g., K(media item, media item) K(media item, media item) . . . ) are computed at  between the remaining randomly selected items (e.g., those having metadata and being somewhat common) and the list of candidate seed items. Next, one of the randomly selected items is inserted into the list at  as a candidate seed item. The inserted item is most dissimilar to some or all of the previously inserted candidate seed item(s). It is appreciated that the first item inserted into the list is merely randomly selected. The method  then decides at  whether enough items are in the list of candidate seed items and continues at  with additional randomly selected items, iteratively, until the list of candidate items includes a suitable number of items.","Subsequently, segments for the list of candidate seed items can be played for a user in order to determine desired characteristics for the user. The segments can be particular portions of media items (e.g., as identified in a database) or at a certain period of time in the candidate items.","Turning now to , a flow diagram of a method  of generating a playlist in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is depicted.

Similarity values are then computed for the respective seed items by comparing the seed items, individually, to a candidate item at . Generally, a similarity value for each seed item is computed for the respective media items, also referred to as candidate items. The similarity values are weighted and added together to produce a final similarity value at . The weights for the individual similarity values can be obtained via a variety of suitable approaches. One approach is to assign the respective weights for the similarity values as +1. This approach results in the similarity value that is an average of the respective similarity values. Another approach is to assign the respective weights as +1 for indicating that a seed item is desirable (e.g., by selecting a scan button as described in ) and as \u22121 for indicating that a seed item is undesirable (e.g., by not selecting a scan button as described in ).

For example, for an implementation having 7 attributes (e.g., from meta data), a media item could be required to have a final similarity value equal or greater than 0.714 which indicates that the media item has about 5 of 7 attributes in common with the one or more seed items. It is appreciated that factors such as weights and undesirable characteristics can modify the number of attributes a media item has in common with the respective seed items while still providing a suitable final similarity value. If there are additional items in the collection at , the method  continues with a next item at . Otherwise, if there are no more items in the collection at , the method  continues at  where the items or tracks in the playlist are sorted according to their respective final similarity values. Thus, items that are more similar are played or encountered prior to less similar items. This is generally desirable because, for example, a user would likely prefer to hear the more similar songs first. Additionally, the desirable seed items, by virtue of necessarily being more similar, are inserted at the beginning of the playlist at .","The playlist can then be utilized by a device or component to, for example, play audio songs (e.g., for digital music), play a slide shows (e.g. for images), music videos and the like according to the playlists. Additionally, as discussed above, the generated playlist can be modified by adding or removing seed items and then employing the method to regenerate the playlist including the new items.","Referring now to , a method  of computing a final similarity value for one or more seed items and a candidate item in accordance with an aspect of the present invention is disclosed. For illustrative purposes only, the method  is discussed with respect to a candidate item, but it is appreciated that the method  can be employed with any suitable number of candidate items that might comprise a library or collection of media items.","A candidate item is obtained at , the candidate item being a member of a library or collection of media items. Candidate item metadata is obtained from the candidate item at . The media items can include types of media such as, but not limited to, music, video, images and the like. A seed item is obtained at  that represents desired or undesired characteristics. Seed item metadata is then obtained or extracted from the seed item at . The metadata can be obtained by the metadata being part of the seed item and\/or candidate item (e.g., a tag in a file) or can be obtained from analyzing the items themselves.","A similarity value or metric is computed according to the seed item metadata and the candidate item metadata at . A variety of suitable methods of computing the similarity value are described elsewhere in this description, but omitted here for brevity. Subsequently, the similarity value is multiplied by a weighting factor at . The weighting factor indicates degrees of desirability and undesirability of the seed item. For example, a weight of +1 typically is employed to indicate a strong preference for that seed item while a weight of \u22121 generally is utilized to indicate a strong dislike for the seed item by a user. Additionally, the weighting factor can be obtained with the seed item. After the similarity value has been computed at , the similarity value is added to a composite similarity value at . The composite value is essentially a running total or summation of the similarity values for one or more seed items and the single candidate items.","If another seed item is available to be processed at , the method  continues at  with the next seed item. Otherwise, if there are no more seed items to process at , the composite similarity value is utilized as the final similarity value at . Additional processing can be performed on the final similarity value, such as by dividing it by the number of seed items or some other scaling to produce a unified result. Then, that final similarity value is typically employed to determine whether or not to add the candidate item to a playlist and to order or sort the playlist. Finally, the method  can be invoked to process remaining items of library or collection, if present.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":["1900","1900","1902","1904","1906","1908","1904","1904","1906","1904","1908"]},"At , a similarity value can then be computed based on the difference vector. By way of illustration and not limitation, a function that accepts as an input a difference vector and produces as an output a similarity value can be employed to produce the similarity value. By way of further illustration and not limitation, a value may be retrieved from a database table by employing the difference vector as an index into the database table. While a similarity value function and a similarity value lookup are described above, it is to be appreciated that other methods for producing a similarity value from a difference vector may be employed in accordance with the present invention (e.g., treat the difference vector as a binary number corresponding to the similarity value). Then, at , the similarity value is multiplied by a weighting factor. The weighting factor is generally of a range of values, such as +1 to \u22121 and indicates a degree of desirability or undesirability that a user has for a particular seed item.","It is appreciated that the methods described supra, are readily combinable with each other and variations thereof. Furthermore, the methods can also be employed with the systems described supra.","Turning now to , a schematic block diagram illustrating feature vectors being compared to produce a difference vector  is depicted. A first feature vector  may include one or more feature attributes (e.g., attributes through , A and R being integers). For example the first feature vector  may include a genre attribute and a subgenre attribute that can be employed to facilitate characterizing a song. Similarly, a second feature vector  may include one or more feature attributes (e.g., attributes through , S being an integer). For example the second feature vector  may include a genre attribute and a subgenre attribute (B being an integer) that can be employed to facilitate characterizing a song. The feature vectors may be compared attribute by attribute to produce a difference vector  that contains a binary digit that codes information concerning whether the feature attributes matched. Such attribute by attribute comparison may be complicated by a situation where the feature vectors contain different attributes and\/or a different number of attributes. For example, the first feature vector  might contain a first number R of feature attributes while the second feature vector  might contain a second number S of feature attributes. Thus, one or more bits in the difference vector  may code information based on a comparison of feature attributes that do not have a one to one correspondence. By way of illustration, the first feature vector  may code information concerning song length into two attributes (e.g., length of song in seconds, size of song in kilobytes) while the second feature vector  may code information concerning song length into one attribute (e.g., play length). Thus, setting or clearing a bit in the difference vector  may involve resolving the dissimilar feature vector attributes. More specifically, if a subset of feature vectors is missing at random, the difference vector for the missing data can be set to be \u201c1\u201d, indicating a difference.","In order to provide additional context for various aspects of the present invention,  and the following discussion are intended to provide a brief, general description of a suitable operating environment  in which various aspects of the present invention may be implemented.  provides an additional and\/or alternative operating environment in which the present invention can operate.
