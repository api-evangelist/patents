In an example embodiment, the disclosure relates to the presentation or display of business information, such as, for example, key performance indicators (KPIs) relating to one or more business functions, the presentation or display being personalized for a particular user.","Given the often complex nature of many business operations or entities, the task of monitoring salient aspects of such organizations is typically daunting. Such may be the case even for relatively small business entities, which may have significant product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing, financial, and other business-related functions operating collectively toward one or more corporate goals. For decision-makers to monitor such an organization, businesses may provide a business information \u201cdashboard,\u201d which is typically a web page or other computer-based presentation providing a number of important business metrics, KPIs, and\/or the like presented simultaneously in an easily digestible format. The information may be presented in any number of formats, such as graphs, tables, charts, individual numerical values, and the like. The viewer of such information may then react to the metrics by modifying or redirecting one or more of the business functions to remedy operational problems, improve overall business performance, and so on.","Generally, within a business organization, a set of dashboards may be specifically designed and employed to present predetermined types of data to the decision-makers of an organization. As a result, the types of information presented in a particular dashboard are generally static in nature over time, and present the same information to similarly situated employees or managers of the organization. Also, given their static nature, a dashboard is often designed to be displayed on a typical computer monitor, given the significant amount of data often presented within a dashboard.","The description that follows includes illustrative systems, methods, techniques, instruction sequences, and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques have not been shown in detail.","At least some of the embodiments described herein provide various techniques for the personalized display of data, such as data associated with various aspects of a business, including, but not limited to, product design and development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, sales, information technology, and employee pay and benefits administration. Such data may be displayed textually, graphically, or via other visual means, and the presentation thereof may be referred to as a \u201cdashboard\u201d display. In some examples, any data other than data associated with a business organization or entity may also be presented or displayed in the same manner as described below. As a result, each user, by way of a user device (such as, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, smart phone, or personal digital assistant (PDA)) may configure a personalized dashboard for the presentation of data of particular interest to the user.","As is described in greater detail below with respect to some embodiments, the user may select any number of predefined data display applications for integration into a single dashboard display, sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cpresentation application,\u201d \u201cdashboard container application,\u201d \u201cdashboard application,\u201d \u201cdashboard container,\u201d and the like. The user may also configure each of the applications, as well the overall dashboard display, with respect to the type of data presented, time periods corresponding to the data, the format of the data presentation, and other parameters. In addition, the user may access and view the same personalized dashboard on a variety of devices. Other aspects of the embodiments discussed herein may be ascertained from the following detailed description.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","102","104","100","102","104","102","102","104"]},"The computing system  may include control logic , a communication interface , and data storage . The control logic  may include one or more processors configured to execute instructions that cause the processors to perform the various operations associated with the computing system  that are described in greater detail below. In other examples, the control logic  may include hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof.","The communication interface  may be configured to facilitate communication with one more user devices  by way of a communication connection, such as, for example, a local area network (LAN) connection (such as an Ethernet connection or an IEEE 802.11x (WiFi\u00ae) connection), a wide area network (WAN) (such as the Internet), or another wired or wireless communication connection.","The data storage  may store configuration data  for each of a number of users that describes one or more aspects of a presentation application to be generated and transmitted to the user device  for presentation to the user. In one example, the configuration data  describe personalized aspects of the presentation application chosen by the user, such as the identity of the separate data display applications to be incorporated within the dashboard presentation application, the values of the parameters utilized to further define the data being presented via the included applications, and so on. The data storage  may also include the applications  themselves, any one or more of which may be referenced in the configuration data  for inclusion in a personalized presentation application or dashboard display for a particular user. The data storage  may include either or both volatile data storage (such as, for example, static or dynamic random-access memory (RAM)) and\/or non-volatile data storage (such as, for example, flash memory, hard disk drive (HDD) memory, optical disk drive (ODD) memory, and solid state disk (SSD) memory).","Communicatively coupled with the computing system  is the user device , which may include control logic , a communication interface , a user interface , and data storage . In some implementations, examples of the control logic , the communication interface , and the data storage  may be similar to those described above for the control logic , the communication interface , and the data storage  of the computing system . The user interface , as shown in , may include a user input component  and a display component . In an example, the user input component  may be any component or structure by which the user may enter input into the user device , such as by way of textual, graphical, or other means, including, but not limited to, a keyboard, touchpad, touch screen, mouse, and the like. The display component  provides output to the user of the user device  by way of a liquid crystal display (LCD) or other visual display means. In some examples, the user input component  and the display component  may be combined into a single component or device, such as a touch screen.","In one example, the control logic  of the user device  may be configured to receive input from the user of the user device  for personalizing a dashboard application  for the user, and for requesting the downloading of the resulting dashboard application  from the computing system  for execution on the user device . As a result, the user may view data of particular interest, such as one or more of the types of business data enumerated above, via the display component  of the user device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","102","200","200","104","202","104","204","206","208","104","210","212","104","214"]},"As a result of the method , the user may cause the generation of a personalized dashboard application by at least selecting multiple preexisting data display applications to be included in the dashboard. The user may then request the download and execution of the generated dashboard application to the user device , as well as other user devices not specifically described herein. Further, as is described in greater detail below, the configuration and execution of the dashboard application does not involve specialized enabling software to be installed on the user device , and the dashboard application is deleted at the user device  upon execution completion.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","100","300","302","104","304","102"]},"In the front-end portion , an execution client  is responsible for executing the presentation application , which may be viewed as a \u201cdashboard container application,\u201d \u201cdashboard container,\u201d \u201cdashboard application,\u201d and the like, incorporating multiple data display applications , wherein the presentation application  has been downloaded from the back-end portion  for execution on a user device , as described above. In one example, the dashboard container application  may be one or more Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae files executable by way of a Flash Player, such as the Flash Player plug-in for Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae Internet Explorer\u00ae, serving as the execution client . Thus, in this example, the dashboard application  may be downloaded and executed by way of accessing a webpage via a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) corresponding to the dashboard application . In some examples, the specification and\/or configuration of the dashboard application , as described more fully below, may also be performed via the same or similar web-based mechanism.","In a specific Flash implementation, the dashboard application  conforms to the SAP\u00ae Web Dynpro\u00ae programming model for web-based user interfaces to SAP business applications. Moreover, the individual data display applications  incorporated within the dashboard container application  may be programmed using the SAP Crystal Solutions\u00ae (formerly Xcelsius\u00ae) dashboarding and data visualization software.","In other examples, the dashboard application  may be specified via one or more files formatted according to another interface standard, such as, for example, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Version 5, which may be implemented on a variety of user devices, including mobile devices. In yet other implementations, other web-based or non-web-based user interface technologies may be employed for the dashboard application  and the execution client . As a result, a user may view the same dashboard display on different display platforms, such as, for example, desktop and laptop computers, smart phones, PDAs, and tablet computers.","In the back-end portion  of the architecture , the interface module  may be configured to support the user interface aspects of the dashboard application  being executed at the user device . In the Web Dynpro example mentioned above, the interface module  may incorporate a Web Dynpro controller that performs data conversions and processing between the dashboard application  executing on the user device  (which may be referred to as a user \u201cview\u201d accessible via a web browser) and an interface to the actual data that is being presented to the user via the dashboard application  (which may be termed a \u201cmodel\u201d). In other examples, the interface module  may be any logic that supports the processing (such as, for example, conversion or translation) of data to a form usable by the execution client  for presentation to the user in the dashboard application . Additionally, the interface module  may also be configured to receive configuration information for the generation of the dashboard container application , such as, for example, the selection of the data display applications  to be included in the dashboard application .","The application provisioning module  of the back-end portion  may be configured to provide one or more services to a user of the user device  pertaining to the dashboard container application  and the incorporated data display applications . These services may include, but are not limited to, the generation of the dashboard container application , the storage of the configuration data used to generate the dashboard , the collection and possible processing of the data to be presented via the multiple data display applications , and the transmission of that data via the interface module  to the user device  for presentation to the user via the dashboard .","As shown in , the application provisioning module  may maintain an internal representation  of the dashboard container application , as well as internal representations  of one or more of the data display applications  included in the dashboard application . In one example, the representations ,  may allow the application provisioning module  to identify the data to be retrieved, as well as the type of processing to be applied to the retrieved data, the format of the data for transmission via the interface module  to the user device , and the like. The dashboard representation  and the representations  of the individual data display applications  may serve additional purposes in other embodiments.","The application provisioning module  may also include a content provisioning module , which may be configured to retrieve and process the data desired for presentation to the user via the dashboard container application . As depicted in , the content provisioning module  may include a content processing module  and a content interface . In one example, the content interface  may be configured to retrieve data from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, a relational database , a data warehouse , and miscellaneous data sources  (such as, for example, a Microsoft\u00ae Excel\u00ae spreadsheet). Generally, a data warehouse is a type of database that contains data that is uploaded from operational business systems primarily for reporting purposes. An example of a data warehouse is a database operated as an SAP Business Warehouse\u00ae (BW). Thus, in some examples, the content interface  may issue one or more database or data warehouse queries in order to receive responses that include the desired data to be presented ultimately to the user of the user device . Other methods by which the data is retrieved may be employed in other examples, and such methods may depend on the particular data source involved. As noted above, the retrieved data may include key performance indicators (KPIs) and other data related to business operations. In other examples, the data may not be restricted to business data, but may include any data or information of interest to a user, such as stock price information, sports statistics, and so on.","The content processing module  may be configured to perform any processing desired for the data retrieved by the content interface . Examples of such processing may include, but are not limited to, filtering the retrieved data (such as according to time, value, or other factors), composing or formatting the data, correlating at least portions of the data with other data, aggregating one or more data items (such as by addition or other mathematical or logical operations), and configuring the data for a particular purpose or objective. One example of such data configuration associated with data processing or communication performance may be service level agreement (SLA) configuration, wherein the data may be organized or processed so that the data may be compared with various requirements stated in a particular SLA to determine compliance with the SLA. In other examples, the content processing module  may perform any type of processing on the retrieved data, and then forward the processed data to the interface module  for transmission to the client device  for presentation to the user via the dashboard container application .","In some examples, the application provisioning module  may provide additional services relating to the dashboard container application , such as, for example, the customization and personalization of the dashboard container application  and the individual data display applications , development (possibly including tracing and debugging) of the data display applications , language localization and translation of the dashboard container application  and the individual data display applications , and\/or authorization for access to the dashboard container application  and the individual data display applications .","The application persistence module  of the back-end portion  may include any data useful in generating the dashboard container application . As illustrated in , such information may include, but is not limited to, configuration data  for the dashboard application , configuration data  for each of the data display applications  incorporated within the dashboard container application , and the individual data display applications . In one example, the data display applications  may be stored as Flash files in a form ready for execution within the dashboard container application . As described herein, at least some of this information may be provided by the user of the user device  via the interface module  and the application provisioning module . To facilitate the storage and retrieval of the various data ,  and applications , the application persistence module  may provide at least one application programming interface (API)  for those purposes in order to protect the integrity of the data ,  and applications .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","306","400","402","306","404","306","406","328","306","330","308","408","328","330","308","324","410"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["500","400","502","504","504","308","306","504","506","508","506","308","306"]},"In one example, the select application dialog box  represents a type of \u201capp store\u201d by which the user may select one or more different preprogrammed data display applications  for inclusion in a particular dashboard container application .

Also included in the dashboard application window  may be a time filter application window  that determines the time period applicable to the data to be presented in the selected application windows . In some examples, the time filter application is explicitly selected by the user for inclusion in the dashboard container application , while in other implementations, the time filter application may be included automatically as a result of the user selecting one or both of the \u201cAlerts per Managed Object\u201d or \u201cIncidents per Managed Object\u201d applications  for inclusion in the dashboard container application .","The time filter application is one example of an application which may produce data which is then employed as input data for another included data display application . In this example, the time filter application provides a time period for which the data for the selected application windows  are to be retrieved. As shown in , the user can select a number of formats via a dropdown menu by which to input the time period. In this particular example, the user has chosen a \u201cCustom Selection\u201d format, which causes the presentation of two calendars (one for the beginning day and another for the ending day of the selected time period). In , the user has selected 1 Jan. 2011 as the first day of the time period, and 1 Feb. 2011 as the last day of the period via the displayed calendars. By then activating the \u201cAccept\u201d button, the selected time period is applied to the other selected data display applications . The user may thereafter activate the \u201cHide filter\u201d selection within the time filter application window  to minimize or remove the time filter application window  to create more display area for the remaining selected application windows . In some examples, the time filter application represents just one type of data display application  which may provide input data, configuration data, or input parameters to other selected data display applications .","The selected application windows  of  provide information based on the data corresponding to the selected data display applications  over the time period selected via the time filter application. In this particular example, the time period is noted in each of the selected application windows . In each of the selected application windows , a number of events (for example, red alerts yellow alerts, or incidents) are displayed via a bar graph, wherein each bar corresponds to a particular data processing system (for example, System , System , and so on). In other examples, other graphical means of presenting this information, such as by way of a chart or table, may be utilized in each of the selected application windows .","In one implementation, the systems for which the various events are to be retrieved and displayed are determined by way of user-determined configuration data  for each of the individual data display applications . In another example, the systems may be selected by way of a separate data display application  that filters or limits the data to be retrieved to those specific systems, analogous to how the time filter application restricts the data to a user-determined time period.","In some embodiments, two or more of the selected data display applications  may be separate instances of the same data display application , distinguished by way of the data being presented, or by way of how the data is formatted. For example, one instance of a data display application  may present data corresponding to a different time period than that associated with another instance of the same data display application . In another example, one instance may pertain to one set of data processing systems (for example, Systems -), while another instance of the same data display application  may be associated with another set of systems (for example, Systems -). In yet other implementations, two instances of the same data display application  may present the same data in different formats, such as, for example, by way of bar graphs and pie charts. Other reasons for selecting multiple instances of the same data display application  for display within a single dashboard application window  are also possible.","In one example, while perusing the dashboard application window , the user may select a particular data display application window  to be magnified or expanded on the display  temporarily to obtain a closer view of the information provided therein.","In the example of , the dashboard application window  may provide the user the ability to refresh, update, or renew the data being presented in the selected application windows  by way of a \u201cRefresh\u201d selector. In addition, the dashboard application window  may indicate the time at which the selected application windows  were refreshed. Also, the dashboard application window  may provide a \u201cConfigure\u201d selector, as depicted in , which may allow the user to add or remove various data display applications  from the dashboard container application , set various parameters or configuration data, and the like, such as by way of the dialog box  of .","In one example, the user device  only needs the execution client  () to execute the dashboard container application  to present the dashboard application window  to the user. Further, once the dashboard container application  completes execution, such as, for example, by way of the user terminating the dashboard container application  on the user device , the dashboard container application , including all data display applications  incorporated therein, may be deleted from the user device .","Based on at least some of the implementations described herein, a user may access one or more dashboard displays, such as by way of the Internet or another communication network or connection, that the user is capable of personalizing to meet the individual needs of the user.

It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (for example, configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.","Accordingly, the term \u201chardware module\u201d should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (for example, hardwired) or temporarily configured (for example, programmed) to operate in a certain manner and\/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (for example, programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules include a general-purpose processor  that is configured using software, the general-purpose processor  may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor , for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.","Modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other modules. For example, the described modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiples of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmissions (such as, for example, over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the modules. In embodiments in which multiple modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple modules have access. For example, one module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (for example, a collection of information).","The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors  that are temporarily configured (for example, by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors  may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, include processor-implemented modules.","Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors  or processor-implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors , not only residing within a single machine but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processors  may be located in a single location (for example, within a home environment, within an office environment, or as a server farm), while in other embodiments, the processors  may be distributed across a number of locations.","While the embodiments are described with reference to various implementations and exploitations, it will be understood that these embodiments are illustrative and that the scope of claims provided below is not limited to the embodiments described herein. In general, the techniques and methodologies described herein may be implemented with facilities consistent with any hardware system or hardware systems defined herein. Many variations, modifications, additions, and improvements are possible.","Plural instances may be provided for components, operations, or structures described herein as a single instance. Finally, boundaries between various components, operations, and data stores are somewhat arbitrary, and particular operations are illustrated in the context of specific illustrative configurations. Other allocations of functionality are envisioned and may fall within the scope of the claims. In general, structures and functionality presented as separate components in the exemplary configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":["The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like references indicate similar elements and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 8"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
