No. 7,566,465.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to methods of treating and managing kinetoplastid infections by administering artemisimins and artelinic acid.","2. Brief Description of Related Art","Trypanosomiasis is a re-emerging [1-3] tropical infectious disease that poses a real challenge to public health countermeasures. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) [4], about 36 sub-Saharan countries in West, Central, and East Africa and some 22 Latin countries in Central and South America delimit its geographic prevalence zone, thus, leading to the establishment of two distinct manifestations of the disease: African trypanosomiasis and American trypanosomiasis.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"i":"Trypanosoma "},"American trypanosomiasis (\u201cChagas disease\u201d) occurs mainly in countries such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina [10,11]. Over 13 million persons in the Southern American region are at risk of infection and the annual incidence rates of the disease reaches 200,000 cases in 15 endemic countries [10]. The bloodstream protozoan 10-12] is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease.","Host-to-host transmission is mediated by blood-sucking triatomine bugs such as 11]. Moreover, blood transfusion and congenital transmission have been encountered, particularly, in humans [10]. These pathogens are all cyclically transmitted to mammalian hosts through the bite of haematophagus tsetse flies () [9] serving as vectors of the disease.","The consistent decimation of human populations and cattle by African trypanosomiasis has reached dramatic proportions and represents a social and economical obstacle for development [6,7]. In AAT, breeding animal losses are estimated to cost African farmers US$4.5 billion per year [8]. Bloodstream flagellated protozoan, members of the taxonomic genus , are incriminated as the causative agents [1-7]. and provoke human (\u201csleeping sickness\u201d) while and cause animal (\u201cnagana\u201d) [http:\/\/www.vet.uga.edu\/vpp\/gray_book\/FAD\/AAT.htm].","In the particular case of human African trypanosomiasis, the trypanosomes multiply in the blood and lymph glands of the infected persons, therefore, defining the first-stage of sleeping sickness [5,13]. The symptoms in this early stage are characterized by bouts of fever, headaches, skin itching, pain in the joints, gradual loss of weight, nausea and vomiting [6,9]. Later, in the second stage, the trypanosomes cross the blood-brain barrier and invade the central nervous system to cause sleeping sickness. Sleeping sickness is characterized by neurological disorders such as mental confusion, sensory disturbances and poor muscular coordination, and reversal of the circadian sleep\/wake cycle (insomnia in the night, drowsiness in the daytime) [5,9,13,14] hence, the nickname \u201csleeping sickness\u201d. In the absence of effective treatment, sleeping sickness invariably leads to death [3,6].","Control measures for African trypanosomiasis are directed either against the transmission vector through eradication of the tsetse fly, or against the causative pathogen, trypanosomes. Although vector control strategies had been effective in the past, they have been virtually abandoned because of their harmful effects on the environment [7]. Treatment of infected persons with the few available synthetic trypanocidal agents have shown significant drawbacks [15-17] related to high cost, host toxicity, limited oral bioavailability, and a requirement for hospitalization during the entire course of treatment. The emergence of drug resistance has also limited the choice and effectiveness of affordable agents in clinical use. Moreover, the type of treatment depends on the stage of the disease: hemolymphatic (first stage) or cerebral (second stage). Effectiveness in the second stage relies on the ability of the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach concentrations high enough to kill the infective trypanosome. The four trypanocidal drugs, shown below [5,6,13] that have been clinically used up-to-date against sleeping sickness are, in chronological order\u2014: Suramin (developed in 1921 against in the first-stage infection), Pentamidine (discovered in 1941 against first-stage infection), Melarsoprol (developed in 1949 against both human-infective subspecies in cerebral infection), and Difluoromethyl ornithine (developed in 1981 as an alternative to Melarsoprol treatment failure in cerebral sleeping sickness). and show the known trypanocidal drugs for early stage infection which are suramin and pentamidine, respectively. Suramin has no oral bioavailability and causes hemolysis and kidney disease. Pentamidine has no oral bioavailability, is an immunosuppressive and causes bleeding. and show the known trypanocidal drugs for cerebral infection which are melarsoprol and difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO), respectively. Melarsoprol has no oral bioavailability and causes tumors in the brain, blood in the urine and stomach pain. DFMO has no oral bioavailability and has a high susceptibility to resistance.","In the absence of prospective vaccine candidates for the disease, the limitations and drawbacks of these drugs emphasize the crucial need to develop new safe, effective and affordable drugs (trypanocides) against all forms of human and veterinary trypanosomiasis.","The Chinese plant has been used to treat malaria for centuries. Research in the past three decades have uncovered artemisinin derivatives like artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate that have played a critical role in the management of infectios caused by the multi-drug resistant malaria parasite, . Artemisinin has also been reported to be selectively active against cancer cells in vitro [39]. Utzinger et al. have demonstrated the use of artemisinin derivatives against tropical parasite species , responsible for schistosomiasis [40]. The effect of artemisinin and its derivatives on , another tropical parasite provoking leishmaniasis has also been reported [41]. However, the widespread use of this class of semi-synthetic artemisinin derivatives have been limited by the high cost of production, low bioavailability and long treatment regimens.","African, Asian and Amerindian societies have a rich tradition [17] in the use of plants for medical care. However, only few reports exist on the phytochemical treatment of sleeping sickness [17] and other kinetoplastid infections. Artemisinins have never before been used to treat human and veterinary trypanosomiasis. Until now, no experimental study has been carried out to establish the effectiveness of artemisinin or its derivatives on any species.","The inventors are the first report on the trypanocidal potency of artemisinin and by extension, artemisinin-derived compounds, including artelinic acid.","Therefore, an object of the invention is to prepare a pharmaceutical composition containing artemisinin lead compounds from natural resources for the treatment of trypanosomiasis. Medicinal plants such as have secondary metabolites of diverse molecular structures, physico-chemical properties, and pharmacological activities and offer an invaluable reservoir for new remedies.","Another object of the invention is to provide a cost effective treatment for kinetoplastid infections.","Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating humans and other mammals with kinetoplastid infections with artemisimin compounds such as artemisinin and artelinic acid.","Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.","The invention relates to the treatment of kintoplastid infections by administering a pharmaceutical composition containing an extract from the plant . The invention also relates to synthetic artemisinins that show improved efficacy in treating kinetoplastid infections. This invention also relates to a method of treating kintoplastid infections with artelinic acid and artemisinins.","The accompanying drawings show illustrative embodiments of the invention from which these and other of the objectives, novel features and advantages will be readily apparent.","The present invention relates to treatment of kinetoplasmid infections such as and with artemisinins such as artelinic acid and\/or trioxolane compounds.","The antimalarial activity of the artemisinins is believed to reside in the generation of toxic free oxygen radicals subsequent to the interaction with heme released from the metabolism of hemoglobin. The inventors have found that artemisinins and synthetic artemisinins, in particular, artelinic acid and trioxolane compounds, are effective in a method of treatment of kinetoplasmid infections, particularly against and ","The structural identity, and biological activity of compounds extracted from the medicinal plant \u201cPlant C-1\u201d was established. For these experiments, chromatographic techniques were used for total purification of the active principles. Various spectroscopic methods and conventional database analysis were also utilized for chemical structure elucidation. The identified candidates were subjected to standard bioassay protocols for in vitro characterization of their trypanocidal activity and also selective toxicity against trypanosomes versus mammalian host cells.","The extract of the plant was shown to kill parasited cultivated within mouse macrophages in vitro in a dose-dependant manner without significant toxicity to the mouse macrophages. The results were duplicated using commercially sourced artemisinin. The active compound in the compound was isolated and purified and chemically identified as artemisinin.","Materials and Methods","a.

The EtOH extracts were purified by organic solvent fractionation and a combination of chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange on a DIAION HP-20 column and hydrophobic interaction on an ODS column and gel filtration on a Sephadex column. The active fractions were then identified. The following experiment confirms that the compounds that were extracted are efficacious against kinetoplastid infection and are artemisinins.","b.

Trypanosome Stocks","Culture suspension of () was obtained from Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (Osaka University, Japan). Trypanosomes were subcultured in appropriate medium (see 5.1.2) as frequently as needed to avoid overgrowth, and maintained in culture flasks at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified, 5% COatmosphere incubator. In addition, parasite culture stabilates were prepared by suspending trypanosomes centrifugation (1500 rpm, room temperature, 3 min) pellet in 1 mL of a mixture of 77% (v\/v) trypanosome dilution buffer [56] and 33% (v\/v) glycerol. The whole volume was transferred into cryotubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. until further needed.","d. Culture Medium for ","The axenic cultivation of the bloodstream forms of was performed in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Gibco) supplemented with L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES buffer. Additionally, 15% heat-inactivated (56\u00b0 C., 40 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS, MultiSer) and also 0.05 mM bathocuproine disulfonic acid disodium salt (Dojin), 1.5 mM L-cystein (Nacalai), 1.0 mM hypoxanthine (Nacalai), 0.16 mM thymidine (TCI), 0.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate (Nacalai) were aseptically incorporated in the culture medium.","e. Trypanocidal Assay","All fractions obtained stepwise in the course of the separation process of the plant crude extracts were assessed for their in vitro activity against . Various concentrations of test samples were prepared in neat dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Wako\u2014for biochemical assay) then diluted in the culture medium so that DMSO content decreased to 10% in the medium. Trypanosomes were harvested at late exponential growth level, counted with a hemocytometer (Erma Tokyo 7059), and resuspended by appropriate dilution in culture medium for achieving a final density of 1\u00d710cells\/mL. Aliquots of 90 \u03bcL of suspension (1\u00d710cells\/mL) were transferred in wells of a Becton Dickinson 96-well microculture plate. Then, 10 \u03bcL of each sample preparation containing 10% DMSO were added to each inoculum well, achieving a final concentration of 1% DMSO. The microculture plate was incubated in a humidified, 5% COatmosphere incubator at 37\u00b0 C. After successively 24, 48, and 72 hr-incubations, parasites viability was determined by observing directly inside the wells of the microculture plate with an optical microscope (Injectoscope model IMT-YF\/Olympus). The in vitro trypanocidal potency of each sample was then evaluated and translated into mathematic symbols [(\u2212): \u226780% growth inhibition level, (\u00b1): \u226780% growth inhibition level, (+): 100% growth inhibition level]. Control wells with the commercial drug pentamidine (positive control) and the solvent DMSO only (negative control) were also achieved in the same conditions as the test samples. A blank (parasites only in culture medium) was also included for reference.","f. Culture Medium for HeLa S3 Cells","An axenic culture of human carcinoma HeLa S3 cell line was established in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (D-MEM, Sigma) supplemented with 4500 mg glucose\/L, L-glutamine, NaHCO, and pyridoxine HCl, to which 10% heat-inactivated (56\u00b0 C., 40 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS, MultiSer) was added.","g. Sample Preparation for Cytotoxic Evaluation In Vitro","Plant chromatographic fractions, which have shown potent trypanocidal activity in vitro, were selected for cytotoxicity assay. Previously dissolved in neat DMSO (Wako\u2014for biochemical assay), an aliquot of 10 \u03bcL of each test sample was diluted in 490 \u03bcL of the cell culture medium with the intent of decreasing the DMSO concentration to 2% in the medium.","h. Cytotoxicity Assay In Vitro","HeLa S3 cells maintained in culture dish (Sumilon) were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate saline buffer (\u2212) [DPBS (\u2212), Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd] after syphonating the culture medium. Adherent cells were released from their dish bottom substrate by adding trypsin (Nacalai) and gently tapping with hand on the round lateral side of the dish. Thus, trypsinized cells were harvested, suspended in culture medium then centrifuged at 800\u02dc1000 rpm for 3 min at room temperature. After removing the supernatant, the remaining pellet was resuspended in the culture medium. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer (Erma Tokyo 7059), and then diluted appropriately to achieve a final density of 1\u00d710cells\/mL in the culture medium. Later on, cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate (Becton Dickinson), each well containing 100 \u03bcL (1\u00d710cells\/mL) of cell suspension. Then, 100 \u03bcL of test samples preparation (see 5.2.2) were added in triplicate for each concentration into respective wells, thus achieving a final concentration of 1% DMSO. Respective triplicate wells for the positive control (mitomycin C) and the negative control (1% DMSO only in culture medium) were also included. After 72 hr-incubation at 37\u00b0 C. in a humidified, 5% COatmosphere incubator (Sanyo), 25 \u03bcL of MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide][57-59] reagent were added to each well including controls. The microtiter plate was returned in the same incubator for an additional 3 hr-exposure at 37\u00b0 C. to allow the formazan [57-59] crystals to accumulate. Then, supernatants were syphonated from the wells and 200 \u03bcL of DMSO were added to solubilize the formazan crystals. After shaking (MSI Minishaker IKA) for 3-5 min, the absorbance in each well was measured at 540 nm in a microtiter plate reader (ImmunoMini NJ-2300). The percentage of cytotoxicity (growth inhibition level) was calculated as (A\u2212B)\/A\u00d7100, where A is the mean optical density of negative control wells and B is the mean optical density of test sample wells.","i. Bioassay-Guided Isolation of Active Constituents of Artemisinin","Dried and pulverized powder from \u201cplant C-1\u201d (2.3 kg) were extracted three times with 80% ethanol after 24-hr maceration (first time) and 3-hr maceration (second and third time) at room temperature. The liquid extracts were combined, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator below 30\u00b0 C. The ethanolic residue (240 g) obtained exhibited a complete inhibition of trypanosomes growth at 30 \u03bcg\/mL after 24-hr exposure and 100% growth inhibition in vitro against at 100 \u03bcg\/mL after 24-hr exposure. This residue was later on dissolved in double-distilled water, then subjected to solvent-solvent partition in EtOAc and n-BuOH to yield, after solvent evaporation, 72 g of EtOAc extract, 74 g of n-BuOH extract, and 94 g of HO extract. The strongest trypanocidal activity in vitro was observed in the EtOAc extract exhibiting 100% and \u226780% growth inhibition against , respectively, at the concentrations of 50 \u03bcg\/mL and 5 \u03bcg\/mL after 24 hr-exposure. This most potent EtOAc residue was applied to SiOgel column and eluted successively with binary solvent mixtures of hexane: EtOAc=4:1\u21921:1\u21921:1.5\u21921:2\u2192100% MeOH. The eluted fractions were monitored by normal phase TLC and similar fractions were pooled into five main fractions named A (280 mg), B (341 mg), C (1.72 g), D (1.84 g), and E (690 mg). Among them, fraction C was the only one that showed trypanocidal activity until the low concentration value of 1 \u03bcg\/mL, thus featuring \u226780% growth inhibition after 24-hr incubation. Further separation of fraction C carried out by reversed-phase ODS column chromatography and eluting gradually with 60% MeOH\u219280% MeOH\u219290% MeOH\u2192100% MeOH yielded seven fractions named from C-1 to C-7. Fractions C-4 (629 mg), C-5 (16 mg), and C-6 (139 mg) showed the highest biological potency and an encouraging selectivity toward HeLa cell in vitro at 0.5 \u03bcg\/mL with, respectively, 100% trypanocidal level and 5.5% cytotoxic level for C-4, \u226780% trypanocidal level and 10.5% cytotoxic level for C-5, and \u226780% trypanocidal level and 14.9% cytotoxic level for C-6.","Firstly, C-4 was subjected to final purification with HPLC (column: 5 SL-II type Waters, 10\u00d7250 mm i.d.; flow rate: 3.0 mL\/min; detection: refractive index detector at range 512; eluent: hexane\/EtOAC=8\/1) leading to isolation of C-46 (7.1 mg) at a tof 21.27 min (), whose trypanocidal activity in vitro was \u226780% growth inhibition after 24-hr incubation and the cytotoxic level in vitro was 17.3% at 1 \u03bcg\/mL. Secondly, C-5 was purified by normal phase HPLC (column: 5 SL-II type Waters, 10\u00d7250 mm i.d.; flow rate: 3.0 mL\/min; detection: refractive index detector at range 512; eluent: hexane\/EtOAC=7\/1) affording C-53 (1.1 mg) at t=12.99 min (). Because of the small amount yielded by C-53, extensive spectral data measurement was inconvenient. Only H-NMR data could be obtained. Thus, purification was repeated starting off with a larger quantity of EtOAc extract. Fortunately, 11.0 mg of C-53 were obtained. According to the bioassay outcome, C-53 showed \u226780% growth inhibition in vitro against after 24-hr incubation at 1 \u03bcg\/mL, and only 3.1% inhibition ratio against HeLa cells in vitro at 5 \u03bcg\/mL.","j. Chemical Structure of C-46","Comparison of H- and C-NMR, H-H COSY, HMBC, FAB-MS, and specific rotation data in our hands with those reported in the literature [34,35] led to conclusion that C-46 was (+)-artemisinin ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"sup":["1","13","+","+","+","24"],"sub":["D","3","15","22","5"]},"k. Chemical Structure of C-53","Relevant H- and C-NMR, H-H COSY, HMQC, HMBC, NOESY, FAB-MS, and HRFAB-MS data were recorded; the specific rotation value was calculated.","C-53 has trypanocidal potency in vitro but is slightly weaker than that of (+)-artemisinin. Nevertheless, from its chemical characterization, 1D- and 2D-NMR, FAB- and HRFAB-MS, and specific rotation data that have been collected, spectral data analysis reveals that C-53 might be polyalicyclic; containing three characteristic methyl substituents and an unsaturated lactone ring; displaying a molecular weight of 234 associated to the chemical formula CHO. Accordingly, C-53 is presumed to be a sesquiterpene lactone congenere of artemisinin, but obviously lacking the endoperoxide bridge. This activity is of more general interest because the mechanism of action of artemisinins, as an anti-plasmodial or anti-tumoricidal agent, is believed by some to be related to the presence of the endoperoxide bridge.","The information obtained by careful examination of C-53 and C46 as well as other eluted compounds in the above experiment verify that artemisinins are active ingredients in that hinder the growth of kintoplastid infections.","Both compounds Artemisinin and Artelinic acid belong to the same class of compounds and both have been found by the inventors in testing to be effective against leishmaniasis and other kinteplastid infections.","Preliminary drug screening (in vitro amastigote\/macrophage culture) of artemisinin and artelinic acid compounds.","Four compounds were obtained.","BN: 97471 artelinic acid","ZW: 60909 dihydroartemisinin","BN: BL 48816WR#255131 (Beta-Arteether)","BN: BL 50129 WR#: 249309 (Artemisinin QHS)","The four compounds were dissolved in the respective solvents as indicated in the table below (Table 1) and were tested against major ATCC 50122 amastigotes in vitro in a mouse macrophage system.

However, similar changes were also noted in the negative control that had no compound added. The effectiveness of the WRAIR compounds tested in the screen was judged to be: Artelinic acid>>>Dihydroartemisinin>Beta Arteether>>Artemisinin.","Because of the high potency of Artelinic acid relative to the other compounds, the experiments were repeated with different doses of Artelinic acid alone. Additionally, the addition of drug to culture wells q4h did not seem to affect the results for this compound (Table 2). Hence, Artelinic acid was added once in the dose response experiments (Table 3).","The initial observation implicating Artemisinins was obtained with crude extracts from the plant (. On the strength of these results Artemisinin-derived compounds that had been synthesized previously as potential anti-malarials were secured from the WRAIR inventory and tested (See U.S. Pat.
