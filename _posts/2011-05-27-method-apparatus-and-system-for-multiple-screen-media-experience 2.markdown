title: Method, apparatus and system for multiple screen media experience
abstract: A current programming channel, and the content thereon, being displayed on a primary display device are tracked. Web content related to the content being displayed on the primary display device is searched and the resulting data is made available to a user on at least one secondary display device via a user interface. The results of the search are made available to a user such that when data resulting from the search is selected for display on the at least one secondary display device, the data is displayed on the at least one secondary display device without interfering with a display of content on the primary display device. In the event of a change of the programming channel or the content thereon, a new search is initiated for data related to content being currently viewed.

In addition, peripheral devices that hook up to televisions and provide on-screen interactivity have also been deployed. Such, interactivity with the internet and peripheral devices on the primary television screen, however, has a number of disadvantages including visual interference with the primary content and awkward interface mechanisms.","In today's market, TV viewers are often surrounded by \u201csecond screen\u201d devices such as laptops, netbooks, smartphones, and tablets that feature rich user interface capabilities and internet connectivity. Today, however, these devices are disconnected from the television viewing experience.","Embodiments of the present invention address the deficiencies of the prior art by providing a method, apparatus and system for multiple screen media experience.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for providing a multiple screen media experience that does not interfere with content being viewed on a primary display device includes tracking content being displayed on a primary display device, searching for data accessible via the Internet related to the content being displayed on the primary display device and providing, on at least one secondary display device, access to data found resulting from the search. In various embodiments of the present invention, results of a search and content found as a result of a search selected for display on the at least one secondary display device are displayed on the at least one secondary display device without interfering with a display of content on the primary display device.","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for providing a multiple screen content experience includes a tuner for receiving and tuning programming content, a processor for tracking content being displayed on a primary display device and a web service for, in conjunction with the processor, searching for data accessible via the Internet related to the content being displayed on the primary display device and making accessible on at least one secondary display device, the data found as a result of the search.","In an alternate embodiment of the present invention a system for providing a multiple screen content experience includes a primary display device for displaying received content, at least one secondary display device for displaying content related to the content being displayed on the primary display device without interfering with a display of content on the primary display device, a web service for providing access to data accessible via the Internet and an apparatus including a tuner for receiving content and a processor for tracking content being displayed on the primary display device and for, in conjunction with the web service, searching for data accessible via the Internet related to the content being displayed on the primary display device and making accessible on the at least one secondary display device, the data found as a result of the search.","It should be understood that the drawings are for purposes of illustrating the concepts of the invention and are not necessarily the only possible configuration for illustrating the invention. To facilitate understanding, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements that are common to the figures.","Embodiment of the present invention advantageously provides a method, apparatus and system for multiple screen media experience. Although the present invention will be described primarily within the context of a providing auxiliary content related to main content on a television on a second screen device, the specific embodiments of the present invention should not be treated as limiting the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art and informed by the teachings of the present invention that the concepts of the present invention can be advantageously applied to the presentation of main content on any screen device and the presentation of auxiliary content on more than a second screen device.","The functions of the various elements shown in the figures can be provided through the use of dedicated hardware as well as hardware capable of executing software in association with appropriate software. When provided by a processor, the functions can be provided by a single dedicated processor, by a single shared processor, or by a plurality of individual processors, some of which can be shared. Moreover, explicit use of the term \u201cprocessor\u201d or \u201ccontroller\u201d should not be construed to refer exclusively to hardware capable of executing software, and can implicitly include, without limitation, digital signal processor (\u201cDSP\u201d) hardware, read-only memory (\u201cROM\u201d) for storing software, random access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d), and non-volatile storage.

Similarly, it will be appreciated that any flow charts, flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, pseudocode, and the like represent various processes which may be substantially represented in computer readable media and so executed by a computer or processor, whether or not such computer or processor is explicitly shown.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","115","120","125","130"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","215","220","225","240","240","242","244"]},"The set-top box of  further illustratively includes an enhanced electronic service guide (ESG) server  including a web service  and a guide update process  including a database .  further illustrates an Internet  for intercommunicating information and content with the set-top box .","Although, in , the ESG server  is depicted as an integrated component of the set-top box , in alternate embodiments of the present invention, given the volume of web searches required to locate related data for the secondary screens of the various embodiments of the present invention and the time required to perform these searches, a central server (not shown) containing a complete ESG database is used versus an integrated component of a set-top box as depicted in . A central server of the present invention would perform the required searches for the related data, such as data related to an ESG associated with a program\/content being displayed on a main screen, cache the results to a database, and then provide the data to a secondary screen device\/service platform running on a set-top box, such as the set-top box  of . In such an embodiment, related data\/ESG data is exposed over HTTP via a REST\/JSON interface. For the database cache, the sqlalchemy database library is used for flexibility of connecting to sqlite or MySQL as database backends. In one such embodiment, the standard ESG is downloaded overnight for each day and used to perform the web searches to populate enhanced ESG data as described below.","In the various embodiments of the present invention, multiple screen devices , ,  are used to provide an enhanced television viewing experience. In one embodiment, the set-top box  is utilized to provide services and access content accessible to the multiple screen devices , , . The multiple screen devices , ,  of the present invention provide displays for viewing information and additional content without obscuring primary television screen content. The secondary screen devices ,  outside of the primary screen device  can also provide user interface opportunities via mouse, keyboard, touch screen, etc. A primary program (e.g., a television channel) is displayed on a primary screen and content related to or associated with the primary program is made available to the user on a secondary screen, in one embodiment, via a web interface, such as the web service  of , which can be customized to take advantage of second screen device characteristics.","In recent years, set-top boxes have become more sophisticated featuring fast general purpose processors, large hard drives (for storing DVR content), advanced operating systems, and network connectivity. Optimal integration between primary and secondary screen devices requires access to the available channel lineup, electronic service guide, currently tuned channel, and tuning\/playback capabilities\u2014all offered by set-top boxes as part of their central functionality.","In the various embodiments of the present invention, the set-top box is aware of what program is currently tuned, can tune to different programs, has access to the electronic service guide (ESG) applicable to a user's available programming, and has a processor, a memory, and network connectivity capabilities approaching that of desktop computers as described above with reference to the embodiment of . As depicted in the embodiment of , by embedding web server capabilities in the set-top box , the capabilities of the various embodiments of the present invention can be made available to off-the-shelf second screen devices on a home network of the present invention via HTTP using, in one embodiment, standard web programming paradigms such as HTML\/Javascript and REST\/JSON as depicted in . A factor that can affect the effectiveness of the various embodiments of the present invention is the quality of data available to a user and, as such, the system of the embodiment of  includes an ESG server  containing a database  of program information enhanced by web content accessed via the web service .","For example, the web is filled with vast information about television programming but today this experience is disconnected for the user. In current systems, in order to retrieve information on the web\/Internet, a user must determine what program they are currently viewing, open a web browser, type in appropriate information for a search, and then manually work through the search engine results to find relevant information. In various embodiments of the present invention, a user viewing experience is improved by automating the search for content on the web\/Internet. In one embodiment of the present invention, a user is provided with a local network URL that connects to a web server running on the set-top box. Connecting to this URL initiates a search for related content on the web\/Internet based on the current channel and program being viewed. In such an embodiment of the present invention, the user is presented with an HTML page that displays the results of the search.","In various embodiments of the present invention, a current programming channel and the content thereon is tracked such that when the user changes the channel or the content being displayed on a channel changes, the HTML page is automatically refreshed with related content for the program currently being viewed. The user thus has immediate access to a variety of web content sources related to the current program such as an official web site if available, Wikipedia page, Internet Movie Database (IMDb) page, streaming content providers, web images, Twitter discussions and the like.","In one embodiment of the present invention, related\/associated content results are displayed in a web page with a tabbed format\u2014a familiar user interface paradigm. For example,  depicts a screenshot of an exemplary related content browser interface in a web page format having a tabbed format in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in , a secondary screen can be used to provide a user with access to information related to a program being watched on a primary screen. In the embodiment of , the content being viewed on a primary screen is Star Trek, Enterprise, Sleeping Dogs on the SyFy channel.  depicts the related available content on a secondary screen in a web page with a tabbed format. As depicted in , access to an official web site, StarTrek.com, is made available on a secondary screen and further access to Wikipedia, the Web, related images, IMDb, Twitter, an associated network (illustratively NBC Universal), and a channel guide. In the embodiment of , a user is given an icon to share the information received on a social network such as Facebook. As depicted in , other available related information can be accessed using such tabs as news, features, series and movies, library, community, gaming and access to stores for purchasing related goods.","In alternate embodiments of the present invention related information can be presented to a user in a \u2018screensaver\u2019 mode whereby the related content areas are automatically iterated through for display to the user as a slideshow. Such display modes emphasize active versus passive information consumption. As opposed to prior art solutions, embodiments of the present invention provide a user a non-linear approach to content\/guide exploration. Secondary screen capabilities of various embodiments of the present invention provide a non-linear approach to guide content that can exploit the state of the art in clustering algorithms and data visualization. In contrast, conventional on-screen guide involves a simple linear listing of programs in a two-dimensional grid with channel and time as axes. Such a guide is common given the ease of implementation and ease of navigation by remote. The information included in typical electronic service guide data is limited and includes only the information required for on-screen television display such as title, subtitle, a brief description, category\/genre, content rating, top credits for some programs, and schedule information (time and channel). This data satisfies the requirements of the typical linear program guide and allows for simple search by name or category but is suboptimal for the enhanced display and interface capabilities of the various embodiments of the present invention.","In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an ESG is augmented with data that is obtained from the Internet using, for example, web searches. For example, Table 1 below compares examples of information offered by standard ESG data versus data that is located and displayed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention in an exemplary enhanced ESG.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Standard ESG","Enhanced ESG"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Title","Representative Images"]},{"entry":[{},"Subtitle","Official Website"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel","Extended Description"]},{"entry":[{},"Start Time\/End",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Time","Extended Cast\/Credits"]},{"entry":[{},{},"3rd party streaming"]},{"entry":[{},"Description","providers"]},{"entry":[{},"New\/Repeat","Netflix, Hulu, etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Broadcast","3rd party physical"]},{"entry":[{},"Technical","media"]},{"entry":[{},"Stereo, HD,","Netflix, Amazon,"]},{"entry":[{},"CC, etc.","etc."]},{"entry":[{},{},"3rd party information"]},{"entry":[{},"Series\/Episode Info ","providers"]},{"entry":[{},"Content","Wikipedia, IMDb,"]},{"entry":[{},"Rating\/Advisories","etc."]},{"entry":[{},"Critic Rating","Web Search Results"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Web Image Search"]},{"entry":[{},"Category\/Genre","Results"]},{"entry":[{},"Cast\/Credits","User Ratings\/Reviews"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"In various embodiments of the present invention, an attempt is made to locate an official web site for a main content\/program being viewed or for information related to the main content\/program. In many cases, such information can be pulled from Wikipedia data for a program and, if not, an attempt is made to identify an official site through the search interfaces. In order to maximize search results, in one embodiment a fallback mechanism is employed by which narrow program searches are attempted first followed by progressively wider searches. For example, in the case of an episode of a television series, the specific episode is first searched for and, if not found, the search is broadened to the specific series and, if not found, the search is broadened to the television channel that the episode is airing on. Such a search model improves the user experience by ensuring that in most cases some related content for a given program is available on the secondary screen. The inventors have determined that a high availability of web information is available for a given program using the fallback approach of the present invention. For example, table 2 gives search results of web information coverage for 2,080 programs in an ESG from a day's worth of programming from a local cable provider.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 2"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{},{},{},"Official"]},{"entry":[{},{},"Wikipedia","IMDb","Website"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Count","2,071","1,549","1,966"]},{"entry":[{},"%","99.6%","74.5%","94.5%"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"In various embodiments of the present invention, links to available streaming content are searched to provide related content to a user.
