No. 09\/688,909, entitled by Greg W. Drake, inventor, filed on 16 Oct. 2000.","This invention relates to energetic ionic salts and methods for preparing same.","Prominent in the field of monopropellants in hydrazine, a highly toxic material, for which a replacement is being sought. Hydrazine's largest inherent drawback, is its considerable vapor pressure at ambient temperature of approximately 12-14 torr, which leads to a high vapor toxicity. This results in high handling and transfer costs in its use in satellite control devices. A current branch of research of the USAF, is the synthesis and use of new low melting energetic salts either alone or as mixtures with other well-known energetic materials, as new monopropellant materials. These salts offer several inherent advantages over materials such as hydrazine and high concentration hydrogen peroxide, including negligible vapor pressure and significantly improved densities. These properties should make these new materials very appealing to space missions for both government and private interests.","The search for new energetic materials having applications as monopropellant ingredients and\/or new fuels is an ongoing research endeavor. Much effort has been applied to find new low melting salts having many inherent advantages over neutral materials such as hydrazine. These advantages include negligible vapor pressure at working conditions as well as much improved densities, usually on the order of 50% or greater. These advantages become apparent in the handling, storage, and lifetime of the device employing the propellant material.","Ionic liquids are known and discussed in two recent patent applications, U.S. Patent Application Publication #2002\/0015883 entitled \u201cIonic liquids\u201d by Hilarius et al, dated Feb. 7, 2002 and Schmidt et al, U.S. Patent Application Publication #2002\/0015884 entitled \u201cIonic liquids II\u201d, dated Feb. 7, 2002. However, none of these references have the newly claimed ionic liquid salts of the present invention as disclosed below nor do they make claims for new energetic materials or new fuels for their systems.","Accordingly, there is need and market for energetic materials of minimized vapor toxicity that overcome the above prior art shortcomings.","There has now been discovered energetic compositions of low vapor toxicity with enhanced stability and performance and method for making same.","Broadly the invention provides a) a method for making improved ionic halide salts and b) a method for making energetic ionic salts in high yield and purity from precursor ionic halide salts as more fully discussed below. Also provided are the resulting novel salts from the above methods.","The synthesis of newly invented 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium energetic salts is described as follows. A large family of energetic salts has been synthesized in high yield and high purity using commonly available starting materials. The reaction of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole with alkyl halides in polar aprotic solvents yields 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salts. This reaction is not novel, it was described for the synthesis of several 1-n-alkyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halides by Scriven, Keay, Goe, and Astleford (1989, 54, 731). However, in their synthesis, they generally used only one equivalent of n-alkyl halide to one equivalent of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole.","However, it has been found that if the experiment is run with excess alkyl halide, n>2, most desirable 2-4 mole equivalents, the 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salt can be recovered in essentially quantitative yield, usually as highly crystalline substances, with no contamination with 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

Similarly, the substituted ammonium cations can be attached to a polymer backbone as represented by the well known class of ion exchange resins such as the commercially available DOWEX\u2122 resins.","As for the E\u2212 anion, those skilled in the art will realize that any anion which carries a relatively high oxygen content and or high nitrogen content and\/or having a high heat of formation including but not limited to nitrate (NO), perchlorate (ClO), dinitramide (N(NO)), nitroformate (C(NO)), nitrocyanamide N(NO)(CN), dicyanamide (N(CN)), 5-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrazoloate, 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazolate, 3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazolate, 2,4,5-trinitro-1,3-imidazolate, bitetrazolate, bitetrazolylamide, perchlorylamide(N\u2014ClO), 2-oxo-5-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrazolate, and 1-oxo-3,5-dinitro-1,2,4-triazolate.","For those skilled in the art, it will be realized that the reactions will be carried out best in polar solvent systems due to the solubility and nature of the reagents. What is meant by polar solvents are solvents that have a natural dipole and a reasonable dielectric constant and can dissolve like materials. Examples include but are not limited to acetonitrile lower weight alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol and n-butanol, nitromethane, cyanothane, dimethylsulfoxide, and mixtures thereof.","Thus, a new family of low melting salts called ionic salts or liquids has been uncovered and their synthesis routes are facile, high yield and lead to high purity products made from readily available materials with simple experimental means. The salts of the invention preferably melt below 100\u00b0 C. and thus are ionic liquids.","These new energetic salts have relatively low melting points yet still have long liquid ranges before decomposition. All of the product salts are soluble in polar solvents such as isopropanol, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, as well as water. They are new members of the well known class of materials described as ionic liquids. These materials have several inherent advantages over conventional energetic materials. The new materials being salts have no vapor pressure at ambient temperatures, results in enhanced safety properties, most notable being lessened toxicity and highly reduced flammability. As new propellant materials, they can serve as energetic ingredients in monopropellants or as new fuels in bipropellant scenarios. In the case where the new salts might be used as a fuel, they have several inherent advantages over conventional fuels. They have densities ranging from 1.30 g\/cmto almost 1.60 g\/cm, which are from 60 to 100% greater than hydrocarbon based materials. Secondly, the materials have essentially no vapor pressure, which leads to much easier handling and significantly lowered flammability. These properties make these new materials much more attractive as new fuels and\/or monopropellant ingredients.","The following Examples serve to illustrate the invention but should not be construed in limitation thereof.","In a 125 ml Erlenmeyer flask, 0.6690 g, 3.2 mmoles of 1-ethanol-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium bromide was dissolved in 25 ml of fresh methanol and stirred vigorously.

It can easily be observed by one skilled in the art that simple substitutions of the cation used in the energetic salt metathesis (aforementioned reaction 2) could be used, based mainly on solubilities of the resultant salts, whereby the corresponding formed halide salt of the cation would have little or no solubility in the reaction medium, making separation of the product from the simple halide salt easy. The resultant salts have many possibilities in their utility, most namely that as energetic ingredients to be used as materials in liquid propellant materials whether it be in a monopropellant scenario or as a fuel or oxidizer in a bipropellant scenario. The intermediates, namely the halide salts of 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole can be very useful intermediates in the syntheses of many triazole based systems, since only the one position, namely the number one nitrogen atom of the 1,2,4-triazole ring system is substituted in high yield and purity. The new invention is a marked improvement over the literature preparatory route (see Scriven, Keay, Goe, and Astleford in 1989, 54, 731) which uses only a one to one ratio of reactants (alkyl bromides), or uses chloroalkanes which are much less reactive, both of which lead to contamination of the final product with the starting material 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole, making separation difficult.","Thus the invention provides an improved synthesis route to 1-substituted 4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salts by reacting excess organic substituted halide, where excess organic substituted halide is n>2 and most useful from 2 to 5 mole equivalents of organic substituted halide with 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole, which results in high purity, high yield of the desired products in polar solvents at temperatures under 100\u00b0 C., e.g., ranging from ambient temperature to about 80\u00b0 C. The new route allows for easy separation of the 1-organic substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salts in high yield and purity.","The invention also provides for the formation of new ionic liquids based upon 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium salts, including a new class of ionic liquids where the anion can be chosen from several energetic species found in readily available salts to yield 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium energetic salts in high yield and purity.","Accordingly, a new family of salts has been synthesized in high yield and purity from commercially available starting materials. 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium salts have been synthesized through the reaction of n moles (n>2) of an organic halide material with 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole in polar solvents such as acetonitrile or isopropyl alcohol. The new 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium salts (halide salts) are covered in high yields as well as in high purity, with no contamination evident from the starting materials. The new 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salts are crystalline materials with melting points below 100\u00b0 C. These 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium halide salts can be reacted cleanly with silver salts of energetic anions, such as nitrate, perchlorate & nitrocyanamide, to yield highly energetic, low melting 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium salts in high yields and high purities, which are easily separated from the reaction mixture. These new salts have high thermal stability and should have application as new fuels, monopropellants, electrolytes, gun propellants, and gas generators.","Also, these new salts can be used as propellant ingredients, low melting casting agents for explosives and warheads, monopropellant ingredients, gun propellants, plasticizers for explosives and propellants, in mixtures with other well known energetic materials including, ammonium nitrate, ammonium perchlorate, ammonium dinitramide hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN), hydrolylammonium perchlorate, hydroxylammonium dinitramide (HADN) and hydrazinium nitrate. These new materials can have application as new electrolytes for batteries for military applications.","Commercial applications of the inventive salts are similar to the uses listed above. Also, these salts, most notably the halide salts of 1-substituted-4-amino-1,2,4-triazolium cations, are excellent synthons for certain triazoles used in the pharmaceutical industry, as the nitrogen in position 1 of the 1,2,4-triazole ring is substituted cleanly, in high yield and purity, without contamination from the starting materials and can be recovered as a highly crystalline salt."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
