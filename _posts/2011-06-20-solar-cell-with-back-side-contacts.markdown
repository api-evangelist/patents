{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/914,441, filed on Oct. 28, 2010, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/933,458, filed on Nov. 1, 2007. This application is additionally a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/957,082, filed on Nov. 30, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,329,5003 which is also a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11\/933,458, filed on Nov. 1, 2007. The entireties of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.","This invention was developed under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000 between Sandia Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","As concerns continue to mount with respect to carbon emissions associated with conventional electric power generation systems, additional funding and research has been undertaken with respect to systems that use renewable energy resources, such as solar power, wind power, geothermal energy, and the like. With more particularity regarding solar cells, such solar cells are designed to convert at least a portion of available light into electrical energy. Solar cells are generally based upon semi-conductor physics, wherein a solar cell comprises a PN junction photodiode with a light sensitive area. The photovoltaic effect, which causes a solar cell to convert light directly into electrical energy, occurs inside a semiconductor material where light knocks off electrons. Because of the structure of the cell, there is an induced field that causes the electrons to flow in one direction and collect at the terminals. The structure of the solar cell is based in a PN junction composed of two layers: a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor. The interface where the two join is referred to as a junction.","For enhanced performance in GaAs solar cells, two additional layers, which are electrical contact layers, are also present. These contact layers enhance electric current that flows out of and into the solar cell. In conventional designs for solar cells that include compound semiconductors, the electrical contact layers reside on opposing sides of solar cells (a front side and a back side, respectively). The front side of the cell is the side that is configured to be directed towards a light source (the Sun) to receive radiation. Typically, the electrical contact layer on the front side of the cell is formed in a grid-like pattern, which includes a plurality of metallic fingers that are manufactured to be as small as possible so as to limit blockage of light prior to the light reaching the absorber region. The electrical contact layer on the back side of the solar cell generally covers the entire back side of the solar cell.","Manufacturing a solar cell with all backside contacts has been extensively explored, particularly for silicon solar cells. This type of solar cell has the advantage of all metallization residing on the back of the cell, giving the opportunity to independently optimize the front and back of the cell for optical and electrical performance, respectively. Back contacted solar cells are ideal for concentration applications, and researchers have been able to create 27.5% efficient silicon cells under 100 suns. Silicon, however, is an indirect band gap semiconductor, which requires a thick layer of material to absorb the solar spectrum. Currently, manufacture of an efficient all-back side solar cell that includes compound semiconductors has not been achieved.","The following is a brief summary of subject matter that is described in greater detail herein. This summary is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the claims.","Described herein are various technologies pertaining to a solar cell that comprises a compound semiconductor with all back side electrical contacts. That is, both a positive electrical contact and a negative electrical contact reside on the same side of the solar cell that comprises the compound semiconductor. Pursuant to an example, the compound semiconductor can be gallium arsenide (GaAs). The solar cell comprises the two absorbing layers: the p-type semiconductor layer and the n-type semiconductor layer. A PN junction is created where the two layers meet. As a described above, the p-type semiconductor and the n-type semiconductor can be made of GaAs. Furthermore, the solar cell can comprise confinement layers that surround the absorbing layers. As used herein, the term \u201cconfinement layer\u201d is intended to encompass a window layer or passivating layer, while the absorbing layers can be collectively referred to herein as an absorbing layer. Thus, the absorbing layer resides between a first confinement layer and a second confinement layer. In the solar cell described herein, the electrical contacts are made at the respective confinement layers or beyond rather than at the absorbing layer.","The solar cell can be manufactured by growing a plurality of layers by way of epitaxy on a GaAs wafer. In an example, a buffer layer may be grown on the GaAs wafer, followed by a release layer, which may be composed of aluminum arsenide (AlAs). A first confinement layer, which may be, for instance, gallium indium phosphorus (GaInP), can be grown on the release layer using epitaxy. An n-doped layer of GaAs may then be grown on top of the first confinement layer followed by a p-doped layer of GaAs, thereby creating the PN junction. A second GaInP confinement layer may be grown by epitaxy on the p-doped GaAs layer, and a GaAs p-doped contact layer may be grown on the second confinement layer. Selective etching may then be employed on this stack of compound semiconductors to reach the first confinement layer (that resides beneath the n-doped GaAs layer). A metallization step may then be undertaken to coat the cell with metal, and etching can be employed to pattern the metal to create metal contact pads on the first confinement layer and the GaAs p-doped contact layer. A similar technique may be used to create the metal pads contacting the second confinement layer. The metal contact pads may comprise gold or silver. Following the placing of the metal contact pads thereon, the solar cell can be released from the wafer by placing the GaAs wafer in a particular solution (such as Hydrofluoric Acid) that selectively etches the release layer from the wafer, thereby freeing the cell from the wafer. The wafer may then be reused in the manufacturing of other solar cells.","Other aspects will be appreciated upon reading and understanding the attached Figs. and description.","Various technologies pertaining to a solar cell that comprises compound semiconductors (e.g., a III-V solar cell) will now be described with reference to the drawings, where like reference numerals represent like elements throughout. Additionally, as used herein, the term \u201cexemplary\u201d is intended to mean serving as an illustration or example of something, and is not intended to indicate a preference. Further, as used herein, the term \u201capproximately\u201d is intended to encompass values within fifteen percent of a specified value.","Described herein is a relatively small solar cell, wherein microsystem tools are utilized to manufacture such solar cell. The cell has few, if any, shading effects, thereby allowing more light to reach absorbing layers of the solar cell. The cell includes all back-side contacts, thereby increasing ease in which the solar cell is packaged and interconnected with other solar cells in a solar panel. For example, connecting several of the cells described herein in series may allow high voltages in small areas. The metal stack survives acid etches to release the cell from a wafer, and the cell can be used by itself or stacked with other cells in unique configurations and small form factors.","With reference now to , an exemplary solar cell  that comprises a plurality of layers of compound semiconductors is illustrated. For instance, the compound semiconductors may be III-V semiconductors. The solar cell  has a front side  and a back side  that is opposite the front side . In operation, the solar cell  is positioned such that light is received through the front side  of the solar cell . In an exemplary embodiment, the solar cell  comprises a transparent packaging layer  that is composed of a transparent material such as glass, a clear plastic film, or the like. The packaging layer  is configured to allow light to be received by semiconductor layers in the solar cell  while protecting the solar cell  from exterior influences, such as weather, abrasive elements, or the like.","The exemplary solar cell  additionally comprises a first confinement layer  that is positioned directly above (immediately adjacent to) the packaging layer . Pursuant to an example, the first confinement layer  may be approximately 1 micrometer in thickness. Additionally, pursuant to an example, the first confinement layer  may be composed of the compound semiconductor gallium indium phosphorus (GaInP).","The exemplary solar cell  further comprises an n-type semiconductor layer . For instance, the n-type semiconductor layer  may be composed of a compound semiconductor such as gallium arsenide (GaAs). Furthermore, the n-type semiconductor layer  may be approximately 100 nm in thickness with a density of charge carriers of approximately 1\u00d710\/cm.","The solar cell  further comprises a p-type semiconductor layer  that is grown on the n-type semiconductor layer  through, for instance, epitaxy. The p-type semiconductor layer  may be composed of a compound semiconductor such as p-doped GaAs. For instance, the p-type semiconductor layer  may be approximately 1.6 micrometers thick, with a density of charge carriers of approximately 1-5\u00d710\/cm. A pn junction is created at the intersection of the n-type semiconductor layer  and the p-type semiconductor layer. As can be ascertained, the pn junction extends across the solar cell  substantially parallel to the front side  and the back side . The combination of the n-type semiconductor layer  and the p-type semiconductor layer  (and thus the PN junction) can be collectively referred to as an absorbing layer of the solar cell .","A second confinement layer  is positioned immediately above the p-type semiconductor layer . The second confinement layer  may be composed of GaInP, and may be approximately 25 nm thick. Additionally, the density of charge carriers of the second confinement layer  may be approximately the same as the density of charge carriers of the first confinement layer .","The solar cell  can further comprise a p-doped contact layer  that can be grown by way of epitaxy on the second confinement layer . In an example, the contact layer  may be composed of a GaAs semiconductor that is approximately 0.50 nm thick.","The exemplary solar cell  additionally comprises a metallic positive contact pad  that is placed upon the contact layer . For instance, the positive contact pad  can be composed of a first layer of chromium followed by a layer of gold. In an example, the chromium layer may be approximately 10 nm thick, and the layer of gold may be approximately 100 nm thick. It is to be understood that the positive contact pad  is placed on the contact layer , but can alternatively be placed on the second confinement layer . However, as can be ascertained, the positive contact pad  is not placed on the absorbing layer of the solar cell . Instead, the positive contact pad  is placed on what is known in the art as a passivating layer or a window layer (which can be the contact layer  and\/or the second confinement layer ).","The exemplary solar cell  further comprises a negative contact pad , which as shown in , can extend around the periphery of the solar cell . The negative contact pad  may again be composed of a conductive metal such as, for instance, a combination of chromium and gold. For example, the negative contact pad  may be composed of approximately 10 nm of chromium (to enhance adhesion) followed by 100 nm of gold. As shown, the negative contact pad  extends from the first confinement layer , rather than the absorbing layer of the solar cell . In alternative embodiments, the negative contact pad  may be contacting layers further from the absorbing layer of the solar cell  (e.g., additional semiconductor compounds can be grown beneath the confinement layer ).","The exemplary solar cell  may be used in a variety of applications for generating electrical power. For instance, the solar cell  may be placed proximate to a concentrating lens that concentrates solar radiation on the front side  of the solar cell . In another exemplary embodiment, the solar cell  may be placed on a consumer device, such as a mobile telephone, a mobile gaming apparatus, a tablet computing device, or the like for generating electrical power for such a device. Still further, the solar cell  may be included in an array of solar cells and placed together to generate electrical power in a solar panel on a permanent or semi-permanent structure, such as a building. Other applications will be contemplated and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims.","Still further, due to the relatively small size of the solar cell  and the materials used in manufacturing the solar cell , a solar panel built with several solar cells such as the solar cell  may have a relatively small radius of curvature. For example, a solar panel made out of cells such as the solar cell  can bend to a radius of curvature ranging from 2 mm up to 10 cm. Accordingly, the solar cell  may be placed on a curved supporting surface if desired.","Moreover, as shown, both the positive contact pad  and the negative contact pad  are exposed on the back side  of the solar cell . Therefore, the conductive metals of the contact pads  and  do not block light from reaching the absorbing layer of the solar cell . This arrangement enhances efficiency of conversion of solar radiation into electrical power over conventional III-V solar cell designs.","Additionally, while the solar cell  is shown as a single junction cell, it is to be understood that the solar cell  may be a multi junction cell that includes at least one additional absorbing layer, which can comprise a p-type and n-type compound semiconductor that is selected based upon a band gap corresponding to such semiconductor. As described above, the p-type semiconductor layer  and the n-type semiconductor layer  can be composed of GaAs. For instance, the solar cell  may include another p-type semiconductor layer and another n-type semiconductor layer that are composed of indium gallium phosphide (InGaP). In another exemplary embodiment, the solar cell  may include an absorbing layer that comprises an n-type indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) layer and a p-type InGaAs layer. The multi junction cell may be manufactured through epitaxy or through stacking solar cells with absorbing layers composed of different compound semiconductors selected based upon band gaps of such semiconductors.","With reference briefly to , an exemplary plan view of the back side  of the solar cell  is shown. For instance, the solar cell  may be hexagonal in shape, although other suitable shades are contemplated. As shown, the negative contact pad  can reside at the periphery of the back side  of the solar cell , while the positive contact pad  can reside over the center of the back side  of the solar cell . As will be described herein, additional processing can be undertaken to lift off a portion of the positive contact pad  such that a window exists through the solar cell , thereby preventing blockage of light as light passes through the solar cell . In such an approach, the solar cell  can be stacked with a second solar cell, wherein the second solar cell comprises an absorbing layer composed of a compound semiconductor of a different band gap than the compound semiconductor used in the solar cell .","Now referring to , a cutaway view of an exemplary semiconductor stack  that can be utilized in connection with manufacturing the solar cell  shown in  is illustrated. Pursuant to an example, the semiconductor stack  can be grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy. Photolithic masks can be designed to create one or more solar cells from the semiconductor stack  in a variety of sizes including, but not limited to, 2 mm, 1 mm, 500 \u03bcm, and 250 \u03bcm diameter sizes. Different sizes can have different design variations with varying densities of etch release holes. Etch release holes are perforations that travel from the front of a wafer to a release layer such that chemistry can access the release layer.","The semiconductor stack  can comprise a wafer . For instance, the wafer  may be a GaAs wafer that can be patterned using standard photolithography. A buffer layer  can be grown on the wafer  to protect the wafer  during release of a manufactured solar cell. An AlAs release layer  can be grown by epitaxy on the buffer layer , wherein the AlAs release layer  may be approximately 50 nm in thickness.","Thereafter, a first GaInP confinement layer  can be grown on the AlAs release layer , and an n-type GaAs layer  is grown on the first confinement layer . A p-type GaAs layer  is grown directly upon the n-type GaAs layer , as described above. This creates a PN junction between the two GaAs layers  and . A second GaInP confinement layer  can be grown on the p-type GaAs layer , and a GaAs p-type contact layer  can be grown on the second confinement layer .","Once the semiconductor stack  is grown, lithography and\/or various etches (wet or dry etches) can be used to etch to at least the first confinement layer  in the semiconductor stack . The remaining structure is then subject to metallization, where metal is put down on the semiconductor stack  and liftoff is utilized to pattern the metal. A directional etch may then be employed to access the AlAs release layer , and such release layer  is etched away entirely to release the resulting solar cell from the wafer . This process can result in the creation of a relatively thin solar cell in the range of 5 \u03bcm. Additionally, the wafer  can be utilized to process additional solar cells.","A particular example of etching processes that can be utilized on the semiconductor stack  to generate the solar cell  will not be provided. It is to be understood, however, that this process is but one exemplary approach for etching the semiconductor stack  to generate the solar cell , and that other approaches are contemplated and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto appended claims. Pursuant to an example, the GaAs contact layer  can be etched by submerging the semiconductor stack  in a 1:4:45 solution of HPO: HO: HO. Thereafter, the second confinement layer  can be targeted using, for instance, a 7:1 solution of HPO: HCl in which the semiconductor stack  can be submerged for approximately 14 seconds. Thereafter, the same chemistry used to remove the contact layer  (HPO: HO: HO) can be utilized to remove the p-type GaAs layer  and the n-type GaAs layer . For instance, etching can be done by submerging the semiconductor stack  in such solution for approximately 462 seconds. The advantage of using this chemistry is its selectivity as it only etches GaAs leaving the GaInP layers  and  intact.","Subsequently, the resulting semiconductor stack  can be subjected to cleaning, and a second photolithography mask can be used to define metal contact pads. Specifically, subsequent to a photoresist pattern being formed, a metal layer can be deposited and the photoresist can be removed to lift off unwanted metal. As mentioned above, the metal layer can be composed of approximately 10 nm of chromium to enhance adhesion followed by 100 nm of gold.","Another photolithographic step can then be undertaken to define the size of solar cells manufactured from the semiconductor stack  as well as the release holes. Photoresist can be employed to protect the cells while leaving boundaries between individual cells uncovered. Thereafter, the semiconductor stack  can undergo a reactive ion etch, thereby removing material to access the AlAs release layer  of the semiconductor stack . With the release layer  being accessible, the semiconductor stack  can be submerged into an HF-based solution to detach the cells from the wafer . Specifically, the release layer  can be selectively etched using a solution composed of approximately 49% HF in water with Tergitol, which can be added to prevent cells from sticking to the wafer  once released. Due the resulting small size of the solar cells, the liftoff process can be completed in approximately 8 minutes, which is in contrast to the several days required for epitaxy liftoff of a full wafer. Various methods can be utilized to contact the resulting cells. For instance, a relatively small amount of silver paste can be placed on the resulting contact pads. In another example, contact can be made using gold wire bonds. It is to be understood, however, that any suitable method for contacting the solar cells at the contact pads is contemplated.","Referring now to , a cutaway side view  of an exemplary stacking of solar cells is illustrated. The cutaway view  illustrates a first solar cell  and a second solar cell , wherein both the first and second solar cells  and , respectively, have positive and negative contacts on backsides of the solar cells. As shown, during metal liftoff, a window can be created through at least one of the solar cells, such that a positive contact pad does not block light that has traveled through an absorbing region of the at least one of the solar cells. Pursuant to an example, the first solar cell  may have an absorbing layer that is composed of a first compound semiconductor, while the second solar cell  may have an absorbing layer that is composed of a second compound semiconductor that has a different band gap when compared to the band gap of the first compound semiconductor.","With reference now to , a cutaway side view  of another exemplary stacking of solar cells is illustrated. The side view  illustrates first and second solar cells  and , which can be manufactured as described above. Accordingly, both the first solar cell  and the second solar cell  can comprise positive and negative contact pads, respectively, that are on the back side of the solar cells  and . The positive and negative contact pads are shown as being in contact with one another. Of course, other exemplary configurations are also contemplated.","With reference now to , an exemplary solar cell  is illustrated. Here, the solar cell  comprises a first confinement layer  and a second confinement layer  that surrounds an absorbing layer . For example, the absorbing layer  can comprise the n-type semiconductor layer  and the p-type semiconductor layer  as shown in . The solar cell  further comprises the contact layer . The positive contact pad  is positioned on the top of the contact layer  and is etched such that a window exists through the contact layer . In other words, a photolithographic mask can be utilized to selectively lift off a center portion of metal applied to the contact layer  such that light that passes through the absorbing layer  and the confinement layer  is not blocked by the positive contact pad . The solar cell  additionally includes the negative contact pad  that contacts the first confinement layer , rather than the absorbing layer .","As described above, the solar cell  shown in  can be selectively released from a wafer, and thereafter a protective coating can be placed on the front side  of such solar cell. It is to be understood, however, that additional processing may be undertaken on the front side  to create an aperture in the first confinement layer  such that a smaller amount of solar radiation is attenuated by the first confinement layer. This can increase the efficiency of the solar cell , as the negative contact pad  remains in contact with the first confinement layer  and not the absorbing layer , while the first confinement layer  does not attenuate light that is desirably received by the absorbing layer . That is, subsequent to the processing described above, the solar cell  can be flipped and additional action can be undertaken on the front side of the solar cell . For instance, the backside of the solar cell can be placed on a substrate, while etching (wet or dry) or other suitable processes can be undertaken on the front side of the solar cells to improve efficiency.","Turning now to , another exemplary solar cell  is illustrated. Here, trenches are selectively caused to be placed in a compound semiconductor to generate positive and negative contact pads at a same level. For example, a p-type compound semiconductor layer  can be grown on a confinement layer . A compound semiconductor layer  can be placed upon the p-type compound semiconductor layer . Thereafter, trenches can be etched through the second compound semiconductor layer and a central portion can be subjected to n-doping. This combination of trenching and n-doping can create positive pillars that are at the same level on the solar cell as the negative contact pad.","With reference now to , an exemplary methodology  that can be employed in connection with manufacturing solar cells is illustrated and described. While the methodology is described as being a series of acts that are performed in a sequence, it is to be understood that the methodology is not limited by the order of the sequence. For instance, some acts may occur in a different order than what is described herein. In addition, an act may occur concurrently with another act. Furthermore, in some instances, not all acts may be required to implement the methodology described herein.","The methodology  starts at , and at  a semiconductor stack that comprises a plurality of layers is grown by way of epitaxy. The plurality of layers can comprise an absorbing layer and first and second confinement layers that surround the absorbing layer.","At , the first confinement layer and the absorbing layer are selectively removed to expose the second confinement layer of the semiconductor stack.","At , positive and negative metal contact pads are created on a same side (back side) of the solar cell, wherein neither of the positive and negative contact pads is contacted to the absorbing layer of the solar cell. The methodology  completes at .","It is noted that several examples have been provided for purposes of explanation. These examples are not to be construed as limiting the hereto-appended claims. Additionally, it may be recognized that the examples provided herein may be permutated while still falling under the scope of the claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
