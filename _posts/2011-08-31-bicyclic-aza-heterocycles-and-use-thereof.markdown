{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel bicyclic azaheterocycles, to processes for preparation thereof, to the use thereof, alone or in combinations, for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases and to the use thereof for production of medicaments for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, especially for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be classified into two groups either by structural features or by the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism. NO can bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","Through the formation of cGMP and the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial role in different physiological processes, more particularly in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion, and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in the event of disorders based on disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase has to date been accomplished using exclusively compounds such as organic nitrates, the effect of which is based on NO. This is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of heme. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","In the last few years, there have been descriptions of some compounds which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, for example 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; M\u00fclsch et al., 120 (1997), 681], fatty acids [Goldberg et al., 252 (1977), 1279], diphenyliodonium hexafluorophosphate [Pettibone et al., 116 (1985), 307], isoliquiritigenin [Yu et al., 114 (1995), 1587] and various substituted pyrazole derivatives (WO 98\/16223).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06569 discloses fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 01\/083490 a fused aminopyridine derivative. WO 2010\/065275 discloses pyrrolopyrimidones as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as very potent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and are therefore suitable for treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"22.52mm","wi":"69.85mm","file":"US09096592-20150804-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":[{},{}]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"20.66mm","wi":"43.01mm","file":"US09096592-20150804-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","* is the attachment site to R,","# is the attachment site to R,","#is the attachment site to the nitrogen atom,","#is the attachment site to the carbon atom,\n\nY is CH or N,\n\nRis hydrogen or fluorine,\n\nRis (C-C)-alkyl or benzyl,\n","where (C-C)-alkyl is substituted by one trifluoromethyl substituent,","where (C-C)-alkyl may be substituted by 1 to 3 fluorine substituents,","and","where benzyl is substituted by 1 to 3 fluorine substituents,\n\nRis a group of the formula\n"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0021"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"23.54mm","wi":"34.71mm","file":"US09096592-20150804-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":[{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","## is the attachment site to the ring P,","L is CH or N,","M is CRor N,\n        \n        ","the ring Qis 5- to 7-membered heterocyclyl, phenyl or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl,\n        \n        ","the ring Qis 5-membered heteroaryl,\n        \n        "]}},"2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-8-methyl-9H-purine,","2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-8-methyl-9H-purin-6-amine,","N-butyl-2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]-8-methyl-9H-purin-6-amine"]}},"Inventive compounds are the compounds of the formula (I) and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, the compounds encompassed by formula (I) of the formulae specified hereinafter and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, and the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter as working examples and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof, to the extent that the compounds encompassed by formula (I) and specified hereinafter are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds. Also encompassed are salts which are not themselves suitable for pharmaceutical applications but can be used, for example, for isolation or purification of the inventive compounds.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds include acid addition salts of mineral acids, carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, for example salts of hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid and benzoic acid.","Physiologically acceptable salts of the inventive compounds also include salts of conventional bases, by way of example and with preference alkali metal salts (e.g. sodium and potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g. calcium and magnesium salts) and ammonium salts derived from ammonia or organic amines having 1 to 16 carbon atoms, by way of example and with preference ethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, ethyldiisopropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, dimethylaminoethanol, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-methylmorpholine, arginine, lysine, ethylenediamine and N-methylpiperidine.","In the context of the invention, solvates refer to those forms of the inventive compounds which, in the solid or liquid state, form a complex by coordination with solvent molecules. Hydrates are a specific form of the solvates in which the coordination is with water. Preferred solvates in the context of the present invention are hydrates.","The inventive compounds may, depending on their structure, exist in different stereoisomeric forms, i.e. in the form of configurational isomers or else optionally as conformational isomers (enantiomers and\/or diastereomers, including those in the case of atropisomers). The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically homogeneous constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this purpose, more particularly HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","If the inventive compounds can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the inventive compounds. An isotopic variant of an inventive compound is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the inventive compound has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into an inventive compound are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of an inventive compound, such as, more particularly, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be of benefit, for example, for the study of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to the comparative ease of preparability and detectability, compounds labeled particularly with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the inventive compounds may therefore in some cases also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the inventive compounds can be prepared by processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the methods described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the particular reagents and\/or starting compounds therein.","In addition, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the inventive compounds. The term \u201cprodrugs\u201d here denotes compounds which may themselves be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) to inventive compounds during their residence time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, unless specified otherwise, the substituents are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a linear or branched alkyl radical having the number of carbon atoms specified in each case.

For this purpose, they can be administered in a suitable manner, for example by the oral, parenteral, pulmonal, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctival, otic route, or as an implant or stent.","For these administration routes, the inventive compounds can be administered in suitable administration forms.","Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art, which release the inventive compounds rapidly and\/or in a modified manner and which contain the inventive compounds in crystalline and\/or amorphized and\/or dissolved form, for example tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with gastric juice-resistant or retarded-dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the inventive compound), tablets or films\/oblates which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films\/lyophilizates or capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.","Parenteral administration can be accomplished with avoidance of an absorption step (for example by an intravenous, intraarterial, intracardiac, intraspinal or intralumbar route) or with inclusion of an absorption (for example by an intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, percutaneous or intraperitoneal route). Suitable administration forms for parenteral administration include injection and infusion formulations in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilizates or sterile powders.","For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films\/oblates or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.","Preference is given to oral or parenteral administration, especially oral administration.","The inventive compounds can be converted to the administration forms listed. This can be accomplished in a manner known per se by mixing with inert nontoxic pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulfate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), dyes (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavor and\/or odor correctors.","In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg\/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration, the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg\/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg\/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg\/kg of body weight.","It may nevertheless be necessary where appropriate to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active ingredient, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. For instance, in some cases, less than the aforementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of greater amounts, it may be advisable to divide them into several individual doses over the day.","The working examples which follow illustrate the invention. The invention is not limited to the examples.","Unless stated otherwise, the percentages in the tests and examples which follow are percentages by weight; parts are parts by weight.

acquisition computer.","The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure, heart rate and body motion of conscious animals in their usual habitat.","Animal Material","The investigations are carried out on adult female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR Okamoto) with a body weight of >200 g. SHR\/NCrl from the Okamoto Kyoto School of Medicine, 1963, were a cross of male Wistar Kyoto rats with greatly elevated blood pressure and female rats having slightly elevated blood pressure, and were handed over at F13 to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.","After transmitter implantation, the experimental animals are housed singly in type 3 Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water.","The day\/night rhythm in the experimental laboratory is changed by the room lighting at 6:00 am and at 7:00 pm.","Transmitter Implantation","The TA11 PA\u2014C40 telemetry transmitters used are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use. The animals instrumented in this way can be used repeatedly after the wound has healed and the implant has settled.","For the implantation, the fasted animals are anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Sanofi: 50 mg\/kg i.p.) and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba, the liquid-filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue (VetBonD\u2122, 3M). The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle, and the wound is closed layer by layer.","An antibiotic (Tardomyocel COMP, Bayer, 1 ml\/kg s.c.) is administered postoperatively for prophylaxis of infection.","Substances and Solutions","Unless stated otherwise, the substances to be studied are administered orally by gavage to a group of animals in each case (n=6). In accordance with an administration volume of 5 ml\/kg of body weight, the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures or suspended in 0.5% tylose.","A solvent-treated group of animals is used as a control.","Test Procedure","The telemetry measuring unit present is configured for 24 animals. Each experiment is recorded under an experiment number (Vyear month day).","Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna (1010 Receiver, DSI).","The implanted transmitters can be activated externally by means of an incorporated magnetic switch. They are switched to transmission in the run-up to the experiment. The signals emitted can be detected online by a data acquisition system (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T. for WINDOWS, DSI) and processed accordingly. The data are stored in each case in a file created for this purpose and bearing the experiment number.","In the standard procedure, the following are measured for 10-second periods in each case:","systolic blood pressure (SBP)","diastolic blood pressure (DBP)","mean arterial pressure (MAP)","heart rate (HR)","activity (ACT).","The acquisition of measurements is repeated under computer control at 5-minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute values are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure (Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor; APR-1) and stored as individual data. Further technical details are given in the extensive documentation from the manufacturer company (DSI).","Unless stated otherwise, the test substances are administered at 9.00 am on the day of the experiment. Following the administration, the parameters described above are measured over 24 hours.","Evaluation","After the end of the experiment, the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software (Dataquest\u2122 A.R.T.\u2122 ANALYSIS). The blank value is assumed to be the time 2 hours before administration, and so the selected data set encompasses the period from 7.00 am on the day of the experiment to 9.00 am the following day.","The data are smoothed over a predefinable period by determination of the average (15-minute average) and transferred as a text file to a storage medium. The measured values presorted and compressed in this way are transferred to Excel templates and tabulated. For each day of the experiment, the data obtained are stored in a dedicated file bearing the experiment number.
