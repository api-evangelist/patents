It also has been shown that ABR-215050 is capable of inhibiting prostate tumor growth via a mechanism involving an anti-angiogenic response (2); a clear anti-tumor response has been achieved in a number of in vivo tumor models using human prostate cancer cell lines (3). This has encouraged further trials on the compound and efficacy in the treatment of human cancer has been shown in a phase 2 clinical trial (4).","In a recent, randomized placebo-controlled double blind phase II clinical study of ABR-215050 in patients with asymptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, a difference was shown in the number of patients with disease progression at six months. Indeed, the results showed that the fraction of patients with disease progression during the six month period was 31% for patients treated with ABR-215050, compared to 66% for placebo treated patients (p<0.0001). The median progression free survival was 7.6 months for the group treated with ABR-215050, compared to 3.2 months for the placebo group (p=0.0009). ABR-215050 treatment also had an effect on biomarkers relevant for prostate cancer progression and was generally well tolerated.","In vivo animal experiments further have shown that ABR-215050 also has an efficacy in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Thus, an in vivo animal experimental study has shown efficacy of the compound in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (5), and another one has shown its efficacy in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (6).","Deuterium (H or D) is a stable and non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen which has approximately twice the mass of protium (H or H), the by far most common isotope of hydrogen. Deuteration of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicity profiles has been disclosed previously with some classes of drugs. For example, it has been disclosed (7) that various deuteration patterns can be used to (a) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (b) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (c) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (d) decrease the amount of a dose needed to achieve a desired effect, (e) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, (f) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues, and\/or (g) create a more effective drug and\/or a safer drug for polypharmacy, whether the polypharmacy be intentional or not. In (7), therefore, deuteration of laquinimod is disclosed and it is stated that the deuteration approach has the strong potential to slow the metabolism of laquinimod","According to a first aspect, there is provided a compound which is deuterium-enriched 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-N,1-dimethyl-2-oxo-N-[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2-dihydro-quinoline-3-carboxamide, having a deuterium enrichment in the amide-N methyl group of at least 70%; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.","There also is provided a method for preparing a deuterium-enriched 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-N,1-dimethyl-2-oxo-N-[(4-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2-dihydro-quinoline-3-carboxamide having a deuterium enrichment in the amide-N methyl group of at least 70%; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, by reacting a 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid C1-C4 alkyl ester with deuterated N-methyl-p-trifluoromethylaniline having a deuterium enrichment in the N-methyl group of at least 70%; in a suitable solvent; and optionally reacting the obtained compound with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base.","In one embodiment, the compound of the invention is according to formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"29.21mm","wi":"65.45mm","file":"US09216956-20151222-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["Ris selected from H and pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic cations;","R, Rand Rare independently selected from H and D; and","CRRRhas a total deuterium enrichment of at least 70%."]}},"There also is provided a method for preparing a compound according to formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"29.21mm","wi":"65.45mm","file":"US09216956-20151222-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3 ","4 "],"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0002","list-style":"none"},"li":"comprising reacting a compound of formula (II)"}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0016"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"28.45mm","wi":"57.83mm","file":"US09216956-20151222-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0003","list-style":"none"},"li":["\u2003wherein Ris a C1-C4 alkyl group;","with a compound of formula (III)"]}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0019"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"21.59mm","wi":"52.83mm","file":"US09216956-20151222-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0004","list-style":"none"},"li":"in a suitable solvent; so as to obtain a compound of formula (I) wherein Ris H; and optionally reacting the compound of formula (I) wherein Ris H, with a suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable base."}},"The compound of the invention is useful as a medicament, e.g. for use in the treatment of a malignant hyperproliferative disease or an autoimmune disease.","The compound of the invention also is useful as a medicament, e.g. for use in the treatment of a disorder ameliorated by the modulation of immune function.","Consequently, there also is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention.","The inventive compound also is suitable for use in the prevention or treatment of a disorder selected from malignant hyperproliferative diseases and autoimmune diseases.","A method for the treatment of a mammal suffering from a malignant hyperproliferative disease also is provided.

It could be suspected that even at a very low concentration, ABR-215691 could contribute substantially to CYP1A induction due to its very high inducing capacity.","The water solubility of ABR-215050 and of its metabolites also was investigated. It is a well-known fact that metabolism in general aims to transform compounds to more water soluble entities (10), which mostly decreases toxicity but also facilitates renal elimination. Both ABR-219694 and ABR-222097 were highly water soluble However, surprisingly ABR-215691 was found to have extremely low water solubility, compared to the other metabolites as well as to the parent compound, cf.

Together, the above findings indicate that CYP1A induction through ABR-215691 could eventually cause a drug to drug interaction problem in man in vivo that, even if not insurmountable, must nonetheless be seriously considered in medical treatment.","Therefore, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the amide-N methyl deuterated ABR-215050 (herein below referred to as ABR-215050-dx), wherein the amide-N methyl moiety was tri-deuterated, compared to the non-deuterated parent compound were studied in rat. The reduction of the metabolic amide-N demethylation when the amide-N methyl was deuterium labeled was very pronounced; the formation of demethylated metabolite was diminished by as much as a factor of four compared to the non-deuterium labeled ABR-215050. In other words: relative to ABR-215050, the in vivo formation of ABR-215691 was reduced to only 25% when ABR-215050-dx was used. It also was noted that the reduced amide-N demethylation did not affect the 1:1 molar ratio for the parent drugs in vivo in plasma, meaning that the positive disease remedy effects are sustained but the undesired side effect consisting of CYP1A induction is depressed. cf. herein below under \u201cIn vivo investigation of pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABR-215050 and ABR-215050-dx in rat\u201d.","Further in vivo studies in rat show that CYP1A induction is substantially reduced by administration of ABR-215050-dx instead of ABR-215050 (cf. herein below under \u201cIn vivo investigation of CYP1A1\/2 activity in rat after administration of ABR-215050 and ABR-215050-dx\u201d).","In vivo studies in mouse also show that ABR-215050-dx retains a high therapeutic activity (cf. herein below under \u201cIn vivo investigation of anti-tumor effect of ABR-215050-dx in mouse\u201d).","Thus, according to the present invention, a deuterated ABR-215050 is provided which on administration gives rise to a substantially reduced CYP1A induction while providing a high therapeutic activity.","For the purpose of the present invention, the term \u201cdeuterium enrichment\u201d at a specific position of a compound refers to the percentage of incorporation of deuterium at that position in place of hydrogen. For example, by \u201ca compound having a 90% deuterium enrichment at a given position\u201d it is intended that 90% of the molecules in a sample contain deuterium at the specified position. The natural abundance of deuterium is about 0.0156%, which means that the natural deuterium enrichment at any specific position of a compound is 0.0156%. The deuterium enrichment can be determined using e.g. mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","When referring to a moiety, such as a methyl group, comprising several positions capable of being deuterated, the term \u201cdeuterium enrichment\u201d refers to a mean value, based on the individual values for the positions in the moiety. As an illustrating example, for a moiety having a deuterium enrichment of 90% and comprising three specific deuteration positions, the deuteration enrichment at each individual position e.g. may be 85%, 92% and 93%, (or any other percentage values) the mean of which is 90%.","For the purpose of the present invention, disorders ameliorated by the modulation of immune function e.g. comprise malignant hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammation and inflammatory diseases, and hypersensitivity disorders of the immune system.","By \u201cmodulation of immune function\u201d is meant e.g. mitigation or prevention of an immune response that causes undesirable effects.","As used herein, the terms \u201cmalignant hyperproliferative disease\u201d, \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201ccancerous\u201d refer to or describe a physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth.

The cells were tested and found free from mycoplasma.","Subcutaneous Implantation of Cells","Male athymic Nude BALB\/c mice (age 8 weeks) were purchased from Taconic (Lille Skensved, Denmark). For subcutaneous implantation, one million tumor cells suspended in 200 \u03bcl Matrigel (BD Bioscience, Bedford, Mass.) were inoculated on the flank of the mice. The tumor size was measured by a caliper once a week throughout the experiment and the tumor take was 75% in the untreated control group (n=12). In the tumor growth experiment, ABR-215050-dx (10 mg\/kg\/day) was administered via drinking water from day 7. To assure appropriate dose was given with no significant fluctuations, water consumption was monitored for each animal cage during the entire experiment. It has previously been shown that the plasma half-life of tasquinimod is 3.4 hours, and that administration of 1-10 mg\/kg\/day via drinking water results in steady state plasma levels (0.4-1 \u03bcM) (14).

Approximately 60 mL solvents had distilled off at the end of the reaction and the mixture was cooled to room temperature. A mixture of n-heptane (25 mL) and toluene (6 mL) was added and the crystalline suspension was stirred for 20 min and the crystals were collected by filtration, washed with n-heptane, and dried to give the crude title compound (1.52 g). This was dissolved in a mixture of methanol (11.2 mL), water (6.8 mL) and sodium hydroxide (5 M, 0.83 mL, 4.15 mmol). Hydrochloric acid (5 M) was added to adjust the pH to approximately 8-9 and the mixture was filtered to remove any insoluble material. To the filtrate was added 5 M HCl until pH was approximately 2.
