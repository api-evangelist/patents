title: Inert and pressure-actuated submunitions dispensing projectile
abstract: An inert axisymmetric projectile is provided for launching from a shipboard gun and dispersing submunitions at a target. The projectile includes a base plug, a sabot housing, a submunitions package, and a retainer ring. The sabot housing includes a plurality of sabot petals angularly arranged and attached to the plug. The housing includes a payload portion and a nose portion, with a passage corridor between these portions. The submunitions package is contained within the payload portion and constrained radially by the housing. The retainer ring constrains the petals for joining together. Upon launch aerodynamic pressure fractures the ring and causes the petals to unfurl, thereby releasing the submunitions package for dispersal.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to gun-launched projectiles. In particular, this invention relates to submunition-dispensing rounds without incorporation of energetic materials.","As the United States Navy transitions from a \u201cBlue Water\u201d Combat Posture to a \u201cLittoral\u201d Combat Posture, naval warships become more susceptible to attack from non-conventional surface weapon platforms from shore-launched threats, such as coastal boats. The Mk 45-5\u2033 54\/62 Gun Mount serves as one of the primary surface warfare weapons aboard these vessels. Although there are multiple 5\u2033 (five-inch) diameter projectiles available for use against small boat threats, their fuzing safe and arm devices preclude their use at close ranges.","Additionally, rules of engagement often permit potential small boat threats to enter within the minimum fuzing safe and arm ranges, thus eliminating any potential self-defense contributions from the Mk 45-5\u2033 54\/62 caliber Gun Mount. Cruiser CG-47 (USS Ticonderoga) and destroyer DDG-51 (USS Arleigh Burke) class ships employ the Mk 45-5\u2033 54\/62 Gun Mount as a primary surface warfare weapon. The Mk 45 5\u2033 54\/62 Gun Mount is a fully automated, rifled, single-barrel weapon that stows and fires 5\u2033 54\/62-caliber ammunition. The weapon is capable of firing 70-lb projectiles at surface craft, low altitude aircraft, and shore targets.","Conventional gun-launched projectiles yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. Although there are multiple 5\u2033 (5-inch) diameter projectiles available for use against small boat threats, their fuzing safe and arm devices preclude their use at close ranges, eliminating any potential self-defense contributions from Mk 45-5\u2033 54\/62 Gun Mount. In particular, various exemplary embodiments provide an inert axisymmetric projectile for launching from a shipboard gun and dispersing submunitions at a target.","The projectile features include a base plug, a sabot housing, a submunitions package, a retainer ring, and a slip obturator. The sabot housing includes a plurality of sabot petals angularly arranged and attached to the plug. The housing includes a payload portion and a nose portion, with a passage corridor between these portions. The submunitions package is contained within the payload portion and constrained radially by the housing. The retainer ring constrains the petals for joining together. Upon launch the ring fractures from aerodynamic pressure and rotational forces. This causes the petals to unfurl, thereby releasing the submunitions package for dispersal.","The slip obturator engages the lands and grooves of the barrel rifling and seals the explosive gases behind the projectile, preventing them from advancing further up the projectile and potentially causing damage. The projectile \u201cslips\u201d at the interface between the slip obturator and the base plug, reducing the spin on the projectile that would have otherwise been induced by the barrel rifling. As the projectile progresses down the barrel, the structure of the sabot petals resist undesired deformations under the gun launch loadings of axial inertial setback and rotational inertia. The forward retaining band is restrained from deformation or failure by the radial restraint of the gun barrel itself.","Once the projectile exits the muzzle of the gun, the retaining band is no longer restrained by the barrel and fractures. The band suffers a controlled fracture by means of stress concentrations at geometric cross-section reductions along its circumference due to the combined loadings of axial inertial setback, rotational inertia, and aerodynamic stagnation pressure. Thus, absent restraint at their forward ends, the sabot petals begin to \u201cpeal\u201d away from the projectile's central axis due to the centrifugal forces caused by rotation, as well as pressure resulting from petal contact with the ambient air. The petals then discard from the projectile and expose the interior submunitions package. The submunitions immediately begin to disperse radially due to their rotational inertia and their interaction with the ambient air. The dispersed payload is then disposed to engage the intended target. The remaining non-payload projectile components in flight are considered sacrificial materials.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Various exemplary embodiments provide an inert gun-launched projectile actuated by gun-launch induced pressures, or \u201cpressure actuated projectile-inert\u201d (PAPI) for standoff ship defense against proximate threats. The PAPI dispenses an internal payload of multiple fragments over an extended area without the use of a conventional fuze or energetic material. The PAPI uses the propelling gasses and acceleration-induced forces from gun launch to initiate internal mechanisms that release housing petals and dispense an internal payload towards a target.","PAPI is being developed to significantly increase the self-defense capabilities of warships against small, fast, asymmetric watercraft threats. Being inert renders the PAPI more convenient and safer to store, manufacture, and maintain. In this context, the term \u201cinert\u201d means without energetic material, such as an explosive or chemical propellant to disperse submunitions from the projectile upon reaching the target.","The PAPI increases capacity provided to the fleet for proximate ship self defense by providing a near-field projectile to be fired from a 5\u2033 (5-inch, e.g., Mk 45) diameter ship-board gun. As such the PAPI constitutes an axisymmetric munitions round. The PAPI is unique less due to its objective, but because of features related to achieving that objective. There are existing \u201cshotgun\u201d type rounds in use by the United States Army. However, these rounds disperse their payloads by means of projectile bodies that shatter apart at or near muzzle exit from the gun.","The PAPI dispenses its payload using mechanisms actuated by gun launch forces. These mechanisms employ controlled fracture of a retaining ring or the channeling of propellant gasses into the interior of the projectile during gun launch. Current research reveals no existing projectile that dispenses a multiple fragment payload by channeling propellant gas to actuate a mechanical device. The novelty of these embodiments can also be extended by the use of a slip obturator to retard spread of the submunitions by reducing spin when fired out of a rifled gun barrel. Exemplary embodiments use the slip obturator to reduce spin (i.e., angular rotation about the PAPI's longitudinal axis) to limit the distribution of the payload to a smaller area. Alternatively, the PAPI can use a regular obturator, thereby achieving full spin, and enabling the round to accurately traverse to the target.","Most shotgun type rounds are fired out of a smoothbore barrel. PAPI can be used on ships wielding large-caliber rifled barrels to engage close range, asymmetric surface threats. The inner spring and pressure actuation mechanism of PAPI can be used for other types and sizes of projectile or as a release mechanism initiated by inertial forces. The principle embodiments described herein include an aerodynamic design and a mechanical design. Each configuration is described in further detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","110","120","130","200","210","210","220","110","230"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","220","310","320","330","340","350","360"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","310","320","330","340","360","350","410","420","430","410","420"]},"Exemplary balls  can be composed of a dense metal, such as \u215c (0.375 inch) diameter tungsten spheres.

The petals are restrained at the bottom of the projectile by the base plug , which is surrounded by a gas-sealing obturator , and restrained at the top of the projectile by a frangible retainer ring  or a mechanical retaining pin as the pushrod .","The PAPI embodiments can employ either the ring  or the pushrod . Both PAPI designs share the same mission and are completely inert and without conventional fuzes. However, the retaining ring PAPI actuates payload dispersion by creating fractures at areas of stress concentration in the retainer ring  due to the resulting forces of gun launch. The mechanical pressure PAPI actuates payload dispersion by enabling gun propelling gases into a rear chamber and using this pressure increase to elevate the plate  and engage the pushrod , which is then disengaged from the sabot petal structure , enabling payload dispersion.","Returning to the view , upon launch from the gun , the projectile exits the muzzle and becomes subject to various aerodynamic forces. In general the projectile will experience about 110 psi of pressure due to aerodynamic forces at the nose of the projectile and about 288 psi of pressure due to the spin of the PAPI. The pressure on the nose portion  of the PAPI acts on the angled nose cone, and the angular velocity pulls the petals , ,  and  of the projectile away from the center of rotation. These forces separate the petals being held together by the ring .","Assembly of the PAPI includes the procedures described as follows. First as in view , the petals connect together by the dowel pins  with silicone between each petal for environmental sealing purposes. This petal assembly slides into a groove in the retainer ring  and is secured in place with standard 4-40 screws. Hose clamps can be used at several locations along the payload portion  to keep the petals together until attaching the base plug . The upper plate  acts as a forward constraint for the payload  and features the groove  to fit an o-ring to environmentally and pneumatically seal the PAPI from the nose portion .","Second as in view , the plate  with o-ring slides inside the petal assembly until reaching the groove  on the petals. The snap ring  can then be inserted into the groove  in the petals to keep the plate  from falling out of the projectile. This snap ring  also provides support for the petals to be torqued to the base plug .","Third as in view , upon installing the upper plate , the tungsten ball payload  can be installed. The precise number of balls is determined by the overall weight of the projectile, with the intent of keeping the PAPI to the standard 70\u00b11 pounds-mass. For the volume considered, this configuration has room for just under 50 pounds-mass worth of payload which can equate to about 2800\u03b8\u215c\u2033 tungsten spheres or balls .","The rod  is inserted before the payload  is poured into the payload portion . This all-thread feature enables use of nuts  to torque and compress the payload  against the lower plate , and enables threading into the base plug . The lower plate  is somewhat more robust than the upper plate  to support the payload  during setback acceleration upon launch. The lower plate  also features an o-ring groove  for environmental and pneumatic sealing.","Fourth as in view , the lower plate  slides into the payload portion  and contacts the payload . The nut  (e.g., locknut and lockwasher) are threaded behind the lower plate  to enable torque to be applied. The entire assembly continues a process of vibrating and torquing down the nuts  until the payload  is sufficiently compacted. This compaction restrains the balls  from rattling around, but also acts to inhibit the payload  from pushing the petals radially outward by hydrostatic pressure setback forces upon firing. This hydrostatic pressure gradates from negligible at the upper plate  to a maximum at the lower plate , causing premature separation of the petals. By compressing the load, these forces can be normalized and enabling the payload  to act as a unitary item instead of several individual balls .","Under the pressures and temperatures experienced during shooting aluminum has been shown to melt and burn, causing small particles of aluminum to be deposited on rifle grooves of the gun barrel. The proceeding shot rips this aluminum from these grooves. With the aluminum comes the chrome plating intended to protect the inside of the barrel. Upon removal of the chrome plating, subsequent shots cause pitting in the rifling of the barrel. This pitting causes blow-by reducing the efficiency and accuracy of future rounds. To avoid such deposits, the base plug  is composed of steel.","Fifth as in view , the petals slide into the groove , and the rod  threads into the hole  of the base plug . The two holes  enable use of a spanner wrench to thread the base plug  onto the rod . A bead of silicone will be applied to the groove in the base plate prior to assembly to provide an environmental seal. The base plug  turns into the rod  until the sides of the petals mate with the top surface of the inner flange .","Sixth as in view , the obturator  is prepared by heating in an oven to allow the nylon to expand, as is commonly accomplished with nylon bands. After heating, the obturator  is pressed onto the base plug  and permitted to cool and thereby shrink into position. This is a practice carried out on the M in addition to multiple other munitions with similar band designs. After installation of the obturator  onto the base plug , the PAPI is completed and ready for load and launch in the gun .","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is, therefore, to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["These and various other features and aspects of various exemplary embodiments will be readily understood with reference to the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like or similar numbers are used throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 11A and 11B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 14A through 14F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIGS. 16A and 16B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 18A through 18C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
