The aforementioned diagnostic tests may involve modifying hardware settings on the number of computing devices at various points in time. The administrator may have to manually interface with the individual computing devices to modify the hardware settings. The administrator may choose to use remote access software (e.g., VNC\u00ae) to access an individual target computing device from a remote location. However, the administrator may be required to have Virtual Private Network (VPN) network access in order to be able to configure settings on the individual target computing device utilizing the remote access software. The process involved therein may, therefore, be time consuming and inefficient.","Disclosed are a method, an apparatus and\/or a system of remote configuration of a hardware setting on one or more target computing device(s).","In one aspect, a method includes registering one or more target computing device(s) with a request processing module of a server computing device and an application executing on a client computing device communicatively coupled to the server computing device, and initiating, through the application, a request to configure a hardware setting on the one or more target computing device(s) based on a communication mechanism. The method also includes processing, through the request processing module, the request to generate a validated message related to the hardware setting configuration and to extract information related to a first identifier of the one or more target computing device(s), a second identifier of a hardware of the one or more target computing device(s) to which the hardware setting is to be applied, and a third identifier of the hardware setting.","Further, the method includes redirecting the validated message to the one or more target computing device(s) along with the extracted information, and interpreting, through another application executing on the one or more target computing device(s), the received validated message and the extracted information to enable application of the hardware setting to the hardware of the one or more target computing device(s).","In another aspect, a server computing device includes a memory including instructions associated with a request processing module stored therein, and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory and configured to address storage locations of the memory to execute the request processing module thereon.

The one or more target computing device(s) is also registered with an application executing on the client computing device configured to enable initiation of the request.","The processor is further configured to execute instructions to process, through the request processing module, the received request to generate a validated message related to the hardware setting configuration and to extract information related to a first identifier of the one or more target computing device(s), a second identifier of a hardware of the one or more target computing device(s) to which the hardware setting is to be applied, and a third identifier of the hardware setting, and to redirect the validated message to the one or more target computing(s) device along with the extracted information to enable interpretation of the validated message and the extracted information at the one or more target computing device(s) in order to apply the hardware setting to the hardware.","In yet another aspect, a communication system includes a server computing device configured to execute a request processing module thereon, a client computing device communicatively coupled to the server computing device and configured to execute an application thereon, and one or more target computing device(s) also communicatively coupled to the server computing device and configured to execute another application thereon.

The aforementioned one or more target computing devices or all target computing devices may be chosen from accessing a drop-down list.","Upon choosing one or more target computing devices (or all target computing devices ) to apply the modified setting(s) to, mobile application  may be configured to generate a text message (e.g., a Short Messaging Service (SMS) message) in an example Protocol Description Unit (PDU) format that is compatible with a mobile communication modem (not shown; provided in client computing device , or, part of a service provider) utilized for transmitting the aforementioned text message.","An example protocol template of the text message created may be:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["<Setting name> <setting value> <graphics processor port> <target computing device name(s)>\n\nExample text messages include\n","Rotate 90 port All","(or)","Rotate 90 port [Device , Device ]"]}},"As shown in , text message  may be displayed through another user interface  arrived at after applying the chosen settings in user interface .

Returning to , request processing module  may be responsible for fetching, converting, processing and redirecting messages received through various communication mechanisms such as text messages, e-mails and web applications.","For the aforementioned purpose,  shows request processing module  as including instructions associated with a text message processing module . In one or more embodiments, text message processing module  may be responsible for fetching text message , conversion of text message  from PDU format to text, processing the converted text and redirecting the text to respective target computing devices . In order for quick and efficient processing, text message processing module  may be configured to poll server computing device  for new text messages. As soon as text message  is received at server computing device , text message processing module  may read text message  from memory  (e.g., using AT commands) of client computing device .","Text message processing module  may then convert text message  from PDU format to text. If the converted text is in the format of a predefined protocol, the converted text may be validated and transmitted further. Based on information included in the converted text, several input parameters (or, identifiers) such as setting name, setting value, graphics processor port and target computing device name(s) may be segregated. The validated text may then be transmitted (e.g., based on a network broadcast protocol) to desired target computing devices as per the message details.","In one or more embodiments, each target computing device may execute an application (shown as part of memory , but configured to execute on central processor \/graphics processor ) that exposes Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to enable direct access to hardware (e.g., graphics processor , display unit ) thereof. An example application may be nVIDIA\u00ae's NVAPI that allows direct access to nVIDIA\u00ae GPUs and drivers across all Microsoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae platforms. NVAPI provides support for categories of operations that range beyond the scope of operations found in APIs such as Microsoft\u00ae DirectX\u00ae and OpenGL\u00ae. While an application may be envisioned as being tailored to enabling direct access to proprietary hardware (e.g., nVIDIA\u00ae hardware), third-party access is also within the scope of the exemplary embodiments.","It is obvious that user  may directly type text message  in an appropriate format instead of text message  being generated through choosing options across one or more user interfaces to initiate the configuration of hardware settings in target computing devices . The user interfaces of  are merely shown for illustrative purposes.","As discussed above, each target computing device may be required to be registered with request processing module  prior to functioning of communication system . Further, each target computing device may also be required to be registered with mobile application  (or, any analogous application required for other communication mechanisms).","Returning to  once again, other communication mechanisms may be possible through request processing module .  shows request processing module  as including instructions associated with an e-mail processing module  and a web application processing module . For example, instead of transmitting text message , user  may transmit an e-mail that is processed through e-mail processing module  to initiate the configuration of hardware settings in one or more target computing devices . In this case, client computing device  may, for example, execute a plug-in to interact with an e-mail client such as Microsoft\u00ae Outlook\u00ae thereon. E-mail processing module  may validate the corresponding request and convert the e-mail into a format compatible for transmission to one or more target computing devices .","In the case of initiating the configuration through a web application (e.g., a web browser) executing on client computing device , web application processing module  may process a message generated due to the initiation and convert the message into a format compatible for transmission to the one or more target computing devices . The polling of server computing device  for new messages and\/or extraction of information associated with target computing device(s) and\/or hardware\/hardware setting information thereof from the converted e-mail\/message may be analogous to the discussion corresponding to text message processing module .","Thus, in one or more embodiments, user  may possess the capability to configure hardware settings on one or more target computing devices even when not physically present at the location of server computing device  and\/or the one or more target computing devices . In one or more embodiments, user  may possess the ability to simultaneously initiate configuration of hardware settings on a number of target computing devices . Exemplary embodiments may find utility in an example scenario of user  being an administrator of a computer network having to run stress tests on target computing devices overnight that require modifying hardware settings on target computing devices at various points in time. Also, as discussed above, configuration of hardware settings may be possible through various communication mechanisms.","It is obvious that in communication mechanisms such as text messages, e-mails and web applications, client computing device  may execute appropriate applications to enable the aforementioned communication mechanisms.
