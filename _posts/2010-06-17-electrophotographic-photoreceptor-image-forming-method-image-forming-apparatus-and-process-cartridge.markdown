{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-149694 filed on Jun. 24, 2009 in Japanese Patent Office, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.","The present invention relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor (hereafter, also referred to merely as a photoreceptor), an image formation method, an image formation apparatus, and a process cartridge used for an electrophotographic image formation, and, in more detail, relates to an electrophotographic photoreceptor, an image formation method, an image formation apparatus and a process cartridge used for the electrophotographic image formation employed in the field of a copier or a printer.","Recently, there have been increased opportunities of using electrophotographic copiers or printers in the field of printing or color printing. There is a strong trend of requiring high quality digital black-and-white or color images in such fields of printing or color printing. In response to such a requirement, there has been proposed formation of high precision digital images by use of a short wavelength laser light (Patent Documents 1 and 2). However, the current condition is that even when forming a precise electrostatic latent image on an electrophotographic photoreceptor by use of a short wavelength laser light and reducing the exposure diameter, the finally obtained electrophotographic image does not achieve sufficiently high image quality.","The cause thereof is due to the fact that there were not sufficiently addressed newly generated problems in images obtained by imagewise exposure at relatively short wavelengths.","As a first problem, in a conventional photoreceptor developed for a longer wavelength laser light, light transmittance for a shorter wavelength laser light has not been fully enough, whereby no excellent sensitivity characteristics has been obtained. This is due to the light absorption range of a charge transport material extended to a portion of 400 nm or more. As a result, no uniform picture image cannot be obtained, for example, due to the effect of an uneven film thickness. On the other hand, a charge transport material which does not substantially have absorption in 400 nm or more had a problem in image stability because of the inferior light stability of the charge transport material. It was found by the present inventor that this problem can be overcome by employing a prescribed charge transport material as disclosed in Patent Document 3.","As a second problem, the transfer current increases as the diameter of the toner is decreased in order to obtain a higher quality image employing a short wavelength laser. When the transfer current is increased, a problem of transfer memory tends to occur in the photoreceptor. Specifically, in a photoreceptor employing a phthalocyanine pigment as a charge generation material, the transfer memory is easy to occur.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0007"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Patent Document 1","Japanese Patent Application Publication Open"]},{"entry":[{},"to Public Inspection (hereafter referred to as JP-A)"]},{"entry":[{},"No. 2000-250239"]},{"entry":["Patent Document 2","JP-A No. 2000-105479"]},{"entry":["Patent Document 3","JP-A No. 2007-108314"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photoreceptor in which deterioration of the stability in potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use is prevented while exhibiting a high transfer property and an excellent suppression effect of a transfer memory even when a high density electrostatic latent image is formed on the electrophotographic photoreceptor by using light of a wavelength of 350-500 nm, as well as to provide an image forming method, an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge, each employing aforementioned electrophotographic photoreceptor.","It was found in the present invention that, by simultaneously employing (i) a charge generation material having a prescribed crystal structure and a suitable particle diameter, and (ii) a prescribed charge transfer material exhibiting an excellent transmittance of light having a shorter wavelength, an electrophotographic photoreceptor which simultaneously overcomes the above first and second problems, improves the transmittance of light of a short wavelength laser (sensitivity to light of a short wavelength laser), prevents deterioration of the stability in electric potential due to light degradation and due to repeated use, and improves the problem of a transfer memory, can be obtained.","The aforementioned object of the present invention is attained by the following structures.\n\n","the charge generation layer comprises a titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having a crystal structure exhibiting the following peaks of Bragg angles 20 (\u00b10.2\u00b0) of X-ray powder diffraction employing a characteristic X-ray of a CuK\u03b1 radiation (having a wavelength of 1.542 \u212b):\n\n","the charge transport layer comprises a compound represented by Formula (1) or (2):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0017"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"34.46mm","wi":"72.98mm","file":"US08241824-20120814-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Rand Reach represent an alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having 1-5 carbon atoms;

The technique which applied the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment of this crystal form to a electrophotography photoreceptor has been disclosed, for example, in JP-A No. 2006-276829.","However, when the photoreceptor employing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment of this crystal form is used in an image forming method in which an imagewise exposure employing light of a short wavelength laser (emitting light of wavelength of 350 nm-500 nm) is carried out, deterioration of sensitivity under repeated use or occurrence of transfer memory tends to occur. In the present invention, as the result of intensive investigation, it was found that these problems can be overcome by laminating a charge transport layer containing a compound represented by above Formula (1) or (2) on the charge generation layer containing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having the aforementioned crystal structure.","The method of preparing the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment having the aforementioned crystal structure has been disclosed, for example, in JP-A No. 2006-276829.","The method to obtain the crystal structure of the titanyl phthalocyanine pigment according to the present invention and description of the compound represented by Formula (1) or (2) will be mentioned below.","(Method to Obtain the Crystal Structure of the Titanyl Phthalocyanine Pigment According to the Present Invention)","The synthetic method of a titanyl phthalocyanine crystal of having the prescribed crystal structure employed in the present invention here will be described.","The synthesis method of a crude titanyl phthalocyanine crystal will be described. The synthetic method of a phthalocyanine compound has been known for many years.","For example, a method to heat a mixture of a phthalic anhydride, a metal or a metal halide and urea under existence or non-existence of a high boiling point solvent may be cited as a 1st method. In this case, a catalyst, such as an ammonium molybdate, is used together if needed. As a 2nd method, a ng point solvent may be cited. This method is used for phthalocyanine compounds, for example, aluminum phthalocyanine, indium phthalocyanine, oxo-vanadium phthalocyanine, oxo-titanium phthalocyanine and zirconium phthalocyanine, which cannot be synthesized by the 1st method. In a 3rd method, a phthalic anhydride or a phthalonitrile is reacted first with ammonia to form, for example, an intermediate such as 1,3-diiminoisoindrine, followed by heating with a metal halide in a high boiling point solvent. In a 4th method, a phthalonitrile compound is reacted with a metal alkoxide under existence of such as urea. The 4th method is an extremely useful method as a synthetic method of an electrophotographic material and extremely effectively used in the present invention, because halogenation (chlorination) of a benzene ring hardly occurs.","Next, a synthetic method of an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) will be described. This method includes dissolving phthalocyanine in a sulfuric acid, and diluting with water to re-deposit the crystal. An acid paste method or an acid slurry method can be applied for this method.","As a concrete method, the aforementioned crude material is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid of an amount of 10-50 times, insoluble matter is removed by filtering if necessary, and the product is gradually added to thoroughly cooled water or ice water of an amount of 10-50 times of the amount of the sulfuric acid to re-deposit titanyl phthalocyanine. After filtering the deposited titanyl phthalocyanine, it is washed with ion-exchanged water followed by filtering. This procedure is repeated until the filtrate exhibits neutrality. Finally, the product is washed with clean ion-exchanged water, and then filtered to obtain a water paste having a solid content of 5-15% by mass.","It is important to reduce the amount of residual sulfuric acid as small as possible by thoroughly washing the deposit with ion-exchanged water. Specifically, it is preferable that the ion-exchanged water after washing shows the following property values. Namely, the amount of residual sulfuric acid can be expressed in terms of a pH value or a specific conductance of the ion-exchanged water after washing. When it is expressed with a pH value, it is desirable that the pH value is in the range of 6-8. When the pH value is in this range, it can be concluded that the amount of residual sulfur is an amount which hardly affect the property of the photoreceptor. When the amount of residual sulfuric acid is expressed with a specific conductance, it is desirable that the specific conductance is not more than 8 \u03bcS\/cm, more preferably not more than 6 \u03bcS\/cm and still more preferably not more than 3 \u03bcS\/cm. When the specific conductance is in this range, it can be concluded that the amount of residual sulfur is an amount which hardly affect the property of the photoreceptor. The pH value or the specific conductance of out of the above range is not preferred since the amount of residual sulfuric acid is too large, whereby the chargeability of the photoreceptor may be lowered or the light sensitivity may be deteriorated.","The titanyl phthalocyanine thus prepared an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine). It is preferable that the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) exhibits at least a largest peak in 7.0\u00b0-7.5\u00b0 of diffraction peaks (\u00b10.2\u00b0) of Bragg angles 2\u03b8 in X-ray diffraction employing a characteristic X-ray of a CuK\u03b1 radiation (having a wavelength of 1.542 \u212b). It is specifically preferable that the half height width of the diffraction peak is 1\u00b0 or more. Further, it is preferable that the average particle diameter of the primary particles is 0.1 \u03bcm or less.","Next, the transformation method of the crystal will be described.","The transformation of the crystal is a process in which the aforementioned amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) is transformed into a crystalline titanyl phthalocyanine having a crystal structure exhibiting the following Bragg angles 2\u03b8 (\u00b10.2\u00b0) of X-ray diffraction employing a characteristic X-ray of a CuK\u03b1 radiation (having a wavelength of 1.542 \u212b):","at least a largest diffraction peak at 27.2\u00b0,","major diffraction peaks at 9.4\u00b0, 9.6\u00b0 and 24.0\u00b0, and","a diffraction peak of a lowest angle at 73\u00b0","while exhibiting no peak between the peaks of 7.3\u00b0 and 9.4\u00b0 and no peak at 26.3\u00b0.","As a specific method, aforementioned amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) without drying is mixed with an organic solvent under existence of water and stirred to obtain the aforementioned crystal structure.","As the organic solvent used in this process, any organic solvent may be used as far as a desired crystal structure is obtained, however, a preferable result is obtained when one of tetrahydrofuran, toluene, methylene chloride, carbon disulfide, o-dichlorobenzene and 1,1,2-trichloroethane is selected. These organic solvents is preferably used alone, however, a mixture of two or more of these organic solvents or a mixture of one of the above organic solvents and other solvent may be used. The amount of the aforementioned organic solvent used for transformation of the crystal structure is preferably 10 times or more and more preferably 30 times or more of the mass of the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine). This is because the crystal structure can be quickly transformed and because the impurity contained in the amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) can be fully removed. The amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) used herein is prepared via an acid paste method. It is preferable to use an amorphous titanyl phthalocyanine (low crystallinity titanyl phthalocyanine) from which sulfuric acid is fully removed as aforementioned. When the transformation of the crystal structure is carried out while sulfuric acid is remained, ions of sulfuric acid remain in the crystal particles which cannot be fully removed even when the procedure described in the washing process is conducted. When sulfuric acid is remained in the crystal, the sensitivity and chargeability of the photoreceptor may be lowered. For example, a method to transform the crystal structure by pouring a titanyl phthalocyanine dissolved in sulfuric acid into an organic solvent together with ion-exchanged water has been disclosed. In this method, a titanyl phthalocyanine exhibiting X-ray diffraction peaks similar to the peaks observed in the titanyl phthalocyanine of the present invention. However, the concentration of sulfuric acid ion in the titanyl phthalocyanine is high, resulting in the inferior light attenuation property (light sensitivity), whereby being unfavorable as a preparation method of a titanyl phthalocyanine of the present invention.","Next, aforementioned compound represented by Formula (1) or (2) used for a charge transport layer will be described.","In above Formula (1), Rand Reach represent each represent an alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group having 1-5 carbon atoms; Rand Reach represent a substituted or non-substituted alkyl group having 1-5 carbon atoms or a substituted or non-substituted alkoxy group having 1-5 carbon atoms; n represents an integer of 0-2; o represents an integer of 0-3; l and m each represent an integer of 0-5; and A, B, C and D each represent a hydrogen atom, a substituted or non-substituted alkyl group, a substituted or non-substituted alkoxy group or a substituted or non-substituted aryl group, provided that A, B, C and D are not simultaneously a hydrogen atom.","Examples of an alkyl group represented by Ror Rinclude a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group and a pentyl group.

When the straightness and the swing width exceed the above-described ranges, good images are difficult to be formed.","As to the conductive material, a metal drum made of aluminum, nickel or the like, a plastic drum on which aluminum, tin oxide, indium oxide or the like is evaporated, and a paper or plastic drum on which a conductive material is coated are usable. The conductive support preferably has a specific resistance of 10\u03a9cm or less at room temperature. The conductive support of the present invention is most preferably an aluminum support. The aluminum support in which a component of manganese, zinc, magnesium or the like in addition to aluminum as a principal component is mixed is utilized. Intermediate layer","In the present invention, an intermediate layer is preferably formed between the conductive support and a photosensitive layer.","In the intermediate layer used in the present invention preferably contains metal oxide particles. Specifically, N-type semiconductor particles exhibiting N-type property are preferably contained. The N-type semiconductor particles refer to particles exhibiting the property of the main charge carrier being electrons. In other words, since the main charge carrier is electrons, the intermediate layer using N-type semiconductor particles exhibits properties of efficiently blocking hole-injection from the substrate and reduced blocking for electrons from the photosensitive layer.","Preferred metal oxide particles exhibiting an N-type semiconductor property preferably include titanium oxide (TiO) and zinc oxide (ZnO), of which the titanium oxide is specifically preferred.","Metal oxide particles employ those having a number average primary particle size of 3 to 200 nm, and preferably 5 to 100 nm. The number average primary particle size is a Feret-direction average diameter obtained in image analysis when N-type semiconductor particles are observed by a transmission electron microscope and 1,00 particles are randomly observed as primary particles from images magnified at a factor of 10000. In cases when the number average primary particle size of N-type semiconductor particles is less than 3.0 nm, it becomes difficult to disperse the N-type semiconductor particles in a binder constituting an intermediate layer and the particles are easily aggregated, so that the aggregated particles act as a charge trap, making it easy to cause a transfer memory.","When the number average primary particle size is more than 200 nm, N-type semiconductor particles cause unevenness on the intermediate layer surface, tendering to cause non-uniformity of dot images via such unevenness. Further, when the number average primary particle size is larger than 200 nm, N-type semiconductor particles easily precipitate in the dispersion, often causing deterioration of dot images.","Crystal forms of titanium oxide particles include, for example, an anatase type, a rutile type, a brookite type and an amorphous type. Of these, rutile type or anatase type titanium oxide particles effectively enhance rectification of a charge passing the intermediate layer. Thus, mobility of electrons is enhanced to stabilize the charge potential, and increase of residual potential is suppressed, contributing to high-density dot image formation, whereby most preferably used in the present invention.","Metal oxide particles are preferably those which were previously surface-treated with a polymer containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit. A polymers containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit and having a molecular weight of 1000 to 20000 effectuates enhanced surface treatment, resulting in enhanced rectifying capability of N-type semiconductor particles. Accordingly, the use of such metal oxide particles prevents occurrence of black spotting and is effective in optimal reproduction of dot images.","The polymer containing a methyl hydrogen siloxane unit is preferably a copolymer containing a structural unit of \u2014[HSi(CH)O]\u2014 and other structural unit (other siloxane units).

Such a high density of metal oxide particles in the intermediate layer results in enhanced rectification and even when the layer thickness is increased, neither an increase of residual potential nor spotting occur and black spots are effectively prevented, thereby forming an electrophotographic photoreceptor exhibiting little potential variation and capable of forming superior halftone images. The intermediate layer contains metal oxide particles preferably in an amount of 100 to 200 parts by volume.","On the other hand, as a binder resin to disperse the metal oxide particles, and to form a layer structure of the intermediate layer, for example, a polyamide resin, an alkyd resin or a resol type phenol resin is preferable in order to obtain excellent dispersibility of the metal oxide particles.
