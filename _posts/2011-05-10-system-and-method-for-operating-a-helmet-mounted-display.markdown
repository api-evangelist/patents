{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Heads-up displays (HUD) have been developed to allow a user to view information about the user's environment or activity without looking down at an instrument panel. HUD's are used in many applications including military and civilian vehicles, gaming systems, and medical devices. Helmet mounted displays (HMD's) are a type of HUD that feature a display attached to a user's helmet that moves with the user's head. The display may, for example, be incorporated in the user's visor or be incorporated into a monocular component. In military aviation applications, HMD's employ an indicator, such as a set of crosshairs, that moves with the orientation of the pilot's head to direct weapons, sensors, or other equipment toward a target. Systems and methods for improving and expanding the functionality of HMD's are needed.","The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102","102","104","100"]},"As shown in  and in the schematic illustration of , the system  includes a display system  which includes a display device , an image source  and an optical system . The display device  is a generally transparent device for displaying an image to the user. The image may include various combinations of information (also known as, \u201csymbology\u201d) related to weapon targeting and\/or vehicle operation. Examples of weapon targeting information include friendly and hostile target tracking, points of interest, and\/or a set of crosshairs or reticle for directional indication of vehicle-mounted weapon systems. Examples of vehicle operation information include airspeed (or ground speed for a ground-based vehicle), altitude, horizon, and heading. The information may be presented in alphanumeric format or graphical format. Further, displayed information may include generated images based upon visible or non-visible (e.g. infrared or acoustic) energy.","A suitable display device may be the visor  itself. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) is one example of an HMD system that uses the visor as a display device. Another example of a display device is a light-guide optical element (LOE) as used in the Scorpion Helmet Mounted Cueing System developed by Gentex Corp. of Carbondale, Pa. Projecting an image onto a transparent body such as the visor or LOE allows the user to view a scene of the environment beyond the image while viewing the information presented by the image in a \u201cheads-up\u201d position. The display device  may be monocular or binocular. The display device  may be integrated into the mounting platform  or may be installed or attached to an existing mounting platform. It is understood that the display device  may project onto any suitable portion of the mounting platform , an attachment to the platform, or other equipment in the environment. The display device  may display information in a single color or in multiple colors. Display cabling  may be used to connect the display device  to other components in the HMD system .","The image source  may employ any of a variety of technologies for image generation including cathode ray tube (CRT), light emitting diode (LED), liquid crystal display (LCD), liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS), digital micro-minor (DMD), organic light emitting diode (OLED), or plasma display panel (PDP) technologies. A combination of technologies may also be employed. The optical system  includes lenses, mirrors, filters, prisms, and\/or other optical components for delivering the image from the image source  to the user's eye.","The HMD system  further includes a tracking system  to track the user's helmet\/head motion and position. The tracking system  may, for example, track information related to head azimuth, head pitch, and head tilt. The tracking system  includes components that may be located on the helmet and other components that may be located at various positions within the environment. A suitable tracking system may be a mechanical tracking system that utilizes, for example, inertial tracking devices that incorporate gyroscopes or other mechanical devices that rely on a physical link between a fixed reference point and the helmet. A suitable tracking system may also be an electromagnetic tracking system that measures the strength of the magnetic fields generated by sending current through wire coils. Another suitable tracking system may be an acoustic tracking system that uses ultrasonic sound waves to measure the location of the helmet. Another suitable tracking system may be an optical tracking system that uses LED's positioned on the helmet and cameras positioned within the cockpit. The above described tracking systems are not meant to be limiting, and other tracking systems known in the art may also be suitable.","The HMD system  further includes a target system  that operates in concert with the tracking system  to conduct a targeted operation. As shown in , the target system  includes an indicator , such as a set of crosshairs with a central pipper or a reticle, which serves as a pointing device. The indicator  moves relative to a scene  of the environment as the user's head\/helmet is pointed toward a target. The target  system allows an action, such as a weapon firing or the activation of weapon-seeking sensors, to be directed within the environment toward the target, in the direction of the indicator .","The HMD system  further includes computer components such as a processor , and memory . These computer components process information and execute software to, for example, generate and update images for display on the display device . They may interface with computers or other components in the tracking system, targeting system, or other computers in the user's aircraft or environment. The computer components may be wearable by the user or may be installed elsewhere in the aircraft or environment.","Although the HMD system  can be used to direct weapon firing, it may also be configured for other actions that use point and select operations to initiate or control an activity. Such actions may include display control operations, display calibration operations, or other operations that use menu or icon driven selection functions. In one embodiment, as shown in , a user interface image  is projected onto the view of the scene  of the environment. In this embodiment, the user interface image  is a menu for controlling the setup of the HMD system . The user interface image  appears stationary or fixed relative to the scene  as movement of the user's head causes movement of the crosshairs  relative to the scene and the image. For example, in , the crosshairs are trained on a menu item . To retrain the crosshairs on menu item , the angle of the head of the user is moved downward (Y direction) and toward the user's right (X direction). As shown in , this reorientation of the user's head has the effect of moving the crosshairs  to the menu item . As shown in , the menu  remained fixed relative to the scene  as the crosshairs  move relative to the scene and the stationary menu.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","132","122","123","122","134","120","123","122","136","122","123","122"]},"At step , (as shown in ) as the user's gaze or head direction moves from menu item  to menu item , the crosshairs  move relative to the scene  and the menu  from a position trained on menu item  to a position trained on menu item . At step , an action is initiated based upon a selection command entered by the user. For example, with the crosshairs  trained on the menu item , the user may depress a selection control button  on a control column  () in the user's vehicle to initiate the function associated with menu item . Alternatively, the function associated with menu item  may be initiated by other acts of the user including the utterance of an oral command, a movement of the user's body, a stroke of a key, or other known selection acts.","As shown in , a control column  located in the user vehicle (not shown) includes multiple selection controls . The control column also includes arrow keys . In an alternative embodiment, the indicator may be moved relative to the menu with the arrow keys, rather than the based on the orientation of the user's head. The control column  may be a hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS).","The menu items of image  may correspond to various helmet control functions. The displayed menu items may be grouped in menus and submenus based upon likely priority to the user.","Priority 1 control functions are functions that are immediately needed and may include: TURN POWER ON, TURN POWER OFF, INCREASE BRIGHTNESS, DECREASE BRIGHTNESS, and COURSE CORESIGHT.","Priority 2 control functions are functions that may be needed quickly and may include: HOVER SYMBOLOGY MODE, FLIGHT SYMBOLOGY MODE, VIDEO ON, VIDEO OFF, and DESIGNATE POSITION AS SYMBOL.","Priority 3 control functions are functions that may be used frequently and may include: CLUTTER, DECLUTTER, SLAVE SENSOR TO HELMET, LOCK SENSOR, SYMBOL IS TARGET, SYMBOL IS WAYPOINT, SYMBOL IS FRIENDLY, SYMBOL IS UNKNOWN, SYMBOL IS POINT OF INTEREST, SLEW DESIGNATED SYMBOL LEFT, SLEW DESIGNATED SYMBOL RIGHT, SLEW DESIGNATED SYMBOL UP, and SLEW DESIGNATED SYMBOL DOWN.","Priority 4 control functions are functions that may be used only two to five times per flight and may include: VIDEO 1 SELECT and VIDEO 2 SELECT.","Priority 5 control functions are functions that may be used only one or two times per flight and may include: GO TO BORESIGHT SYMBOLOGY MODE, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST UP, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST DOWN, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST LEFT, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST RIGHT, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST ROTATE RIGHT, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST ROTATE LEFT, FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST HELMET REFERENCED SYMBOLOGY ADJUST ROTATE RIGHT, and FINE BORESIGHT ADJUST HELMET REFERENCED SYMBOLOGY ADJUST ROTATE LEFT.","Priority 6 control functions are functions that are used once every few flights and may include: INITIATE BUILT-IN-TEST.","As shown in , an alternative user interface image  includes arrow icons - which point to control selection menu items -. As described above for image , the user interface image  is displayed on the display device  and remains fixed relative to the scene of the environment as the user's helmet is moved. For example, to increase the brightness of the indicator  or of other graphics or text displayed on the display device , the user's head is directed toward control selection item . In this embodiment the indicator  is shown as a selection box. With the indicator  positioned on item  in response to the direction of the user's head, the user initiates a selection command to increase the brightness of the display. Alternatively, the \u201cup arrow\u201d key on the control column may be pressed by the user to increase the brightness of the display.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["170","172","182","122","170","106","172","172","120","120","172"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 10","b":["190","172","170","192","204","122","190","106","194","120","120","194"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 11","b":["210","212","106","214","214","214","210","216","214","216","218","218","214","216","218","220","222","122","218","106","214","220","214","220","214","222","214","222","214","222"],"i":["a","b","c ","a ","b ","b ","c ","c ","c "]},"In an alternative embodiment, status or other equipment related information may be displayed without positioning a cross-hairs on equipment within the cockpit. Rather, the position of the user's helmet relative to an instrument or other item of equipment may, without further selection or initiation by the user, cause information to become displayed to the user. For example, when the user's helmet is positioned such that the user would be viewing the fuel gauge in a cockpit, other more detailed information about fuel status may be displayed on a user interface image. This image may appear to the user on the display device, without further selection or initiation by the user. In other words, the position of the user's helmet provides the selection action needed to initiate the display of the user interface image. In another alternative embodiment, a user interface image with predetermined menu or other information items may be displayed whenever the user's helmet is positioned such that the user's view is directed toward an non-instrumented portion of the cockpit, such as an overhead ceiling space or a bulkhead. When the user's view is directed toward one of these unused portions of the cockpit, menus or other information may be displayed for user reference or to initiate selection and activity.","Although specific examples have been provided above, it is understood that the HMD systems of this disclosure may be used in other applications. Generally, the crosshairs of the HMD system may be used to select and initiate the viewing of main menus, context menus, status reports, operational information and other information associated with equipment in the user's environment. In other embodiments, as described, information may be displayed based upon the position of the user's helmet, without further selection or initiation by the user. In medical applications, for example, the HMD system could be used by a quadriplegic patient to control instruments on a control panel, while the patient is stationary or in a moving vehicle, by directing the patient's head at the control instrument. In gaming applications, for example, the HMD system could be used by a stationary or moving player to gain information or control equipment using the position of the user's helmet.","The foregoing outlines features of selected embodiments so that those skilled in the art may better understand the aspects of the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they may readily use the present disclosure as a basis for designing or modifying other processes and structures for carrying out the same purposes and\/or achieving the same advantages of the embodiments introduced herein.
