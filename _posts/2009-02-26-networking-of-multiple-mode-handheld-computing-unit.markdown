Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to computing devices used in such communication systems.","2. Description of Related Art","Communication systems are known to support wireless and wire lined communications between wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices. Such communication systems range from national and\/or international cellular telephone systems to the Internet to point-to-point in-home wireless or wired networks. The wireless and\/or wire lined communication devices may be personal computers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDA), cellular telephones, personal digital video players, personal digital audio players, global positioning system (GPS) receivers, video game consoles, entertainment devices, etc.","Many of the communication devices include a similar basic architecture: that being a processing core, memory, and peripheral devices. In general, the memory stores operating instructions that the processing core uses to generate data, which may also be stored in the memory. The peripheral devices allow a user of the communication device to direct the processing core as to which operating instructions to execute, to enter data, etc. and to see the resulting data. For example, a personal computer includes a keyboard, a mouse, and a display, which a user uses to cause the processing core to execute one or more of a plurality of applications.","While the various communication devices have a similar basic architecture, they each have their own processing core, memory, and peripheral devices and provide distinctly different functions. For example, a cellular telephone is designed to provide wireless voice and\/or data communications in accordance with one or more wireless communication standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth, advanced mobile phone services (AMPS), digital AMPS, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), local multi-point distribution systems (LMDS), multi-channel-multi-point distribution systems (MMDS), radio frequency identification (RFID), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), and\/or variations thereof). As another example, a personal digital audio player is designed to decompress a stored digital audio file and render the decompressed digital audio file audible.","Over the past few years, integration of the some of the communication device functions into a single device has occurred. For example, many cellular telephones now offer personal digital audio playback functions, PDA functions, and\/or GPS receiver functions. Typically, to load one or more of these functions, files, or other applications onto a handheld communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone, a personal digital audio and\/or video player, a PDA, a GPS receiver), the handheld communication device needs to be coupled to a personal computer or laptop computer. In this instance, the desired application, function, and\/or file is first loaded on to the computer and then copied to the handheld communication device; resulting in two copies of the application, function, and\/or file.","To facilitate such loading of the application, function, and\/or file in this manner, the handheld communication device and the computer each require hardware and corresponding software to transfer the application, function, and\/or file from the computer to the handheld communication device. As such, two copies of the corresponding software exist as well as having two hardware components (one for the handheld device and the second for the computer). In addition to the redundancy of software, timing issues, different versions of the software, incompatible hardware, and a plethora of other reasons cause the transfer of the application, function, and\/or file to fail.","In addition to integration of some functions into a single handheld device, handheld digital audio players may be docked into a speaker system to provide audible signals via the speakers as opposed to a headphone. Similarly, a laptop computer may be docked to provide connection to a full size keyboard, a separate monitor, a printer, and a mouse. In each of these docking systems, the core architecture is not changed.","Due to the portable nature of the handheld devices and the increasing functionality of them, there may arise situations where it is desirable to form an ad hoc wireless network between two or more handheld devices. There are a variety of current implementations for facilitating wireless communication between two or more handheld devices. Such implementations include Bluetooth connections, infrared connections, direct connection IEEE 802.11, etc. While each of these implementations allow devices to communication with each other directly, they lack an extend mode of operation.","Therefore, a need exists for a computing device that includes a handheld computing unit and an extended computing unit, wherein the handheld computing unit may function in a network mode.","The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods of operation that are further described in the following Brief Description of the Drawings, the Detailed Description of the Invention, and the claims. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention made with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","12","16","14"]},"In general, the handheld computing unit  includes the primary processing module (e.g., central processing unit), the primary main memory, and the primary hard disk memory for the computing device . In this manner, the handheld computing unit  functions as the core of a personal computer (PC) or laptop computer when it is docked to the extended computing unit and functions as a cellular telephone, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, a personal digital assistant, and\/or other handheld electronic device when it is not docked to the extended computing unit.","In addition, when the handheld computing unit  is docked to the extended computing unit , files and\/or applications can be swapped therebetween. For example, assume that the user of the computing device  has created a presentation using presentation software and both reside in memory of the extended computing unit . The user may elect to transfer the presentation file and the presentation software to memory of the handheld computing unit . If the handheld computing unit  has sufficient memory to store the presentation file and application, then it is copied from the extended computing unit memory to the handheld computing unit memory. If there is not sufficient memory in the handheld computing unit, the user may transfer an application and\/or file from the handheld computing unit memory to the extended computing unit memory to make room for the presentation file and application.","With the handheld computing unit  including the primary components for the computing device , there is only one copy of an application and\/or of a file to support PC functionality, laptop functionality, and a plurality of handheld device functionality (e.g., TV, digital audio\/video player, cell phone, PDA, GPS receiver, etc.). In addition, since only one copy of an application and\/or of a file exists (other than desired backups), special software to transfer the applications and\/or files from a PC to a handheld device is no longer needed. As such, the processing module, main memory, and I\/O interfaces of the handheld computing unit  provide a single core architecture for a PC and\/or a laptop, a cellular telephone, a PDA, a GPS receiver, a personal digital audio player, a personal digital video player, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["12","14","28","36","38","30","32","34","26","28","14"]},"As is also shown, the extended computing unit  is coupled to a monitor , a keyboard, a mouse , and a printer .

In addition, the extended computing unit  may have a form factor similar to a personal computer and\/or a laptop computer. For example, for in-home or in-office use, having the extended computing unit with a form factor similar to a PC may be desirable. As another example, for traveling users, it may be more desirable to have a laptop form factor.","In this example, the handheld computing unit  is docked to the extended computer unit  and function together to provide the computing device . The docking of the handheld computing unit  to the extended computing unit  encompasses one or more high speed connections between the units  and . Such a high speed connection may be provided by an electrical connector, by an RF connector, by an electromagnetic connector, and\/or a combination thereof. In this mode, the handheld computing unit  and the extended computing  collectively function similarly to a personal computer and\/or laptop computer with a WLAN card and a cellular telephone card.","In this mode, the handheld computing unit  may transceive cellular RF communications  (e.g., voice and\/or data communications). Outgoing voice signals may originate at the VoIP phone  as part of a VoIP communication  or a microphone coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing voice signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming digital audio signals and that may be provided to a sound card within the extended computing unit for presentation on speakers or provided to the VoIP phone via as part of a VoIP communication .","Outgoing data signals may originate at the mouse , keyboard , image scanner, etc. coupled to the extended computing unit . The outgoing data signals are converted into digital signals that are subsequently converted to outbound RF signals. Inbound RF signals are converted into incoming data signals and that may be provided to the monitor , the printer , and\/or other character presentation device.","In addition, the handheld computing unit  may provide a WLAN transceiver for coupling to the WLAN router  to support WLAN RF communications  for the computing device . The WLAN communications  may be for accessing the internet  via modem , for accessing the entertainment server, and\/or accessing the entertainment receiver . For example, the WLAN communications  may be used to support surfing the web, receiving emails, transmitting emails, accessing on-line accounts, accessing on-line games, accessing on-line user files (e.g., databases, backup files, etc.), downloading music files, downloading video files, downloading software, etc. As another example, the computing device  (i.e., the handheld computing unit  and the extended computing unit ) may use the WLAN communications  to retrieve and\/or store music and\/or video files on the entertainment server; and\/or to access one or more of the entertainment components  and\/or the entertainment receiver .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["12","14","28","36","38","30","32","34","26","28","14"]},"As is also shown, the extended computing unit  is coupled to a monitor , a keyboard, a mouse , and a printer .

In addition, the extended computing unit  may have a form factor similar to a personal computer and\/or a laptop computer.","In this example, the handheld computing unit  is quasi docked  to the extended computer unit , where the handheld computing unit  functions as a stand-alone computer with limited resources (e.g., processing modules, user inputs\/outputs, main memory, etc. of the handheld computing unit) and limited access to the memory of the extended computing unit . The quasi docking  of the handheld computing unit  to the extended computing unit  is provided by an RF communication, where an RF transceiver of the handheld computing unit  is communicating with an RF transceiver of the extended computing unit . Depending on the bit rate of the RF connection, the handheld computing unit can access files and\/or applications stored in memory of the extended computing unit . In addition, the handheld computing unit  may direct the processing module of the extended computing unit  to perform a remote co-processing function, but the processing module of the handheld computing unit and the extended computing unit do not function as a multiprocessing module as they do when in the extended mode.","As an alternative, the quasi extended mode may be achieved by the handheld computing unit  communicating with the extended computing unit via the WLAN communication  and the WLAN router .

Alternatively stated, wireless communication functions of the handheld computing unit have their own operating system; user applications of the handheld computing unit have their own operating system; and system applications of the handheld computing unit have their own operating system.","In general, the kernel section  functions to connect an application to the hardware resources of a computing device. In this regard, the kernel section  manages the computing device's resources (e.g., multi-processing capabilities, processing module run time, main memory, hard disk memory, network throughput, I\/O devices, communication between hardware and software components, etc.) and provides the lowest-level software abstraction layer. Note that the kernel section  may include monolithic kernels and\/or micro-kernels.","The process management kernel section  provides one or more kernels to allow and support execution of one or more processes. A process is the execution of an application's operating instructions and several processes may be associated with the same application. When the handheld computing unit is in a remote mode, the HH processing module may function as a single central processing unit that executes one instruction at a time. In this embodiment, the HH processing module may use a time-sharing process to allow seemingly concurrent execution of multiple processes. In another embodiment, the HH processing module includes a multi-processor core that supports actual concurrent execution of multiple processes, where each processing core may use the time-sharing process to allow more processes to run at once. When the handheld computing unit  is in the extended mode or the network mode, the HH processing module and the EXT processing module or the other HH computing unit's processing modules function collectively to provide the multi-processor core. Note that each of the HH and EXT processing modules may include its own multi-processor core such that, when functioning collectively, the number of processors is further increase.","To run an application, a kernel of the process management kernel section  sets up an address space for the application, loads the file containing the application's code into memory, sets up a stack for the application and branches to a given location inside the application to start its execution. Several applications may be supported by using multi-tasking kernels, pre-emptive multi-tasking kernels, cooperative multi-tasking kernels, and\/or multiprocessing. A multi-tasking kernel schedules access to the HH processing module and\/or EXT processing module among a plurality of processes in an orderly manner. The scheduling may be done in a variety of ways including multiprogramming, time-sharing, and real-time.","A pre-emptive multi-tasking kernel allocates each process a slice of time and switches from process to process in accordance with the time slices to provide the illusion of concurrent execution. The size of the time slices may vary from process to process and may be adjusted and\/or reallocated based on priority of other processes. The kernel also provides a mechanism for the processes sharing the processing resources to communication with one another, which is generally referred to as inter-process communication (IPC), which may be done by sharing memory, message passing, and\/or a remote procedure calls.","A cooperative multi-tasking kernel allows a process to run uninterrupted until it makes a special request that tells the kernel it may switch to another process. The special request may be the result of a response to an inter-process communication or the process is waiting for an event to occur.","A multiprocessing kernel allows different processes and\/or threads to run on different processors (e.g., one or more of the HH processing modules and the EXT processing module). The kernel provides a synchronization mechanism to ensure that no two processors attempt to modify the same data at the same time.","The memory management kernel section  provides one or more kernels to control access to the HH main memory, the HH hard disk\/flash memory, the EXT main memory, and\/or the EXT hard disk\/flash memory. In general a memory management kernel has full access to the computing device's memory and controls a process' access to the memory. This includes establishing virtual addressing using paging and\/or segmentation. The virtual address spaces may be different for different processes (e.g., the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same virtual address). The operating system maintains a page table to track the virtual addresses association to physical addresses and the allocation of the virtual memory to particular processes. The virtual memory allocations are tracked so that when a process terminates, the memory used by that process can be made available for other processes. In this manner, the memory management kernel allows each process to function as if it the only process running.","The file system management kernel section  includes one or more kernels to control a file system for file storage and\/or file transfers. The file system uses the EXT hard disk\/flash memory, the EXT CD-ROM drive, the HH hard disk\/flash memory, etc. to store and organizes files and\/or applications for ease of finding and accessing. In an embodiment, the file system includes directories that associate file names with files. This may be done by connecting the file name to an index into a file allocation table. The directory structure may be flat (no subdirectories) or hierarchical (includes subdirectories). The directory may further include meta data regarding a file. The meta data may include file length, a byte count, time the file was last modified, file creation time and\/or date, time and\/or date the file was last accessed, any changes to the meta data, owner's identity, creator's identity, access permission settings, etc.","The file system may be a disk file system, a flash file system, a database file system, a transactional file system, and\/or a special purpose file system. In an embodiment, each of the various modes of the operating system has its own file system. For example, the remote mode operating system has a file system that utilizes the HH hard disk\/flash memory ; the quasi docked mode operating system has a file system that has a hierarchical preference for the HH hard disk\/flash memory  over the EXT hard disk\/flash memory ; and the docked mode operating system has a file system that has a hierarchical preference for the EXT hard disk\/flash memory  or the HH hard disk\/flash memory .","The I\/O device management kernel section  includes one or more kernels that manage I\/O device processing resource and\/or memory resource allocation requests. As an example, a process may need to access an I\/O device (e.g., the HH display), which is controlled by the kernel through a device driver. As a more specific example, to show the user something on the HH display, an application would make a request to the kernel, which would forward the request to its display driver, which plots the character\/pixel for display.","The operating system  may security features. The security may include levels: internal security and external security. The internal security is the protection of the computing device's resources from concurrently running applications performing the same process at the same time. In this instance, applications and\/or processes thereof are assigned a privilege level, which blocks less privileged applications and\/or processes from using certain hardware instructions, certain processing resources, accessing certain memory spaces, etc. When an application or process is blocked, it must ask a higher privileged application or process to perform the task for it.","For external security, the computing device may include a software firewall or an intrusion detection\/prevention system. The software firewall is configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating system.","The operating system  further includes graphical user interfaces (GUI) for the handheld computing unit and the extended computing unit. The GUI may be for a touch screen, a keypad, an LCD display, a monitor, and vary depending on the applications being used. For example, when the handheld computing unit is in a cellular telephone mode, the GUI may be adapted for the cell phone. As another example, when the handheld computing unit is a GPS receiver mode, the GUI may be adapted to for GPS operations.

The executing of the user application includes one or more processes that require access to the HH computing unit's resources. When a process needs a resource, it generates a service call and\/or evokes a trap. When the process service call or the trap is detected, the operating system transitions to the process kernel state  for a process service call, to the I\/O kernel mode for an I\/O service call, to the memory kernel mode  for a memory service call, or to the file system kernel mode for a file service system call. Assuming that the service call was a process service call, the operating system is in state  and beings to process the process service call. The process service call may be to have a series of operational instructions executed by the HH processing module, may be to store data, may be to read data, may be use certain data while executing the operational instructions, may be to display data, may be to receive data, etc.","If the process service call is to execute operational instructions, the process management kernel schedules the process for access to the HH processing module based on the state of the process. A process may be in a blocked state, a running state, or a ready state. If the process is in a blocked state, it is dependent on some other process, memory management function, and\/or file management function to be completed before it can execute its current task. When the dependency is removed, the process transitions into the ready state. The process remains in this state until the resource it has requested is allocated to it. When allocated, the process transitions to the running state.","After the process is scheduled and\/or the process is completed, the operating system transitions back to the user state . If the process service call includes requesting access to the processing module and to store the results, the operating system would also transition to the memory kernel state  and the file system kernel state  to fulfill the storage request service call.","When an I\/O device desires access to the processing module, to a file, and\/or to the memory, it issues an interrupt. When the operating system receives the interrupt, it transitions to the I\/O device kernel mode to process the interrupt, which may be for access to the file system, access to the processing module, and\/or access to the memory.

In addition to performing the network functions, the handheld computing units can simultaneously support standalone functions or extended functions via coupling to their respective extended computing units.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0192"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},"In example of operation, the processing module  receives outbound data (e.g., voice, audio, data, etc.) from one or more of the IO modules  of the three units. The processing module  converts the outbound data from the handheld computing unit and\/or the at least one other handheld computing unit into the outbound symbol stream. The RF transceiver converts the outbound symbol stream into an outbound RF signal.","The RF transceiver also converts an inbound RF signal into an inbound symbol stream. The processing module  converts the inbound symbol stream into inbound data for the handheld computing unit and\/or at least one other handheld computing unit. The processing module then provides the inbound data to the IO module of the appropriate handheld computing unit.","As may be used herein, the terms \u201csubstantially\u201d and \u201capproximately\u201d provides an industry-accepted tolerance for its corresponding term and\/or relativity between items. Such an industry-accepted tolerance ranges from less than one percent to fifty percent and corresponds to, but is not limited to, component values, integrated circuit process variations, temperature variations, rise and fall times, and\/or thermal noise. Such relativity between items ranges from a difference of a few percent to magnitude differences. As may also be used herein, the term(s) \u201coperably coupled to\u201d, \u201ccoupled to\u201d, and\/or \u201ccoupling\u201d includes direct coupling between items and\/or indirect coupling between items via an intervening item (e.g., an item includes, but is not limited to, a component, an element, a circuit, and\/or a module) where, for indirect coupling, the intervening item does not modify the information of a signal but may adjust its current level, voltage level, and\/or power level. As may further be used herein, inferred coupling (i.e., where one element is coupled to another element by inference) includes direct and indirect coupling between two items in the same manner as \u201ccoupled to\u201d. As may even further be used herein, the term \u201coperable to\u201d or \u201coperably coupled to\u201d indicates that an item includes one or more of power connections, input(s), output(s), etc., to perform, when activated, one or more its corresponding functions and may further include inferred coupling to one or more other items. As may still further be used herein, the term \u201cassociated with\u201d, includes direct and\/or indirect coupling of separate items and\/or one item being embedded within another item. As may be used herein, the term \u201ccompares favorably\u201d, indicates that a comparison between two or more items, signals, etc., provides a desired relationship. For example, when the desired relationship is that signal  has a greater magnitude than signal , a favorable comparison may be achieved when the magnitude of signal  is greater than that of signal  or when the magnitude of signal  is less than that of signal .","While the transistors in the above described figure(s) is\/are shown as field effect transistors (FETs), as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, the transistors may be implemented using any type of transistor structure including, but not limited to, bipolar, metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET), N-well transistors, P-well transistors, enhancement mode, depletion mode, and zero voltage threshold (VT) transistors.","The present invention has also been described above with the aid of method steps illustrating the performance of specified functions and relationships thereof. The boundaries and sequence of these functional building blocks and method steps have been arbitrarily defined herein for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries and sequences can be defined so long as the specified functions and relationships are appropriately performed. Any such alternate boundaries or sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention.","The present invention has been described above with the aid of functional building blocks illustrating the performance of certain significant functions. The boundaries of these functional building blocks have been arbitrarily defined for convenience of description. Alternate boundaries could be defined as long as the certain significant functions are appropriately performed. Similarly, flow diagram blocks may also have been arbitrarily defined herein to illustrate certain significant functionality. To the extent used, the flow diagram block boundaries and sequence could have been defined otherwise and still perform the certain significant functionality. Such alternate definitions of both functional building blocks and flow diagram blocks and sequences are thus within the scope and spirit of the claimed invention. One of average skill in the art will also recognize that the functional building blocks, and other illustrative blocks, modules and components herein, can be implemented as illustrated or by discrete components, application specific integrated circuits, processors executing appropriate software and the like or any combination thereof."],"heading":["STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT","INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S)","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 19"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
