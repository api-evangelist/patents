{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND INFORMATION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["With the advent of computers, interactive electronic communications, and the Internet, as well as advances in the realm of digital information, has come a reinvention of conventional techniques for customer support and helpdesk services. Traditionally, customer support services have been facilitated through telephony call centers, whereby participants converse via voice communications in order to resolve customer issues. Unfortunately, these conventional approaches have proven to be inefficient and expensive, as they are typically constrained by legacy infrastructures and corresponding technologies. With readily available, cost-effective broadband services and reductions in cost of computing equipment, mobile devices, and the like, new more advanced techniques for customer support and helpdesk services are desired.","Furthermore, telecommunication service providers are finding it increasingly more challenging to leverage their existing resources. Yet, as increasing numbers of individuals migrate from the use of traditional communications based technologies to synergistic multimedia platforms, traditional telecommunications service providers are being challenged to develop new services and features in order to remain competitive, as well as develop fresh sources of revenue to support their aging infrastructures.","Therefore, there is a need for an approach that provides effective and convenient techniques for managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services.","A preferred apparatus, method, and software for providing managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services are described. In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the preferred embodiments of the invention. It is apparent, however, that the preferred embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the preferred embodiments of the invention.","Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to instant communication (or chat)-based applications, it is contemplated that exemplary embodiments have applicability to other equivalent applications.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","103","105","101","107","107","107","107","107","109","101","111","107","107","113","105","100"],"i":["a","b","n ","a","n ","a","n "]},"It is recognized that providing high quality customer support is an integral part of many businesses, organizations, institutions, and the like (referred to as enterprises), that provide services, products, and information to various sectors (or markets), such as educational markets, production markets, supply markets, maintenance markets, financial markets, and the like. Typically, these enterprises go to great efforts trying to differentiate themselves, or otherwise gain competitive advantages, and unusually extend these efforts on the basis of customer support service alone. To this end, an enterprise will typically exhaust significant amounts of capital in order to provide increasingly higher levels of customer support, such as is in the case of customer support call centers. Namely, enterprises have traditionally sunk enormous amounts of money into legacy telephony systems in order to address customer needs via, for example, provisioning toll-free customer service telephone numbers for call centers so that customers can reach customer service representatives (or agents) when needed.","The convergence of legacy telephony and data communications within the telecommunications arena has enabled enterprises to realize certain cost-effective means for reaching customers, such as extending customer support in a variety of modes of communication, such as electronic mail, telephony calls, self-service portals, web pages, and the like. With the increasing popularity of the Internet, as well as instant communication, messaging, or chat-based applications, enterprises are beginning to seriously consider the potential advantages associated with the provisioning of chat-based customer support via live, virtual, and even mobile instant communication interfaces. With an increasing body of available customer support services and accompanying helpdesks that provide these customer support services, both customers and service providers alike are facing rather burdensome challenges associated with managing, monitoring, operating, publishing, searching, selecting, and supporting this ever growing population of helpdesks, as well as the communication channels, costs, and user experiences associated therewith. Moreover, conventional enterprises typically include many different branches, departments, subdivisions, and the like, each of which may implement one or more of their own helpdesks, making connecting customers to the most relevant, efficient helpdesk an even more onerous task.","It is noted that instant communication (or chat)-based customer support services are becoming more appealing to both customers and enterprises, largely due to the fact that chat-based sessions (and supporting infrastructures) are significantly less expensive for both parties as compared to corresponding telephony-based services. Even more so, customers tend to perceive the availability of instant communications as more effective. For example, customers generally feel as though they are able to access customer service agents more quickly.","Therefore, the approach of system , according to certain exemplary embodiments, stems from the recognition that extending chat-based customer support services through a managed helpdesk platform provides an effective and efficient technique for creating a network of helpdesks that may be associated with one or more service providers and, thereby, made available to customers in a seamless manner. That is, certain exemplary embodiments of system  enable service providers to register with the managed helpdesk platform, which is, in turn, configured to manage, monitor, operate, publish, and update the helpdesk(s) associated with the service provider(s). To this end, certain other exemplary embodiments of system  enable customers to discover (e.g., inquire about, search for, etc.) and be bridged to available ones of these helpdesk(s) that are, otherwise, considered \u201cbest suited\u201d to address and solve the particularized issues of these customers.","By way of example, platform  may comprise computing hardware (such as described with respect to ), as well as include (or have access to) one or more components or facilities configured to execute the processes described herein. According one embodiment, platform  may include or have access to portal , instant communication module , management logic , helpdesk queue(s) , publication and discovery system , monitoring system , and feedback system . It is contemplated, however, that platform  may embody many forms and include multiple and\/or alternative components. For example, it is contemplated that the one or more of the aforementioned components or facilities may be combined, located in separate structures, and\/or separate physical locations. In other words, a specific topology is not critical to embodiments of platform  or system .","In exemplary embodiments, platform  may execute one or more processes via, for example, management logic , for managing (or otherwise controlling) the establishment, bridging, transferring, and monitoring of instant communication sessions, as well as the queuing of these instant communication sessions in one or more helpdesk queues . It is noted that individual helpdesk queues  may be owned and operated by individual helpdesks of helpdesk network . To this effect, management logic  may also be configured to place instant communication sessions into one or more helpdesk queues , as well as share helpdesk queues  amongst one or more of the helpdesks associated with helpdesk network . When an instant communication session cannot be established, such as because a suitable helpdesk for resolving an issue of a customer does not exist or an instant communication session cannot be placed into an available helpdesk queue  because of, for example, system overloading, management logic  may be configured to notify the customer (e.g., via text message, electronic mail, telephony communication, etc.), as well as notify one or more administrators of platform . In this manner, the one or more administrators of platform  may efficiently deal with these issues, such as by registering additional helpdesks to helpdesk network , provisioning additional helpdesk queues (or overflow queues), etc.","Accordingly to exemplary embodiments, management logic  may provide one or more commands, directions, instructions, etc., to instant communication module  for establishing instant communication (or chat)-based sessions with one or more helpdesks based on various parameters, such as based on a business flow of a particular portal  from which a customer initiates a helpdesk query, questions answered by a customer during helpdesk inquiry processes, selection criteria, and the like. Establishment of instant communication sessions is examined in more detail in association with . However, in any event, management logic  may provide one or more commands, directions, instructions, etc., to instant communication module  for instructing instant communication module  to queue instant communications sessions based on various logical definitions. For example, instant communication sessions may be queued based on one or more predefined (or dynamically defined) fixed or variable ratios that are directly proportional to a capacity of one or more of helpdesk queues . It is noted that queue capacity may be defined as a product between a total number of agents associated with a particular helpdesk and a number of instant communication sessions being concurrently (or simultaneously) handled by the total number of agents of the helpdesk. According to various other exemplary embodiments, management logic  may be configured to instruct instant communication module  to distribute (and, when necessary, redistribute) instant communication session between helpdesk queues . For instance, a particular helpdesk may become unavailable (or effectively unavailable) due to various factors, such as helpdesk scheduling (e.g., hours of operation), helpdesk queue capacity, agent availabilities, wait times associated with bridging instant communication sessions between customers and agents of the helpdesk, and\/or any other suitable factors. As such, instant communication module  may be configured to, in response to one or more instructions provided by management logic , place instant communication sessions into one or more \u201coverflow\u201d queues . Namely, overflow queues  may be utilized by platform  to, in essence, queue helpdesk queues . In certain exemplary embodiments, overflow queues  may be ordered based on, for example, one or more priorities, such that instant communication sessions being overflowed into overflow queues  may be queued in association with one or more service level agreements corresponding to the customers and\/or helpdesk service providers of system . As such, instant communication module , in conjunction with management logic , enables platform  to automate and dynamically place (or, when necessary, redistribute) instant communications session based on one or more of the aforementioned scenarios. According to various other embodiments, management logic  may be configured to instruct instant communication module  to enable various instant communication bridging operations, such as one or more transferring or conferencing operations between agents and\/or helpdesks. It is noted that the execution of exemplary bridging operations are described in more with .","According to various embodiments, helpdesk management platform  may be implemented in one or more computing environments, including as a backend component (e.g., as a data server), as a middleware component (e.g., as an application server), as a front-end component (e.g., as a client computing device having a graphical user interface (GUI) or web-browsing application through which client computing devices can interact with a data server or application server), or as any combination thereof. Platform  may be interconnected by any form or medium capable of supporting data communication, such as one or more communication networks , e.g., a local area network (LAN), a metropolitan area network (MAN), a wide area network (WAN), the Internet, etc. Further, communication networks  may embody any telephony, packet-switched, or wireless network capable of transporting data and\/or supporting instant communication (or chat)-based customer support sessions. As such, system  may embody a client-server environment, a master-slave environment, a peer-to-peer environment, or any other suitable environment. Although depicted as separate entities, communication network(s)  may be completely or partially integrated with network(s) of helpdesks . For example, communication networks  may include facilities to provide for transport of packet-based and\/or telephony communications of the network(s) of helpdesks .","In exemplary embodiments, helpdesk networks  may be one or more physical and\/or logical aggregations of helpdesks that may be associated with one or more service providers. To this end, the helpdesks of helpdesk networks  may provide customer support services associated with various markets (or submarkets), such as educational markets, production markets, supply markets, maintenance markets, financial markets, and the like. As such, the helpdesks of helpdesk networks  may be geographically dispersed across numerous geographical regions or other logical divisions, which is illustrated in . As such, helpdesk management platform  may be configured to aggregate, manage, monitor, operate, publish, and update the helpdesks of varying regions and divisions.","As shown in , platform  is implemented as a backend data server accessible to one or more user devices -via one or more middleware application servers, e.g., portal . User devices -may interact with portal  via communication network(s)  utilizing, for example, browser application . According to one embodiment, portal  acts as an enterprise web portal that provides a consistent \u201clook and feel\u201d for access control and helpdesk management operations. Such an architecture, while not necessary, enables user devices -to be remotely dispersed (e.g., as by geography) from each other, as well as from platform , yet remain in collaboration with platform . Namely, portal  enables intelligent integration of and unified, real-time access to platform . To this end, it is noted that user devices -may be associated with various types of users, such as service provider administrators, customer service support agents, and customers. As such, portal  may, according to various exemplary embodiments, provide one or more customized portlets (e.g., user interfaces and\/or user interface components) arranged in one or more page layouts, which can be tailored to the various users, logical divisions (e.g., geographical regions, service providers, etc.), and\/or helpdesks of helpdesk networks . Thus, the varied users of platform  can be provided common sets of web-based, or otherwise networked, applications to consistently and efficiently facilitate customer support services according to the classification (e.g., service provider administrator, agent, customer, etc.) of the users. In this manner, portal  may be employed by service provider administrators for registering with the managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services of system  via, for example, user devices -. Administrators (and\/or customer service agents) may also employ portal  for updating various forms of business information associated with one or more of their helpdesks, such as, for example, acceptable forms of customers (e.g., common customers, enterprise customers, etc.), categories of service (e.g., health, technology, finance, etc.), description of services, modes of communication (e.g., electronic mail, instant communication, live chat, virtual chat, mobile chat, telephony, etc.), guides for utilizing the customer support services associated with various helpdesks, rates of service (e.g., capacity of customers capable of being serviced), and scheduling (e.g., helpdesk hours of operation, agent hours, etc.), as well as any other suitable information. Customers may utilize portal , via user devices -, to inquire about (or otherwise search for) helpdesk services of helpdesk networks  that are seamlessly made available to customers via platform .","According to exemplary embodiments, system  includes publication system  for registering service providers to the managed instant communication-based services of system , as well as facilitating customer discovery of available ones of these helpdesk(s) that are, otherwise, considered \u201cbest suited\u201d to address and solve the particularized issues of these customers. Thus, publication and discovery system  may communicate with platform  directly or via one or more networks, such as a corporate network (not illustrated) of the service provider of platform . It is also noted that system  may store the service provider information and\/or helpdesk information associated with service provider registration processes to any suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) system , such as service provider repository  and helpdesk information repository . As such, system  may be configured to push (either automatically or in response to a request) various forms of service provider and\/or helpdesk information to platform . In order to facilitate these communications, system  may include a communication interface (not shown) for transmitting information to platform , either \u201con-demand\u201d or as the result of a predefined schedule, such as continuously or periodically. Exemplary processes for registering service providers and facilitating helpdesk discovery procedures are respectively described in accordance with .","System  may also include monitoring system  for monitoring helpdesks of helpdesk network  and\/or helpdesk queues  associated therewith. For example, system  may monitor the number of instant communication sessions being received by the helpdesks of helpdesk network , the number of instant communication sessions being handled by customer service agents, the number of bridging operations performed in connection with the helpdesks and\/or agents, helpdesk and agent wait times, and\/or simultaneous instant communication sessions being supported by helpdesks and\/or agents, as well as any other suitable parameter, such as one or more metrics (e.g., bandwidth, congestion, throughput, latency, etc.) associated with service level agreements corresponding to the customers and\/or helpdesk service providers of system , or any parameter associated with helpdesk network , such as network topology, quality of service, total number of subscribers, etc. According to various embodiments, monitoring system  may communicate with platform  directly or via one or more networks, such as a corporate network (not illustrated) of the service provider of platform . It is also noted that monitoring system  may store the aforementioned parameters, statistics, etc., in the form of helpdesk information to any suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to) system , such as helpdesk information repository . To this end, monitoring system  may push (either automatically or in response to a request) certain helpdesk information to platform . As such, monitoring system  may include a communication interface (not shown) for transmitting helpdesk information to platform , either \u201con-demand\u201d or as the result of a predefined schedule, such as continuously or periodically. An exemplary process for monitoring helpdesk network  is described in more detail in association with .","According to certain other exemplary embodiments, system  may also include feedback system  configured to gather feedback information (e.g., ratings, open-ended customer responses, survey responses, etc.) corresponding to customer satisfaction with the managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services of system , as well as customer satisfaction with individual helpdesks and\/or customer service agents associated therewith. It is also noted that feedback information may be acquired from one or more of the helpdesk service providers, as well as gathered from one or more third-party sources. Still further, a service provider of platform  may also provide its own independent feedback information. In this manner, system  may communicate with platform  (and\/or one or more third party sources (not shown)) either directly or via one or more networks, such as a corporate network (not illustrated) of the service provider of platform . It is also noted that feedback system  may store feedback information to any suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to system ), such as feedback information repository . To this end, system  may push (either automatically or in response to a request) certain feedback information to platform . As such, system  may include a communication interface (not shown) for transmitting feedback information to platform , either \u201con-demand\u201d or as the result of a predefined schedule, such as continuously or periodically. An exemplary process for acquiring and implementing feedback information is described in more detail with .","To this end, platform  is configured to facilitate managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services over one or more communication networks . It is noted that communication networks  may be any suitable wireline, wireless, or combination thereof network. For example, communication networks  may include one or more telephony networks, such as a circuit-switched network, e.g., the public switched telephone network (PSTN), an integrated services digital network (ISDN), a private branch exchange (PBX), or other like network. Communication networks  may employ various wireless access technologies including, for example, code division multiple access (CDMA), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), Internet protocol multimedia subsystem (IMS), universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS), etc., as well as any other suitable wireless medium, e.g., microwave access (WiMAX), Long Term Evolution (LTE), wireless fidelity (WiFi), satellite, and the like. In other instances, communication networks may include a data network, such as any local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or any other suitable packet-switched network, such as a commercially owned, proprietary packet-switched network having voice over internet protocol (VoIP) capabilities, e.g., a proprietary cable or fiber-optic network. It is further contemplated that communication networks  may include components and facilities to provide for signaling and\/or bearer communications between the various components or facilities of system . In this manner, communication networks  may embody or include portions of a signaling system 7 (SS7) network, or other suitable infrastructure to support control and signaling functions.","In exemplary embodiments, user devices -may include any customer premise equipment (CPE) capable of sending and\/or receiving one or more forms of the aforementioned modes of communication (e.g., chat-based communications, electronic mail communications, facsimile communications, telephony communications, etc.), as well as send and receive information associated with one or more of the processes or features described herein. For instance, user devices -may include functionality for telephony-based communications, such as those functions employed by suitable plain old telephone service (POTS) devices, facsimile machines, and the like. user devices -may employ mobile (or otherwise wireless) functions, such as included in cellular phones, radiophones, satellite phones, smart phones, wireless phones, or any other suitable mobile device, such as personal digital assistants (PDA), pocket personal computers, tablets, customized hardware, etc. Further, user devices -may include computing device functions, such as implemented by any suitable computing device, e.g., VoIP phones, skinny client control protocol (SCCP) phones, session initiation protocol (SIP) phones, IP phones, personal computers, softphones, workstations, terminals, servers, and the like.","It is noted that user devices -include one or more components for extending instant communications sessions to users (e.g., instant communication applications ), as well as include one or more browser applications (e.g., browser application ) for accessing platform  and the features and functionalities thereof. It is contemplated, however, that browser applications  and\/or instant communication applications  (or any other suitable client program) may be executed via platform  (e.g., via instant communication module ) and, thereby, made accessible to users via user devices -. In this way, browser applications  and\/or instant communication applications  may provide one or more user interfaces, e.g., graphical user interfaces (GUI), configured to interact with the various services (or functions) of system . Exemplary GUIs are described in more detail in accordance with . Additionally (or alternatively), these or other GUI interfaces may be configured to facilitate the acquisitioning, exchanging, managing, sharing, storing, and updating of service provider information, helpdesk information, and feedback information, respectively stored to, for example, service provider information repository , helpdesk information repository , and feedback information repository . It is noted, however, that the service provider information, helpdesk information, and feedback information may be stored to any suitable storage location or memory of (or accessible to system ), such as memories (not shown) of platform , user devices -, portal , publication and discovery system , monitoring system , feedback system , etc.","According to various exemplary embodiments, repositories - may be maintained by a service provider of platform  and, thereby, of the managed instant communication-based helpdesk services of system  or by any suitable third-party. It is also contemplated that the physical implementation of repositories - may take on many forms, including, for example, portions of existing repositories of a service provider, new repositories of a service provider, third-party repositories, and\/or shared-repositories. As such, repositories - may be configured for communication over system  (e.g., over one or more of communication networks ) through any suitable messaging protocol, such as lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP), extensible markup language (XML), open database connectivity (ODBC), structured query language (SQL), Configuration Access Protocol (CAP) and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In those instances when repositories - are provided in a distributed fashions, information and content available via repositories - may be located utilizing any suitable querying technique, such as electronic number matching, distributed universal number discovery (DUNDi), uniform resource identifiers (URI), etc.","The operation of platform  and, thereby, of system , for providing the managed instant communication (or chat)-based helpdesk services are explained below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 1","FIGS. 4A-4C"],"b":["301","101","103","101","113","107","107","109","101","109","101","101","109","101"],"i":["a","n"]},"According to exemplary embodiments, formulated inquires may be supplied to publication and discovery system (or system)  for generating responses therefrom. Thus, in step , system  generates a response to the inquiry, which can be based on the one or more parameters provided by the customer. To this end, the response may indicate the particular helpdesks of helpdesk network  satisfying the parameter(s) specified by the customer. It is noted that the helpdesk(s) provided (e.g., listed) in the response may be associated with at least one service provider. Further, system  may, in certain exemplary embodiments, generate the response based on additional information, such as real-time status information (e.g., wait times, helpdesk availabilities, agent availabilities, and the like) corresponding to the multitude of helpdesks. As such, the response may be transmitted (or ported) to portal  for presentation to the customer via one or more of the aforementioned portlets. Accordingly, the customer may choose (or otherwise select) a helpdesk that they believe is \u201cbest\u201d suited for resolving their support issue. Thus, at step , management logic  and\/or instant communication module  receives, from the customer via portal , a selection of a particular helpdesk from the plurality of helpdesks of helpdesk network . Alternatively, management logic  and\/or system  may select the particular helpdesk from the plurality of helpdesks based on the one or more parameters of the inquiry, as well as based on one or more predefined selection criteria, e.g., threshold values associated with, for instance, the real-time status information associated with the plurality of helpdesks.","In any event, platform  establishes, via instant communication module , an instant communication session between the customer and the selected helpdesk, per step . At this point, the one or more porlets of portal  may cause browser application  of a user device (e.g., user device ) to execute (or access) an instant communication application (e.g., instant communication application ) for communicating with the selected helpdesk via, for instance, an instant communication (or chat)-based session. Referring momentarily to , graphical user interface (GUI)  provides the customer with an instant communication (or chat)-based interface  that presents (e.g., displays) a text dialogue between the customer and the selected helpdesk, which in this example is \u201cHELPDESK \u201d associated with \u201cSERVICE PROVIDER .\u201d Logo region  is provided so that the customer knows that they are connected to the support services of \u201cSERVICE PROVIDER .\u201d Input region  enables the customer to input text to graphical user interface , which may be transmitted to a corresponding participant of the instant communication via send button . In this example, once the instant communication session is established, \u201cHELPDESK \u201d may prompt the customer to \u201cPLEASE WAIT WHILE WE CONNECT YOU TO THE NEXT AVAILABLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGENT.\u201d","Referring back to , platform  determines, via management logic , one or more availabilities of the customer support agents (or agents) associated with the selected helpdesk based on, for example, presence information related to the agents, per step . The availabilities and\/or the presence information may be retrieved from a presence service (not shown) that may be operated and maintained by a service provider of the managed instant communication (or chat)-based services of system  or by any suitable third-party provider. An exemplary model for presence and presence determination are respectively detailed in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 2778 and 2779, which are incorporated herein, by reference, in their entireties. An exemplary data format for conveying presence information, as well as extensions to that format for conveying rich presence information, are respectively detailed in IETF RFCs 3863 and 4480, which are incorporated herein, by reference, in their entireties. Based on the availabilities of the agents, the instant communication session may be placed, at step , into a helpdesk queue (e.g., helpdesk queue ) for an agent associated with the selected helpdesk. In certain exemplary embodiments, instant communication module  may provide the customer, via an instant communication (e.g., message), with a projected wait time before an agent will be available to assist the customer with their support issue. Referring to , GUI  illustrates \u201cHELPDESK \u201d prompting the customer with status message  that provides the customer with projected wait time . It is contemplated that projected wait time  may be updated in real-time, periodically, or in an on-demand fashion. According to certain embodiments, projected wait time  may be updated in an \u201con-demand\u201d fashion by the customer messaging \u201cHELPDESK \u201d by inputting an \u201cUPDATE WAIT TIME\u201d message to input region  and transmitting the message to \u201cHELPDESK \u201d via send button . To this end, GUI  and status message  may be configured so that when updates to projected wait time  are provided, GUI  may simply update projected wait time  without reproducing the entirety of status message ; however, it is contemplated that GUI  may be simply configured to reproduce status message  with an updated projected wait time .","Thus, monitoring system (or system)  may be configured to monitor the availability of the agent, such that when the agent becomes available (e.g., is capable of supporting the instant communication session either alone or simultaneously with one or more other instant communication sessions), instant communication module  may seamlessly bridge the instant communication session between the customer and the available agent, per step . In this manner, instant communication application  may remain connected to a same instant communication session and, thereby, executing a same GUI. Referring to , GUI  illustrates that \u201cAGENT \u201d has been bridged into the instant communication session, such that \u201cAGENT \u201d may prompt the user with introductory message , e.g., \u201cHELLO MR. SMITH. I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH PRODUCT \u2018X.\u2019 CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME A LITTLE MORE ABOUT YOUR ISSUE?\u201d It is also noted that projected wait time  has been continuously or periodically updated to \u201c0 SECONDS,\u201d also indicating that the available agent, i.e., \u201cAGENT ,\u201d has been bridged to the instant communication session. As such, the customer and the agent may converse via GUI  that, according to certain embodiments, may also include one or more navigation elements (e.g., scroll bar ) for reviewing previous messages associated with the instant communication session, as well as include one or more user interface components for terminating the instant communication session, such as button .","As previously mentioned, platform  enables service providers to register with the managed instant communication (or chat)-based services of system .  is a flowchart of a process for registering a service provider to the managed instant communication (or chat)-based service, according to an exemplary embodiment. For illustrative purposes, the process is described with reference to . It is also noted that the steps of the process may be performed in any suitable order, as well as combined or separated in any suitable manner. At step , platform  receives registration information from a service provider via, for example, publication and discovery system . That is, an administrator, for example, may access platform  via one or more portlet applications of portal  that, in turn, are made available to the service provider via, for instance, browser application  executing on (or made accessible to) a corresponding user device, e.g., user device . To this end, the service provider may be provided access to one or more GUIs and associated interface tools (e.g., menus, options, selections, widgets, etc.) for passing registration information to platform  that, in exemplary embodiments, may correspond to standard enterprise profile information, e.g., name, objective, history, headquarters, management personnel, employees, locations, units (or divisions), revenue, clients (or customers), partners, awards, etc. It is noted that system  may store this registration information to any suitable storage location of (or accessible to) system , such as service provider information repository .","Utilizing the registration information, system  may preliminarily register the service provider to the managed instant communication-based helpdesk services of system , per step . In certain embodiments, system  may provide one or more usernames and passwords to the administrator to enable one or more individuals associated with the service provider to access and utilize the features and functionality of platform .","According to exemplary embodiments, management logic  generates, in step , a profit sharing policy (or contract) that the service provider may rely on and, in turn, be required to adhere to. The policy may specify one or more associated cost structures, profit sharing models, established groups of service providers, participation requirements, responsibilities, etc., of registered service providers, as well as expound upon the various management, monitoring, operation, publication, and updating services provided by platform . In certain exemplary embodiments, management logic  may be configured to cause one or more \u201chardcopies\u201d or \u201csoftcopies\u201d of these policies, contracts, etc., to be transmitted to the service provider for physical and\/or electronic approval (e.g., signatory approval, etc.).

An input device , such as a keyboard including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to the bus  for communicating information and command selections to the processor . Another type of user input device is a cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys, for communicating direction information and command selections to the processor  and for controlling cursor movement on the display .","According to an embodiment of the invention, the processes described herein are performed by the computer system , in response to the processor  executing an arrangement of instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions can be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as the storage device . Execution of the arrangement of instructions contained in main memory  causes the processor  to perform the process steps described herein. One or more processors in a multi-processing arrangement may also be employed to execute the instructions contained in main memory . In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the embodiment of the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . The communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  connected to a local network . For example, the communication interface  may be a digital subscriber line (DSL) card or modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card, a cable modem, a telephone modem, or any other communication interface to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of communication line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card (e.g. for Ethernet\u2122 or an Asynchronous Transfer Model (ATM) network) to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links can also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information. Further, the communication interface  can include peripheral interface devices, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) interface, etc. Although a single communication interface  is depicted in , multiple communication interfaces can also be employed.","The network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, the network link  may provide a connection through local network  to a host computer , which has connectivity to a network  (e.g. a wide area network (WAN) or the global packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d) or to data equipment operated by a service provider. The local network  and the network  both use electrical, electromagnetic, or optical signals to convey information and instructions. The signals through the various networks and the signals on the network link  and through the communication interface , which communicate digital data with the computer system , are exemplary forms of carrier waves bearing the information and instructions.","The computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), the network link , and the communication interface . In the Internet example, a server (not shown) might transmit requested code belonging to an application program for implementing an embodiment of the invention through the network , the local network  and the communication interface . The processor  may execute the transmitted code while being received and\/or store the code in the storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution. In this manner, the computer system  may obtain application code in the form of a carrier wave.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as the storage device . Volatile media include dynamic memory, such as main memory . Transmission media include coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires that comprise the bus . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic, optical, or electromagnetic waves, such as those generated during radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) data communications. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, optical mark sheets, any other physical medium with patterns of holes or other optically recognizable indicia, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a computer can read.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in providing instructions to a processor for execution. For example, the instructions for carrying out at least part of the embodiments of the invention may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. In such a scenario, the remote computer loads the instructions into main memory and sends the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem of a local computer system receives the data on the telephone line and uses an infrared transmitter to convert the data to an infrared signal and transmit the infrared signal to a portable computing device, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a laptop. An infrared detector on the portable computing device receives the information and instructions borne by the infrared signal and places the data on a bus. The bus conveys the data to main memory, from which a processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory can optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by processor.","While certain exemplary embodiments and implementations have been described herein, other embodiments and modifications will be apparent from this description.
