No. 09\/840,769, filed Apr. 24, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,633,600, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/444,079, filed Nov. 22, 1999, now U.S. Pat.

The past needs created by these services have been partially satisfied by wireless radio services, such as fixed or mobile frequency division multiplex (FDM), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiplex (TDM), time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, combination frequency and time division systems (FD\/TDMA), and other land mobile radio systems. Often, these remote services are faced with more potential users than can be supported simultaneously by their frequency or spectral bandwidth capacity.","Recognizing these limitations, recent advances in wireless communications have used spread spectrum modulation techniques to provide simultaneous communication by multiple users. Spread spectrum modulation refers to modulating a information signal with a spreading code signal; the spreading code signal being generated by a code generator where the period Tc of the spreading code is substantially less than the period of the information data bit or symbol signal. The code may modulate the carrier frequency upon which the information has been sent, called frequency-hopped spreading, or may directly modulate the signal by multiplying the spreading code with the information data signal, called direct-sequence spreading (DS). Spread-spectrum modulation produces a signal with bandwidth substantially greater than that required to transmit the information signal, and synchronous reception and despreading of the signal at the receiver demodulator recovers the original information. The synchronous demodulator uses a reference signal to synchronize the despreading circuits to the input spread-spectrum modulated signal in order to recover the carrier and information signals. The reference signal can be a spreading code which is not modulated by an information signal. Such use of a synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald L. Schilling, which is incorporated herein by reference.","Spread-spectrum modulation in wireless networks offers many advantages because multiple users may use the same frequency band with minimal interference to each user's receiver. Spread-spectrum modulation also reduces effects from other sources of interference. In addition, synchronous spread-spectrum modulation and demodulation techniques may be expanded by providing multiple message channels for a user, each spread with a different spreading code, while still transmitting only a single reference signal to the user. Such use of multiple message channels modulated by a family of spreading codes synchronized to a pilot spreading codes for wireless communication is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,951 entitled HIGH CAPACITY SPREAD-SPECTRUM CHANNEL by Donald L. Schilling, which is incorporated herein by reference.","One area in which spread-spectrum techniques are used is in the field of mobile cellular communications to provide personal communication services (PCS). Such systems desirably support large numbers of users, control Doppler shift and fade, and provide high speed digital data signals with low bit error rates. These systems employ a family or orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal spreading codes, with a pilot spreading code sequence synchronized to the family of codes. Each user is assigned one of the spreading codes as a spreading function. Related problems of such a system are: supporting a large number of users with the orthogonal codes, handling reduced power available to remote units, and handling multipath fading effects. Solutions to such problems include using phased-array antennas to generate multiple steerable beams, using very long orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal code sequences which are reused by cyclic shifting of the code synchronized to a central reference, and diversity combining of multipath signals. Such problems associated with spread spectrum communications, and methods to increase capacity of a multiple access, spread-spectrum system are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,901,307 entitled SPREAD SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING SATELLITE OR TERRESTRIAL REPEATERS by Gilhousen et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.","A wireless communication unit comprises circuitry configured to receive a voice data associated with a first logical channel. The circuitry further configured to receive a non-voice data associated with a second logical channel. The voice data and non-voice block carried by a wireless channel set during a time period. The wireless channel set comprises a plurality of wireless channels. The wireless channel is associated with the communication unit. Circuitry is configured to insert information into the non-voice data, when the non-voice data is missing in the wireless channel set during the time period.","Referring to , the radio links  to  incorporate Broadband Code Division Multiple Access (B-CDMA\u2122) as the mode of transmission in both the Uplink and Downlink directions. CDMA (also known as Spread Spectrum) communication techniques used in multiple access systems are well-known, and are described in U.S. Pat. No.5,228,056 entitled SYNCHRONOUS SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD by Donald T. Schilling which is incorporated herein by reference. The described exemplary system uses the Direct Sequence (DS) spreading technique. In each modem, one or more CDMA modulators performs the spread-spectrum spreading code sequence generation. In addition, the modems generate, for example, a pseudonoise (PN) spreading sequence; and perform complex DS modulation to produce quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) signals for the In-phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) channels. Pilot signals are generated and transmitted with the modulated signals. The pilot signals of the present embodiment are spreading codes which are not modulated by data. The pilot signals are used for system synchronization, carrier phase recovery, and for estimating the impulse response of the radio channel. Each SU includes a single pilot generator and at least one CDMA modulator and demodulator, called a CDMA modem. Each RCS , ,  has a single pilot generator plus sufficient CDMA modulators and demodulators for all the logical channels in use by all SUs.","The CDMA demodulator despreads the signal, with appropriate processing to combat or exploit multipath propagation effects. Parameters concerning the received power level are used to generate the Automatic Power Control (APC) information which, in turn, is transmitted to the other end (i.e. from the SU to the RCS or from the RCS to the SU). The APC information is used to control transmit power of the automatic forward power control (AFPC) and automatic reverse power control (ARPC) links. In addition, each RCS ,  and  may perform Maintenance Power Control (MPC), in a manner similar to APC, to adjust the initial transmit power of each SU , , ,  and .","Diversity combining at the radio antennas of the RCS ,  and  is not necessary because CDMA has inherent frequency diversity due to the spread bandwidth. Receivers may include Adaptive Matched Filters (AMFs) (not shown in ), however, which combine the multipath signals. In the exemplary embodiment, AMFs perform Maximal Ratio Combining.","Logical Communication Channels","A \u201cchannel\u201d of the prior art is usually regarded as a communications path which is part of an interface and which can be distinguished from other paths of that interface without regard to its content. In the case of CDMA, however, separate communications paths are distinguished only by their content. The term \u201clogical channel\u201d is used to distinguish the separate data streams, which are logically equivalent to channels in the conventional sense. All logical channels and sub-channels of the present invention are mapped to a common 64 kilo-symbols per second (ksym\/s) QPSK stream. Some channels are synchronized to associated pilot codes which are generated in the same way and perform much the same function as the system Global Pilot Code. The system pilot signals are not, however, considered logical channels.","Several logical communication channels are used over the RF communication link between the RCS and SU. Each logical communication channel has either a fixed, pre-determined spreading code or a dynamically assigned spreading code. For both pre-determined and assigned codes, the code phase is in synchronism with the Pilot Code. Logical communication channels are divided into two groups: the Global Channel (GC) group includes those channels which are either transmitted from the base station RCS to all the remote SUs or from any SU to the RCS of the base station regardless of the SU's identity. These channels contain for all users and include the channels used by SUs to gain access to message communication channels. Channels in the Assigned Channels (AC) group are those channels which are dedicated to communication between the RCS and a particular SU.","The Global Channels (GC) group provides for 1) Broadcast logical channels, which provide point to multipoint services for broadcasting messages to all SUs and paging messages to SUs; and 2) Access Control logical channels which provide point-to-point services on global channels for SUs to access the system and obtain assigned channels.","An Assigned Channel (AC) group contains the logical channels that control a single telecommunication connection between the RCS and a SU. The functions developed when an AC group is formed consists of a pair of power control logical message channels for each of the Uplink and Downlink connections, and depending on the type of connection, one or more pairs of traffic channels. The Bearer Control function performs the required forward error control, bearer rate modification, and encryption functions. The logical channels which constitute the BC and AC groups are summarized below in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"280pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE

The spreading code is a sequence of symbols, called chips or chip values. The general methods of generating pseudorandom sequences using Galois Field mathematics is known to those skilled in the art; however, the inventor has derived a unique set, or family, of code sequences for the present invention. First, the length of the linear feedback shift register to generate a code sequence is chosen, and the initial value of the register is called a \u201cseed\u201d. Second, the constraint is imposed that no code sequence generated by a code seed can be a cyclic shift of another code sequence generated by the same code seed. Finally, no code sequence generated from one seed can be a cyclic shift of a code sequence generated by another seed.","The inventor has determined that the spreading code length of chip values of the present invention is:\n\n128\u00d7233415=29877120\u2003\u2003(1)\n","The spreading codes are generated by combining a linear sequence of period 233415 and a nonlinear sequence of period 128.","The nonlinear sequence of length 128 is implemented as a fixed sequence loaded into a shift register with a feed-back connection. The fixed sequence can be generated by an m-sequence of length 127 padded with an extra logic 0, 1, or random value as is well known in the art.","The linear sequence of length L=233415 is generated using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) circuit with 36 stages. The feedback connections correspond to a irreducible polynomial h(n) of degree 36. The polynomial h(x) chosen by the inventor for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention is\n\n()=+1\u2003\u2003(2)\n","A group of \u201cseed\u201d values for a LFSR representing the polynomial h(x) of equation (2) which generates code sequences that are nearly orthogonal with each other is determined. The first requirement of the seed values is that the seed values do not generate two code sequences which are simply cyclic shifts of each other.","The present invention includes a method to increase the number of available seeds for use in a CDMA communication system by recognizing that certain cyclic shifts of the previously determined code sequences may be used simultaneously. The round trip delay for the cell sizes and bandwidths of the present invention are less than 3000 chips. In one embodiment of the present invention, sufficiently separated cyclic shifts of a sequence can be used within the same cell without causing ambiguity for a receiver attempting to determine the code sequence. This method enlarges the set of sequences available for use.","By implementing the tests previously described, a total of 3879 primary seeds were determined by the inventor through numerical computation. These seeds are given mathematically as\n\nmodulo ().\u2003\u2003(3)\n","When all primary seeds are known, all secondary seeds of the present invention are derived from the primary seeds by shifting them multiples of 4095 chips modulo h(x). Once a family of seed values is determined, these values are stored in memory and assigned to logical channels as necessary. Once assigned, the initial seed value is simply loaded into LFSR to produce the required spreading-code sequence associated with the seed value.","Epoch and Sub-epoch Structures","The long complex spreading codes used for the system of the current invention have a number of chips after which the code repeats. The repetition period of the spreading sequence is called an epoch. To map the logical channels to CDMA spreading codes, the present invention uses an Epoch and Sub-epoch structure. The code period for the CDMA spreading code to modulate logical channels is 29877120 chips\/code period which is the same number of chips for all bandwidths.

This delay is due to the nonzero electrical delay in the electronic components of the implementation. The timing problems associated with the delay can be mitigated by inserting additional delay elements into the FF chain. An exemplary FF chain with additional delay elements is shown in ","The code-generators in the exemplary system are configured to generate either global codes, or assigned codes. Global codes are CDMA codes that can be received or transmitted by all users of the system. Assigned codes are CDMA codes that are allocated for a particular connection. When a family of sequences is generated from the same generator as described, only the seed of the 36 stage LFSR is specified. Sequences for all the global codes, are generated using the same LFSR circuit. Therefore, once an SU has synchronized to the Global pilot signal from an RCS and knows the seed for the LFSR circuit for the Global Channel codes, it can generate not only the pilot sequence but also all other global codes used by the RCS.","The signal that is upconverted to RF is generated as follows. The spreading sequences produced by the above shift register circuits are converted to an antipodal sequence (0 maps into +1, 1 maps into \u22121). The Logical channels are initially converted to APSK signals, which are mapped as constellation points as is well known in the art. The In-phase and Quadrature channels of each QPSK signal form the real and imaginary parts of the complex data value. Similarly, two spreading codes are used to form complex spreading chip values. The complex data and complex spreading code are multiplied to produce a spread-spectrum data signal. Similarly, for despreading, the received complex data is correlated with the conjugate of the complex spreading code to recover the data signal.","Short Codes","Short codes are used for the initial ramp-up process when an SU accesses an RCS.

One exemplary system which uses a modem according to the present invention employs convolutional encoding.

The idle code used for each traffic channel is programmed by the Modem Controller  by writing the appropriate pattern IDLE to the MOI, which in the present embodiment is a 8 bit word for a 64 kbps stream, 4 bit word for a 32 kbps stream.","Modem Algorithms for Acquisition and Tracking of Received Pilot Signal","The acquisition and tracking algorithms are used by the receiver to determine the approximate code phase of a received signal, synchronize the local modem receiver despreaders to the incoming pilot signal, and track the phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence with the received pilot code sequence. Referring to , the algorithms are performed by the Modem controller , which provides clock adjust signals to code generator . These adjust signals cause the code generator for the despreaders to adjust locally generated code sequences in response to measured output values of the Pilot Rake  and Quantile values from quantile estimators B. Quantile values are noise statistics measured from the In-phase and Quadrature channels from the output values of the AUX Vector Correlator  (shown in ). Synchronization of the receiver to the received signal is separated into two phases; an initial acquisition phase and a tracking phase. The initial acquisition phase is accomplished by clocking the locally generated pilot spreading-code sequence at a higher or lower rate than the received signal's spreading code rate, sliding the locally generated pilot spreading code sequence and performing sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) on the output of the Pilot Vector correlator . The tracking phase maintains the locally generated spreading-code pilot sequence in synchronization with the incoming pilot signal.","The SU cold acquisition algorithm is used by the SU CDMA modem when it is first powered up, and therefore has no knowledge of the correct pilot spreading code phase, or when an SU attempts to reacquire synchronization with the incoming pilot signal but has taken an excessive amount of time. The cold acquisition algorithm is divided into two subphases. The first subphase consists of a search over the length 233415 code used by the FBCCH. Once this sub-code phase is acquired, the pilot's 233415\u00d7128 length code is known to within an ambiguity of 128 possible phases. The second subphase is a search of these remaining 128 possible phases. In order not to lose synch with the FBCCH, the second phase of the search it is desirable to switch back and forth between tracking the FBCCH code and attempting acquisition of the pilot code.","The RCS acquisition of short access pilot (SAXPT) algorithm is used by an RCS CDMA modem to acquire the SAXPT pilot signal of an SU. The algorithm is a fast search algorithm because the SAXPT is a short code sequence of length N, where N=chips\/symbol, and ranges from 45 to 195, depending on the system's bandwidth. The search cycles through all possible phases until acquisition is complete.","The RCS acquisition of the long access pilot (LAXPT) algorithm begins immediately after acquisition of SAXPT. The SU's code phase is known within a multiple of a symbol duration, so in the exemplary embodiment of the invention, there may be 7 to 66 phases to search within the round trip delay from the RCS. This bound is a result of the SU pilot signal being synchronized to the RCS Global pilot signal.","The re-acquisition algorithm begins when loss of code lock (LOL) occurs. A Z-search algorithm is used to speed the process on the assumption that the code phase has not drifted far from where it was the last time the system was locked. The RCS uses a maximum width of the Z-search windows bounded by the maximum round trip propagation delay.","The Pre-Track algorithm immediately follows the acquisition or re-acquisition algorithms and immediately precedes the tracking algorithm. Pre-track is a fixed duration period during which the receive data provided by the modem is not considered valid. The Pre-Track period allows other modem algorithms, such as those used by the ISW PLL , ACQ & Tracking, AMF Weight GEN , to prepare and adapt to the current channel. The Pre-track algorithm is two parts. The first part is the delay while the code tracking loop pulls in. The second part is the delay while the AMF tap weight calculations are performed by the AMF Weight Gen  to produce settled weighting coefficients. Also in the second part of the Pre-Track period, the carrier tracking loop is allowed to pull in by the SE PLL , and the scalar quantile estimates are performed in the Quantile estimator A.","The Tracking process is entered after the Pre-Track period ends. This process is actually a repetitive cycle and is the only process phase during which receive data provided by the modem may be considered valid. The following operations are performed during this phase: AMF Tap Weight Update, Carrier Tracking, Code Tracking, Vector Quantile Update, Scalar Quantile Update, Code Lock Check. Derotation and Symbol Summing, and Power Control (forward and reverse).","If loss of lock (LOL) is detected, the modem receiver terminates the Track algorithm and automatically enters the reacquisition algorithm. In the SU, a LOL causes the transmitter to be shut down. In the RCS, LOL causes forward power control to disabled with the transmit power held constant at the level immediately prior to loss of lock. It also causes the return power control information being transmitted to assume a 010101 . . . pattern, causing the SU to hold its transmit power constant. This can be performed using the signal lock check function which generates the reset signal to the acquisition and tracking circuit .","Two sets of quantile statistics are maintained, one by Quantile estimator B and the other by the scalar Quantile Estimator A. Both are used by the modem controller . The first set is the \u201cvector\u201d quantile information, so named because it is calculated from the vector of four complex values generated by the AUX AVC receiver . The second set is the scalar quantile information, which is calculated from the signal complex value AUX signal that is output from the AUX Despreader . The two sets of information represent different sets of noise statistics used to maintain a pre-determined Probability of False Alarm (P). The vector quantile data is used by the acquisition and reacquisition algorithms implemented by the modem controller  to determine the presence of a received signal in noise, and the scalar quantile information is used by the code lock check algorithm.","For both the vector and scalar cases, quantile information consists of calculated values of lambda through lambda, which are boundary values used to estimate the probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of the despread received signal and determine whether the modem is locked to the PN code. The Aux_Power value used in the following C-subroutine is the magnitude squared of the AUX signal output of the scalar correlator array for the scalar quantiles, and the sum of the magnitudes squared for the vector case. In both cases the quantiles are then calculated using the following C-subroutine:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0218","num":"0217"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00011","num":"00011"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"for (n = 0; n<3; n++) {"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"lambda [n]+ = (lambda [n]<Aux_Power)?CG[n]:GM[n];"]},{"entry":[{},"}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"During the acquisition phase, the search of the incoming pilot signal with the locally generally pilot code sequence employs a series of sequential tests to determine if the locally generated pilot code has the correct code phase relative to the received signal. The search algorithms use the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) to determine whether the received and locally generated code sequences are in phase. The speed of acquisition is increased by the parallelism resulting from having a multi-fingered receiver. For example, in the described embodiment of the invention the main Pilot Rake  has a total of 11 fingers representing a total phase period of 11 chip periods. For acquisition 8 separate sequential probability ratio test (SPRTs) are implemented, with each SPRT observing a 4 chip window. Each window is offset from the previous window by one chip period, and in a search sequence any given code phase is covered by 4 windows. If all 8 of the SPRT tests are rejected, then the set of windows is moved by 8 chips. If any of the SPRTs is accepted, then the code phase of the locally generated pilot code sequence is adjusted to attempt to center the accepted SPRTs phase within the Pilot AVC.

below.\n",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0252","num":"0251"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00031","num":"00031"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":["A",{}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":"-","mn":"1"}}},{"mrow":{"mi":{},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"0"}
