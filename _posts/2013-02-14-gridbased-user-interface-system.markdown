{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["A business manager is often interested in viewing sorted or grouped business information. For example, he might want to see all of his clients grouped into categories based on total amount billed, or his employees grouped by performance. The manager might be able to build a report into his business software to show the desired groupings, however, if the manager were interested in a more complex partitioning of business information, he would be at a loss. It would be advantageous to display business information grouped along multiple dimensions in a single report.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","A grid based user interface system is disclosed. A system for displaying data comprises an interface configured to receive an indication of a matrix element for expansion. The system for displaying data additionally comprises a processor configured to provide a matrix for display, wherein the matrix includes a plurality of matrix elements; and provide a modified matrix for display, wherein the matrix element selected for expansion is expanded maintaining relative position to all other matrix elements of the plurality of matrix elements, wherein all other matrix elements of the plurality of matrix elements are modified. The system for displaying data additionally comprises a memory coupled to the processor and configured to provide the processor with instructions.","A set of business data objects (e.g., employees, vendors, clients, tasks, accounts, etc.) is divided into a set of groups. Each group of objects is associated with a location in a 1 or 2-dimensional matrix, or is the unassociated group of objects. Each axis of the 1 or 2-dimensional matrix represents a value or a value range for an object attribute (e.g., employee potential, employee performance, employee salary, vendor value, client amount billed, etc.). The matrix is comprised of a set of matrix elements, each matrix element displayed at a specific location in the matrix and associated with a value for each axis of the matrix. The number of matrix elements is equal to the product of the number of possible values on each axis. The group of objects associated with a given matrix element comprises the set of objects whose attribute values are those matching the values associated with the matrix element on each axis. In various embodiments, the unassociated group of objects is shown in a separate region from the matrix, or is accessible via an indication to a menu or other user interface object.","A user of the matrix may wish to interact with it in several different ways. When the matrix is first displayed, the matrix is shown filled with business data objects at locations determined by their associated attribute values. A user can quickly learn about the business data objects by viewing the matrix display. For example, a matrix displays employee potential on one axis and employee performance on another. In various embodiments, matrices and axes comprise a matrix for employee performance on one axis and project\/initiative importance on another axis; a matrix for employee performance on one axis and compensation quartile on another axis; a matrix for employee performance on one axis and retention on another axis; or any other appropriate matrices and axes. If the user desires to see a given matrix element more clearly, he makes an indication to that matrix element, causing the matrix element to be expanded maintaining relative position to the other matrix elements, while all other matrix elements of the plurality of matrix elements are modified in order to make room. If the user desires to move an object from one matrix element to another matrix element or from the unassociated group to the matrix element, he moves the object via drag and drop. In some embodiments, multiple objects are moved at once (e.g., multi-select employees in one matrix elements, then drag and drop them all to a new matrix element).","In various embodiments, an attribute of an object is associated with a matrix row or a matrix column or a matrix element.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","100","100","104","104","104","104","104","104"]},"Database system  comprises interface , processor , and memory .
