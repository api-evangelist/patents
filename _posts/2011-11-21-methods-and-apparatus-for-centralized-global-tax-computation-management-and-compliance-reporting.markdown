{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application is a Divisional of and claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 10\/037,035, filed on Jan. 2, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,099,342 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference.","The invention relates generally to the field of tax computation and management tools, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture for tax computation, management\u201d and compliance reporting via a centralized transactional tax platform capable of incorporating transaction data and tax information from multiple locations and\/or multiple business applications via a network architecture.","As geographic barriers to new markets and new sources of supply continue to disappear, organizations are doing business on an increasingly wider scale, frequently, throughout the world. One consequence of doing business in many locales is an increase in the complexity of an organization's procedures designed to facilitate tax compliance. Because of political boundary variations, changing laws and regulations, new forms of products, and new business innovations, transaction taxes and tax compliance represent a substantial part of any organization's cost structure. In the United States alone, there are over 7,500 tax jurisdictions, including states, cities, counties, and subsections of cities and counties. The location of an organization's warehouses, stores, and\/or customers may all impact the organization's tax obligations as it does business electronically, or via traditional \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d mechanisms.","Transaction taxes generally relate to the transfer (i.e., the purchase or sale) of goods and\/or services. Special transactional taxes may exist in various locales for certain types of goods (e.g., alcohol may by subject to an excise tax, or communications services may be subject to a telecom tax), but generally, there are three main categories of transactional taxes: Turnover tax; sales and use tax; and, value added tax. While all three categories of taxes represent a tax on the sale of supplies (i.e., goods and\/or services), they differ in many important ways, such as how the tax is calculated and to whom the tax is owed, thereby further complicating tax compliance procedures and reporting. In addition, considerations such as exemptions, specially negotiated rates, and the like, must be taken into consideration by an organization's tax professional in order to prevent miscalculation of taxes, which may lead to overpayment, or penalties for underpayment.","As an organization's scope of business and geographic footprint expand, it becomes increasingly difficult to consolidate data and tax information corresponding to transactions taking place at varying locations throughout the organization, or in conjunction with a variety of business applications. Current tax computation and management tools are capable of being integrated with only a single business application. As a consequence, an organization having multiple business applications, or multiple locations, requiring transactional tax calculations, must incur substantial up-front costs to integrate existing point solutions for tax compliance with each application or physical location. Furthermore, even in organizations with existing, separate point solutions, there is no mechanism to facilitate an integrated reporting scheme without expensive and cumbersome customization, thereby unnecessarily increasing the workload of the organization's tax professional on simple compliance and reporting issues.","Having dispersed, non-synchronized records, generated by separate point solutions integrated with individual business applications increases the time spent by the tax professional dealing with the collection and consolidation of tax-related information in order to report and remit taxes to a variety of taxing authorities. Time spent collecting, consolidating, updating, and reporting tax compliance information substantially diminishes the time spent on tax strategy, which may result in an unnecessary drain of valuable resources.","Embodiments of methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture for centralized tax computation, management, and compliance reporting are described in detail herein. In the following description, numerous specific details are provided, such as the identification of various system components, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize, however, that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details, or with other methods, components, materials, etc. In still other instances, well-known structures, materials, or operations are not shown or described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of various embodiments of the invention.","Reference throughout this specification to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases \u201cin one embodiment\u201d or \u201cin an embodiment\u201d in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.","As an overview, embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present invention provide methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture for tax computation, management, and compliance reporting via a centralized transactional tax platform capable of incorporating transaction data and\/or tax information from multiple locations and\/or multiple business applications via a network architecture. In one embodiment, a central server, configured to execute an application for managing the configuration, administration, and reporting associated with global tax transactions, may be communicatively coupled to a plurality of intra-organizational client systems located throughout the world. Each of the plurality of client systems may be configured to execute one or more business applications to enable transactions, or to gather information related to transactions, in an embodiment.","In one embodiment, transaction data corresponding to the transactions may be communicated to the central server via a network communication link from a calling client system. Upon receiving the transaction data, the central server may execute instructions to calculate any appropriate transaction taxes, store tax-related information corresponding to the transaction such as audit information, a record of calculation logic and output, or the like, and respond to the calling client system with an indication of the calculated transaction taxes associated with the transaction or series of transactions. In another embodiment, taxes may be calculated client-side via separate tax calculation engines administered by the central server. In this scenario, updates of tax tables, for example, as well as other tax compliance configuration data, may be communicated to the client systems for incorporation into the separate tax calculation engines. In addition, tax information, corresponding to the calculated transaction taxes, may then be communicated to the central server for storage to facilitate centralized tax compliance and reporting while minimizing customization and maintenance costs for the organization. Other features of the illustrated embodiments will be apparent to the reader from the foregoing and the appended claims, and as the detailed description and discussion is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to , an embodiment of a network environment  is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.

As the following description proceeds in conjunction with , reference is made to  to illustrate aspects of embodiments of the present invention. It will be appreciated that aspects of the present invention included in the following description may apply to the server  and any or all of the client systems - illustrated in , and may be implemented or facilitated by the hardware components of the computer described in conjunction with , and\/or the software elements described in conjunction with  above, in various embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.","With reference first primarily to , one aspect of embodiments of the present invention is the provision of a graphical UI to enable a tax professional within an organization to administer tax compliance configuration data, such as product codes or other identifiers for goods and\/or services bought and\/or sold, exemption certificates, special tax rules, input filters, and the like, which impact the calculation of transaction taxes. Providing a graphical UI, which, in one embodiment, may be a browser-based UI accessible via a network link to the server, enables the tax professional to focus on tax strategy without having to approach the organization's information technology department to alter information that impacts the organization's tax calculations and compliance reporting.","The reader will appreciate that the tax professional may access the server (e.g., the server , ) via a client system (e.g., the client system , ) with a universal resource locator (\u201cURL\u201d) or other unique address identifier associated with the server , in an embodiment. In response to a request sent from the browser, for example, of the client system , the server  may send the UI to the client system  (see, e.g., process block ) as a series of pages that maybe received by the client system  (see, e.g., process block ), interpreted by the browser and\/or a parser application, and displayed on a display coupled to the client system  (e.g., the display , ). At this point, a user, such as the organization's tax professional, may enter information and\/or data via the UI, and submit data to the server for configuration of at least one tax engine (e.g., the domestic tax engine  and\/or the international tax engine , ) (see, e.g., process block ) that will calculate transaction taxes corresponding to transactions in which the organization or its subsidiaries, for example, participate (see, e.g., process block ).","It will be appreciated that administration of tax compliance configuration data (see, e.g., process block ), while indicated in  as occurring server-side, incorporates the user data entry and submission of that data to the server, as indicated by the client-side process block . The administration of tax compliance configuration data (see, e.g., block ) comprises a number of elements that would be familiar to one skilled in the art. For purposes of explanation, the administration of tax compliance configuration data (see, e.g., block ) may be broken down into four separate sections, including defining an organization's nexus (see, e.g., process block ), managing locations (see, e.g., process block ), defining exceptions and exemptions to standard tax provisions within various jurisdictions (see, e.g., process block ), and administering registrations and zones (geographical areas organized based on transaction tax cross-border rules) for international tax compliance. It will be appreciated that additional elements of tax compliance configuration data not discussed herein may impact an organization's tax obligations, and that the following discussion is not intended to be all inclusive with regard to tax compliance procedures, or methods of tax calculation.","With consideration for the foregoing, one important concept in regard to domestic (e.g., the United States) transaction taxes is the idea of a nexus. A nexus represents an organization's legal obligation to collect and remit taxes in a particular jurisdiction. For example, a national department store may have a nexus in many jurisdictions, while an Internet merchant may have a nexus in only a few jurisdictions. In the international arena of transaction taxes, a registration with a taxing authority may serve a similar function.","In one embodiment, the UI sent to the client system (see, e.g., block ) comprises displays, such as the example UI displays illustrated in , to enable the organization's tax professional to define the organization's nexus in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. It will be appreciated that a single individual or a group of individuals may be given the authority to access these elements of the UI, and to modify tax compliance configuration data. This individual or these individuals may be located at one location (e.g., see the client , ), while the organization's transactions are occurring at different locations throughout the world (e.g., see the client systems -, ), in an embodiment.","With reference to , because of the large number of taxing jurisdictions in the United States (over 7,500 including states, counties, cities, and subsections of the foregoing), the tax professional may need to define the company's nexus to equate with the company's true tax obligations. It will be appreciated that a determination as to whether the company has a nexus with anyone particular tax jurisdiction may be based on the particular tax laws and regulations specific to that tax jurisdiction, which is beyond the scope of the present invention. Typically however, the company's nexus will be related to its physical locations, or areas in which it does business or a substantial amount of business.","For example, the tax professional may define the company's nexus to include all of the states (e.g., Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, and Arkansas) listed on the example UI display illustrated in  by selecting the state tax indicator (see reference numeral ). However, there may be particular local tax jurisdictions (e.g., cities), for example, within a state (e.g., Alabama), for which the company does not have a nexus, and therefore has no legal obligation to collect and remit taxes to a taxing authority (see reference numeral ). Because the majority of local tax jurisdictions are included in the company's nexus in the particular state (e.g., Alabama), the tax professional may seek to define his or her company's local tax nexus by excluding only those cities, for example, that are not to be considered (see reference numeral ). If, on the other hand, a majority of the local tax jurisdictions were to be excluded in a particular state, the tax professional could choose to \u201cinclude\u201d only those cities (see reference numeral ), for example, that are to be considered for purposes of collecting and remitting transaction taxes. Similarly, the tax professional may define his or her company's nexus by including \u201cnone\u201d of the local tax jurisdictions (see reference numeral ), or he or she may include \u201call locale\u201d tax jurisdictions (see reference numeral ), depending on the particular circumstances.","If the tax professional later determines that the status of one or more of the local tax jurisdictions should be changed, he or she may \u201cdelete\u201d (see reference numeral ) that particular selection from the list of included or excluded local tax jurisdictions for a particular state (see, e.g., ). Similarly, the addition of other local tax jurisdictions may be facilitated by entering the city, for example, in a data entry field, and clicking an \u201cadd\u201d button, for example (see reference numeral ), with a cursor actuated by an input device such as a mouse.","If a particular set of nexus definitions apply to one or more divisions of a company, for example, while other nexus definitions apply to other divisions, the tax professional may define one or more \u201cnexus groups\u201d with different nexus characteristics that may be associated with the different divisions. For example, in the illustrated embodiment shown in , a \u201cdefault\u201d nexus group (see reference numeral ), which preliminarily may include all tax jurisdictions, in an embodiment, is shown. If no specific nexus group is defined for the company or a particular division, the default nexus group may be used in an embodiment.","With continued reference to , in addition to defining the organization's nexus, the tax professional may also manage locations associated with the company's transactions. A significant component of any transaction tax determination is the location of the parties involved in the transaction. In the United States, each transaction must include information regarding each of four locations: A ship from location; a point of order origin (\u201cPOO\u201d) location; a point of order acceptance (\u201cPOA\u201d) location, and a ship to location. The ship from location generally refers to a location from which goods are being shipped, or a location at which services are being performed, for example a warehouse or a store. The POO location generally refers to a location at which an order for the goods or services is placed, for example a store or a trade show. The POA location generally refers to a location at which the order for the goods or services is accepted, for example a call center where an order was placed. The ship to location generally refers to a location at which a customer receives the goods or services that were purchased, for example the customer's business or home.","While information related to these locations could, in one embodiment, be provided to the server (e.g., the server , ) with other transaction data for each transaction occurring at a particular location, many locations will be common to large numbers of transactions in which the company participates. For example, when our example company ships electronics to customers on the East Coast, they may always accept orders at a site in South Dakota, and ship from a warehouse located in New Jersey, for example. In this case, the ship from location and the POA location will always be identical, and there is no need to repetitively communicate information related to these locations with each transaction in order to calculate any applicable transaction taxes. Instead, a default location may be set up to apply to all transactions, unless otherwise indicated by the inclusion of specific location information.","In regard to the foregoing, elements of the UI sent to the client system (e.g., the client system , ) from the server  (see, e.g., block ) may include UI displays to enable the tax professional to define information related to various locations, and to set default locations related to various transactions.  are illustrations of example UI displays that enable the tax professional to configure location information and set default locations in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. For example, the tax professional may input address information related to a particular location (e.g., a Portland, Oreg.) (see reference numeral ), and define this location to function as the default POA and POO locations for a particular location set (see reference numeral ).","As with the nexus groups discussed above in conjunction with , location sets may be defined to correspond to one or more client systems (e.g., client systems -) so that location information need not be communicated with other transaction data for each transaction for which transaction taxes are to be calculated. For example, a \u201ccompany\u201d location set may be defined to include a default ship from location of Allston, Mass., and a POO and POA location of Portland, Oreg. (see, e.g., ). The specific information related to these locations may be defined on a UI display, such as that illustrated in , and communicated only once to the server , thereby reducing the amount of transaction data that must be communicated to the server  to facilitate the calculation of transaction taxes corresponding to transactions occurring at the client systems (e.g., client systems -) in various locations.","With continued reference to , in addition to defining the organization's nexus, and managing locations corresponding to the organization, the tax professional may also define exceptions and exemptions to standard taxes within various tax jurisdictions (see, e.g., process block ). In many transactions, different products may be taxed differently in the same tax jurisdiction, or the same product may be taxed differently in different tax jurisdictions. As a consequence, transaction data corresponding to product specifics is necessary in order to properly calculate transaction taxes.","In this regard,  are illustrations of example UI displays that enable the organization's tax professional to configure the organization's products and rules applied to those products in order to calculate transaction taxes in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.  provides a UI display to enable the tax professional to define a cross-reference between internal product codes (see reference numeral ), which may be used by the company in invoices, or to track inventory, and the like, and a particular product code (see reference numeral ) that may be used by the application executed by the server (e.g., the server , ) to calculate transaction taxes corresponding to transactions related to the product. This allows specific rules to be defined for different products that may be treated the same for purposes of transaction tax calculations. For example, the company may sell different sizes or volumes of the same product, and identify these different sizes or volumes with different internal product codes. However, for purposes of transaction tax calculations, these different sizes or volumes of the same product may be treated identically, and therefore need only refer to a single product code to enable the calculation of appropriate taxes.","In addition, the tax professional may define various cross-reference groups (see reference numeral ), and\/or product groups (see reference numeral ) to permit various divisions or subsidiaries of the organization to use different cross-reference schemes according to their needs. For example, two divisions of the same company may have a partially overlapping set of internal product codes, and in some cases the same internal product code may refer to two different products for purposes of transaction tax calculation. In this case, the two divisions of the same company could utilize different cross-reference groups (see reference numeral ) to prevent confusion. Different product groups (see reference numeral ) may be used to store modifications or customizations to products that are specific only to certain locations or divisions of the company, such as for example, if a division of the company has been granted certain tax advantages to spur technology investment in a specific tax jurisdiction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIGS. 8B and 8C","FIGS. 8B and 8C"]},"In the embodiment depicted in , a product having product code \u201cXYZ89\u201d (see reference numeral ), and defined as \u201cFreight\/Shipping charges\u201d (see reference numeral ) is \u201cexempt\u201d from state, county, city, and transit taxes within the states of \u201cAlabama,\u201d \u201cIllinois,\u201d and \u201cMaine.\u201d In order to define whether the current product (e.g., the product corresponding to product code XYZ89) is exempt within a particular jurisdiction, subject to a standard tax rate, or subject to a custom tax rate, the tax professional may select the name of the state wherein the jurisdiction rule is to be defined by selecting the state (e.g., Alabama) from the pull-down list accessible at the bottom of the column labeled with reference numeral . In combination with this selection, the tax status of the product may then be defined by selecting \u201cExempt,\u201d \u201cStandard,\u201d or \u201cCustom\u201d from the pull-down menus accessible at the bottom of the columns for each of the \u201cState\u201d (see reference numeral ), the \u201cCounty\u201d (see reference numeral ), the \u201cCity\u201d (see reference numeral ), and the \u201cTransit\u201d (see reference numeral ) tax jurisdictions.","State, county, and city tax jurisdictions are those that were discussed above in conjunction with defining the organization's nexus. The transit tax jurisdiction corresponds to a tax collected at a secondary location, and generally corresponds to a shipment of goods. For example, shipping a computer from Houston, Tex. to Dallas, Tex., may require the payment of a sales tax in Houston (e.g., a city tax jurisdiction), as well as the payment of a transit tax in Dallas (e.g., a transit tax jurisdiction). In addition, the tax professional may set the effective date (see reference numeral ) of any rules to enable a provision that will take effect in the future to be immediately available to ensure that appropriate taxes are calculated on all transactions occurring after that date.","In order to define custom tax rates for the current product (e.g., product code XYZ89) at a state-level, the tax professional may select a \u201cstate rules\u201d tab (see reference numeral ) and select the \u201cdtls\u201d (details) button (see reference numeral ) to access the \u201crule details\u201d UI display (see, e.g., ). In this display, the tax professional may define the \u201ccurrent rate,\u201d see the \u201cprior rate,\u201d identify whether the maximum tax rate (\u201cuse max rate\u201d) should be used, the \u201ceffective date\u201d for the maximum tax rate to take effect, the maximum tax \u201camount\u201d for the current product within the current jurisdiction rule, the maximum amount that can be taxed (\u201ctaxable\u201d) for the current product within the current jurisdiction, and the maximum tax rate (\u201crate 1\u201d) for the current product that is to be charged after the \u201ctaxable\u201d amount has been surpassed.","Similarly, exceptions to the county and city tax jurisdictions may be defined by selecting the county exceptions tab  and\/or the city exceptions tab , and defining exceptions in a manner similar to that described above in conjunction with defining exceptions to the organization's nexus, in combination with a \u201crule details\u201d UI display similar to that described above in regard to the \u201cstate rules\u201d tab .","Since any standardized tax calculation and compliance platform cannot address every conceivable tax situation, embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present invention also allow users (e.g., the company's tax professional) to customize the processing of transaction data if user-specified conditions are satisfied. This customization option, also referred to herein as an input filter, permits the tax professional or other administrator to define particular tax situations relevant to the company's business, and modify the processing of transaction data relevant to these particular tax situations. In one embodiment, a user-specified set (one or more) of incoming (to the tax engines , , or -) XML elements maybe compared to user-specified conditions, which if met, cause a modification or exception to standard processing of the transaction data included in the XML elements as specified by the tax professional, such as a tax rate adjustment or the like.","Input filters are basically combinations of conditions and actions. In one embodiment, the tax professional may create multiple filters and organize them in a hierarchical relationship such that if a condition in a top-level filter is met, then one or more lower level filters may also be tested. When conditions are met, corresponding defined actions are then performed to modify processing of the transaction data from standard procedures. For example, an input filter may be created that would, where the ship-to state is New York (condition), and the value of the item being sold is over $10 (condition), set the tax rate at 12% (action), in an embodiment.","In addition to the exceptions described above, the tax professional may also define a number of exemptions that may apply to the company's customers, or to the company in the case of purchase transactions. Exemption certificates are generally specific to products and\/or tax jurisdictions, and may alter the transaction taxes that the company otherwise has an obligation to collect and remit, or pay themselves, to the respective tax jurisdictions.  illustrate example UI displays that enable the tax professional to manage customer information (see, e.g., ), and to manage exemption certificates for those customers. It will be appreciated that a similar process may be used to administer exemptions for the company itself. The data entry fields corresponding to the manage customers UI display illustrated in  and the manage certificates UI display illustrated in  are relatively self explanatory and would be familiar to one skilled in the art familiar with tax calculation and exemption certificates. As such, in the interest of brevity, no additional explanation will be provided herein in this regard.","In a manner similar to that described above in regard to the administration and calculation of domestic transaction taxes, the tax professional in support of tax compliance in international jurisdictions must also define tax compliance configuration data to enable appropriate tax calculation and compliance reporting. Tax compliance configuration data in regard to the international arena generally falls into two basic categories: Shared international content, and company-specific international content. Shared international content defines the taxing world, including such things as geographical zones, taxing authorities, product exceptions, as well as global financial data considerations such as currencies, and the like. Company-specific international content generally includes product cross-references and registration information. These elements of international tax compliance configuration data will be discussed in greater detail below.","With continued reference to , the tax compliance configuration data has been defined (see, e.g., block ) by user data entry via the UI and submission of the data to the server (see, e.g., block ). At this point, the client system (e.g., the client system , ) collects and validates transaction data (see, e.g., process block ) for transactions occurring at the client system  via one or more of the business applications -(see, e.g., ), in an embodiment. For example, an order entry may be facilitated via the \u201corder entry\u201d business application , such as for example, the purchase of a number of office items. The \u201corder entry\u201d business application may be designed to ensure that all information necessary to the calculation of appropriate transaction taxes is provided before the transaction data is serialized to XML (see, e.g., process block ), and sent to the server  (see, e.g., ).","For example, the information provided regarding the example transaction to purchase a number of office items may comprise information such as that provided on the example invoice  illustrated in  in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. In fact, in one embodiment, the information provided may also be used to generate the invoice  for the \u201ccompany.\u201d In this instance, the invoice  provides the customer name \u201cNanette Simon\u201d as well as the line items detailing the products for which the customer has placed the order. The reader will appreciate that the customer name may be sufficient information to provide the tax calculation engine (e.g., the domestic tax engine , ) at the server  with \u201cship to\u201d location information, as well as any exemptions or special tax rates related to the customer or the products being ordered because this information may have previously been provided via the UI displays illustrated in , discussed above, in an embodiment.","With continued reference to the foregoing example, the customer has placed an order for three separate products in varying quantities, and each with a distinct price. In order to calculate applicable transaction taxes associated with this transaction between the company and the customer, all of this information (the \u201ctransaction data\u201d) must be sent to the server  for use by either the domestic tax engine  or the international tax engine , depending on the location of the company and\/or the customer. In one embodiment, it maybe possible to send the transaction data (see, e.g., block ) via a data transfer method such as American Standard\u2019\u201d Code for Information Interchange (\u201cASCII\u201d) (see, e.g., ). One downside of such a data transfer method however, is that data must be sent in a very precise format in order to be interpretable by the processing application, for example the application server , at the server . As a consequence, transaction data such as the invoice number, the date, and the customer name must be repeated for each line item thereby creating redundancy, inefficiency in the network connection, and introducing additional potential for data integrity errors.","In contrast, and with reference to , by incorporating the transaction data (see, e.g., block , ) included in the invoice  (see, e.g., ) into elements of an XML document, and transmitting the transaction data (see, e.g., block , ) to the server  via the network  using HTTP or another appropriate protocol, the transaction data can be structured in a manner that makes it accessible to the processing application (e.g., the application server ) as a compilation of structured elements within the XML document. This data transfer mechanism facilitates the transmission of only a single instance of information, such as for example, the invoice number (provided in the element \u201cinvoicenum\u201d). Other elements of the XML document provide the customer name (e.g., the element \u201ccustname\u201d), the respective product codes (e.g., the element \u201cprodcode\u201d), which may be converted to a product code used by the tax engines  and\/or  to calculate transaction taxes via the cross-reference information provided previously by the tax professional, as discussed above in conjunction with , and the like.","It will be appreciated that the processing application (e.g., the application server , ) must be configured to interpret the elements of the XML document in order effectively utilize the transaction data contained therein. In this regard, in addition to a standard set of elements generally applicable to components of transaction data, such as the \u201cprodcode,\u201d and \u201ccustname,\u201d mentioned above, and the like, customizable elements may also be provided at the invoice level and at the line level to enable the tax professional to define elements of transaction data that may be unique to his or her organization. For example, one customizable invoice element may be defined to correspond to a \u201cstore number\u201d such that it could be used to transmit transaction data regarding the store from which the transaction was generated. The parent company of the store maybe interested in tracking transactions in this manner, and thus providing this element of information enables records to be maintained which are specific to a particular store number, in an embodiment.","In addition to the various elements of the XML document referring to the specifics of the transaction (e.g., the \u201cprodcode,\u201d \u201cquantity,\u201d \u201cgrossamt,\u201d and the like), information regarding the company's role (e.g., buyer or seller) in the transaction must also be provided (see, e.g., element \u201cmerchantrole\u201d, ) to properly calculate transaction taxes, and to properly maintain records of tax information related to the transactions for reporting and remittance purposes. This information may help determine whether the company has an obligation to collect and remit taxes themselves, or whether they may recover taxes previously paid with regard to other transactions in which they may have played a different role. For example, a seller may have an obligation to pay a turnover tax, or to collect and remit a sales and use tax or a value added tax, while a buyer may want to maintain a record of value added taxes paid in order to recover those taxes when playing the role of the seller in a future transaction.","With continued reference to , the server (e.g., the server ) may then receive the transaction data from the client system (see, e.g., process block ), and parse the transaction data (see, e.g., process block ) from the XML document to make the content, incorporated into the elements of the XML document, accessible to other software elements such as the tax engines (e.g., the tax engines  and ). The tax engines, for example the domestic tax engine  may then calculate any applicable transaction taxes corresponding to the transactions associated with the transaction data (see, e.g., process block ), and the output from the tax engine  may then be stored in the database , for example, or other central storage coupled to the server, along with other tax information (see, e.g., process block ) such as computational logic and the content and elements of the transaction data to facilitate the generation of reports or audit information. In one embodiment, the log component  of the reports server , illustrated in , may format the tax information for storage in the database .","The output from the tax engine , for example, may also be serialized to XML (see, e.g., process block ) and sent to the calling client system  (see, e.g., process block ) in a format designated by the tax professional, for example. In one embodiment, the tax professional may configure the output sent to the calling client system  to include particular elements of information. In one embodiment, the output may then be received by the client system  (see, e.g., process block ), parsed to recover the content incorporated into the elements of the XML document (see, e.g., process block ), and provided to the calling application (e.g., the business applications -) (see, e.g., process block ) to enable the business application to complete its transaction.","In one embodiment, the server  may then generate compliance reports (see, e.g., process block ) and the like, based on the stored tax information, to identify taxes paid or owed, and to plan tax strategy for the company, or to remit taxes to the taxing authorities. In one embodiment, the compliance reporting component  of the reports server , illustrated in , may generate tax compliance reports, and the like.","With reference now primarily to , another embodiment of a flow of events in a server (e.g., the server , ) and a client system (e.g., the client system , ) is illustrated in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. It will be appreciated that many of the process blocks illustrated in  are analogous to those illustrated in , and have been identified with identical reference numerals. In these instances, as will be identified below, the reader may make reference to the discussion of the particular process block as described with reference to  so as to avoid repetitive discussion of these particular elements.","With regard to the foregoing discussion, the server (e.g., the server , ) may send the UI to the client system (see, e.g., process block ) to enable a tax professional or other system administrator to provide tax compliance configuration data that may be used for configuration of at least one tax engine (e.g., the tax engines -, ), in an embodiment. The client system (e.g., the client system , ) may then receive the UI from the server  (see, e.g., process block ), and submit data to the server  for configuration following user data entry via the UI (see, e.g., process block ), in one embodiment. As discussed above, administering the tax compliance configuration data (see, e.g., process block ) may include defining the organization's nexus (see, e.g., process block ), managing location information (see, e.g., process block ), defining exceptions and exemptions to standard tax provisions (see, e.g., process block ), and\/or administering registrations and zones (geographical areas organized based on transaction tax cross-border rules), in an embodiment.","Following administration of the tax compliance configuration data (see, e.g., block ) via user input and submission from the client system  (see, e.g., block ), the server  may send updates and\/or configuration data to the client system  to enable configuration of the tax engines -, in an embodiment (see, e.g., process block ). The updates and configuration data may be communicated to the client system  via content incorporated into elements of an XML document, in an embodiment. The client system  may then receive the updates and\/or configuration data from the server  (see, e.g., process block ) to configure the tax engines -to enable calculation of transaction taxes based upon up-to-date information.","The client system  may then collect and validate transaction data via one or more of the business applications (e.g., the business applications -, ) (see, e.g., process block ), and send the transaction data to a coupled tax engine (see, e.g., process block ). In one embodiment, each coupled tax engine (e.g., the tax engines -) is configured to receive transaction data generated from its respective business application (e.g., the business applications -), to calculate any applicable transaction taxes (see, e.g., process block ), and to send the output and other tax information to the coupled business application (see, e.g., process block ) to be serialized to XML (i.e., incorporated into elements of an XML document) (see, e.g., process block ), and sent to the server  (see, e.g., process block ).","In one embodiment, the server  may then receive the tax information, including computational logic and outputs from the tax engines -, as well as components of the transaction data (see, e.g., process block ), parse the tax information to retrieve the content from the XML document (see, e.g., process block ), and store the tax information in a database (e.g., the database , ) or other central storage coupled to the server , in an embodiment. In one embodiment, the tax information is formatted for storage via the log component  of the reports server . The stored tax information may then be used to generate compliance reports (see, e.g., process block ) via the compliance reporting component  of the reports server , in an embodiment.","It will be appreciated that although administration of the tax compliance configuration data, as discussed above in conjunction with , was described as occurring via a client system (e.g., the client systems  and , , respectively) separate from the client system (e.g., the client systems  and , , respectively) executing the business applications, the administration of the tax compliance configuration data may be facilitated by the client system executing the business applications, in another embodiment.","The foregoing description of embodiments in accordance with the teachings of the present invention has focused most prominently on aspects of the invention related to tax compliance configuration data corresponding to the calculation of domestic transaction taxes. As mentioned previously, the tax professional in support of tax compliance in international jurisdictions must also define tax compliance configuration data to enable appropriate tax calculation and compliance reporting. In one embodiment, the tax compliance configuration data necessary for the appropriate calculation of transaction taxes via an international tax engine (e.g., the international tax engine ) may also be provided and administered via a UI similar to that described above in conjunction with .","In the international arena, tax compliance configuration data corresponding to exceptions and exemptions to standard tax provisions may be defined and administered in a manner similar to that described above with regard to domestic transactions in . In addition, zones (geographical areas organized based on transaction tax cross-border rules), taxing authorities, and registrations corresponding to the company must also be defined. Zones define the locations involved in an invoiced transaction, and may be associated with one or more taxing authorities. Taxing authorities are government entities that have authority to collect taxes corresponding to particular zones. In a manner similar to a company's nexus, as described above, registrations are then defined to correspond to taxing authorities, and represent the company's taxing and reporting obligations to particular taxing authorities with which they are associated.","With reference now to , illustrations of example UI displays to administer the company's zones, taxing authorities, and registrations are shown in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. As illustrated in , the company's tax professional or other administrator may select zones from a hierarchically arranged menu. In one embodiment, a zone may be added by selecting an \u201cAdd\u201d button  associated with the zone. The content of the menu may vary depending on the particular areas of the world that are supported by the tax calculation software utilized in embodiments of the present invention. For purposes of explanation, only a high-level menu is illustrated in , but it will be appreciated that each respective country or region shown in the illustration may include a plurality of sub-categories. For example, \u201cCanada\u201d may include a second level of zones that includes each of the provinces, and in turn each province may correspond to a third level of the hierarchy from which various cities may be selected, and so forth.","In order to define specific taxing authorities to correspond to the selected zone(s), the tax professional may select an \u201cAuthorities\u201d button  associated with the zone. With reference now primarily to , assume that the tax professional selected the \u201cEuropean Union\u201d zone from the menu illustrated in , which caused generation of a list of zone authorities (taxing authorities) to be displayed in the UI, as illustrated in . A zone authority may then be selected by the tax professional to correspond to the \u201cEuropean Union\u201d zone. In one embodiment, the tax professional may select a \u201cDetails\u201d button  corresponding to a taxing authority in order to define details associated with the authority, such as a registration mask that may be used to test whether registration numbers fit basic criteria for the authority, such as length or adherence to certain other rules.","For international tax calculations, the primary element of company-specific tax compliance configuration data is company registration information. The registration information allows the tax calculation engine to know where the company is registered and to appropriately calculate taxes and generate tax information for compliance reporting to the taxing authority. With reference now primarily to , the tax professional may, in order to define registrations for the company, select a region (see reference numeral ) from a pull-down menu, in an embodiment. Registration information (e.g., registration numbers) (see reference numeral ) for each applicable authority may then be input in a data entry field. In one embodiment, a registration group (see reference numeral ) may be selected from a pull-down menu to which the registration may belong. Registration groups may provide an advantage when generating reports by allowing the generation of a single report for a group of closely related organizations. For example, several European countries allow multiple closely-related companies to share a single registration number, and these may be included in a registration group.","Other elements of tax compliance configuration data may also be defined and administered via UI displays in a manner similar to that described above. Transaction data may then be generated from business applications, and input into one or more tax calculation engines to calculate applicable transaction taxes and to generate tax information for compliance reporting as described above in conjunction with the domestic transaction tax scenarios.","While the invention is described and illustrated here in the context of a limited number of embodiments, the invention may be embodied in many forms without departing from the spirit of the essential characteristics of the invention.
