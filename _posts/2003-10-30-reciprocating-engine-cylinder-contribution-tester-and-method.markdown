{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to engine diagnostics, and more particularly, to evaluating cylinder contribution to engine output power.","Engine performance problems are typically caused by the failure or diminished operation of a single control system or single engine cylinder. Many conventional diagnostic instruments are designed for testing or troubleshooting various systems, including the ignition, induction, electrical, and emissions systems. One problem with conventional diagnostic instruments is that they often require complicated or time-consuming connections to the engine. Further, conventional diagnostic instruments may display results that are difficult to interpret or provide only general information. That is, a technician may invest time setting up a diagnostic instrument yet not receive specific enough information about a problem or performance issue to perform a repair efficiently.","In a properly functioning reciprocating engine, each cylinder contributes equally to the total output power for balanced operation. A lack of equal contribution to overall power typically produces an imbalance in the form of an unwanted engine block motion. That is, the lack of expected contribution from one or more cylinders can cause the engine to \u201crock\u201d or displace with respect to the engine's normal, balanced motion on its mount points.","To evaluate engine cylinder contribution issues, typical diagnostic instruments infer the velocity of engine block movement from other measurements. One conventional technique measures the rate of change of alternator ripple and relates this to engine block movement.","One problem with inferring the velocity of engine block movement is the inaccuracy of the resulting information. In a typical belt-driven alternator system, for example, the belt does not move exactly with the engine. This makes it difficult to infer the engine block movement accurately from the alternator output current. Given that a performance problem is likely attributable to a malfunction of a single engine cylinder, a technician does not want to receive inaccurate information and, therefore, consume diagnostic or repair time on a properly functioning cylinder.","Additionally, common diagnostic instruments for evaluating an engine cylinder contribution may require the use of many pieces of equipment. For each piece of equipment, the technician must spend time setting it up and running the tests. Thus performing a comprehensive diagnostic test may require significant diagnostic time to localize or to pinpoint the specific trouble area.","What is needed is a diagnostic instrument for evaluating engine cylinder contribution that uses direct observation of engine block movements to provide specific results in an easily understandable manner.","In one aspect, engine cylinder contribution is evaluated. A displacement measuring device, such as a potentiometer, observes engine block movement or displacement with respect to the engine mount points. The displacement measuring device provides a displacement signal to a signal analyzer. The signal analyzer evaluates the displacement signal to identify a low or poorly contributing cylinder.","In another aspect, a trigger signal provides a reference point for the signal analyzer. The trigger signal enables the signal analyzer to use the firing order or other engine parameters when analyzing the displacement signal. Further, the trigger signal enables a user interface module to provide specific test results in an easily understandable manner.","In a further aspect, a method for measuring cylinder contribution includes observing engine block movement with a displacement measuring device (e.g., a potentiometer or a piezo cable). The observed movement can be correlated to the engine's firing order and evaluated to determine the cylinder contribution. The lack of expected contribution from one or more cylinders can cause the engine to \u201crock\u201d or displace with respect to the engine's normal, balanced motion on its mount points.","Additional aspects and advantages of the present disclosure will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description, wherein only exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure is shown and described, simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present disclosure. As will be realized, the present disclosure is capable of other and different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects, all without departing from the disclosure. Accordingly, the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as restrictive.","The present disclosure is now described more fully with reference to the accompanying figures, in which several embodiments are shown. The embodiments described herein may include or be utilized with any appropriate engine having an appropriate voltage source, such as a battery, an alternator and the like, providing any appropriate voltage, such as about 12 Volts, about 42 Volts and the like. The embodiments described herein may be used with any desired system or engine. Those systems or engines may comprise items utilizing fossil fuels, such as gasoline, natural gas, propane and the like, electricity, such as that generated by battery, magneto, solar cell and the like, wind and hybrids or combinations thereof. Those systems or engines may be incorporated into other systems, such as an automobile, a truck, a boat or ship, a motorcycle, a generator, an airplane and the like.","One skilled in the art will recognize that methods, apparatus, systems, data structures, and computer readable media implement the features, functionalities, or modes of usage described herein. For instance, an apparatus embodiment can perform the corresponding steps or acts of a method embodiment.","A. System Overview",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["110","135","150","110","115","110","115"]},"The signal analyzer  is coupled to the potentiometer  via a signal cable . In one embodiment, the signal cable  includes one or more wireline communications paths for communicating data between the potentiometer  and the signal analyzer . Various protocols or signaling techniques can be used with the signal cable . For example, the signal cable  can include an analog electrical signal (at baseband or any suitable transmission frequency). In addition, the displacement measuring device (e.g., the potentiometer ) can include circuitry or logic for digitizing or for encoding the provided displacement signal into a data communication interface protocol. For example, typical serial data interfaces (e.g., RS-232, universal serial bus, or IEEE 1394), instrument interfaces (e.g., general purpose instrument bus) or onboard diagnostic system interfaces (e.g., OBD-II) can be used. In another embodiment, the displacement measuring device and the signal analyzer  can communicate or exchange data wirelessly. Radio frequency (RF) or infrared (IR) communications protocol can be used.","The potentiometer  includes a shaft  that is extendible from the potentiometer . The potentiometer  outputs a voltage difference signal that corresponds to movements of the shaft . In one embodiment, the potentiometer  is a conventional 2 inch stroke linear potentiometer (which is commercially available from Penny+Giles of Dorset, United Kingdom). The stroke of the potentiometer  generally refers to the distance that the shaft  may travel into or out of the body of the potentiometer .","In the illustrated configuration for measuring engine cylinder contribution, the potentiometer  is attached to the vehicle  between the engine  and the cowl . The cowl  is part of the body of the vehicle  and represents a stationary or fixed mount point with respect to movement (or displacement) of the engine . More specifically, the potentiometer  is mechanically attached to the engine  at an engine-side mount , and the end of the shaft  is mechanically attached to the cowl  at a body-side mount . When attached in the illustrated or similar manner, the potentiometer  provides a displacement signal output that reflects the displacement of the engine  with respect to the body of the vehicle . That is, the voltage change of the potentiometer  output corresponds to the movement of the shaft . In this respect, the potentiometer  can be a displacement measuring device configured to observe engine block movement relative to the cowl . As used herein, the engine block refers to the body or structure of the engine  in contrast to other externally visible moving parts of the engine , such as a belt pulley.","The engine-side mount  and the body-side mount  are attachment points for the potentiometer . The engine-side mount  and body-side mount  can be located at any suitable location on the engine  and the vehicle . One skilled in the art will appreciate that the location of the engine-side mount  and the body-side mount  can vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle  or other equipment under test. For example, in a 1989 Ford Taurus (3.0 liter, V-6 engine), the engine-side mount  is a bracket that is located near the throttle body and the body-side mount  is a location on the cowl  that arranges the potentiometer  parallel to the thrust line of the vehicle . Further, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the body-side mount  need not be coupled to the vehicle . That is, the body-side mount  may be a stationary structure external to the vehicle .","A suitable measurement or attachment point on the engine  is a point that has engine block motion. In one embodiment, a technician uses trial-and-error techniques to find a convenient point that has engine block motion in at least one dimension. For example, in a transverse mounted V-6 engine arrangement, the engine  likely has maximum movement in a direction that is parallel to the thrust line of the vehicle . For a transverse mounted in-line engine, however, the engine  likely has maximum movement in a direction that is perpendicular to the thrust line of the vehicle . As one skilled in the art will appreciate, engine block movement can depend on the number and placement of the engine mounts. Although motor mounts can restrict movement in certain directions, the movement can be manifested in other directions.","In one embodiment, the signal analyzer  provides specific information regarding measurement points or provides additional heuristics to assist the technician in configuring the displacement measuring device. Additional details about the placement of the displacement measuring device (e.g., the potentiometer ) are described below and with reference to .","The embodiment shown in  includes a displacement measurement device  operatively coupled to the signal analyzer . The displacement measurement device  is configured to detect engine block movement relative to a stationary structure, such as the cowl . As described above, the cowl  is part of the body of the vehicle  and represents a stationary or fixed mount point with respect to movement (or displacement) of the engine .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["135","150","210","220","230","150"]},"In one embodiment, the cylinder clip  is coupled to the spark plug wire of a reference cylinder. More specifically, the cylinder clip  can be fastened or attached to the spark plug wire for the first cylinder in the firing order of the engine . The cylinder clip  provides an output signal that is coupled to I\/O port  of the signal analyzer . The cylinder clip  also provides a grounding lead that is coupled to the ground port of the signal analyzer . The output signal represents a trigger signal that is used to start data acquisition or otherwise indicate to the signal analyzer  when a particular cylinder has fired. The trigger signal is further described below and with reference to .","One skilled in the art will appreciate that the cylinder clip  can be coupled to the engine  in a variety of ways that can depend on the type of ignition system used by the engine . That is, various capacitive or inductive signal sensing techniques can be used, such as coil-on-plug (COP) adapters, hybrid COP adapters, RPM clamps or KV clips.","The distributor clip  can be coupled to the distributor in order to sample the ignition coil voltage at the distributor rate. With a 6 cylinder engine, for example, the distributor clip  provides an output signal that is coupled to I\/O port  of the signal analyzer  to indicate the six firings. The distributor clip  also provides a grounding lead that is coupled to the ground port of the signal analyzer . Similar to the cylinder clip , distributor clip  can use any suitable coupling technique, such as inductive, capacitive or resistive.","The power supply  couples to and provides power for the potentiometer . In one embodiment, the power supply  provides a 30 volt, direct current (VDC) supply to the potentiometer . Of course, the voltage or the current provided by the power supply  to the potentiometer  or other displacement measuring device may be adjusted to suit various system configurations. The potentiometer  generates a displacement signal that is proportional to the motion of the engine . In some configurations, the proportionality of movement of the shaft  to the displacement signal is dependent on the supply voltage from the power supply . That is, the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of the displacement signal may depend upon the supply voltage.","As described above, the potentiometer  provides a displacement signal via the signal cable . In the illustrated embodiment, the signal cable  is coupled to I\/O port  of the signal analyzer . The signal cable  may further include a grounding lead that is coupled to the ground port of the signal analyzer . This permits a common ground or reference potential for each of the distributor clip , cylinder clip , and potentiometer .","1. Engine Displacement Measurement","In a reciprocating engine, a lack of equal contribution from each cylinder tends to produce an unwanted engine block motion. That is, the lack of expected contribution from one or more cylinders can cause the engine to \u201crock\u201d or displace with respect to the engine's normal, balanced motion on its mount points. Embodiments of the present disclosure evaluate engine cylinder contribution by measuring the amount of engine block motion.","As one skilled in the art will recognize, the potentiometer  represents one technique for measuring the engine block motion directly. In another embodiment, a piezo cable can be used to measure the engine block motion. A piezo cable (such as one commercially available from Measurement Specialties, Valley Forge, Pa.) is a coaxial cable, which when stretched axially, outputs a voltage that is proportional to strain. Strain is defined in Equation 1, where \u0394L is the change in cable length, Lis the original length. The voltage developed between the center conductor and the cable shield is defined, for example, in Equation 2, where K is a constant of proportionality. \n\n","One advantage of using a piezo cable as a displacement measuring device is that the piezo cable can be directly coupled to the signal analyzer . Therefore, in this embodiment, the potentiometer  and the power supply  are not used.","In a further embodiment, an antenna or antennas and an associated signal receiver can be used to measure engine block motion. The receiver can detect a signal from each spark plug firing and provide an output signal to the signal analyzer . The signal analyzer  can then measure the time difference for any two cylinders (in the proper firing order). A time difference can indicate that the engine has slowed during the interval between firings. The signal analyzer  can identify which cylinder has a contribution problem that caused the slowing.","Additionally, a laser or other optical encoding device can be used to measure engine block movement directly. The laser can be coupled to the engine  or the vehicle . In this embodiment, the laser generates a displacement signal output that is provided to the signal analyzer .","In an embodiment, a machine vision device can be used to measure engine block movements. A target can be placed on the engine block and the machine vision device can track the movements of the target. Based on the detected movements, the machine vision device can provide a displacement signal output for the signal analyzer  or provide coordinate information, such as motion vectors that can be used for analysis. In one embodiment, the target comprises masked circles made from retroreflective material. The machine vision device can analyze angular or positional changes to measure engine block movements. Further, a machine vision device can be configured to discriminate the engine block from other components of the vehicle  to detect engine block displacement without an express target.","Additionally, a vibration or sound sensing device may be used to measure engine block movements. In this embodiment, a signal filter may be needed to distinguish between desirable and undesirable motion. More specifically, an engine-specific filter can be used to discriminate between normal motion and motion that is due to a cylinder contribution problem. The vibration or sound sensing device can generate a displacement signal output that is provided to the signal analyzer .","Similar to the potentiometer , a cable having resistance proportional to strain can be used to measure engine block motion. At a given temperature, stretching a cable can cause a change in end-to-end resistance as defined in Equation 3, where K is a constant of proportionality.\n\n\u0394*Strain\u2003\u2003(3)\n","In this embodiment, the power supply  provides a voltage across the cable. The displacement signal provided to the signal analyzer  reflects a voltage change that corresponds to the change in cable resistance.","B.

The connection network  can be an electrical bus, switch fabric, or other suitable interconnection system.","The processor  is a conventional microprocessor. In one embodiment, the signal analyzer  is portable and powered by a battery. In this instance, the processor  may be designed for low power operation in order to provide satisfactory runtime before requiring recharging or replacement of the battery. In a typical service facility, satisfactory runtime is approximately 8 hours or the duration of a technician's shift.","The processor  executes instructions or program code modules from the memory . The operation of the signal analyzer  is programmable and configured by the program code modules. Such instructions may be read into memory  from another computer readable medium, such as a device coupled to the storage device controller . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in the memory  causes the processor  to perform the method or functions described herein.

Thus, embodiments of the disclosure are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software. The memory  can be, for example, one or more random access memory (RAM) devices, flash RAM, or electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) devices. The memory  may also be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions by processor .","The term \u201ccomputer readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to the processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media, volatile media, and transmission media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as those controlled by the storage device controller . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as the memory . Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire and fiber optics, including the wires or communication paths that comprise the connection network . Transmission media can also take the form of acoustic or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.","Common forms of computer readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a programmable ROM (PROM), an electrically PROM (EPROM), a flash EPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, a carrier wave, or any other medium from which a data processing system can read.","Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote data processing system, such as a server. The remote data processing system can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a communication link. The communications interface  can receive the data from the communication link and place the data on the connection network . The connection network  can then carry the data to the processor  for execution.","The input\/output device controller  provides an interface to the display screen  and the input device . The display screen  can include associated hardware, software, or other devices that are needed to generate a screen display. In one embodiment, the display screen  is a conventional liquid crystal display (LCD). One skilled in the art will appreciate that many suitable technologies can be used for the display screen , for example, a light emitting diode (LED), organic LED, cathode ray tube (CRT), or a plasma display panel (PDP). The display screen  may also include touch screen capabilities.","The illustrated embodiment also includes an input device  operatively coupled to the input\/output device controller . The input device  can be, for example, an external or integrated keyboard or cursor control pad. In an automotive service environment, for example, it may be convenient for a technician to enter customer or vehicle information using the input device . Of course, customer or vehicle information can also be transmitted to the signal analyzer  by another device such as a server (not illustrated). In one embodiment, the communications interface  can receive such information and can send the information to the processor  via the connection network .","The storage device controller  can be used to interface the processor  to various memory or storage devices. In the illustrated embodiment, a database  is shown for storing customer information, test results, system configuration, engine parameters, and the like.

The computer readable storage volume can be available via a public network, a private network, or the Internet. Program instructions can be in any appropriate form, such as source code, object code, or scripting code. One skilled in the art will recognize that arrangement of the modules , , , , ,  represents one example of how the features or functionality of the present disclosure can be implemented.","The user interface module  includes display elements that can be presented on the display screen . As described in further detail below and with reference to , the user interface module  can generate screen displays of waveform data, test results and the like.","The engine parameter module  provides information about the engine  under evaluation. The engine parameter module  can receive information about the engine  from, for example, the user interface module  or from the database . The engine parameter module  provides data, such as engine mass, mounting characteristics, and firing order that the signal analyzer  uses for evaluating cylinder contribution.","The engine parameter module  may further provide information to assist the technician in placing the displacement measurement device in an appropriate location on the engine . As one skilled in the art will appreciate, an appropriate position is one that manifests engine block movement when a cylinder is poorly contributing.","The cylinder contribution module  evaluates engine block movement to determine cylinder contribution. The cylinder contribution module  receives displacement information from the data acquisition module . In one embodiment, the cylinder contribution module  computes one or more derivatives of the displacement signal in order to identify inflection points in the engine block movement. The cylinder contribution module  can further compensate for engine mass or other signal dampening characteristics in order to identify a poorly contributing cylinder from the displacement signal.","The data acquisition module  includes functionality for storing and for retrieving data received from the communications interface . When performing a test, for example, the communications interface  may provide a raw data stream of the measurements which the database module records. Accordingly, the data acquisition module  can provide measurement data to the processor  or other functional modules for analysis.","The system configuration module  handles the configuration of the signal analyzer . A user of the signal analyzer  may select among various configuration options. For example, the user may indicate the type of displacement measuring device that is coupled to the signal analyzer . Additionally, the user may indicate the location on the engine  where the displacement measuring device is coupled.

For example, the user interface module  calls a function of the operating system module  in order to display an element on the display screen .","2. Test Results",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["510","530","550","570"]},"The trigger signal  indicates the firing of a first cylinder. Typically the trigger signal  is associated with the cylinder no.  or the first cylinder in the firing order of the engine . Of course, the trigger signal  can be associated with the firing of any of the engine cylinders provided that the signal analyzer  (or the technician) has information about the firing order of the engine . The trigger signal  is used to provide a reference signal to the signal analyzer  for data acquisition or analysis purposes. More specifically, when the signal analyzer  receives a first cylinder trigger , it can determine the time points at which the other cylinders intend to fire given the timing and firing order for the engine . Although testing is typically performed at idle speed (e.g., 600 to 1200 RPM), the signal analyzer  is responsive to changes in the period of the trigger signal  or other signals.","The marker signal  indicates the firings of each of the cylinders from trigger-to-trigger. In one embodiment, the marker signal  is provided by the output of the distributor clip . The signal analyzer  can superimpose or overlay numbers that indicate the firing order  in order to aid a technician's understanding of the signal waveforms. In the illustrated embodiment, six firings are shown where each firing corresponds to one of the six engine cylinders. One skilled in the art will appreciate that if the engine  includes greater or fewer cylinders then greater or fewer firings are shown accordingly.","The normal displacement signal  shows a small amount of engine block motion that is associated with normal, balanced operation of the engine . In this case, each cylinder of the engine  is contributing approximately equally to the total power output. Specifically, if the peak-to-peak amplitude of the displacement signal is the same or zero for all cylinders, then all cylinders are contributing equally to the total power output.","On the other hand, the poorly contributing cylinder displacement signal  indicates a contribution problem with one of the cylinders. When a cylinder fails to contribute equally, the motion of the engine  responds to this lack of a single power stroke, slows slightly, and moves accordingly. Specifically, if a particular cylinder is contributing less than the average of the other cylinders, the peak-to-peak amplitude for that cylinder is higher because of the engine rock created.","In the illustrated embodiment, the poorly contributing cylinder displacement signal  includes peaks above and below a bias point . When a particular cylinder poorly contributes, the engine  typically moves when the next cylinder fires. That is, the normal contribution of the next cylinder reveals the imbalanced operation.","In the illustrated example, cylinder number  is poorly contributing to total output power. A time period  elapses before corresponding engine block movement occurs. The time period  generally relates to the time between cylinder firings. Although the signal analyzer  (or technician) observes a negative going peak  between the firings of cylinders  and , the movement is due to poor contribution from cylinder . In addition, because of mass, engine mounts, or other dampening characteristics, the engine  does not instantaneously move when a cylinder fails or poorly contributes. The signal analyzer  can compensate for the time period  and other characteristics in order to evaluate cylinder contributions accurately. In one embodiment, the signal analyzer  uses engine-specific information, such as the type of engine mounts, to evaluate the dampening of the displacement signal.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["324","610","2","6","610","1","612","610"]},"Although many different types of digital or analog displays can be used, one advantage of the bar graphs A\u2013F is that a technician can quickly see the relative contributions of each of the cylinders. Of course, in one embodiment, the user interface can state that a particular cylinder is a poor contributor. The technician can then focus his or her repair on that cylinder.","Problem conditions that can cause poor or no cylinder contribution include: valve leak, bad head gasket, manifold leak, shorted or fouled spark plug gap, open plug or wire, bad or broken ring(s), and faulty fuel injector. One advantage of directly measuring the amount of engine block movement using, e.g., the potentiometer , is the precision of the displacement signal obtained. Different problem conditions can produce different amounts of characteristic engine block motion. In one embodiment, the signal analyzer  can further refine the test result information to include one or more likely problem conditions of the poorly contributing cylinder.","The user interface illustrated in  also includes a view waveform option , a setup option , and a menu option . The user can invoke or select the view waveform option  to display the displacement signal or other waveforms. In this case, the signal analyzer  displays waveforms similar to those illustrated in . One skilled in the art will appreciate that the signal analyzer  can displace the firing order  by a predetermined amount and overlay the firing order  on the displacement signal , . Displaying the firing order  has an advantage of making the waveform display easier for the technician to understand.","The setup option  can be used to configure the signal analyzer  or to enter customer information. In one embodiment, the setup option  enables the technician to enter the vehicle identification number (VIN) for the vehicle . The signal analyzer  can then use the VIN to lookup engine parameters, such as mass, firing order, and position information for the displacement measurement device.","The menu option  enables the technician to return to a menu of diagnostic tests or other options for operating the signal analyzer . The signal analyzer  may also provide other diagnostic functions or be coupled to other sources of diagnostic information that can be accessed via a navigational menu.","C. Method for Cylinder Contribution Measurement",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["705","710","440","135"]},"The method then correlates  engine block movement to firing order. The firing order is provided  in order to correlate . In one embodiment, the method compensates for the time period  before associating engine block movement with a particular engine cylinder. As described in further detail above, the trigger signal  provides a reference that can be used to identify conclusively a poorly contributing cylinder.","Next, the method adjusts  for engine parameters . The engine parameters  indicate engine-specific characteristics such as the mass and type of engine mounting (e.g., electronic dampening or rubber mounts). The engine parameters  can influence the engine block motion that results from a poorly contributing cylinder.","The method then evaluates  the engine block movement to determine cylinder contribution.
