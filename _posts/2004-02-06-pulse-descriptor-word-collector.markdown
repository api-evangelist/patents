title: Pulse descriptor word collector
abstract: A pulse descriptor word (PDW) collector, including an extractor coupled to a computer, for passively collecting radio frequency (RF) data received by an electronic surveillance system (ESS). It is integrated into the ESS after a receiver (which converts RF pulse data to digitized PDWs) and parrallel to a presorter. Using two RAM circuits, the extractor forms a read/write loop to ensure that no PDWs are lost in the collection process. The extractor simultaneously writes onto one RAM while reading from the other RAM to the computer. The read/write functions of the RAMs are switched at predetermined interrupts. Collected data is stored on the computer hard drive. The computer controls the entire collection process by using data management software, graphical user interface software and sequencing software. Stored data is available on demand for analysis and is used to monitor, assess, and update the threat identification capabilities of the particular ES system.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","1. Field of the Invention","The invention relates to electronic surveillance (ES) and electronic counter measure (ECM) systems and, in particular, to a portable device capable of passively collecting and storing all digitized radio frequency (RF) pulse data received by an electronic surveillance system. The invention further relates to the method by which the device collects and stores said data.","2. Description of the Background","Electronic Surveillance (\u201cES\u201d) systems are used on all modern United States (U.S.) Navy ships. These systems receive RF signatures in the form of pulse data and digitize them. The data is then processed in order to identify signals and determine the nature of the signals, threatening or non-threatening, for the purpose of theater awareness and self-defense. The data processing is typically accomplished by sending the data through a presorter, filtering it, and comparing the filtered data to stored sets of parameters. Monitoring the performance of processors within ES systems currently in use on U.S. Navy ships is required for continued improvement in recognition capabilities.","Previously, such monitoring was accomplished by analyzing the ES system's response to controlled stimuli. The stimuli is typically supplied by radiating RF modulated pulses at the ES system antennas, injecting RF modulated pulses into the ES system cables, or using system specific built-in-test (BIT) capabilities. Each of these methods supplies RF modulated pulses that the ES system processes into digital PDWs. The ES system responds to the supplied RF pulses by either displaying the correct threat identification or producing active transmissions based upon a correct threat identification. Recordings are made of the response. By analyzing the recordings a judgment can be made on how well the system works.","Unfortunately, due to the ever-increasing complexity and density of emissions in the RF spectrum this method of assessing ES system performance is out-dated and insufficient. Specifically, it does not allow for a more detailed analysis, based upon a realistic and comprehensive RF environment, to determine the cause of an incorrect response. Adequate assessment of the performance capabilities of a particular ES system requires an in-depth analysis of all received (vice supplied) RF pulse activity for a given time period. Only with such an assessment can there be a realistic improvement in the development of radar and threat recognition algorithms.","Many ES systems and electronic counter measure (ECM) systems have the ability to sample and temporarily store the RF parameter data of a singular received RF pulse. This pulse is finely sampled across its duration. This sampling information allows the recreation of the pulse for output. However, modern ES and ECM systems do not possess long-term multi-pulse storage capability. In ECM systems the goal of the memory is to affect a short delay in the retransmission of data. This delay equates to range when viewed from a hostile perspective. Digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) or other memory is used to capture, store and then retransmit RF energy a short time later. This is often referred to as an RF delay line. Once the data has been re-transmitted, it is no longer held in memory. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,891,646, 4,713,662 and 4,743,905 to Wiegand, U.S. Pat. No. 4,885,587 to Wiegand et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,104 to Schaffer all discuss various forms of DRFM for use within ECM systems. Specifically, these DRFMs are designed for use within active radar jamming systems. In each form the purpose of the DRFM is to allow the radar jamming system to capture received radar signals, manipulate or alter them in time or phase, as necessary, and return them on demand to confuse enemy radar systems. U.S. Pat. No. 5,032,839 to Even-Or employs optical RF memory for the same purpose.","Several other prior art references also disclose the use of short-term memory to improve the speed and accuracy of ECM or ES systems.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,145,691 to Freeling et al. patents a memory system which finds particular use in ECM systems. It uses memory to establish a feedback loop to recirculate RF burst signals which are emitted by enemy radar systems.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,217,580 to Lowenschuss discloses a complete ECM system. In this system RF signals are converted to digital words. The digital words are then pre-sorted. Once a predetermined number of digital words associated with one radio frequency signal is collected, that data is passed to a computer. This computer will then compare the signature to that of a library, recognize the threat and determine the counter technique called jamming. U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,561 to Inkol discloses a filter system for analyzing interleaved pulse descriptor words (PDW) received from a multiplicity of radar signals. This system incorporates a buffer memory. The buffer memory is organized to allow data corresponding to a particular radar emitter to be efficiently accessed for further analysis within the radar system.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,025,920 to Reitboeck et al. discloses an apparatus and method for identifying incoming radar signals by comparing them with stored sets of parameters. Similarly, a radio frequency detection and collection system (RFD\/CS) produced by Wide Band Systems, Inc. uses an antenna array and instantaneous frequency measurement (IFM) receivers to collect RF signals and convert them into PDWs. The PDWs are then transmitted to a computer workstation for analysis. The purpose of the computer workstation in this RFD\/CS system is used to compare the incoming PDWs with stored parameters in order to identify the intercepted emissions. None of the above-mentioned references discloses a system that records the total RF environment for long-term use.","Thus, there is a need for a portable PDW collector designed to passively collect and record all received RF emissions for later comparative analysis in a laboratory environment. This portable PDW collector enables the capture for analysis of all RF activity within any given theater of operation or important point around the world. Such a PDW collector would provide a convenient and cost-effective device that can easily be carried onboard a U.S. Navy vessel and integrated into its ES system. The alternatives to this solution, including installation on each vessel of another independent ES system capable of collecting the required data or an invasive redesign of all ES systems, are cost prohibitive.","It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for passively collecting and recording all digitized RF pulse data received by a ship's ES system. The digitized data typically includes parameters such as time of arrival, angle of arrival, amplitude, pulse width and frequency.","It is another object of this invention to provide a method for collecting and recording digitized RF pulse data. As described above, the collected data can be analyzed in order to test the detection and identification capabilities of current ES systems and to improve upon those detection and identification capabilities.","The foregoing and other objects are generally obtained by providing a pulse descriptor word collector (PDW collector) comprised of a PDW extractor and a PDW computer.","The object of the PDW extractor is to coincidentally collect all RF pulse data as the ES system receives it without impacting upon normal ES operations or intruding into ES system Ship Replaceable Units (SRUs). The ES system receiver receives RF pulse data, formats it into digital pulse descriptor words (PDWs), and forwards the data to the ES system presorter. The PDW collector is integrated into a ship's ES system between the ES system receiver and presorter. All PDWs that are transmitted from the receiver are diverted to the PDW extractor, flowing through the PDW extractor and on to the presorter. The PDW extractor passively monitors the transmissions carrying PDW data. Once data collection is initiated, the PDW extractor captures the incoming data, storing it in memory and simultaneously allowing the data to flow unaltered and uninterrupted to the ES system presorter. The PDW extractor then internally processes the captured data.","Upon capturing PDW data, the PDW extractor initially stores the data in a buffer or holding register. It then writes the data onto one of two RAM circuits. Incoming PDWs are written on to one of the RAM circuits, while PDWs that were previously stored on the other RAM circuit are simultaneously read to and stored on the PDW computer. The object of this continuous read\/write loop is to ensure that no data is lost.","The object of the PDW computer is (1) to control the functions of the PDW extractor, (2) to provide long term storage for all received PDW data, and (3) to store, analyze and manipulate said data using data management software. The PDW computer controls the PDW extractor through specially written graphical user interface (GUI) software and multi-state sequencing software. The GUI software gives the user point and click control of the PDW extractor, allowing the user to initiate and\/or terminate data collection. The multi-state sequencing software controls the data processing within the PDW extractor. Specifically, the sequencing software controls the RAM Control within the PDW extractor by: (1) monitoring a strobe that indicates data is being received by the ES system and is ready for collection; (2) selecting which RAM circuit to write the data on to; (3) writing the data onto the RAM circuit; (3) switching the RAM functions from write to read and vice versa; and, (4) reading the data to the PC computer.","The foregoing PDW collector has enough speed and memory to record all RF signals present in the dense pulse environments of any given theater for an extended length of time. Specifically, the PDW collector is capable of collecting a minimum of one million RF pulses per second. The preferred embodiment of this invention provides for storing the collected data on the PDW computer on high-speed Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) hard drives.","The above-described apparatus, capable of operating on any ship class using an ES system, is portable (easily from ship to ship or from ship to laboratory) and acts as a referee receiver (providing redundant proof of the signals received).","The present invention, a pulse descriptor word (PDW) collector, comprises an apparatus for controlled collecting and recording of all RF pulse data received by a ship's electronic surveillance (ES). The PDW collector coincidentally collects the RF pulse data as the ES system receives it (after formatting into digitized PDW data). The PDW collector includes: (1) a portable PDW extractor unit , and (2) a high-speed PDW computer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00038","num":"00038"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","1","4","10","1","7","2","3","35","36","23","6","20"]},"Data captured and stored by the PDW extractor  is also simultaneously forwarded, unaltered and uninterrupted, to the ES system presorter A via output connections J, J, and J which are connected, respectively, by cables W, W, and W to the ship's ES system presorter A at its input connections, J, J, and J. Thus, the PDW extractor  and the ES system presorter A are able to processes the same data at the same time.","FIGS. -. form a detailed block diagram illustrating the hardware configuration and interconnections of the preferred embodiment of the present invention. Referring to , using a graphical user interface (GUI) , supported by specially written software, a user initiates data collection via the PDW computer . Communication between the PDW computer  and the PDW extractor  occurs via input\/output connections J on the PDW extractor  and J on the PDW computer . Multi-state sequencing programs  within the PDW computer  are designed to control the PDW extractor . Specifically, these sequencing programs  control the RAM control  within the PDW extractor  (see FIG. ). The RAM control  then regulates the storage of data onto RAM circuits A and B,  and  respectively. FIGS. A-G.,  and -., illustrate the RAM ( and ) schematics, circuit card assembly layout, and circuit card interconnections, respectively. FIGS. A-C. and , illustrate the RAM control  schematics and circuit card assembly layout, respectively.","Referring to , the host ship's ES system receiver includes a starboard antenna angle encoder , a port antenna angle encoder  and a coarse frequency receiver (CFR) . These angle encoders produce digital word data based on both the amplitude (AMP) and the angle of arrival (AOA) of received RF signals. The starboard antenna angle encoder  transmits AMP and AOA PDWs via the ship's cable W to input J on the PDW extractor . The port antenna angle encoder  transmits AMP and AOA PDWs via ship's cable W to input J. The CFR  produces PDWs based on the frequency (FREQ) of received RFs and transmits these PDWs via ship's cable W to input J.","Once the transmitted PDWs enter the PDW extractor , the AMP and AOA PDWs are transmitted within the PDW extractor  through internal connectors J\/J and J\/J\/J to angle\/amplitude boards B and B, where the data is captured and held. Frequency PDWs are transmitted through internal connector J to the frequency formatter  and formatted.","Timing of all functions within the PDW extractor  is managed based upon a clock generator . The exterior front panel of the clock generator  has a run\/load toggle switch and a push button reset which allow the user to place the extractor into operations mode or to initialize the internal sequencer. Timing alignment controls  on the front panel  of the PDW extractor  are adjustable by the user so that the timing of the data flow control (DFC) time coincidence  synchronizes the timing of the PDW extractor  with that of the host ship's ES system. In order to accomplish the required timing alignment, the timing alignment controls  cause potentiometers , to send voltage signals into the circuit boards holding the angle, amplitude and frequency data.","Once the timing adjustment is complete, AOA, AMP and FREQ PDWs are forwarded to the PDW buffer . The PDW buffer  is a holding register where PDW data is held until it is stable and the RAM control  can write the data on to the RAM memory ( and ). The time of arrival (TOA)  of each PDW into the PDW buffer  is monitored by the clock generator . PDWs are clocked in to and out of the PDW buffer  using a first in-first out (FiFo) control logic . When the PDW buffer  holds PDW data, it sends a strobe  out to the RAM control  (see FIG. .), informing the RAM control  that there is data waiting to be collected.","Again referring to , RAM control  and the two high-speed integrated RAM circuits, RAM A () and RAM B (), are powered by a 2.5 volt power source (PS) . This power source  contains a power converter for converting a 5 volt direct current into the required 2.5 volts. A diagram of the PDW extractor's electrical flow is presented in FIG. . FIGS. -. and  illustrate the power converter schematics and the power converter assembly layout.","The writing of data onto RAMs A () and B () and the reading of data from RAMS A () and B () are controlled by the read\/write select  and the read\/write control  mechanisms of the RAM control  that is in turn controlled by the multi-state sequencing software  of the PDW computer . The purpose of these two RAM circuits ( and ) is to allow the PDW extractor  to write new PDW data onto one RAM (ie. ), while at the same time reading PDW data previously stored on the other RAM (ie. ) to the PDW computer . This write\/read loop using two RAMs allows for continuous long-term data collection and is designed to ensure that no data is lost.","Using the GUI  and data management software  within the PDW computer , the user assigns a base file name to the data to be collected and initiates the data collection process. The RAM control  has a strobe monitor  for monitoring the PDW strobe  from the PDW buffer . When the PDW strobe  indicates to RAM control  that data is ready to be collected, read\/write select  determines which RAM to write the data on to and read\/write control  initiates the writing of PDWs onto the selected first RAM (ie. ). As each PDW is written on to the first RAM, a write counter ( or  depending on which RAM is in the write mode) is incremented to indicate how many PDWs are being stored. Writing continues onto the first RAM until an interrupt, programmed by the sequencing software  of the PDW computer , simultaneously forces the read\/write select  to switch the first RAM circuit () into the read mode and the second RAM circuit () into the write mode. In the current embodiment of this invention, this interrupt is set at 1 second. Control to each RAM circuit is complementary. The sequencing programs  then read the write counter from the first RAM to determine the total number of stored pulses, and then reads that amount of stored PDW data to the PDW computer . A read counter ( or  depending on which RAM is in the read mode) within the RAM insures that the PDW computer  is reading the correct number of PDWs. This read\/write loop repeats at each interrupt. Lastly, the PDWs that are read to the PDW computer  are stored onto a RAID hard drive  within the PDW computer  for retention and later analysis.","Data management software  is written so that it is able to read stored PDW data from the hard drive, compact CD disk, DVD or other storage medium and format the data into usable (binary to decimal, etc) terms. During analysis the data parameters may be plotted into a variety of graphics such as, pulse frequency versus time of arrival, pulse frequency versus angle of arrival, amplitude versus angle of arrival, etc. The data management software  filters ranges of several parameters and stores these as spread sheet files. The data management software  is also able to relate the parameters in high resolution and format the files to play back in laboratory environment. Ultimately, once all the digitized RF pulse data from a selected theater of operation during a particular time period is captured, the ES system engineers can replay an entire event to monitor, assess, develop and update threat identification software.","Three multi-state sequencing programs , set out below, were developed for the preferred embodiment of this invention. Sequencing program  primarily controls the sequence of the processes within the PDW extractor  based upon input stimulus. Sequencing programs  and , along with sequencing program , control the outputs that in turn control data paths, write strobes, etc, all based on the \u201cstate\u201d of the sequencer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-d0e2476","num":"00002"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"294pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"SEQUENCER PROGRAM 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"280pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["C","SET UP THE STATE FIELD"]},{"entry":[{},"PSTAT=A0+2*A1+4*A2+8*A3+16*A4+32*A5"]},{"entry":["C","SET UP THE INPUT CONTROL BITS"]},{"entry":[{},"DACK=A6"]},{"entry":[{},"READ=A7"]},{"entry":[{},"NEWPDW=A8"]},{"entry":[{},"GROUND=A9"]},{"entry":[{},"NSTAT=PSTAT"]},{"entry":["C","SET UP THE OUTPUT BITS' DEFAULT CONDITIONS"]},{"entry":[{},"CLKEN=1"]},{"entry":[{},"OERAM=1"]},{"entry":["C","SET UP THE STATES"]},{"entry":["C","SEQUENCER STARTS AT 0 AND DEPENDENT ON READ MODE GOES TD RD\/WR LOO"]},{"entry":["C","READ LOOP STARTS AT 1, WR LOOP STARTS AT 32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.0.AND.READ.EQ.1)NSTAT=1"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.0.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":["C","WATCH FOR CHANGE OF READ STATUS AT TOP OF WRITE AND READ LOOP"]},{"entry":["C","FOLLOWING IS THE READ SEQUENCE  *********"]},{"entry":["C","STORE LAST ADDRESS, CLR COUNTER, HANDSHAKE WITH DIO FOR # WORDS"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.1.AND.READ.EQ.1)NSTAT=2"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.1.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.2)NSTAT=3"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.3.AND.DACK.EQ.1)NSTAT=4"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.4)NSTAT=5"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.5.AND.DACK.EQ.1)NSTAT=6"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.6)NSTAT=7"]},{"entry":["C","SET READ ADDRESS, HANDSHAKE WITH DIO FOR PDW, INC READ ADDRESS"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.7)NSTAT=8"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.8)NSTAT=9"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.9)NSTAT=10"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.10.AND.DACK.EQ.1)NSTAT=11"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.11)NSTAT=12"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.12.AND.DACK.EQ.1)NSTAT=13"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.13)NSTAT=14"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.14.AND.DACK.EQ.1)NSTAT=15"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.15)NSTAT=16"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.16)NSTAT=8"]},{"entry":["C","START WRITE SEQUENCE"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.32.AND.READ.EQ.1)NSTAT=1"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.32.AND.NEWPDW.EQ.1)NSTAT=33"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.33)NSTAT=34"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.34)NSTAT=35"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.35)NSTAT=36"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.36)NSTAT=37"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.37.AND.NEWPDW.EQ.1)NSTAT=33"]},{"entry":["C","CHECK FOR CHANGED READ MODE IF SO GOTO 0"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.3.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.5.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.8.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.10.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.12.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.14.AND.READ.EQ.0)NSTAT=32"]},{"entry":["C","CHECK FOR CHANGED READ MODE IF SO GOTO 0"]},{"entry":[{},"IF(PSTAT.EQ.37.AND.READ.EQ.1)NSTAT=1"]},{"entry":["C","SET UP CONTROL BITS VS.
