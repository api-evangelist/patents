{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["This application is based on Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2003-320699 filed on Sep. 12, 2003, and 2003-320700 filed on Sep. 12, 2003, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a processing device such as a multifunction device for executing processing in accordance with programs obtained by download or other ways, to a method for controlling such a processing device and to others.","2. Description of the Related Art","In recent years, an operating system (OS) with a high-performance application program interface (API) has been adopted to various devices in addition to devices such as a personal computer and a workstation. Such an OS is employed in a multifunction peripheral (MFP) in which functions of a copier, a printer, a scanner, a fax machine, a document server or others are consolidated and in other devices.","When an API was not sophisticated, it was difficult and time-consuming to create programs for expanding functionality of these devices or for performing applied processing. The reason was that an understanding of device structures and program coding using a language such as a machine language were required.","However, adoption of a high-performance API enabled to invoke various functionality for performing processing merely by calling API functions that are prepared in advance. In this way, programming is performed easier compared to the conventional ways.","Accordingly, programs for expanding functionality of the devices or for performing applied processing, and service providers creating and providing these programs will increase in the future. This leads to an advantage that users can use devices more conveniently and, on the other hand, to a problem that a defective program or a malicious program executing undesirable processing to cause damage to users is easily distributed.","Additionally, it is expected that a program for updating important data or system construction of a device, both of which should be acquired and used only by a system administrator, will be readily created for distribution. If so, a user, who is not an intended user, can acquire such a program and perform an improper operation, so that important data may be lost or a device may break down.","In order to prevent these problems, some sorts of checks are required at the time of executing a program in a device.","According to an invention disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication No. 2002-169621, when an application program is downloaded to a terminal device, a user of the terminal device is authenticated. Then, only when the user is authenticated, the application program is downloaded to the terminal device. Likewise, according to inventions disclosed in Japanese unexamined patent publication Nos. 2002-132726 and 2001-103270, predetermined processing including download is performed when a user is identified.","However, according to these conventional inventions, program providers only confirm the identity (authentication) of a user intending to use a program. Accordingly, it is impossible to know as to whether or not the program is a defective program, a malicious program or a program operating improperly at the user's device.","The present invention is directed to solve the problems pointed out above, and therefore, an object of the present invention is to prevent unauthorized processing from being performed in a processing device at the time of executing a program or others obtained from external devices.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a processing device includes a processing portion for executing processing, a program memory portion for memorizing a program that makes the processing portion execute processing, a judge portion for judging whether or not the program is permitted to start, and a control portion for controlling the processing portion so that processing is executed in accordance with the program when the judge portion determines that the program is permitted to start, and for controlling the processing portion so that processing in accordance with the program is not executed when the judge portion determines that the program is not permitted to start.","A processing device may be provided with plural processing portions. A processing device may include processing portions, for example, each of which performs scanning, printing, copying, transmission and reception of a facsimile, transmission and reception of a file or document management.","In order to solve the problems discussed previously more effectively, the processing portion may be controlled by the following structures.","More particularly, first, a processing device includes a creator information memory portion for memorizing first creator information used for identifying a creator of a program, the first creator information being prepared for each creator of a program, a program obtaining portion for obtaining a program from an external device along with second creator information used for identifying a creator who created the program, an authenticity judge portion for determining a program obtained by the program obtaining portion as an authorized program created by an authorized creator when the creator information memory portion memorizes the first creator information having the same contents as the second creator information obtained together with the program, and for determining the program obtained by the program obtaining portion as an unauthorized program created by an unauthorized creator when the creator information memory portion does not memorize the first creator information having the same contents as the second creator information obtained together with the program, and a control portion for controlling the processing portion so that, with respect to a program determined to be an authorized program by the authenticity judge portion, processing is executed in accordance with the program, and for controlling the processing portion so that, with respect to a program determined to be an unauthorized program, processing based on the program is stopped.","Secondly, a processing device includes a program obtaining portion for obtaining a program from an external device, a use approval\/disapproval information memory portion for memorizing use approval\/disapproval information indicating whether or not a creator of a program is permitted to use a function included in the processing portion, the program being obtained by the program obtaining portion, a use approval\/disapproval judge portion for determining whether or not a creator of a program obtained by the program obtaining portion is authorized to use the function corresponding to a code included in the program based on the use approval\/disapproval information, and a control portion for controlling the processing portion so that the function is called to execute processing when the use approval\/disapproval judge portion determines that the creator of the program obtained by the program obtaining portion is authorized to use the function corresponding to the code included in the program, and for controlling the processing portion so that processing based on the program is stopped when the use approval\/disapproval judge portion determines that the creator is not authorized to use the function.","Thirdly, a processing device includes a function calling portion for invoking a function corresponding to a code described

approval\/disapproval judge portion determines that the creator of the program obtained by the program obtaining portion is authorized to use the function corresponding to the code described in the program, and for controlling the processing portion so that processing based on the program is stopped when the use approval\/disapproval judge portion determines that the creator is not authorized to use the function.","Fourthly, a processing device includes a use approval\/disapproval information memory portion for memorizing use approval\/disapproval information for each user, the information indicating whether or not a user is permitted to use a program that makes the processing portion execute processing, a designation reception portion for receiving designation of processing that a user

The use approval\/disapproval information memory portion may be included in a device other than the processing device.","These and other characteristics and objects of the present invention will become more apparent by the following descriptions of preferred embodiments with reference to drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 7","FIG. 8"],"b":["100","1","1","3","2","71","73","73"]},"As shown in , the program sharing system  includes the multifunction device , the authentication server  and the program server . These devices can be connected to each other via a network . The Internet, an intranet, a public line, a dedicated line or the like is used as the network . Communication protocol can be TCP\/IP, FTP, HTTP or others.","The multifunction device  is a device where functions of a copier, a printer, a scanner, a fax machine, a document server or others are consolidated, and is sometimes called a multifunction peripheral (MFP). Referring to , the multifunction device  includes a CPU , a RAM , a ROM , a control circuit , a nonvolatile memory , a magnetic storage device (a hard disk drive) , a printer , a scanner , a touchscreen and a communication device ","The communication device serves to exchange data with a fax terminal, a personal computer or others (hereinafter referred to as an external terminal device ) located outside the authentication server , the program server  or the program sharing system . The control circuit serves to control all parts configuring the multifunction device .","The nonvolatile memory is a rewritable and nonvolatile memory such as an EEPROM or a flash memory. The ROM is a read-only memory. Although a ROM is generally included in a nonvolatile memory, in the first embodiment, the ROM is distinguished from the EEPROM or the flash memory. Accordingly, the former is referred to as the \u201cROM \u201d, while the latter is referred to as the \u201cnonvolatile memory ","On the magnetic storage device are installed, as an operating system (OS), programs and data for realizing functions of various portions including a processing execution portion , an API call control portion , an API management portion , a program obtaining portion , an access privileges information obtaining portion  and an access privileges database , all of which are shown in . Stated differently, these functions form an MFP core portion  that is a central portion of the multifunction device .","On the magnetic storage device are further memorized an address book database DB, an image database DB, an accounting information database DB and others. The address book database DB stores individual information  indicating a name, a company name, an address, a telephone number, a fax number or an e-mail address or others of a user (a user MU shown in , for example) using the multifunction device , business partners of the user or the like. The image database DB stores image data received from the external terminal device , image data read by the scanner or others. The accounting information database DB stores information required for charge processing for the use of the multifunction device , for example, the information including data relating to usage of the multifunction device  for each user.","All or part of these programs or data memorized in the magnetic storage device may be memorized in the ROM or the nonvolatile memory . Alternatively, all or part of the functions shown in  may be realized by a processing device (the control circuit ). These programs and data are loaded on the RAM as required and the programs are executed by the CPU ","The program server  includes an external communication portion , a data management portion  and a program database  as shown in . The program server  memorizes application programs that can be executed by the multifunction device  (hereinafter referred to as \u201cprogram(s) PG\u201d) and serves to provide the program PG via the network  in response to a request from the multifunction device . The program server  is operated by a manufacturer (maker) of the multifunction device , an agency (dealer) of the manufacturer, a third party or others.","The authentication server  includes an external communication portion , a data management portion  and a creator information database  as shown in . The authentication server  memorizes creator access privileges information  relating to a creator CR of each of the programs PG and serves to provide the creator access privileges information  via the network  in response to a request from the multifunction device . The authentication server  is operated by the maker of the multifunction device .","The authentication server  and the program server  can be server machines having a function of data transmission, for example, can be an FTP server or an HTTP server.","When a creator CR wishes a user of the multifunction device  to use a created program PG, the creator CR uploads the program PG to the program server  through the network  so as to publish the program PG. The user of the multifunction device  can access the program server , download the program PG into the multifunction device  and use the program PG.","However, when creator access privileges information  of the creator CR is not registered in the authentication server , the program PG cannot start up and executed in the multifunction device . Further, even if the creator access privileges information  is registered, when predetermined requirements are not satisfied, processing in the program PG stops. A detailed explanation will be given to these respects later.","Hereinafter, an explanation is made to all portions of the multifunction device , the authentication server  and the program server , the portions being shown in .","The processing execution portion  in  includes a memory control portion , a nonvolatile memory control portion , a touchscreen control portion , a scanner control portion , an external communication portion , an image control portion , an HDD control portion , an engine control portion  and a job management portion . The processing execution portion  controls hardware configuring the multifunction device  and performs image processing.","The memory control portion  controls the RAM (see ). The memory control portion , for example, writes data into the RAM , reads data stored in the RAM , manages a memory space and performs other processing. The nonvolatile memory control portion  writes data into the nonvolatile memory , reads data stored in the ROM or the nonvolatile memory and performs other processing.","The touchscreen control portion  displays an operation screen, a setting screen or others, determines a position where a user touches in the touchscreen and performs other processing. In other words, the touchscreen control portion  performs processing relating to a user interface.","The scanner control portion  makes the scanner read an image of a document placed on a document set glass, i.e., conducts processing for controlling the scanner to obtain image data. The external communication portion  controls the communication device to perform processing for sending and receiving data to and from the authentication server , the program server , the external terminal device  or others.","The image control portion  performs image processing such as change in resolution, enlargement or reduction of an image size, color correction, tilt correction, strikethrough correction or halftone dot correction for image data obtained from the external terminal device  or others, image data memorized in the magnetic storage device , image data of an image read by the scanner or other image data.","The HDD control portion  performs processing for reading out the programs and data memorized in the magnetic storage device or for storing the obtained programs and data on a predetermined area such as a database or a directory in the magnetic storage device ","The engine control portion  controls the printer in such a manner as to print an image based on image data obtained by the scanner or the communication device , image data subjected to the image processing by the image control portion  or others.","The job management portion  manages processing order of jobs arising in the multifunction device , or others. The jobs include a job of transmitting data to the external terminal device  using facsimile, e-mail or the like, a job of printing based on image data and a job of scanning a document.","The API management portion  manages an application program interface (API) for invoking each functionality of each of the portions structuring the processing execution portion . The API management portion  defines contents of the functionality as a function to manage by appending a function name such as \u201cGetAddressItem( )\u201d to the functionality. Hereinafter, such a function is called an \u201cAPI function\u201d.","On the multifunction device  are prepared plural API functions for writing data into the magnetic storage device , obtaining a status, obtaining an address book (the individual information ), writing data including the individual information  into the magnetic storage device , obtaining setting data for an administrator, sending a facsimile, transmitting e-mail, controlling a print job, downloading data and performing other processing.","A creator CR can create a program PG easily using the APIs. More specifically, when the creator CR intends to invoke (call) certain functionality, the creator CR may describe an API function corresponding to the functionality in the program PG. In this case, parameters can be described in parentheses of the API function, if necessary.","The program obtaining portion  downloads a program PG from the program server  to store the same in a predetermined storage medium (the RAM , the nonvolatile memory or the magnetic storage device ). When the multifunction device  is expanded, for example, the program obtaining portion  downloads a new program PG for the expansion from the program server . The access privileges information obtaining portion  obtains the creator access privileges information  of a creator CR from the authentication server  to store the same in the access privileges database . An API function is provided for each functionality realized by the program obtaining portion  and the access privileges information obtaining portion . The designation of the API function and necessary parameters allows for calling of functionality, resulting in execution of desired processing.","The creator access privileges information  (,  . . . ) of each creator CR is stored in the creator information database  of the authentication server  as shown in . The creator access privileges information  includes creator information and use approval\/disapproval information as shown in .","The creator information includes information relating to a creator name, a creator ID and a password. The \u201ccreator name\u201d is a name of the creator CR. If some creators CR create a program PG, a company name or a group name is given as the creator name. The \u201ccreator ID\u201d is identification information for distinguishing the creator CR. The \u201cpassword\u201d is used to authenticate that the creator CR is an authorized creator. The use approval\/disapproval information includes a permission API list showing API functions of functionality that the creator CR has permission to use.","A creator CR without the creator access privileges information  informs an administrator of the authentication server , e.g., a maker of the multifunction device , of his\/her name or others and requests the administrator to issue the creator access privileges information  and to register the creator CR in the creator information database .","The administrator of the authentication server  determines functionality that the creator CR can obtain permission to use in accordance with a technical skill and reliability of the creator CR. Then, based on the determination result, the administrator sets creator access privileges information  of the creator CR to register the same in the authentication server .","Referring to , the programs PG are stored as program portions of the program files  in the program database  of the program server . The program files  have program headers in addition to the program portions . Referring to , in each of the program headers is described creator information  indicative of a creator name, a creator ID, a password or others of a creator CR of the program PG. The creator information  may be described in the program header after being encrypted.","The creator access privileges information  and the programs PG are transmitted from the authentication server  or the program server  to the multifunction device  in the following procedure. For example, when a user designates a desired program PG for the multifunction device , the program obtaining portion  shown in  requests the program server  to send a program file  including the program PG.","Then, the data management portion  in  extracts the program file  requested by the program database , so that the external communication portion  sends the program file  to the multifunction device . Thus, the program file  is downloaded onto the multifunction device  to be temporarily stored in storage means such as the RAM (see ).","The access privileges information obtaining portion  shown in  requests the authentication server  to transmit the creator access privileges information  of the creator CR of the downloaded program PG. On this occasion, the creator information  presented in the program header of the program file  is transmitted to the authentication server .","Then, the data management portion  in  searches whether or not the creator information database  stores creator access privileges information  (see ) including creator information conforming to a creator ID and a password indicated in the transmitted creator information .","As a result, when the corresponding creator access privileges information  is stored in the creator information database , the creator CR of the downloaded program file  (program PG) is authenticated (judged) as an authorized (qualified) creator. Then, the data management portion  approves of transmission of the creator access privileges information , so that the external communication portion  transmits the same to the multifunction device .","The multifunction device  stores the creator access privileges information  in the access privileges database  (see ). The program file  temporarily stored in the RAM or the like is saved on the magnetic storage device or the nonvolatile memory as required. The touchscreen (see ) in the multifunction device  displays a message indicating successful download. The API call control portion  permits the program PG included in the program file  to be started up and be executed.","On the other hand, when the corresponding creator access privileges information  including the matching creator information is not stored in the creator information database , the data management portion  judges the creator CR as an unauthorized creator to refuse transmission of the creator access privileges information . Then, the external communication portion  notifies the multifunction device  of the transmission rejection.","In this case, the API call control portion  in the multifunction device  prohibits the program PG included in the program file  from starting up. Then, the program file  stored in the RAM or the like is deleted. Further, the touchscreen displays an error message indicating that since the program PG obtained from the program server  is an unqualified program, the program PG cannot start up. This situation means that download of the program PG is eventually unsuccessful.","The multifunction device  performs processing sequentially in accordance with codes described in the program PG downloaded successfully. During this series of processing, when a code (a processing code) for processing to be executed next shows an API function, the API call control portion  shown in  judges whether or not the API function is specified in the creator access privileges information  of the creator CR of the program PG. More particularly, the API call control portion  judges whether or not permission of the use of functionality corresponding to the API function is given to the creator CR of the program PG.","When judging that the API function is included, i.e., permission of the use is given, the API call control portion  issues a command to call functionality corresponding to the API function and execute predetermined processing for the API management portion . The API management portion  controls the processing execution portion  based on such a command and, if necessary, on the designated parameters.","When deciding that no permission of the use is given, the API call control portion  does not call the corresponding API function to halt processing by the program PG. Then, the touchscreen displays an error message indicating that unpermitted and unauthorized processing was intended to be executed. Alternatively, it is possible to make a user select whether or not functionality corresponding to the API function may be called to continue the processing.","When the next processing code is not an API function, a command is issued to each of the portions of the multifunction device  without involving the APIs. Thus, processing by each unit of the multifunction device  in  is performed.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0092","num":"0091"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIG. 10","FIG. 11","FIGS. 9-11"],"b":["1","2","71","1"]},"Next, an explanation is given of processing flow of each device in the program sharing system  at the time of downloading and executing a program PG with reference to flowcharts.","For instance, when a user operates the touchscreen (see ) to designate his\/her desired program PG, as shown in , the multifunction device  connects to the program server  publishing the program PG to request transmission of a program file  where the program PG is described (#).","Responding to the request, the program server  searches the requested program file  to send the same to the multifunction device  that made the request. Thereby, the multifunction device  obtains the program PG (Yes in #, and #). When the requested program file  is not included (No in #), the touchscreen displays an error message indicating as such (#).","The multifunction device  presents creator information  (see ) described in a program header of the obtained program file  to the authentication server . Then, the multifunction device  requests the authentication server  to transmit creator access privileges information  of a creator CR of the program PG (#).","Referring to , after receiving the request (#), the authentication server  searches in the creator information database  (see ) to extract creator access privileges information  having the same creator ID as that in the creator information  presented by the multifunction device . Then, the authentication server  judges whether or not the password in the creator information  is identical to the password in the extracted creator access privileges information  (#).","When the creator access privileges information  having the same creator ID as that in the creator information  is extracted, and passwords in both the information are identical to each other, i.e., when the creator information  and the creator information (see ) included in the creator access privileges information  are identical to each other in contents, the authentication server  authenticates the program PG that the multifunction device  obtains from the program server  as a program created by an authorized creator CR, approves of transmission processing (Yes in #) and sends the extracted creator access privileges information  to the multifunction device  that asked for the same (#).","When the creator access privileges information  having the same creator ID as that in the creator information  is not extracted, or when passwords in both the information are inconsistent with each other, the authentication server  regards the program PG as a program created by an unqualified creator CR (No in #). Then, the authentication server  transmits a notification to the multifunction device  that made the request, the notification indicating that since the program PG is created by an unauthorized creator CR, the creator access privileges information  cannot be sent (#).","Referring to , when receiving the creator access privileges information  from the authentication server  (Yes in #), the multifunction device  stores the same in the access privileges database  (see FIG. )(#). Then, the multifunction device  saves the program PG obtained from the program server  on the magnetic storage device or the nonvolatile memory as required (#). When the creator access privileges information  cannot be received, the multifunction device  displays the notification from the authentication server  on the touchscreen , deletes and abandons the obtained program file  (#).","Next, execution of the downloaded program PG is described. The timing of execution of the program PG includes: (1) The time when the program PG already saved in the magnetic storage device or others is called. (2) Immediately after downloading the program PG and the creator access privileges information  of the creator CR of the program PG.","Most programs PG can be executed at both the timing (1) and (2). Examples of programs PG that need to be executed at the timing (2) include programs whose update frequency is high and whose latest version needs obtaining with every execution of processing. In the case of such a program PG, it is desirable that the program PG is downloaded from the program server  every time when the program PG is needed, instead of saving the program PG on the magnetic storage device or others even after downloading the same.","The program PG is executed in the procedure shown in . First, initialization for executing the program PG is implemented (#). For example, when the program PG is executed at the timing (1), there is a case where no programs PG are stored in the RAM . On this occasion, the program PG saved on the magnetic storage device or others is read out to be loaded on the RAM . Further, the permission API list (see ) specified in the creator access privileges information  of the creator CR of the program PG is obtained from the access privileges database  (see ) to be loaded.","It is judged whether or not the first processing code described in the program PG is an API function (#).","When the first processing code is an API function (Yes in #), it is searched whether or not the API function is specified in the permission API list in the creator access privileges information  (see ) of the creator CR of the program PG (#).","When the API function is specified, it is judged that the API function is permitted to be used (Yes in #), then to perform an API call for calling functionality corresponding to the API function to execute processing (#). When the API function is not specified, it is judged that the API function is not allowed to be used (No in #). Then, execution of the program PG is discontinued and an error message is displayed on the touchscreen , the error message indicating that unauthorized processing was intended to be executed (#). Alternatively, it is possible to make a user select whether or not such processing may be executed. On this occasion, when the user selects execution of the program PG, the API call shown in Step # is performed.","When the processing code described in the program PG is not an API function (No in #), a command is issued directly to each unit of the multifunction device  to execute exactly the same processing as instructions indicated in the processing code, without the API call shown in Step #, i.e., without involving the APIs (#).","With respect to the second and later processing codes described in the program PG, processing is executed in the procedure discussed above until all the processing is completed (Yes in #).","According to the procedure described with reference to , programs PG and PG shown in  respectively are executed as described below. In addition, solid line portions and dotted line portions are illustrated as portions for showing processing in . The former means that a processing code for executing the processing is coded using API functions, while the latter means that coding for executing the processing is performed without using API functions.","The program PG shown in  is an address book management program for managing the individual information  stored in the address book database DB (see ), i.e., the address book. The program PG enables to execute processing of transmitting the individual information  designated by a user to the external terminal device  and processing of adding the individual information  received from the external terminal device  to the address book database DB.","It is supposed that a user of the multifunction device  is requested to send individual information  of a certain person to the external terminal device . The user operates the touchscreen shown in  to start up a program PG, then to designate a name of the person and an e-mail address of the external terminal device  or an address on the network. So, the multifunction device  executes the program PG to perform processing as follows.","The multifunction device  calls functionality corresponding to an API function for extraction processing to extract the individual information  of the person from the address book database DB (#). Next, conversion processing is performed, so that the extracted individual information  is converted from a format adopted in the multifunction device  (hereinafter refereed to as a \u201cstandard format\u201d) into a format corresponding to the other party (a format of spreadsheet software, for example) (#). This processing is, however, illustrated as a dotted line portion, i.e., this processing does not depend on an API function. Accordingly, the processing is executed without involving the APIs. Then, the multifunction device  calls functionality corresponding to an API function for transmission processing to send the converted individual information  to the external terminal device  (#).","When the individual information  is transmitted to the multifunction device , the multifunction device  calls functionality corresponding to an API function for reception processing to store the individual information  in a predetermined memory area (#). In the event that the received individual information  is not in the standard format, reverse conversion processing is performed, so that the individual information  is converted into the standard format (#). Then, the multifunction device  calls functionality corresponding to an API function for writing processing to register the individual information  subjected to the reverse conversion as required on the address book database DB (#).","The program PG shown in  is an image processing program for receiving image data from a terminal device to perform image processing or others. When an image file is transmitted to the multifunction device  during starting up the program PG, the multifunction device  calls functionality corresponding to an API function for reception processing to store the image file in a predetermined memory area (#).","In the event that a format of the image file is not supported by the multifunction device  (a JPEG file, a PDF file or other files, for example), conversion processing is performed, so that the image file is converted into the standard format (a format for page-description language such as a PCL, for example) (#).
