{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["It has been a continuing challenge to develop a computer keyboard that has display functionality. One particular difficulty is that two or more application programs may desire access to display output to the keyboard at the same time. No convenient mechanism exists to resolve conflicts between display requests from differing applications. Further, there may be confusion in routing input from the keyboard to these different application programs, as well as routing output from the application programs to display output on the keyboard. As a result, development of application programs for such keyboards has not advanced significantly to date.","Methods and systems for controlling access of application programs to a composite display of an adaptive input device are described herein. One exemplary computing system includes an application programming interface executable on a computing device for controlling said access to an adaptive input device having a plurality of display regions. The application programming interface is configured to receive a display request from one of the application programs to display formatted output on the composite display and is further configured to apply at least a display sharing policy based on application-specific policy settings received from the application program for defining an application-specific area including at least one of the display regions. Further, the application programming interface is configured to generate formatted output based on the application-specific policy settings, and to send the formatted output to the application-specific area for display. The application-specific policy settings include a shared display mode and an exclusive display mode.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","104","106","107","108","100","104"]},"Graphics can be displayed on the adaptive keyboard device , said graphics being projected by a projector to one or more display regions. As discussed above, display regions may be on a surface of one or more keys, where display regions (e.g., surfaces) of the plurality of keys can be logically contiguous to thereby display a logically continuous graphic across a plurality of spatially fragmented keys. One potential advantage of an adaptive keyboard device configured to display graphics over display regions that are spatially fragmented (e.g., display regions on the surfaces of keys) includes an increased flexibility and magnitude of areas available for display.","The adaptive keyboard device  can also include touch-sensitive display regions (e.g., touch-sensitive display region ) that are spatially fragmented yet not formed on the surface of keys.","The adaptive keyboard device  may be configured to recognize user input  by mechanical depression, or actuation, of one or more keys. In another embodiment, the adaptive keyboard device  may include a sensor to detect touch input  from a user over one or more touch-sensitive display regions. The sensor may detect a user presence, a pressure or electrical change from a touch by a user, and\/or a movement of the keyboard using an accelerometer, as some examples.","In one example, several application programs may be operable on a computing device with one or more peripheral adaptive input devices operatively connected to the computing device. Some or all of the application programs may desire access to the one or more adaptive input devices in order to display various graphics and in order to receive user input relevant to the respective applications. In order to control access to an adaptive keyboard device , for example, the computing system  includes an application programming interface  executable on the computing device .","In one embodiment, the application programming interface  may control access of the plurality of application programs to an adaptive input device desktop  displayed on the composite display of the adaptive input device . The adaptive input device desktop  may be independent of an active desktop  of the computing system , where the active desktop  may be displayed on display . That is, the adaptive input device desktop  and the active desktop  may be controlled independently such that different graphical images may appear concurrently on both the adaptive input device desktop  and the active desktop .","The application programming interface  may be configured to receive a display request  from one of the application programs (e.g., first application program , second application program ) to display formatted output  on the composite display. In order to define an application-specific area of the composite display for interoperation with each application program, the application programming interface  may include a policy engine  for applying a plurality of policies in order to define an application-specific area, such as first application-specific area . Policies may be based on application-specific policy settings  received from the application programs and will be discussed in detail below.","Application-specific areas are indicated in  by areas enclosed in dashed-line boxes of the adaptive keyboard device , and may include one or more keys, non-key touch-sensitive display regions, etc., to collectively form a composite display.","In one example, the application programming interface  may apply a display sharing policy , for defining an application-specific area , such as first application-specific area  including at least one of the keys (e.g., key , key ). For example, the application-specific policy settings  regarding the display sharing policy  may include a shared display mode and\/or a exclusive display mode for the first application program .","The shared display mode may indicate that the first application program  is assigned to interoperate with a first application-specific area  including a subset of an assignable region of the composite display. An example of application programs running in the shared display mode include a first application program  being allowed access to a first application-specific area  of the adaptive keyboard device  while a second application program  (or any other suitable number of application programs) is concurrently being allowed access to a second application-specific area  for the second application program .","In contrast, the exclusive display mode indicates that an application program is assigned to interoperate with an application-specific area including substantially all of the composite display of the adaptive keyboard device . In one example of operation of an application program in the exclusive display mode, a first application program  is assigned exclusive access to the entirety of the composite display, and all other running applications (e.g., second application program ) may be hidden, minimized, and\/or shut down. In some examples, the entirety of the composite display may include an assignable region of the composite display that is substantially all of the adaptive keyboard device . In other examples, the entirety of the composite display may include less than all of the adaptive keyboard device  (e.g., third application-specific area ), depending on features of the adaptive keyboard device  as well as parameters of an application program operating in the exclusive display mode.","Independent of whether an application program is to be operated in a shared display mode or the exclusive display mode, an application program such as first application program  may interoperate with an application-specific area by receiving user input via actuation, or mechanical depression, of the keys (e.g., key , key ) and outputting formatted output  for display on a display region on the surface of a key in the application-specific area. In another example, an application program may interoperate with an application-specific area by receiving user input via touch input at touch-sensitive display regions (e.g., touch-sensitive display region ) of the application-specific area (e.g., first application-specific area ) and by outputting formatted output  for display on a touch-sensitive display region of the application-specific area.","It may be appreciated that any number of application programs may be allowed concurrent access to respective application-specific areas when the application programs have respective sharing display policies specifying the shared display mode. Furthermore, an application program may be assigned more than one application-specific area, and an application-specific area may include one or more sub-regions. Positions and\/or positioning of application-specific areas and\/or sub-regions of the application-specific areas of the composite display may be customizable (e.g., movable by touch input and dragging) by a user to form a customized composite display layout.","The display sharing policy  as described is one policy that may be applied to define the application-specific area. Other policies that may be applied for various reasons include a focus-based foreground-background policy , an adaptive support level policy , a digital signature policy  and\/or a feedback policy , discussed in detail below.","The application programming interface  may apply a focus-based foreground-background policy  based on application-specific foreground-background policy settings received from first application program  in the application-specific policy settings . By applying the focus-based foreground-background policy , a foreground display mode or a background display mode for the formatted output  of an application program may be defined.","For some application programs, it may be appropriate to show graphics on the respective application-specific area of the adaptive keyboard device  when the first application program  has user focus. One example includes a word processing application program, where it is appropriate to show formatting options in a respective application-specific area when the word processing application program has user focus, and where showing said formatting options when the word processing application program does not have focus may not be desirable. In such a case, the application programming interface  may receive a background display mode policy setting from the first application program  in the application-specific policy settings , and said setting may be appropriately stored in the focus-based foreground-background policy .","On the other hand, it may be appropriate for another application program, such as second application program  (e.g., a media player) to visibly show graphics (e.g., a volume control) on respective application-specific area(s) of the adaptive keyboard device  regardless of whether the application program has user focus. In this case, the application programming interface  may receive application-specific policy settings  including a foreground display mode policy setting from the media player application program, and this may be appropriately stored in the focus-based foreground-background policy .","The application programming interface  may also be configured to apply an adaptive support level policy  based on application-specific adaptive support level policy settings received from the first application program  in the application-specific policy settings . By applying the adaptive support level policy , a display priority level for the formatted output  of the first application program  may be specified.","There may be several levels of display priority level associated with capabilities of an application program or a preferred method of interoperation of an application program with an adaptive keyboard device. A first level may be a FULL level, in which an application program is appropriately operated in the exclusive display mode described above such that it may interoperate with an entirety of an assignable region of the adaptive keyboard device. A second level may be a PARTLY level, in which an application program is appropriately operated in the shared display mode described above, such that the application program is assigned less than an entirety of an assignable region of the adaptive keyboard device, when the adaptive keyboard device is divided.","A third level may be a MINIMAL level, indicating that an application program can be operated independent of some display regions of the composite display of the adaptive keyboard display. For example, an application program may interoperate with display regions on the surface of keys but may not interoperate with other display regions of the composite display. Further, a fourth level may be a NONE level, in which an application program is configured to only receive user input via the mechanically depressible function of the keys, and may receive other standard support, such as multi-language QWERTY keyboard support and modifier key support, as some examples.","It may be appreciated that a display priority level policy setting for an application program may be a recommendation and\/or a rule. Further, the display priority level for an application program may be used in the defining of the adaptive support level policy . In another example, the display priority level may be combined with the focus-based foreground-background policy  to define behavior of an application program with respect to its interoperation with the adaptive keyboard device .","Referring now to digital signature policy , the application programming interface  may apply the digital signature policy  to thereby specify an availability of a user-defined override and an availability of an application program-defined override. In this example, the digital signature policy  is based on digital signature policy settings received from the first application program  in the application-specific policy settings , where the digital signature policy settings may include a user-defined override to override a disablement of the application program. If a user-defined override is available, a user is provided the option to manually override a disablement of an application program that lacks a valid digital signature. If a user-defined override is not available, a user is unable to manually override a disablement of an application program without a valid digital signature.","Similarly, the digital signature policy setting received at the application programming interface  in the application-specific policy settings  may include an application program-defined override specifying that, if available, the application program is able to override a digital signature check, and thus a disablement of the application program. On the other hand, if the application-defined override is not available, the application program will be unable to override a digital signature check. This will be described in more detail with respect to .","Further still, the application programming interface  may be configured to apply a feedback policy  based on feedback policy settings received from the first application program  in the application-specific policy settings . The feedback policy  may specify an availability of an operation recommendation message from the first application program  and\/or from an adaptive device developer. As one example, an operation recommendation message may include a displayable message indicating a preferred mode of operation (e.g., \u201crun this application in FULL mode\u201d). Further, user rankings and user comments regarding experiences with the first application program  in conjunction with the adaptive keyboard device  may be available on website forums, and\/or in community ranking engines at a device developer server. As such, the feedback policy  may also specify an availability of user experience rankings from a community ranking engine for the formatted output , such that user experience rankings can be made available to a user of the first application program  upon installation or use of the first application program . That is, the user experience rankings may be automatically or semi-automatically accessed by the first application program  or the device developer for display in order to provide a user with recommendations and\/or information with which the user may then decide in which mode to run, or whether or not to run, the first application program .","The application programming interface  may be further configured to generate formatted output  based on the application-specific policy settings  (e.g., shared display mode, foreground display mode, etc). The application programming interface  may send the formatted output  to an application-specific area (e.g., first application-specific area , second application-specific area , third application-specific area ) of the adaptive keyboard device , via a display driver , for display. Additionally, display output  may be sent from a number of application programs (e.g., first application program , second application program ) to one or more additional displays, such as display , via the display driver  for display on the active desktop .","The application programming interface  may be stored on mass storage  and executed by processor  using portions of memory , and may further be configured to communicate via an input\/output interface  to achieve the functionality disclosed herein.","By the description of a computing system above, it can be appreciated that the adaptive input device of the computing system may be a handheld computing device without mechanically depressible keys. That is, an adaptive input device may include only touch-sensitive display regions configured to receive touch input.","Referring now to , a flowchart illustrates a method  for controlling access of a plurality of application programs to a composite display of an adaptive input device. At , the method may include receiving a display request from one of the application programs at an application programming interface to display formatted output on the composite display.","At , the method may include applying policies, for example at a policy engine. The method includes at least applying a display sharing policy at , which is based on application-specific policy settings received from an application program, in order to determine an application-specific area including at least one of the display regions of an adaptive input device. Similar to that discussed above with respect to , the application-specific policy settings for the display sharing policy described with respect to the method  includes a shared display mode and a exclusive display mode for each application program. The shared display mode indicates that an application program is assigned to interoperate with an application-specific area including a subset of an assignable region of a composite display, and the exclusive display mode indicates the application program is assigned to interoperate with an application-specific area including substantially all of an assignable region of a composite display. The interoperating may include receiving user input via actuation of a mechanically depressible key having a display region on its surface and\/or receiving touch input at a touch-sensitive display region.","It may be appreciated that the application programming interface is configured to receive touch input via an adaptive input device, such that application-specific areas or sub-regions of application-specific areas of the composite display may be movable by touch input or other peripheral device input (e.g., cursor input via a computer mouse), to thereby form a customizable composite display layout.","As described above, any or all of policies contained in a policy engine may be applied to further characterize the application-specific area and\/or formatted output for display. Application of the one or more policies may be executed at a policy engine configured to apply a plurality of policies based on application-specific policy settings received from the application program, for the generating of the formatted output.","For example, the method  may include applying a focus-based foreground-background policy at  based on foreground-background policy settings received from an application program, to thereby specify a foreground display mode or a background display mode for formatted output of an application program. Further, the method  may include applying an adaptive support level policy at  based on adaptive support level policy settings received from the application program to thereby specify a display priority level for the formatted output of the application program. Further still, the method  may include applying a feedback policy at  based on feedback policy settings received from the application program, to thereby specify availability of an operation recommendation message from the application program and\/or from an adaptive device developer for the formatted output. Applying a feedback policy may also specify availability of user experience rankings from a community ranking engine for the formatted output. At , the method may include applying a digital signature policy based on digital signature policy settings received from the application program to thereby specify an availability of a user-defined override and an availability of an application program-defined override.","The method also includes generating formatted output based on application-specific policy settings at  and sending the formatted output to one or more of the display regions of the application-specific area for display at .","The method  may also include receiving user input at  from the adaptive input device via actuation of a mechanically depressible key and\/or via touch input over a touch-sensitive display region.","Step  may include determining whether or not to enable an application program in a control panel upon installation, as is illustrated by the flowchart of . Step  of method  may also, or alternatively, include determining whether to run the application program, and may thus allow an application program to access an adaptive input device for subsequent interoperation based on an application of a digital signature policy, as is illustrated by the flowchart of . As will be appreciated upon study of , the availability of a user-defined override specifies that a user is provided the option to override a disablement of the application program, and the application program-defined override specifies that an application program is provided the option to override a disablement of the application program.","Referring now to , the method  includes downloading a digital signature to an application program's installation package at . At , the method includes installing an application program on a computing device, and at , adding the application program to the adaptive input device control panel. At , it is determined if a digital signature is valid. This may include determining if the application program has a digital signature and if the digital signature is up-to-date. If the answer is yes at , the method  includes enabling the application program in the control panel at . If the answer is no at , the method includes disabling the application program in the control panel at .","Referring now to , the method  includes determining if a user is selecting to run an application program at . If the answer is yes, the method  includes determining if a digital signature is valid and\/or up-to-date at . If the answer is yes at , the method includes determining the display sharing policy setting of the application program at . If it is determined that the display sharing policy setting is the exclusive display mode at , the method includes determining other application programs that are running at , and hiding, minimizing, shutting down, and\/or exiting the identified running application programs at , and running the nominal application program at .","If the display sharing policy setting is not the exclusive display mode at  (e.g., it is the shared display mode), the method  includes positioning the nominal application program on the adaptive input device and\/or rearranging other running application program(s) on the adaptive input device at , and running the nominal application program at .","At , if the digital signature is determined to be not valid at , the method  includes determining at  if the application program-defined override is available to override an application program disablement. If the answer is yes at , the application program may override the digital signature check and the method  proceeds to  and the application program can run. If the answer is no at , the method  includes displaying, at , a warning on a display associated with the computing device on which the user is attempting to run the application program. At , it is determined if the user-defined override is available to allow a user to manually override a disablement of an application program. If the answer is yes at , the method determines if the user is manually selecting an override at . If the answer is yes at , the method proceeds to , and the application can be run. If the answer is no at  or , the method proceeds to  where there is a disabling of the running of the application program.","Methods for controlling access of application programs to the application programming interface as described herein may be executable on a computing device configured to execute any or all of the steps of the methods.","It will be appreciated that the computing devices described herein may be any suitable computing device configured to execute the programs described herein.
