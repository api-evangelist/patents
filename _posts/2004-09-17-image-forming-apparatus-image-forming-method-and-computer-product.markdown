{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present document incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese priority document, 2003-326536 filed in Japan Sep. 18, 2003.","1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a technology for performing a rendering process and an image processing on three-dimensional graphic data.","2) Description of the Related Art","In recent years, color desktop publishing (DTP) processors and word processors include highly-functional applications, thereby making it possible to create not only text but also complex graphics. Among others, a gradation function for successively changing color density is widely used for enhancing the appearance of documents. For example, GDI+\u00ae is known as a graphic application programming interface (API) for WINDOWS\u00ae 2000, which is an operation system dedicated to personal computers and manufactured by Microsoft Corporation. A gradient fill of this GDI+\u00ae defines, as shown in , three end points of a triangle with each different color, and interpolates inside of each point for rendering.","Also, in Power Point\u00ae, which is a presentation software program manufactured by Microsoft Corporation, two-dimensional graphics and photo images are pasted for creating documents for presentation.","Conventionally, pasting three-dimensional graphic data on a presentation document or the like is performed after the three-dimensional graphic data is converted to two-dimensional image data.","As for three-dimensional (3D) processing, a scheme is known in which end points of a triangle polygon are assigned with RGB colors and then interpolation is performed based on a plane equation.","In Power Point\u00ae of Microsoft Corporation, examples of an image to be pasted are two-dimensional bit map data and two-dimensional graphics. As for two-dimensional bit map data, due to a difference in resolution between a cathode-ray tube (CRT) and a printer, the image is disadvantageously degraded when printed out with a zoom-in process.","On the other hand, two-dimensional graphics allow zoom-in and zoom-out, and therefore no image degradation occurs due to zoom-in. However, two-dimensional graphics are not as realistic as photo images. Also, a two-dimensional graphic is merely a figure viewed from one direction. To get a figure viewed from another direction, another figure has to be rendered.","The problems described above at the time of using two-dimensional graphics can be solved by pasting three-dimensional graphic data. Three-dimensional graphic data allows zoom-in and zoom-out, and no image degradation occurs due to zoom-in. Also, three-dimensional graphics are realistic as photo images. Furthermore, the three-dimensional graphics can be rotatably pasted, thereby making it possible to freely generate two-dimensional images with different view points.","However, when three-dimensional graphic data is pasted during a rendering process with a gradient fill of GDI+\u00ae, for example, such rendering is merely two-dimensional rendering. Therefore, in rendering three-dimensional graphic data, a hidden-surface process cannot be performed and therefore, disadvantageously, a clear and realistic image cannot be generated.","The hidden-surface process is described below.  is a diagram for explaining an example of the hidden-surface process. Here, two three-dimensional triangles are provided at their end points with Z values, and the hidden-surface process is performed through the known Z buffer scheme, for example. When the hidden-surface process is accurately performed, as shown in the drawing, in a three-dimensional point of view, one triangle is penetrated by the other triangle.  is a diagram for explaining an example of a rendering process without a hidden-surface process. In this case, a figure in which one triangle is not penetrated by the other triangle, which is different from a figure actually viewed, is rendered.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIG. 34C","FIG. 34D"]},"Moreover, at the time of forming an image, such as at the time of actual printing, a scheme can be taken in which a three-dimensional graphic process is performed typically by a host personal computer on three-dimensional graphic data in print data, and after the three-dimensional graphic data is converted to two-dimensional data, the data is transferred to a printer. In this case, however, communication data and a communication time are increased. Also, due to a difference between a resolution of a host personal computer and a low resolution of the printer, an aliasing becomes conspicuous when the data is actually printed out, resulting in low image quality.","To solve these conventional problems, a printing apparatus has been published in which a rendering process is performed in the printing apparatus so that print data including three-dimensional image information received from a host is changed to a three-dimensional graphic for print-out, thereby reducing a load on data communications and achieving a high-speed process (see, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 07-168679).","This printing apparatus uses a scheme in which projection conversion is performed by the printing apparatus itself for converting three-dimensional graphic data to two-dimensional data for rendering.","According to the patent document mentioned above, a decision regarding a back side is made to a convex figure, such as a simple hexahedron, and then projection conversion is performed, thereby making it possible to render approximately accurate figure. However, the patent document does not mention a hidden-surface process required for normal three-dimensional graphic data. In practice, without such a hidden-surface process, an accurate figure cannot be rendered.","Furthermore, conventionally, the Z buffer scheme is known as a hidden-surface process. Currently, however, printers are typically at a resolution of 120 dots per inch (dpi), which requires a memory amount that is several tens of times as large as a memory amount of a CRT at a resolution of 72 dpi. Therefore, it is generally not an easy task for the printer to perform a hidden-surface process.","It is an object of the present invention to solve at least the above problems in the conventional technology.","An image forming apparatus according to one aspect of the present invention includes a rendering processing unit that represents position information of each vertex of a plurality of triangles forming a figure in a first image data with coordinate values in a first axis in a depth direction, a second axis in a first direction perpendicular to the first axis, and a third axis in a second direction perpendicular to both the first axis and the second axis, obtains the position information and color information on each vertex of the triangles, and performs the rendering process on the first image data to produce a second image data; a hidden-surface processing unit that performs a hidden-surface process on the second image data to produce a third image data; and an image processing unit that performs an image procession the third image data.","An image forming method according to another aspect of the present invention includes obtaining position information of each vertex of a plurality of triangles forming a figure in a first image data; performing a rendering process on the first image data to produce a second image data; performing a hidden-surface process on the second image data to produce a third image data; and performing an image process on the third image data.","A computer-readable recoding medium according to still another aspect of the present invention stores a computer program for realizing the image forming method according to the above aspect.","The other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are specifically set forth in or will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","Exemplary embodiments of an image forming apparatus, an image forming method, and a computer product according to the present invention are explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 1A","FIG. 1B","FIG. 2","FIGS. 1A"],"b":["1","2"]},"As shown in , the image forming apparatus includes a rendering processing unit , a hidden-surface processing unit , an image processing unit , an encoding unit , a decoding unit , and an engine controller .","The rendering processing unit  performs rendering by configuring a figure with a plurality of triangles based on image data received through a network .

The hidden-surface processing unit then performs a hidden-surface process. The image processing unit then performs an image processing. Then, image output is performed by the printer engine. With this structure, the image forming apparatus receives three-dimensional graphic data for image output, and therefore the amount of data transferred to the image forming apparatus can be made small. Also, instead of image output as bit map data, images can be formed at the resolution of the image forming apparatus. Therefore, the output image quality can be increased. Furthermore, a three-dimensional rendering process is performed inside of the image forming apparatus. Therefore, a high-speed image process can be performed.","Also, the rendering processing unit calculates color information including gray-scale information at each vertex of the triangle and differentials in the x axis direction and the y axis direction with respect to the Z value information indicating coordinate values in the depth-direction axis with a point of intersection of the plane perpendicular to the y axis direction and one of two sides of the triangle as a start point. Then, by using the calculated differentials in the x and y directions, the rendering processing unit calculates color information and Z-value information at the calculated start point through interpolation. Then, by using the position information, color information, and Z-value information at the calculated start point and the calculated differentials, the rendering processing unit calculates position information including the Z-value information and color information at pixel points between the start point to another point of intersection of the plane and the other one of the sides of the triangle through interpolation. The hidden-surface processing unit then performs a hidden-surface process on the image data by using the Z values for the respective points calculated by the horizontal interpolating unit. With this structure, color information and depth information of a plurality of triangles to be rendered can be accurately and quickly interpolated. Then, with a hidden-surface process, image output can be achieved.","Furthermore, the rendering processing unit calculates a resolution from the position information of each vertex of the triangles and a tetragon surrounding each of the triangles being divided by the minimum color length in the x axis and the minimum color length in the y axis. With the calculated resolution, the amount of change in the color information in color interpolation in the x axis direction and the y axis direction is controlled. The changing resolution (mesh) is found from the minimum color length in the vertical direction of the specified tetragon and the minimum color length in the horizontal direction thereof, thereby allowing the color information correcting unit to control a color change in color interpolation in the horizontal and vertical directions.
