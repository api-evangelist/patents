{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An aspect of the present disclosure relates to the field of laser optics, and more particularly, to a scintillation generator for simulation of aero-optical and atmospheric turbulence.","Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology for reducing the effect of wave-front distortions for improving the performance of optical systems. AO systems may be used to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion or optical aberrations in laser communication systems, astronomical telescopes, and retinal imaging systems. AO systems operate by measuring and compensating for distortions in a wave-front using a spatial phase modulator, such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.","Propagation of laser energy and sensor imagery is degraded by the optical effects of atmospheric path turbulence arising from both a near-field aerodynamic flow-field and free-stream atmospheric turbulence beyond the aerodynamic flow regime. AO systems in use since the 1970's attempt to reduce the effects of these two turbulence regimes on propagating optical signals; however, limitations of AO system closed-loop bandwidth and spatial resolution hamper the ability of AO systems to fully correct for path turbulence. Hence, optimization and refinement of AO systems is actively ongoing.","New developments in ultra-high speed laser communication have pushed data rates to 100 giga-bits per second (Gb\/sec) or higher, yet these laser communication systems are not immune to aerodynamic and free-stream turbulence, and are subject to frequent and rapid data fades and dropouts in strong scintillation (variation in amplitude at the laser-communication optical entrance pupil). For example, laser radar (LADAR) systems rely on strong target backscatter signals for accurate range and Doppler information, and these backscatter signals are again modulated in intensity by time-varying scintillation, thereby decreasing system performance.","In one aspect of the subject disclosure, the role of a two-deformable mirror (2-DM) system is reversed to create realistic turbulence and scintillation for testing and development purposes. In one aspect, the use of two deformable mirrors (DM) in a scintillation generator provides a wide variety of laser and electro-optical systems for reliable, calibrated, validated optical simulation of aerodynamic and free-stream turbulence at realistic ranges and conditions, but within an optical laboratory environment. The application of a second DM in a Fourier plane of a first DM, according to one embodiment, enables simulation of amplitude fluctuations in the far field, thus providing a means for accurately simulating realistic propagation of beams through both aerodynamic flow-fields and through free-stream paths outside the immediate flow-field. In one aspect, a scintillation generator may be easily reconfigured to any laser wavelength by changing appropriate optical lens elements. In one aspect, a scintillation generator creates programmable simulations. A scintillation generator, according to one aspect, should increase in value and utility over time and across many programs, as the input files to drive the system for a specific case are added to its broader and more general data library.","In one aspect of the subject disclosure, a scintillation generator for simulation of aero-optical and atmospheric turbulence is described. In one aspect, a first deformable mirror is illuminated using collimated light from a source laser beam. In one aspect movement (actuation) of a first deformable mirror is controlled to modulate a reflected laser beam to induce wave-front phase error (aberrations) onto a reflected laser beam to simulate propagation of the reflected laser beam through near-field aero-optical disturbance. In one aspect, the reflected laser beam is focused onto a second deformable mirror to form a near-field beam. In one aspect, movement (actuation) of the second deformable mirror is controlled to modulate a reflection of the near-field laser beam to induce amplitude fluctuations onto the reflected near-field laser beam to simulate propagation of the reflected near-field laser beam through far-field atmospheric turbulence. In one aspect, the second deformable mirror is in a Fourier plane of the first deformable mirror. Other aspects are described and claimed.","It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.","The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of understanding.","Some aspects of the subject disclosure, address a need in technology development for a wide variety of laser and electro-optical systems for reliable, calibrated, validated optical simulation of aerodynamic and free-stream turbulence in a laboratory setting. Conventionally, it has been necessary to setup laser-based sensors and systems on mountaintops, towers and\/or building tops (as far apart as practical) to test performance at range, typically followed by very costly flight testing. This open-air testing introduces random, uncontrollable unrepeatability into the test data, as well as tower or building vibration and local thermal effects. Flight testing adds several layers of unrepeatability to the testing. In addition, both methods are highly susceptible to weather conditions, and are complicated by requiring lengthy and stringent approvals by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for laser operation, often accompanied by restricted operation times.","Some aspects of the present disclosure eliminate the need for long-range testing during development of laser and electro-optical systems. In one aspect, single-DM modulation of collimated beams is used to vary the wave-front phase error in the beam. The application of the second DM in the Fourier plane of the first DM, as embodied in one aspect of the present disclosure, enables simulation of amplitude fluctuations in the far field, thus providing a means for accurately simulating realistic propagation of beams through both aerodynamic flow-fields and through free-stream paths outside the immediate flow-field. Inclusion of a variable-density neutral filter may allow simulation of path absorption by the atmosphere. Optional inclusion of weak holographic diffusers in the path simulates atmospheric scattering and radiance. This combination of components may provide a direct, easily calibrated, easily validated method for accurate simulation of long-path propagation, but within the controlled environment of an optical laboratory.","In one aspect, the scintillation generator may be easily reconfigured to any laser wavelength by changing appropriate optical lens elements. In one aspect, a scintillation generator creates programmable simulations. A scintillation generator, according to one aspect, should increase in value and utility over time across many programs, as the input files to drive the system for a specific case are added to its broader and more general data library.","One aspect of the present disclosure allows precise simulation of long-path turbulence and scintillation within the controlled environment of an optical laboratory with no restrictions other than those imposed by standard laser safety regulations. The deformable mirrors used in one aspect are strictly under computer control, and thus provide accurate, repeatable, calibration and validation of wave-front modulation of any desired temporal and spatial behavior, and at any level of intensity. This provides a direct means and method for testing the performance of laser and electro-optical systems at realistic ranges and conditions, but within the optical laboratory environment.","In one aspect, two deformable mirrors (DM) are used in this scintillation generator. In one aspect, a first DM is fed collimated light and is used to generate time-varying optical wave-front phase errors that simulate the temporal and spatial behavior of realistic aerodynamic and atmospheric turbulence. Light reflects from this first DM to a focusing mirror and is brought to the mirror focal point, which may be the Fourier plane for the first DM. In one aspect, a second DM is positioned at this focal point, and its surface profile is driven to simulate realistic spatial and temporal amplitude fluctuations in the beam, characterized by the beam Rytov number, coherency length (r), anisoplanatic patch size, scintillation variance and other metrics.","In one aspect, a third mirror may re-collimate the beam, which is then optionally passed through a variable neutral density filter to simulate path absorption, then optionally through weak holographic diffusers to simulate path scattering and radiance, then into a zoom lens that brings the beam to the focal point of a larger test collimator. The zoom lens focal ratio may be varied to change the average diameter of the beam projected from a collimator. In one aspect, the scintillation generator is fully programmable through standard adaptive optics techniques and is able to duplicate any desired level of aero-optical and atmospheric turbulence and transmission at any desired, simulated test range.","As described herein, the term \u201cnear field\u201d may refer to an immediate flow-field surrounding and affecting a vehicle. As further described herein, the term \u201cfar field\u201d may refer to aerodynamic flow-fields and free-stream paths outside the immediate flow-field surrounding a vehicle.
