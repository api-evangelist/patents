The present invention preferably facilitates the transfer, compilation, aggregation, integration, and\/or distribution of data. The data may be in: one or more software applications; common or proprietary, structured or unstructured, formats; centralized or distributed database(s); and\/or compatible or incompatible formats.","Data typically must be transferred, cleaned, converted, and\/or coded from a native format into the recipient's format, before it can be used by the recipient. Frequently, incompatibility is so severe that the data may need to be re-keyed or otherwise reentered. Data may be coded in one format, converted to another format so that it can be transferred or exchanged, and converted back into the first or other proprietary formats for subsequent processing. Third parties may not have access to the formats used at various stages of processing, requiring further conversion.","Professional service(s) practices rely on information from disparate sources. A medical practice, for example, may maintain: patient identifying and contact information; medical history records; financial and accounting software to generate bills, process insurance and third party payment claims, and perform accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and payroll functions; and various other systems. In a hospital or clinical setting, separate software systems typically manage radiology, pharmacy, laboratory, and nursing functions. Private physicians typically use separate software systems for scheduling; accounting; word processing; and retrieving laboratory records. In addition, various expert systems have been developed to assist in diagnosing conditions and devising appropriate treatment therapies. Other software systems provide assistance in selecting appropriate tests and interpreting results.","As a further example, a law practice typically maintains information relating to: clients; matters being worked on for those clients; projects undertaken in connection with those matters; tasks that are necessary to complete those projects, and events relating to those matters and\/or projects. These may include, without limitation: identifying and\/or contact information for clients, potential clients, adversaries, counsel, foreign associate counsel, witnesses, vendors, experts, investigators, and others involved in the matter or project; billing information; documents, references, exhibits, and other records; email and other electronic records; fact and legal research; correspondence; pleadings; docketing; finance, budgeting, timekeeping, expense, billing, general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, collection, and other financial data; and, potentially, a wide variety of other project management tools.","Document management and\/or document assembly systems are typically employed in a legal practice to generate, maintain, manage, and retrieve work product. Many legal practices maintain \u201clibraries\u201d of prior work product, work flow forms, and\/or \u201cprecedents.\u201d These resources help maintain quality control, providing a knowledge base for training younger attorneys and efficiently generating work product. Graphics, modeling, presentation, and visualization tools are becoming more widely used. In addition, as in medicine, various expert systems are used, particularly in specialized areas of practice, such as litigation, securities, real estate, intellectual property, and others. More recently, the demand for case management systems has increased, particularly among in-house law departments. Case management systems known by the present inventor prior to the present invention, however, shared several of the deficiencies identified below.","Professional service(s) practices typically maintain these types of information in various custom, proprietary, specialized, mass-marketed, and\/or open software applications. These applications are not adapted to, and in many instances, are not capable of, cooperating or communicating with one another. Data, therefore, must frequently be converted or re-entered in various applications.","One of the greatest strengths of modern computer networks is their adaptability. They support a wide variety of different software applications and enable users to share work product. The users may be permitted to tailor their computing environment to their individual work patterns. This is highly desirable, yet, this pattern of individualized computing fosters a proliferation of software applications, operating systems, and network management applications. The architecture of computer networks has compounded the difficulties of managing these disparate systems.","Most networks combine various hardware components: personal computers; network and mainframe components; servers and routers; desk tops, laptops, and hand-helds; remote access devices; personal digital assistants (PDAs); wireless access devices; various output devices, and a bewildering array of accessories. Each typically has a different operating system; of different vintage, quality, and capability. Apart from the substantial challenges this imposes on network managers and systems administrators, it has made the ready transferability of data between components more difficult, if not impossible.","In a typical law practice, for example, information systems and software may include, without limitation:\n\n","Docketing illustrates some of the problems posed by the lack of data transferability in a law practice setting. Both counsel and their clients desire access to certain information maintained in a docket. Professional liability carriers typically require independence and redundancy in docketing, or calendaring, systems. A law firm typically maintains: organization-wide; department-wide; and\/or practice group-wide docketing systems, in addition to each individual attorney or professional maintaining their own docket. The organization or department-wide system is typically secured; a limited number of individuals have write access and others have read-only access. While these restrictions help preserve the security, integrity, and reliability of the data, they impair the transferability of the data.","Many docketing systems now include a web-access feature that allows the client, or others outside the law firm to access the data. Yet, these systems generally remain: proprietary; rigid in their formatting; and rigid in their ability to transfer or exchange information with other software applications and to accept related project management and\/or financial information. More important, a corporate client retaining multiple outside law firms would be forced to access multiple web sites in order to collect the desired docketing information from each. Centralizing the docket by a third party to derive the client form, the burden shifts to each law firm which still requires visiting several different sites to collect the desired docketing information about its clients. While the client's interests should predominate relative to those of the outside law firm, secure and ready access by all concerned is preferable.","Extranets remain complex and limited in their functionality. Web-based systems have not resolved the fundamental problem that pertinent data is stored in multiple inconsistent formats.","Data maintained in a docketing system (such as addresses, client and matter identifying information, deadline dates, events, tasks, etc.), may also be needed in accounting, word processing, litigation support, case management, risk analysis, database, and other applications. It may be needed by persons both inside and outside the organization. The rigidity of most docketing systems, however, impairs or prevents the data from being readily exchanged with other applications. Consequently, data is typically manually transferred (cut and pasted) or simply key-entered repeatedly in each application in which it is needed, presenting multiple additional opportunities for errors and data corruption.","As a further example, address book applications provide a stark illustration of some of the inefficiencies and problems associated with the lack of application-independence and portability of data used in a professional services practice. In a typical law office, an address is needed by several professionals and support staff: the accounting system to clear conflicts and to open new client matters against which to accrue time and charges; the docketing system, the word processing and document management systems to enable professionals to generate work product, lists of specialized vendors, such as foreign associate counsel; the relationship management systems to enable professionals to conduct client development and business development activities; and the various handheld and portable devices in which the professionals may wish to maintain their personal address data.","The address of a new client, for example, may be entered (typically manually) in an attorney's personal address list when he or she solicits the prospective client initially. In the course of generating or sending materials soliciting the prospective client, the address may be reentered and then maintained in various distributed applications such as business development lists, word processing systems, document management systems, and\/or relationship management systems. The same address may even be entered by multiple professionals in the same applications. If the client engages the firm, the address, among other information, will be reentered\u2014typically manually\u2014into the firm's conflicts checking, accounting, and\/or time and billing systems. The address will typically be reentered\u2014again manually\u2014into the firm's docketing and\/or calendaring systems. As files are created, it will be reentered\u2014again typically manually\u2014in the firm's filing systems. So too, as work product is generated, it is typically reentered into the individual documents as they are created, although one or more of these iterations of the address may be captured at some point in a document management and\/or forms generation system, from which it can be used in other documents. As bills are generated, the address is accessed again\u2014either by entering it anew, or from one of the multitude of locations where it already resides\u2014to generate an invoice and cover letter.","As a result, the same intended address now resides in multiple locations in the firm's computer network, each likely being different and possibly containing incorrect and inconsistent information, style, and formatting. At each point where it was entered or used, time is wasted in reentering the same information. At each entry point, there are new opportunities for additional errors being introduced.","These problems extend to databases that are expressly intended to resolve these problems. For example, some relationship management systems are expressly designed to be compatible with certain email, calendaring, and address systems, such as Microsoft Outlook and\/or Lotus Notes. Yet, while the data may be portable between the applications to a greater or lesser degree, incompatibilities remain, that have resulted in corruption or loss of the data, or general protection faults. For example, errors and inconsistencies frequently result between Palm databases, Notes databases, and relationship management databases that purport to contain the same information. The format of the data is different in all three and, although some fields are substantially the same, others are different, truncated, or missing. The data is not reliably transferred between them in practice, due to software flaws and\/or incompatibilities. Moreover, the undue complexity of these systems makes them difficult for even sophisticated users to use competently. In Applicant's experience, these problems extend to all of the types of data used in a professional service(s) practices.","Some mass-marketed applications have claimed portability, while others have simply ignored or actively resisted it. Generally, word processing applications, due to their widespread use, have been under greater pressure to make their data portable than more specialized applications, such as docketing, accounting, and time and billing applications. Prior to the present invention, none of the applications of which Applicant is aware have achieved the desired level of portability, let alone substantial application independence of their data, with the possible exceptions of applications, such as Adobe Acrobat, that specifically attempt to enhance the portability of data.","Applications, such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, PowerPoint, Corel WordPerfect, and\/or Corel QuartoPro have claimed at various times that some data was substantially portable between several of these applications. Even these limited applications, however, encountered substantial problems in transferring data from one application to another prior to the present invention. Docketing and accounting systems have generally been even more problematic with respect to the portability and\/or application-independence of their data.","In some businesses outside the professional service(s) sector, these incompatibility problems have been addressed by massive integration of centralized database applications. This is typically done, enterprise-wide, on an Oracle, SAS, SAP, or other centralized platform, integrating financial and operational data. In a professional services setting, such as law and\/or medicine, centralized database applications have generally been disfavored for several reasons. First, the cost and complexity of these types of integration projects have been prohibitive. Second, the rapid evolution of hardware and software further contraindicate the massive investment required for centrally integrated databases. Third, the distributed nature of professional services, as well as security concerns, teach away from massive integration in a professional services setting.","Distributed systems provide lower overall cost and greater flexibility, as well as enhanced availability and security, in the event of a failure of, or attack on, one or more network components. In addition, the need for access to the data by multiple independent parties (clients, their outside counsel, vendors, and others), continues to favor distributed solutions.","Thus, there has long been an unresolved need for secure, reliable, simple data transfer between applications. Prior known approaches have failed to meet this long-felt and unresolved need, particularly in a professional service(s) setting. The commercial software industry has long overlooked professional service(s) markets. Professional service(s) markets, therefore, have had to rely on either mass-marketed software applications that are not adapted to their particular needs, and\/or customized and\/or proprietary solutions that are expensive, complex, and limited in their flexibility and adaptability.","No mass-marketed software application is \u201cbest in class\u201d in every function it performs (e.g., email, scheduling, calendaring, word processing, document management, spreadsheet, docketing, etc.). Applications, or suites of applications, may be considered by some users superior in certain functions and inferior in others. Lawyers in private practice, in particular, need to interface with multiple clients who may be using different software applications for performing the same function. Users end up securing multiple, competing software applications. This results in duplication in purchasing and training, while only certain programs or features of each application are actually used.","In principle, data should be application-independent. Any application should be able to access the data. In practice, however, databases are built for specific applications. Commentators have long recognized that, \u201c[t]he biggest challenge is to find ways of cutting the ties that inherently bind programs to specific computers and to other programs.\u201d W. Wayt, Gibbs, \u201cTrends in Computing, Software's Chronic Crisis,\u201d SA, September 1994, at 94. A need exists for consumers to meld the best components of various programs and\/or suites to meet the user's, rather than the programmer's, software vendor's, or reseller's needs. A consumer focus on data transferability, however, is largely absent from software development. Rather, each software application is typically written in a different, and incompatible, proprietary format.","Although many mass-marketed applications advertise that they are \u201copen,\u201d they are fundamentally proprietary systems and are \u201copen\u201d only to the extent that the vendor has decided to enable development of certain compatible applications. These proprietary formats are generally not compatible with other software applications. Even in those situations in which the software is marketed with the express representation that data is transferable between them (such as between Microsoft Word and Corel WordPerfect, or between various applications in a single manufacturer's suite of applications software such as Microsoft Office), frequently, they are not.","During the 1990's, law firm accounting systems, such as TMC and Elite, were sold based upon the representations that data was freely transferred from these proprietary systems to more easily used, mass-marketed, software such as Excel spreadsheets. In practice, however, this was not the case. Transferring data was cumbersome, time consuming, and required manual intervention and conversion, typically, with specialized assistance from personnel specifically trained in the proprietary software.","Such incompatibilities regularly cause catastrophic failures. The \u201cblue screen of death,\u201d received when a general protection fault occurs in the Windows operating system, has become a regular feature of network and PC-based computing. TEat 23, Col. 3, II. 10-12 (Nov. 13, 1999). Nor has the advent of Windows XP and other operating systems resolved these problems. One of the advertised benefits of Windows XP was that it finally enables software applications to transfer data between one another. This marketing simply underscores the failure of prior known approaches to resolve this fundamental and long-felt need. Moreover, Windows XP continues to suffer faults, with a \u201cTask List\u201d interface provided to terminate the offending application(s). Thus, rather than correcting or avoiding the incompatibilities that give rise to such failures, the generally accepted solution remains to terminate application(s) and\/or reboot the computer.","These types of failures are unacceptable in a modern business environment. Instead, simplicity, transferability, speed, reliability, and security are required. Mass-marketed application software companies have not met these challenges. Instead they continue to supply software products that include known\u2014and remediable\u2014defects. In 2001, Microsoft Corporation ran a \u201c99999\u201d national advertising campaign\u2014alluding to Six Sigma (3.4 defects in a million opportunities) reliability for its server products. Similarly, during 2002, Oracle ran an \u201cUnbreakable Linux\u201d campaign. In reality, mass marketed business application software of the type used in professional services practices has come nowhere near achieving these levels of reliability.","Incompatibility, flowing from the proprietary nature of various software platforms, ultimately requires that data be converted or that the same information be re-entered in multiple applications. This is wasteful and introduces multiple opportunities for error in data entry, maintenance, and retrieval. Proprietary software applications also require extensive investment in training, retraining, and support. Typically, the more powerful the tool, the more rigorous the training requirements. In a professional service(s) practice, such as medicine or law, the individuals who could most benefit from these tools are the individuals whose time is most highly valued and whom the organization can least afford the extensive investment in training, retraining, and support time required to gain proficiency in multiple applications.","Ideally, the data used in a business should be exchanged on a commodity basis, the data should be application-independent. Although distributed PC-based networks could have fostered that result, they have had the opposite result. PC-based network systems have fostered the proliferation of incompatible, proprietary applications software. These proprietary systems have resulted in: maintenance problems; undue complexity in systems architecture and design; excessive network systems support requirements; the need for duplicate copies of applications software; increased systems maintenance; increased cost; impaired access to data; increased training time and expense; diversion of professional time to non-productive uses; and, ultimately, impairment of access to the information needed to run the practice or business.","Edward Tenner has compared the development of computer technology to an arm's race: arms races \u201chelp mainly the armorers,\u201d in this case the developers and vendors of computer systems, rather than users. Edward Tenner, \u201c-\u201d TWQ, Summer 1990, at 102-05. Training time must be balanced against the value of upgrades, which sap even more resources. Managers demand more and more data from sophisticated financial and statistical software. The ease of generation and revision of documents begets more documents and more revisions. Data expands to fill ever cheaper storage technology. As a result, the paperless office never arrived. The result has been information overload. Id. New technologies have enabled greater productivity, yet, have done little to guide that effort in a productive manner. Automation alone does not make an organization more efficient or productive. Recognizing and addressing these various revenge effects are key to improving the efficiency and productivity of a business organization. Id.","In spite of Tenner's admonitions, more than a dozen years ago, the software industry has done little or nothing to address the fundamental incompatibility and lack of reliability of their products. Rather, with the proliferation of application software options, the problem has worsened, markedly.","Nor do large-scale software integration projects offer a viable alternative. In 1994, W. Wayt Gibbs, published an article, entitled \u201cSoftware's Chronic Crisis\u201d SA, September 1994, at 86, in which he commented: \u201c[t]he average software development project overshoots its schedule by half; larger projects generally do worse. And some three quarters of all large systems are \u2018operating failures\u2019 that either do not function as intended or are not used at all. Gibbs notes, sarcastically, that the art of programming has taken 50 years of continual refinement to reach this stage.\u201d Id. at 86-87.","Gibbs chronicles a number of high profile software failures and attempts to deduce some of their root causes. These include a pervasive lack of quality and repeated systems failures suffered by various software systems. Among the software engineering failures Gibbs chronicles are: the baggage handling system at Denver International Airport; the loss of the Clementine space probe; the State of California's attempt to merge its driver and vehicle registration systems; the unsuccessful attempt to force the expansion of American Airline's successful \u201cSabre\u201d reservation system to integrate hotel and car reservation bookings; the Federal Aviation Administration's replacement of it's air traffic control software with its failed \u201cAdvanced Automation System;\u201d and other spectacular failures.","The term \u201csoftware engineering\u201d was coined in 1968 at a NATO Science Committee meeting, to describe: \u201cthe application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.\u201d Id. at 87. Yet, more than thirty years later, most software continues to be \u201chandcrafted from raw programming languages by artisans using techniques they neither measure nor are able to repeat consistently.\u201d Id. Software development is stuck in a pre-industrial stage of development, comparable to the stage of manufacturing prior to Eli Whitney's innovation of interchangeable parts that could be assembled by any skilled craftsman. Software \u201cengineering\u201d remains largely aspirational. Programmers' \u201cacceptance that everything they produce will have defects\u2014must change in response.\u201d Id. at 88.","Nor have distributed systems approaches proved successful in overcoming the lack of maturity of the software industry. In addition to the problems presented by order of magnitude growth every decade, undue complexity, lack of adequate documentation, and failure to integrate successive stages of evolution of a software product, the stresses imposed by \u201cdistributed systems\u201d are substantial. \u201cSoftware is buckling as well under tectonic stresses imposed by the inexorably growing demand for \u2018distributed systems\u2019; programs that run cooperatively on many networked computers. Businesses are pouring capital into distributed information systems they hope to wield as strategic weapons. The inconsistency of software development can turn such projects into Russian roulette.\u201d Id.","In June of 1994, IBM's Consulting Group released a study of 24 leading companies that had undertaken large distributed systems: 55% cost more than expected; 68% overran their schedules; and 88% had to be substantially redesigned. Id. at 89. \u201cThe survey did not report one critical statistic: how reliably the completed programs ran. Often systems crash because they fail to expect the unexpected. Networks amplify this problem. \u2018Distributed systems can consist of a great set of interconnected single points of failure, many of which you have not identified beforehand . . . \u2019 \u2018The complexity and fragility of these systems pose a major challenge.\u2019\u201d Id.","Gibbs emphasizes the lack of discipline and professionalism in the software industry. Although some researchers are addressing practical, repeatable solutions, most of the industry is not. The Software Engineering Institute has developed a Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for rating software development organizations. Its survey of over 261 organizations ranked over 75% at the lowest level\u2014chaotic in their ability to create predictable software that meets their customer's needs. By late 1994, only two, Motorola's Indian programming team in Banglore, India, and Loral's on-board space shuttle team, received the highest rating, for having good management practices for software development. Id. at 90.","\u201cMass-market software producers, because they have no single customer to please, can take a belated and brute force approach to bug removal: they release the faulty product as a \u2018beta\u2019 version and let hordes of users dig up the glitches.\u201d Id. Although Microsoft Corporation prides itself that its software is \u201cbeta-tested\u201d by tens of thousands of users, this system is expensive, inefficient, and, ultimately, ineffective. Most software developers cannot and do not secure even this ineffective, level of exposure. The result is a continuing stream of defective and faulty products. Id.","Software continues to be developed through an \u201cevolutionary\u201d approach, despite the persistent flaws of that process. \u201cClean room\u201d approaches attempt to prevent the introduction of bugs, or build software systems from established prototypes of graphic interface components. They attempt to meld formal notations, correctness proofs, and statistical quality control with an evolutionary approach to software development. Id. at 91. This development approach attempts to grow systems, one function at a time, and certify the quality of each unit before integrating it into the architecture. Id. Unfortunately, these advances generally have not been adopted by producers of mass-market software, the type of software typically used in a business or professional service(s) setting.","In contrast to other engineering disciplines, such as Chemical Engineering, Software Engineering has steadfastly resisted progress toward professionalism. Mary M. Shaw, of Carnegie Mellon University, has described some of the common stages in the evolution of engineering disciplines: from craft and production to commercialization; and from commercialization and science to professional engineering. Id. at 92. The progression in software development from craft and production to commercial scale production was achieved decades ago. Yet, the development of scientific methods, and the merger of those methods with commercialization technologies into a professional engineering framework has yet to occur. It continues to encounter substantial resistance among the companies, managers, and engineers who produce these software products. As a result, productivity in software development has lagged behind that of most mature disciplines, including computer hardware engineering. Id. at 93.","One glaring example of the lack of professionalism in software development is the presence of \u201cEaster Eggs\u201d in mass-marketed software programs. For years, programmers have been hiding \u201csurprises\u201d in computer code. \u201cMessages from the Hall of Tortured Souls\u201d, TE, Dec. 18, 1999, at 75. Most popular software, including business, word processing, spreadsheet, Internet browsers, and others have undocumented \u201cEaster eggs\u201d hidden among their millions of lines of code: exploding Lara Croft (the lead character in the popular \u201cTomb Raider\u201d computer games), a flight simulator in Microsoft Excel 97, a hidden pinball game in Windows Word 97, Monzilla in Netscape Navigator V 4.05; Monzilla being crushed by the Microsoft \u201ce\u201d mark in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. Id.","The consumer is not offered the option to reject these deliberate and extraneous bits of software. One expert in computer security, Ross Anderson, at Cambridge University in Britain, has stated: \u201cEaster Eggs are a telling symptom of poor quality control at many software companies . . . . Purchasers are right to be concerned; the great majority of computer-security failures result from the opportunistic exploitation of vulnerabilities that are discovered by chance. The software vendors should be concerned too; programmers who are so badly supervised that they can hide games for their friends' amusement can also hide time-bombs.\u201d Id. at 76.","Another indicator of the lack of professionalism in the development of mass-marketed software is the steadfast refusal of most software companies to stand behind the products they sell. Rather than provide consumers the types of warranties that are common in almost every other industry, software manufacturers continue to disclaim responsibility for their products, going so far\u2014fifty years after their discipline was launched\u2014as disclaiming that their products will function as intended and are fit for the express purposes for which they were sold.","Unlike the computer hardware industry, the software industry has failed to embrace consensus performance standards. \u201c[M]ature engineering fields codify proved solutions in handbooks so that even novices can consistently handle routine designs, freeing more talented practitioners for advanced projects. No such handbook yet exists for software, so mistakes are repeated on project after project, year after year.\u201d W. Wyat Gibbs, SA, September 1994, at 93.","In sum, the software industry in general, and the mass-marketed software segment of the industry in particular\u2014the segment upon which most business and professional software users rely, has strongly resisted the trend to professionalism. Although researchers are investigating several promising approaches, these approaches are not yet generally accepted. Significant technical and cultural barriers remain to the success of these approaches. Id. at 95.","Professional services markets have generally eschewed massive integration of data in favor of distributed solutions. Prior known approaches have typically involved creating yet another proprietary software application, that substitutes for the original application software or is used in parallel with it.","Christopher, et al., International Publication No. WO 9524010 A1, for Computer System for Managing Patient Care (Sep. 8, 1995) (U.S. application Ser. No. 09\/502,598), discloses an integrated computer system for managing medical care of patients. Christopher discloses a centralized, proprietary computer system that handles the various functions in a medical office in a single proprietary application. Christopher's centralized application replaces\u2014rather than works in concert with\u2014various specialized, distributed applications that would otherwise perform each function. Christopher prompts entry of information by the user about a patient's medical history, physical examination, insurance coverage, and diagnosis. Christopher maintains a database that allows the physician to review and compare cost information for alternative treatments associated with the patient's diagnosis at the time of treatment.","Christopher expressly recognizes that \u201cseparate, incompatible software packages are often used for scheduling, accounting, word processing and retriev[al] . . . . A number of expert systems have been developed in the past to assist the physician in clinical diagnosis. Other software systems are intended to assist the physician in selecting appropriate tests and treatment, and interpreting test results. However, these expert systems have not been integrated with the other aspects of the medical practice to enable the physician to monitor the outcome of patient treatment, in terms of either the cost or efficacy of medical treatment.\u201d Id. at 2, II. 3-12. Christopher seeks to address the problem of coordinating the information that would otherwise be contained in multiple, incompatible software programs and replacing them with a massively integrated, proprietary computer system for managing medical care of patients.","Christopher's approach requires that all of the information be recorded and maintained in Christopher's proprietary system. This requires entry and\/or reentry of the information in response to screen prompts. There is no accommodation to integrate or accept data from the types of distributed applications that are otherwise used in a medical office, or to transfer information maintained in an office's legacy systems.","Microstrategy, Inc., of Vienna, Va., is the assignee of a series of patents for systems and methods for deriving information from a database system and outputting that information is a useful form through a personalized On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) system.","Yost, et al., U.S. Pat.

In addition to maintaining basic identifying and background information about a matter, the system provided a vehicle for conducting correspondence between in-house and outside counsel about a particular matter. The source data is maintained in the Notes database with a dedicated, limited access messaging format for exchanging communications, authorization, and instructions about a case between outside counsel and the in-house case manager at AIG.","More recently, numerous case management software applications have been offered. Hummingbird, Ltd., offered a product under the brand name LawPack. Hummingbird acquired LawPack when it acquired PC Docs Group International, Inc., in June 1999. PC Docs sold the LawPack product for the in-house counsel market and its PC Docs document management product for outside counsel firms. The LawPack product did not fit within Hummingbird's core business strategy and Hummingbird announced in late 2001 that it was phasing out the LawPack product.","Other vendors who have offered case management applications include: eCounsel (Bridgeway Software Inc.); Legal Desktop (Corprasoft Inc.); Law manager (Elite Information Group, Inc.); TeamConnect (Mitratech, Inc.); ProLaw (ProLaw\u2014West Group); and Practice Manager (RealLegal, Inc.). Some of these products are also offered in web-enabled versions. The present inventor believes that each suffers at least some of the same drawbacks mentioned above of being either a proprietary, centralized approach that fails to accommodate the distributed, networked application environment in which most professional services practices operate, or requiring duplicitous entry of data into distributed, proprietary systems in which the data is not readily portable or substantially application-independent.","The Internet, generally, and World Wide Web in particular, has fostered the development of a series of protocols that enhance the transferability of data. New protocols, such as POP (post office protocol), HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), WAP (Wireless Application Protocol), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), and others, allow a variety of devices and accessories (computers, hand held devices, and mobile phones) to \u201ctalk to\u201d one another. Judge Jackson observed in his opinion in the Microsoft antitrust case, that the Internet \u201ccould oust the PC operating system from its position as a proprietary platform for applications development and the main interface between users and their computers.\u201d \u201cThe Future: Tomorrow's Internet,\u201d THE ECONOMIST, at 23 (Nov. 13, 1999).","HTML describes only the layout of a web page and does not describe its contents. Other protocols, such as XML (extensible Markup Language), also describe information content through the use of metatags. XML allows previously incompatible computer programs to communicate with one another to the extent of the information coded through metatags. Other approaches, such as Java, may also prove useful in facilitating the ready transfer of data. Although XML has won widespread support in recent years from Internet standard bodies such as the World Wide Web Consortium, it too has drawbacks, namely: astonishing complexity (Id. at 26) and the impracticality of metatagging the entire contents of a page. Standards are, nonetheless, emerging. Most of these are open standards.","Although XML is beginning to address the issue of transferability of data in the context of web search engines, it is a limited approach and has not been applied among the various software applications within a machine to enhance the transferability of data within an application or between applications. These standards have not found their way back into the PC or office network environment to help resolve the basic problem of transferring information between incompatible application software platforms within the same computing device or network. Nor have these approaches yet been applied to distributed networks serving professional services markets.","No solution yet emerged with respect to the security issues facing internal networks (authentication; authorization; confidentiality; integrity; and non-repudiation), let alone the Internet. Id. at 26. Encryption technologies have been suggested as a potential solution. Id. Yet, these too are saddled with the drawbacks of undue complexity and being proprietary and, therefore, less flexible and more rigid that desired. Id. Although PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) systems, employing digital certificates are also gaining ground, particularly in banking and telecommunications, they are similarly complex, rely on third party involvement, and are not well-adapted to use within an internal network to commoditize data between applications.","The \u201copen architecture\u201d movement regained momentum with the explosive growth of the Internet. The Open Source Movement has long required that access to its products, as well as any enhancements produced by using those products, remain freely available to all users. Operating systems, such Linux, feature open architecture. Open Source systems, such as Bind, Perl, Sendmail, and Apache have proven to be far more reliable than many proprietary software applications and operating systems. Microsoft itself recognized, in two internal memos, that the Open Source collective approach has been able to produce \u201chigher-quality code than commercial software\u201d. Rivette and Kline, RITA, Harvard Business School Press (1999) at 190. This is due in large part to the substantial peer review each program has received. Id. at 189.","Although some software companies, such as IBM, Oracle, Netscape, Apple, Novel, Corel, and others, have opened portions of their software to Open Source developers, others have not done so at all and many have retained certain portions of their code as proprietary. Open Source systems could be useful in addressing the problems of transferability of data within an enterprise and\/or to remote users and clients external to the enterprise's network. Its ability is limited, at present. This is primarily due to restraints on access and the lack of generally accepted standards for data formatting.","After the filing of the Provisional Application upon which this application claims priority, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Sears Roebuck and Co., and possibly others, have announced attempts to develop customized case management systems.","Prior to the present invention, none of the systems of which the present inventor is aware facilitated the ready transfer of data between the various distributed applications used in a professional services practice.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the setting of a law practice, is shown in  as 10. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention comprises a method and system for aggregating and\/or transferring data useful in the management of a professional services project or engagement. The present invention preferably provides a substantially portable or application-independent format for data used in a professional services practice.","The method and system of the present invention is illustrated in the setting of a law practice. It is intended, however, that the invention has wider applicability to other forms of professional services, such as medical practices, accounting practices, consulting services, and other professional services practices, as well as other business applications. The following detailed descriptions of various preferred embodiments, and examples of the invention, are illustrative and explanatory only and should not be construed to limit the present invention as disclosed and claimed.","Various programming and database development techniques are well-known in the art. Applicant expressly intends that these, as well as protocols, standards, and techniques yet to be developed, be considered within the scope of the present invention. For example, Michael Blaha discusses various techniques that would be known to persons of ordinary skill in the art at the time of filing the priority document for the present application, in \u201cA MGDT\u201d (Prentice Hall 2001), which is incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety, as if fully set forth herein.","For purposes of the present application, Applicant distinguishes between \u201cproprietary\u201d formats on one hand, and \u201ccommon,\u201d \u201cportable,\u201d or \u201capplication-independent\u201d formats on the other. In principle, databases should be application-independent. In practice, however, databases are built for a specific application. Michael Blaha, \u201cA MGDM\u201d (Prentice Hall 2001) at 3. Professional services practices rely on a variety of proprietary applications. Many are legacy systems in proprietary formats. Consequently, the data used in a typical professional services practice is substantially application-dependent. The data is not readily transferable or portable among applications.","As used in the present application, the terms \u201ccommon,\u201d \u201cportable,\u201d and \u201capplication-independent\u201d are intended to convey a sense of the relative transferability of the data, and not an absolute or particular degree of transferability or application-independence. These terms are not intended to imply that the data is perfectly application-independent or completely fungible between software applications and\/or operating systems, without error, modification, or adaptation. \u201cPortable\u201d formats preferably include standard such as ODBC: protocols and\/or standards, either that are in existence today or that will be developed in the future. Application-independent formats include, without limitation, relational databases; SQL databases; and XML and HTML standards and protocols. Application-independent formats may also include various other web-enabled applications and protocols; SOAP; WAP; Open Source applications; Lotus Enterprise Integration; ZMerge; or other applications that are adapted to permit, facilitate, or enhance the transferability of data between applications.","The term \u201cproprietary,\u201d in conjunction with data formats of the present invention, refers primarily to proprietary software applications, of the types that are typically used in a law or other professional services practice. These may include, by way of example and not limitation, legacy systems and various hierarchical databases. The use of the term \u201cproprietary\u201d includes but is not limited to data that is entirely application-dependant or exclusive to a single application. Nor is it intended to convey an absolute sense of incompatibility or exclusivity. Rather, the term \u201cproprietary\u201d is intended to convey a relative degree of difficulty of transfer of data. For example, the relative degree of difficulty of transferring data from and\/or among the various docketing and\/or accounting applications of the type that were known in the legal market prior to the present invention is considered \u201cproprietary.\u201d Docketing systems (such as CPI, Dennemeyer, Master Data, Pattsy, or IPPO in an intellectual property practice), and accounting systems (such as Broadway, TMC, and\/or Elite), prior to the present invention, had limited ability to transfer data to other applications used in the enterprise, such as word processing systems (such as WordPerfect and Word), document assembly systems, spreadsheets (such as Quarter, Excel, and Lotus 123), project management systems, and other software applications.","Although Microsoft and Corel each represented, prior to the present invention, that documents could be transferred readily between their respective word processing programs (Word and WordPerfect), errors and critical failures occurred frequently. Legacy knowledge bases in a prior version of a software platform are frequently lost upon conversion or upgrade, requiring costly and time-consuming efforts to convert individual documents and\/or data to the newer release format. Although it may be possible to transfer data between these various \u201cproprietary\u201d applications, substantial effort is required to convert or transfer the data. These applications are not specifically designed to render the data readily transferable between them.","The term \u201cproprietary\u201d may be understood in some other settings to convey some claim of exclusive ownership, such as rights accorded by patent, trademark, copyright, or trade secret protection. The term \u201cproprietary\u201d as used in this application, however, is not limited to that sense of exclusive ownership rights but, rather, is used in the sense of the relative degree of application-dependence of the data. Formats that may enable a high degree of transferability and accessibility (such as .pdf, .tif, .jpg, and a wide variety of other data formats and protocols that are known in the art or may later be developed) may be \u201cproprietary\u201d in the sense that they are subject to claims of exclusive rights but should be considered to be \u201cportable\u201d in terms of data transfer and aggregation for purposes of the present invention. Similarly, proprietary applications may use relational or SQL databases, XML or HTML coding, and be considered application-independent in the sense of the present invention. Similarly, some \u201copen source\u201d software operating systems and\/or applications may be public domain information in terms of ownership rights but may lack the requisite degree of data transferability.","Applicant considers application-independent data formats to be a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Nonetheless, the present invention may be implemented with \u201capplication-independent\u201d or \u201cportable\u201d data formats, \u201cproprietary\u201d data formats, or some combination of them. Although the use of application-independent formats, such as relational databases, SQL databases, XML and HTML are within the level of ordinary skill in the art, these techniques have not been applied for purposes of the present invention, particularly in a professional services setting. In view of the lack of consensus standards, the invention is implemented in a Lotus Notes database in a present preferred embodiment. In certain preferred embodiments, a Lotus Notes database (which is ODBC-compliant), and\/or SQL database, queries otherwise \u201cproprietary\u201d databases (such as a \u201cproprietary\u201d docketing, accounting, word processing, time and billing, etc., system). An Appendix is provided of the Forms implemented in connection with one embodiment of the invention in a Lotus Notes database format.","Applicant expressly intends that the invention include various improvements in protocols and\/or standards for data transfer that may occur or be developed after the present invention. The preferred implementation of the present invention incorporates generally accepted protocols that are accepted throughout the market for professional services in which they are used. These to-be-developed protocols or standards may include developments in open source software, data standards, data transfer protocols, and\/or web-enabling technologies, or other technologies. The present invention is expressly intended to cover such improvements and developments that may enhance the transferability, portability, or application-independence of data and\/or the ability to aggregate data between or integrate various distributed, proprietary applications.","The system of a preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises: a digital computer ; one or more databases ; and means for providing data  to a user in substantially application-independent or \u201ccommon\u201d data format . As shown in , , , , and , network  comprises multiple applications . Data  is stored in one or more data storage means  of native applications and, ultimately, supplied to one or more applications . This can be accomplished either through an intermediary database means , a server system , and\/or a combination of a database  and server , that secures the desired data  from the respective databases  and supplies it to database  and then to applications , or directly to applications .","A typical law firm maintains a computer network hosting multiple distributed software applications used in the practice. These applications typically store the data  used by the applications  in proprietary or substantially application-dependent formats. , , , , , and , depict some of the various distributed software applications used in a typical law office environment:\n\n","Some vendors of docketing systems are now offering web-enabled versions of their software. Even these web-enabled versions, however, are limited with respect to the formats in which they can transfer and\/or report pertinent information about a project. Prior known web-enabled docketing systems report only that data maintained in the docketing system and are not adapted to cooperate with other sources of data in the manner of the present invention. Moreover, clients using multiple outside counsels would be required to visit multiple firms' web sites to gather the requisite information about their projects.\n\n","Microsoft Word, in particular, has substantial limitations with respect to data transferability. Although Microsoft has long advertised the transferability of documents between WordPerfect and Word, Microsoft Word generally fails effectively to convert WordPerfect documents in practice. WordXP is not capable of reading many documents that were generated in either WordPerfect or prior versions of Word, requiring a labor-intensive manual process to convert the document to WordXP.\n\n","Document Assembly or \u201cForms\u201d systems, maintained in a firm's word processing or docketing system or as a separate application (such IPDAS), typically use the same address information. With multiple sources of address information, however, it is often unclear which records are up to date and which are not valid. Depending on the network configuration, access to certain sources of the information may be slowed or impaired. Moreover, multiple sources for the same information invites errors in data entry, retrieval, and maintenance.\n\n","It has become common practice to employ the firm's document management system to index work product precedent, in lieu of a separate knowledge management system. This approach, however, is heavily dependent on the quality of abstracting in the firm's document management system because full text searching through the entire document management system is often not practicable. Many of these document and knowledge management databases are maintained in a variety of inconsistent and\/or incompatible formats, necessitating access to multiple software applications.\n\n","Thus, prior to the present invention, the attorney would have to access multiple native applications, employing widely divergent formats, in order to access the data necessary effectively to manage a client's projects.","In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, as shown in , data  is transferred directly from the native applications  in which it is normally stored directly to a Notes database  in substantially application-independent format. Alternatively, as shown in , SQL server  periodically queries native applications  and secures data  from native applications  and transfers it to Notes database  from which it can be read or transferred to applications , or from which it can be transferred directly to the end user applications , in either \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201cproprietary\u201d format, without an intermediate substantially application-independent database or data warehouse.","Data means  comprises data used in the business or professional services practice. Data means  preferably further comprises data in a substantially \u201cportable\u201d or application-independent format. Common data formats may include open formats, any of various ODBC-compliant formats, relational databases, SQL databases, various web-enabled formats (such as ip, tcp\/ip, ftp, http, HTML, XML, and other web-enabled formats), and any other suitable common data format that is adapted to support transfer of the data. In a preferred embodiment, data means  are maintained in a common data format, in which it can be transferred among the various native applications, as shown in . Data means  preferably further comprises methods, processes, or systems, for securing the data, such as key entry, voice recognition, optical scanning and\/or imaging, data transfer, reading data from any medium, or any other suitable techniques.","In a preferred embodiment, data means  comprises: client means, matter means, and event means.

Illustrative Forms for each type of entry are provided in the accompanying Appendix.","Client means preferably comprise data about the client for whom the project is being performed. Client data means typically are maintained in a docketing and\/or accounting system. The client is established as a client of the firm, after conflicts have been cleared with respect to the representation. The data may be key entered into the accounting system and preferably transferred to the docketing system and other software applications in which the data is needed, such as word processing and\/or address books, or vice versa. Prior to the present invention, the data was typically key-entered separately into each application (conflicts, accounting, docketing, word processing, time and billing, etc.) in which it was needed.","In an alternative preferred embodiment of the present invention, Client means further comprises one of more of the following: Bibliographic Information; and Service Provider Information. Bibliographic information preferably comprises one or more of the following: Client Name; Client Number; Primary and Supplemental Contact Name(s) and Address(es); Client's Line of Business; Client's Products\/Services; and\/or any other pertinent information.

Project Means preferably differentiate between multiple projects under the same general matter. Projects may be aggregated under Client Means, Matter Means, or both. Alternatively, Project Means may be omitted ()) and project level information maintained at the Client and\/or Matter level.","For example, Project Means may be identified at the Client level ()), enabling multiple matter numbers to be issued for the same project in the accounting and\/or docketing systems. Alternatively, Projects could be identified at the Matter level (, enabling multiple projects to be identified for the same matter in the firm's accounting and\/or docketing system. Similarly, projects could be identified at both the client and matter levels, if desired. This flexibility enables the user to more precisely track activity or tasks in conjunction with rendering the professional services.","Project Means tracked by the present invention preferably include various data about the project, including without limitation: Type of project; Identifying numbers or codes; Description of the project; Country and Foreign Associates; Addresses; Comments; any Related Documentation; Affiliated Parties; Counsel, Courts, and Administrative Tribunals; Case Numbers; Responsible Person or Person(s) related to the project; Serial Numbers; any pertinent information related to any applications, registrations, or grants; Transfer information; Pertinent Dates; any other suitable information relating to the project.

Some of the tools that may be used in conjunction with the present invention preferably include, without limitation: Tables; Schedules; Spreadsheets; Databases; Graphs; Indicia; Icons; and any other means adapted to provide budget information for a project or matter. Budget Means of the present invention may take any format suitable for use in conjunction with the system for providing useful budgeting information. Budgets could be tracked separately by expenses and fees, as well as at various discrete stages of the project.","In the context of rendering legal services, various types of budgeting software are generally used, including without limitation: TMC; Elite; Broadway, CMS Open; and various others. Some of these software systems include budget modules or budget functionality that may be adapted for use in conjunction with the present invention. These prior systems, however, have been hampered by their inability effectively to deliver budgeting data to the user in a format in which it can readily be used or manipulated, such as Excel spreadsheets. It may be necessary, therefore, to export the data from these financial accounting software packages to other format(s) from which it can be used more effectively in management of the professional services practice. This export can be accomplished by dumping the data to spreadsheets adapted to cooperate with the system of the present invention through VLOOKUP Tables, SQL queries, or any other suitable means.","Data may be exported in particular format(s) so that they can be read by or transferred to the system and method of the present invention. Alternatively, data may be exported directly to the system to the present invention or to an intermediate database. Suitable databases could include: Crystal Reports; Excel; Notes; SQL; Windows-compatible; Cold Fusion; HTML; XML; relational databases; ASCII; ODBC-compatible; or any other format, that is adapted for use in conjunction with the system and\/or method of the present invention.","For example, using a TMC Accounting system, the invention may export: Default budgeting information from the TMC system; Monthly Fees; Monthly Expenses; Accrued Fees (from inception, year to date, or other suitable period or by category), and\/or Accrued Expenses (from inception, year to date, or other suitable period, or by category).","In the context of an intellectual property practice, for example, budgets could be established for any one or more of the following: Preliminary Patentability Assessment; Patent Application Preparation and Prosecution; Trademark Clearance; Trademark Application Preparation and Prosecution; Copyright Application Preparation and Prosecution; Opinion of Counsel; Patent Infringement Litigation; Trademark Infringement Litigation; Copyright Infringement Litigation; Patent Cooperation Treaty filings; Foreign Trademark Application filings; and any other project suitable for determination and tracking of a project budget.","Each of these categories of project types may be further defined based on the complexity of the project. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention budgets are prepared based upon a simple, intermediate, or complex level of effort for patent infringement claims or patent preparation and prosecution. Similarly, varying levels of budgeting could be offered to the user based upon the complexity of a trademark infringement claim, or other projects.","Budget means tracked by the present invention preferably includes variations of the budget and expenditure information about the project, including without limitation: estimated budget(s) for the project; breakdown by stages; fees and expenses; accrued costs; payables information; accounts receivable information; graphical comparisons of projected budget and actual expenditures; and any other information desired about the financial performance of the project.","In alternative preferred embodiments of the present invention budget means further comprises a graphical interface for indicating to the user the budget for the project relative to the accrued fees and expenses to date. This can be accomplished through any suitable graphical interface, such as the silo format, employed in many video games for depicting resources relative to expenditures, or other suitable format.","Project Management Means may be provided to enhance management of the professional services project. Links to tools such as Microsoft Project and\/or Project Gateway databases that provide project management tools may be adapted to cooperate with the aggregated data.","In alternative preferred embodiments, flowcharts may be provided of the steps being performed in conjunction with the project.

Accounting information may be exchanged with docketing and may be used to establish client entries in docketing, after a new client or matter has cleared conflicts and been opened in the firm's accounting system. Time keeping records are entered, and transferred to accounting, from where they are used in the billing process. Similarly address information is frequently needed in word processing applications, docketing, and accounting.

This can be accomplished in any of several ways: standardizing the data means on a common format among the various data storage means and application means; using the same proprietary format among the data means to the degree necessary to achieve transferability of the data means to the data storage means and application means involved; or converting each data means from its native proprietary format in the respective data storage means or application means in which it is native to either a common format or the native format of the recipient data storage means of application means. As shown in , the docketing, accounting, and address data means are coordinated in the management of the project.","In alternative preferred embodiments, data may be adapted to be transferred automatically or on a predetermined schedule. For example, certain events may be considered milestones for the advancement of a project. These milestones may be identified and, when they are reached in the docketing system, a message transferring the appropriate data sent to a project management or other database. As an example, certain docketing events may be designated as milestones. These milestones may be correlated to certain events, and when they are reached, a message is sent to a Notes database identifying that the milestone has been reached and making an appropriate event entry and designating the progress of the project through an indication on a flowchart of the project, with links to any applicable documentation. Docketed entries may be mapped as standard milestone events, which trigger automatic entries and indicators in the event and project management means.","Professional services are inherently personal in nature, posing substantial challenges in ensuring control over the quality of professional services, particularly in a large corporate or law firm setting. By modeling, tracking, and monitoring of the delivery of professional services, the present invention provides a means for enhancing the quality control of professional services.","Various quality control systems have been introduced in a number of business settings. One system of quality control that has received substantial recent press attention is the so-called \u201cSix Sigma\u201d system, pioneered by Motorola. Harry J. Mikel and Richard Schroeder, SS: The Breakthrough Management Strategy Revolutionizing the Worlds' Corporations (1ed. 2000), which is incorporated herein by reference, as if fully set forth herein. Six Sigma systems have been successfully implemented by Motorola, Allied Signal, General Electric, and others, often with substantial positive results.","Although Six Sigma systems have enjoyed substantial success in manufacturing operations, quality control over service functions and professional services (such as legal) in particular have been more problematic. Some companies, such as DuPont, have implemented Six Sigma quality control systems in their legal department. Few if any technical tools are available to law departments to implement the rigorous measurement protocols necessary for effective quality control. Certain embodiments of the present invention may provide the necessary tools for assessing, monitoring, and measuring performance relative to these types of quality control procedures.","Any quality control program, whether a Six Sigma or other program, requires detailed modeling, monitoring, and measurement of performance. Specifically, a Six Sigma program seeks to identify the number of \u201cdefects\u201d per requirement for a functional area. The requirement is sampled continuously (or continually) and the number of defects is measured. One \u201csigma,\u201d (standard deviation) is about 317,400 defects per million; four sigma about 6,200 defects per million; and six sigma, about 3.4 defects per million). The actual sigma value that is desired depends on a number of factors and the cost-effectiveness achieving that degree of reduction in defects relative to the cost of the defects.","The client's expectations or requirements for a particular professional service can be determined and delivery of the service monitored to determine the number of times the service is actually delivered within that parameter or outside of it (a failure). The service can then be modeled and the root causes of the failure are then assessed to determine ways in which the process of delivery of the service can be reengineered and improved in a cost effective manner. Id.","These steps require not only definition of the workflow but monitoring and measurement of the delivery of the service, functions can be readily accomplished in conjunction with the present invention. In order to identify process improvements, the process itself must be defined and documented. These are accomplished in the project management functions of the present invention.","For example, in the context of a patent application, the process workflow may be defined and documented in conjunction with providing the user an indication of the stage of the process that has been attained.  depicts an example of a sample flowchart for the process of securing a U.S. patent; , a process for securing U.S. trademark registration; and  a process of a typical intellectual property infringement litigation matter. Requirements may be established for any stage(s) of the process that are significant to the client. As a further example, the service provider could define specific time period for reporting events, submitting drafts for review, returning edited drafts, etc. Similarly, requirements could be based on further substantive parameters of the work product, such as compliance with certain guidelines or more subjective criteria relating to the content of the work product. These requirements may then be stored in one or more of the applications or in a project management application, such as that described above.","In the example of implementing the present invention through a separate project management application, the project management application software could then compare the actual event timing that is reported to the project management application or entered directly in the project management application with the requirement that has been determined and stored in the project management application (for example sending to the client Official Communications received in conjunction with the matter within 2 business days of receipt, returning calls within 24 hours, etc.). Thus, the level of \u201cdefects,\u201d and the efficacy of any process changes that are made to reduce the number of defects, can be monitored easily and with minimal or no manual intervention.","It will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art that variations and modification may be made to the present invention.
