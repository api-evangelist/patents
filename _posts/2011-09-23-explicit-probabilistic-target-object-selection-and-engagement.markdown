title: Explicit probabilistic target object selection and engagement
abstract: An object of interest in a cloud of objects is identified by RF and IR sensing. The RF and IR signals are separately discriminated to determine the probability that the RF tracked object is one of a predetermined number of possible object types, and the IR tracked object is one of the possible object types. Joint probabilities are calculated for all pairs of RF and IR signals and all objects, and the joint probabilities are normalized. Marginal probabilities of the joint RF/IR discrimination results are calculated to produce a vector set of marginal optical probabilities. The vector set is normalized over all object types to thereby produce a vector set of normalized marginal optical probabilities. The object of interest is selected to be the IR object of said vector set of normalized joint optical probabilities with the highest probability of being the object type of interest.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. HQ0276-10-C-0001 awarded by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). The Government has certain rights in this invention.","Hostile intercontinental missiles can be expected to deploy decoy objects to conceal the warhead(s). The effectiveness of hit-to-kill based weapon systems against a target object of interest surrounded by decoy and other objects depends upon discriminating the object of interest from decoys and other objects of a \u201ccloud.\u201d Discriminating this object of interest may involve the use of radar as a radio frequency (RF) sensor and the use of an interceptor missile fitted with a sensor such as an infrared (IR) tracker or sensor. The information from either the RF or the IR sensor is used to discriminate among the objects. Fusing discrimination information from both the RF and IR sensors increases the probability of discriminating and selecting the object of interest and thus improves the likelihood of successful engagement to negate the threat.","The challenges in this approach are to correlate the objects of the cloud as sensed by the separate sensors, and properly account for the resulting probability of correlation in the fused discrimination results. For example, if the probability of correlation is zero (i.e. objects from the RF sensor cannot be to corresponding objects from the IR sensor), the RF discrimination results cannot be trusted and the fused discrimination solution should only depend upon or use the IR discrimination results. Alternately, if the probability of correlation is non-zero, the fused discrimination results should be a blend of both the RF and IR discrimination results.","Many discrimination fusion systems are in use today, but they are primarily heuristic in nature and are based on a set of rules that govern how the discrimination results are fused given the number of objects in common between the sensors and the degree of confidence in the discrimination solutions from each sensor. The current correlation methodology for the Standard Missile-3 is based on such a rule set.","Improved or alternative real-time object selection systems based on multi-sensor discrimination and correlation are desired.","Thus, a method according to an aspect of the disclosure for selecting an object of interest in a cloud of objects of lesser interest comprises the steps of sensing objects of the cloud with an electromagnetic or radio-frequency (RF) sensor at a location, to thereby generate sensed RF signals for at least some of the objects of the cloud, and discriminating the sensed RF signals by computing the probability that each RE tracked object is one of a predetermined number of possible object types, to thereby form an RF confusion matrix. Objects of the cloud are sensed with an optical (IR) sensor at a location different from the location of the RF sensor, to thereby generate sensed optical signals for at least some of the objects of the cloud. The sensed optical signals are discriminated by computing the probability that each optical tracked object is one of a predetermined number of possible object types to thereby form an optical confusion matrix. RF tracked object data and optical tracked object data are correlated to provide a RF\/IR correlation matrix data set indicative of the confidence or probability that the iRE tracked object is correlated or matched with the jIR tracked object. In exemplary embodiments, correlation may be performed using a common RF and IR metric, such as position or velocity, for each tracked object of each sensor, and may be based on computing the maximum likelihood or Mahalanobis distance of every combination of tracked RF and IR objects. Joint probabilities are calculated for all pairs of RE and optical signals and over all objects according to the RF and IR probability matrix data sets and the RF\/IR correlation matrix data set. The joint probabilities are normalized over all object types to produce a matrix set of normalized joint probabilities. Marginal probabilities of the joint RF\/IR discrimination results are calculated to produce a vector set of marginal optical probabilities. The vector set of marginal probabilities is normalized over all object types to thereby produce a vector set of normalized marginal optical probabilities. The object of interest is selected to be the IR object of the vector set of normalized marginal optical probabilities with the highest probability of being the object type of interest. In one mode of the method, the selected object is provided to an interceptor missile for aiding in guiding an interceptor missile toward the object of interest.","A system according to another aspect of the disclosure is for identifying an object of interest in a cloud of remote objects of different types, where the number of object types is limited. The system comprises an electromagnetic sensor observing the cloud, for generating electromagnetic or RF signals representing the objects of the cloud, and an electromagnetic discriminator coupled to the electromagnetic sensor for computing the probability of each RF tracked object being one of the possible object types. An optical sensor observes at least portions of the cloud, for generating optical signals representing at least some objects of the cloud, and an optical discriminator computes the probability of each IR tracked object being one of the possible object types. An electromagnetic-optical correlator is coupled to the electromagnetic discriminator and to the optical sensor, for determining the probability that the ielectromagnetic object is correlated or matched with the joptical object. A processor is coupled to the electromagnetic discriminator, to the optical discriminator, and to the electromagnetic-optical correlator, for (a) generating an electromagnetic\/optical correlation matrix, (b) calculating joint probabilities for all pairs of electromagnetic and optical signals and all types of objects, (c) normalizing the joint probabilities over all object types to produce a matrix set of normalized joint probabilities, (d) calculating marginal probabilities for each optical object, (e) normalizing the marginal probabilities for each optical object and over all object types, and (f) selecting as the object of interest the optical object with the highest normalized probability.","In a further aspect, a method comprises the steps of: receiving RF probability data indicative of a probability that an object being tracked by an RF sensor is one of a predetermined number (X) of possible object types; receiving IR probability data indicative of a probability that an object being tracked by an optical sensor is one of the predetermined number (X) of possible object types; receiving RF and IR correlation data indicative of correlations between pairs of objects consisting of one of the RF objects being tracked and one of the IR objects being tracked, corresponding to a probability that the iRF object being tracked is matched with the jIR object being tracked; determining via a computer processor, based on the received RF probability data, the IR probability data, and the RF and IR correlation data, data indicative of joint probabilities for all pairs of the RF objects being tracked and the IR objects being tracked; normalizing the joint probability data over all object types to produce data sets of normalized joint probabilities; determining marginal probabilities based on the normalized joint probabilities data sets to produce a data set of marginal optical probabilities representative of the probability that a given IR object is of a given object type, independent of which RF object the given IR object corresponds to; normalizing the data set of marginal optical probabilities over all object types to thereby produce a data set of normalized marginal optical probabilities; and determining the IR object of the data set of normalized marginal optical probabilities having the highest probability for the object type of interest to be the guide-to object. Further, the method comprises providing information of the determined guide-to object to an interceptor missile for aiding in guiding the interceptor missile toward the guide-to object.","According to an aspect of the disclosure, an explicit, probabilistic, real-time target object selection system is based on multi-sensor discrimination and correlation. This multi-sensor discrimination and correlation system improves the probability of discriminating and negating or successfully engaging the object of interest in situations in which the RF and the IR sensors do not have a common picture (i.e. where mismatch of objects and correlation of objects between sensors are not known to a high confidence).","The selection system or method is called \u201cEXplicit Probabilistic Object Selection and Engagement System\u201d (EXPOSES). It is explicit in the sense that no heuristic algorithm is used, and in that the probabilities are combined using explicit probability rule sets. The system of the disclosure is described in the context of a missile weapon system. However, it should be noted that the method could be used in any application where multiple probabilities from varying sensors or sources need to be combined in an \u201coptimal\u201d sense, factoring in the confidence levels of each source or sensor.","In , a scenario  includes a radio-frequency sensor  such as a radar system, which tracks a cloud  of objects , , , and by means of one or more radio-frequency (RE) radar beams, illustrated by a \u201clightning bolt\u201d symbol . Sensor  may be on the Earth's surface (land or sea) rather than airborne. The cloud  may originate from a hostile missile, one portion of which, after deployment, may be manifested as object . The radar sensor system  produces RF track data, which is made available to an object selection and discrimination system designated generally as  and which includes an RF discrimination system designated generally as  and an RF\/IR correlation system designated generally as . Object of cloud  of  is illustrated as a conical object, suggesting that it is the reentry device against which action is to be taken; details of the cloud or set  are illustrated in . Also in , an anti-missile missile or interceptor missile  is illustrated as being guided along a guidance track  by guidance commands transmitted over a path  from a guidance\/navigation module illustrated as a block . Interceptor missile  is fitted with an optical or infrared sensor , which generates infrared tracking data relating to those objects of cloud  within its field of view. The infrared tracking data is applied by way of a path  to an IR discriminator illustrated as a block  and to RF\/IR correlation block  of object sensing and discrimination system . RF\/IR correlation block  also receives RF track data from RF sensor  by way of a path . Object selection and discrimination system  of  also includes an RF discrimination function illustrated as a block , which receives RF track data by way of path . A probabilistic object selection function illustrated as block  receives discriminated infrared information from block  by way of a path , discriminated RF information from block  by way of a path , and RF\/IR correlation information from block  by way of a path . Details of probabilistic object selection function block  are illustrated in . The threat objects of set  deployed from the hostile missile are tracked by both RF sensor  and IR sensor . The EXPOSES method fuses RF and IR tracked object discrimination probabilities to select the object of interest and to identify the guide-to object (in this case, the guide-to object is conical element ). Finally, the interceptor missile is guided toward the object of interest. The interceptor missile is guided toward the selected object for the purpose of hitting and killing it using the kinetic energy of the collision, or at least bringing the interceptor missile within a range in which an explosive charge can be effectively used.","As shown in , the deployed threat and decoy objects of set  are tracked by both RF and IR sensors. The same object may not be tracked by each sensor, and also the number of objects may not be equal in the Field of View (FOV) of each tracking sensor. The lack of exact correspondence between the number of objects tracked by the RF and optical sensors may be attributable, in part, to the time required for the RF sensor to scan over its field-of-view, including the cloud, and to the limited and continually-changing field of view of the optical sensor. The discrimination function and algorithm represented by selection and engagement system  computes the tracked object discrimination probability using tracking data from the various sensors. The EXPOSES system uses the outputs of the IR and RF discrimination algorithms of blocks  and  to identify the object types of the RF and IR tracked objects. The RF and IR discrimination processing is described below. It should be noted that the various processing blocks, namely blocks , , , , and  of  may be located at the site of RF sensor , at the interceptor missile , or at some other location, the only requirement being that the communication delays be sufficiently short to allow proper operation. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the invention may be practiced with various computer system configurations, including multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable electronic devices, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers and the like. The invention may be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network as discussed herein. In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in local and remote memory storage devices. Suitable computer program code may be provided for performing the functions described herein such as RF discrimination, IR discrimination, RF\/IR correlation, probabilistic object selection and engagement, guidance and navigation, and other calculations illustrative of the type of functions which may be performed by computer program code embodiments of the present invention. By way of non-limiting example only, interceptor missile  may include the functionality associated with processing blocks  (IR discrimination),  (RF\/IR correlation),  (explicit probabilistic object selection) and  (guidance\/navigation) with communication paths , , , and  being typical electrical (including optical) communications media for communicating information within interceptor missile . RF data from the RF sensor  (including RF probability data from RF discriminator ) located remotely from interceptor missile  may be communicated to interceptor missile  via one or more radio links (e.g. paths , ). In another embodiment, the RF sensor , IR sensor and corresponding processing blocks , , , ,  are located at interceptor missile  with corresponding electrical and\/or optical communications pathways for establishing communications within interceptor missile , as is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.","In the arrangement of , the initial RF discrimination is performed by block  using RF measurements from RF sensor . The RF discrimination algorithm computes the probability of each RF tracked object being one of X possible object types, where the X object types are denoted by O, . . . , Ox. This process is well known in the art of object discrimination. A corresponding computer processor (e.g. CPU) and associated data storage device (e.g. memory) may be used for implementation of RF discriminator . The data storage device may store, for example, (i) a program (e.g., computer program code and\/or a computer program product) adapted to or configured to direct the processor in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, and (ii) a database adapted to store information that may be utilized to store information required by the program.

Number of object types X is limited to be 6 without loss of generality of the discussion. The RF discrimination probabilities represent the probability that any RF object of cloud  is one of the 6 object types (O, O, O, O, O, and O). Note that for any object, the sum of probabilities over all object types must be equal to one. In one embodiment, the RF discrimination confusion matrix information from the RF discriminator  is passed to the missile in flight via a radio link, path . Note that the RF discriminator  could be either ground or air based.","As mentioned, the scenario of  depicts a missile weapon system in which the IR sensor on board the interceptor missile independently provides IR tracking data through path  to the IR discrimination system . IR discrimination system  performs IR discrimination based on the IR measurements. The IR discrimination algorithm computes the probability of each IR tracked object being one of the same X possible object types.

However, in general, at least one object from the primary objects of interest (i.e. O, O, O, etc.) should be sensed in common between the RF and IR sensors, and this commonality is exploited by the EXPOSES processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["34","18","34","34","36","35","34","34","30"],"sup":["th ","th "]},"The EXPOSES algorithm of block  of  combines the RF and IR tracked object discrimination probabilities using explicit probability rule sets.

In , matrix  represents the RF confusion or probability matrix, and matrix  represents the IR confusion or probability matrix. Matrix  of  represents the RF\/IR correlation matrix.","The EXPOSES process of logic block  of  begins by calculating joint probabilities for each possible pair of an RF object and an IR object, taking their correlation into account. For M number of RF objects and N number of IR objects, this results in matrix set  of , which is an N\u00d7N matrix of joint probabilities for each object type. The joint probabilities are calculated using the equation\n\n()=()[1(1())]\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere:\n","i is the RF object;","j is the IR object;","k is the object type; and","cis the correlation between RF object i and IR object j, or the probability that they are the same object. Equation 1 is used to calculate the joint probability instead of a simple product of P, P, and because of the desired effect of the correlation term. When there is a perfect correlation of one between the RF and IR objects, equation 1 simplifies to\n\n()=()()\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nwhich is the same as the fused probability that would result from a simple product. When there is perfect correlation certainty that RF object i is the same object as IR object j, the joint probability of matrix set  results in the product of their posterior probabilities. When there is zero correlation between a pair of objects, the simple product results in a fused probability of zero, even if the IR discrimination algorithm has assigned a high probability to the IR object. The EXPOSES joint probability, on the other hand, reduces to\n\n()=()\u2003\u2003(3)\n\nwhen there is zero correlation between the pair of objects. In other words, when there is zero correlation between the objects, the RF probabilities do not contribute any information to the missile's decision on which object to engage. Therefore, the interceptor missile should rely on its own discrimination algorithm to assign a probability to that IR object. This may be important in situations in which there is poor correlation between all pairs of objects, which can happen if there are large measurement errors or sensor biases. In these situations, the missile should rely on its own IR discrimination rather than making all the fused probabilities very small due to poor correlation.\n","The next or second step  in the EXPOSES process of logic flow chart  is to normalize the joint probabilities for each pair of objects over all possible object types.

IR object # is not detected by the RF sensor.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 5"],"b":["1","3","2","4","5","3","4","4","1","1","1","2","3","3","4","4","1","4","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["1","1","2","3","2","3","4","5","4","1","2","3","1","1","2","3","3","4","4","1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["2","3","1","1","2","3","4","2","3","4","1"]},"Thus, with reference to  in conjunction with  and , a method according to an aspect of the disclosure for selecting an object of interest in a cloud or set () of objects of lesser interest comprises the steps of sensing objects of the cloud with an electromagnetic or radio-frequency (RF) sensor () () at a location, to thereby generate sensed RF signals for at least some of the objects of the cloud, and discriminating () () the sensed RF signals by computing the probability that each RF tracked object is one of a predetermined number (X) of possible object types, to thereby form an RF confusion matrix () (). Objects of the cloud are sensed with an optical (IR) sensor () at a location different from the location of the RF sensor (), to thereby generate sensed optical (IR) signals for at least some of the objects of the cloud. The sensed optical signals are discriminated () by computing the probability that each optical tracked object is one of a predetermined number (X) of possible object types to thereby form an optical confusion matrix (). RF tracked object data and optical tracked object data are correlated to provide a RF\/IR correlation matrix data set indicative of the confidence or probability that the iRF tracked object is correlated or matched with the jIR tracked object. Joint probabilities are calculated () for all pairs of RF and optical signals and over all objects () according to the RF and IR probability matrix data sets and the RF\/IR correlation matrix data set. The joint probabilities are normalized over all object types () to produce a matrix set of normalized joint probabilities (). Marginal probabilities of the joint RF\/IR discrimination results () are calculated to produce a vector set of marginal optical probabilities (). The vector set of marginal probabilities is normalized over all object types () to thereby produce a vector set of normalized marginal optical probabilities (). The object of interest is selected to be the IR object of the vector set of normalized marginal optical probabilities with the highest probability of being the object type of interest.

The system comprises an electromagnetic sensor () observing the cloud, that generates electromagnetic or RF signals representing the objects of the cloud, and an electromagnetic discriminator () coupled to the electromagnetic sensor () that computes the probability of each RF tracked object being one of the X possible object types. An optical sensor () observes at least portions of the cloud, and generates optical signals representing at least some objects of the cloud, and an optical discriminator () computes the probability of each IR tracked object being one of the X possible object types. An electromagnetic\/optical correlator () is coupled to the electromagnetic discriminator () and to the optical sensor (), and configured to determine the probability that the ielectromagnetic object is correlated or matched with the ioptical object.
