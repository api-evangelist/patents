title: Player biofeedback for dynamically controlling a video game state
abstract: Various embodiments are directed towards employing one or more physical sensors arranged on or in proximity to a video game player to obtain biofeedback measures that are then useable to dynamically modify a state of play of a video game. The sensors may be connected or even un-connected to the game player, replace, or otherwise augment traditional physical game controllers. The sensors gather various biofeedback measures and provide such measures to a biofeedback application programming interface (API). Before and/or during video game play, the video game queries the biofeedback API to request inferences about the game player's state of arousal. The response to the query is then used to modify the state of the video game play. Where the video game is a multi-player video game, biofeedback measures from other game players may also be obtained and used to further modify the state of the video game play.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to interactive video games and more particularly, but not exclusively, to using biofeedback from a game player to modify a video game state.","Today, the computer gaming industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. Such popularity may be due in part to faster computing devices, higher quality graphics, and better quality games. Many of today's video games provide a variety of different input\/output devices useable by a game player to interact with the game. For example, many video games allow a player to interact using a keyboard and\/or mouse. While such input\/output controllers allow the game player to interact with the game, the game player might not \u2018feel\u2019 that they are immersed into the game. Therefore, many video games have been redesigned to allow use of gamepads, joysticks, trackballs, game paddles, and the like to provide ways of immersing the video game player. Some joysticks and\/or paddles are configured to resemble a type of device consistent with the video game being played. For example, for some flight simulation games, a joystick might be designed to provide throttle quadrants, levels, wheels, and handheld sticks that appear to the game player as though they are flying within a cockpit of an aircraft.","By modifying the input devices, video game players are more likely to become involved with and therefore, enjoy the video game more so. As such, the video game player is more likely to continue to play the game, share the game with others, and perhaps to purchase similar games in the future. This trend of modifying the input devices to have more game player involvement is even more apparent with the advent of wireless controllers. For example, in one popular video game, the game input controller is a wireless handheld controller that may include built-in accelerometers, infrared detectors, or similar components. Such components are used to sense a position of the controller in three-dimensional space when pointed at a light emitting diode (LED) within a remote sensor bar. The game player then controls the game using physical gestures as well as traditional buttons, to play games such as bowling, imaginary musical instruments, boxing games, or the like.","However, while many game players may feel this provides an increased level of involvement in the video game, other game players may still feel that the involvement in the video game is incomplete. Thus, it is with respect to these considerations, and others, that the present invention has been made.","The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and which show, by way of illustration, specific exemplary embodiments by which the invention may be practiced. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Among other things, the present invention may be embodied as methods or devices. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.","Throughout the specification and claims, the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d as used herein does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, though it may. Furthermore, the phrase \u201cin another embodiment\u201d as used herein does not necessarily refer to a different embodiment, although it may. Thus, as described below, various embodiments of the invention may be readily combined, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention.","In addition, as used herein, the term \u201cor\u201d is an inclusive \u201cor\u201d operator, and is equivalent to the term \u201cand\/or,\u201d unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term \u201cbased on\u201d is not exclusive and allows for being based on additional factors not described, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In addition, throughout the specification, the meaning of \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural references. The meaning of \u201cin\u201d includes \u201cin\u201d and \u201con.\u201d","As used herein, the terms \u201cbiofeedback,\u201d and \u201cphysiological\u201d refer to measures of a game player's specific and quantifiable bodily functions. Such biofeedback measures are typically also referred to as measurements of unconscious or involuntary bodily functions. Such biofeedback measures may include, but are not limited to blood pressure, heart rates, eye movements, pupil dilations, skin temperatures, sweat gland activity, muscle tensions, and similar bodily functions. As described further herein, such measures are useable to make inferences about the game player's state of arousal or emotional state. It is noted that a state of arousal includes not only an emotional state, but a physiological state as well. Moreover, as used herein, a state of arousal further includes determination of engagement, valence, and\/or other user states based on physiological measurements.","The following briefly describes the embodiments of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This brief description is not intended as an extensive overview. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements, or to delineate or otherwise narrow the scope. Its purpose is merely to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.","Briefly stated, various embodiments are directed towards employing one or more physical sensors arranged on or in proximity to a video game player to obtain biofeedback measures about the game player that is useable to dynamically modify a state of play of the video game. In one embodiment, the modifications may be performed substantially in real-time. In another embodiment, the modifications may be performed for use in a subsequent game play. The physical sensors may be connected to the game player, replace, and\/or otherwise augment traditional physical game controllers. In another embodiment, the physical sensors need not be connected to the game player and may instead be located in proximity to the game player. Non-limiting examples of such physically un-connected sensors include a video camera, weight\/position sensor pads upon which the game player might stand upon, or the like. The sensors are arranged to gather various biofeedback measures such as heart activity, galvanic skin responses, body temperatures, eye movements, head or other body movements, or the like, and to provide such measures to a biofeedback application programming interface (API). Before and\/or during a video game play, the video game may query the biofeedback API for an inference about the game player's state of arousal, emotional state, or the like, as described further below based on the biofeedback measures. Then, based on the response to the query, the video game modifies a state of video game play. In this manner, the video game may determine whether the game player's current physiological state is consistent with a type and\/or level of experience the video game may seek to provide. For example, if the game player's stress or arousal state is determined to be above a given threshold, the video game may modify the state of the game play to provide the game player an opportunity to relax and\/or recover. In another embodiment, where the game player's stress or arousal state is determined to be below another threshold, the video game may modify the state of the game play to provide an increased level of excitement for the game player.","In one embodiment, the threshold may be based on historical biofeedback measures and\/or inferences about the particular game player. In another embodiment, the threshold may be based on analysis of the particular game player for the current video game play. In still another embodiment, the threshold may be based on statistical analysis of a plurality of game players.","In one embodiment, where the video game is configured as a multi-player video game, biofeedback measures from other game players may also be obtained and used to further modify a state of the video game play.","Illustrative Operating Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","105","110","101","110","120"]},"One embodiment of a client device usable as client device  is described in more detail below in conjunction with . Briefly, however, client device  may include virtually any mobile computing device capable of receiving and sending a message over a network, such as network , or the like. Such devices include portable devices such as, radio frequency (RF) devices, infrared (IR) devices, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), game consoles, handheld computers, laptop computers, wearable computers, tablet computers, integrated devices combining one or more of the preceding devices, or the like. Client device  may also include virtually any computing device that typically connects using a wired communications medium, such as network , such as personal computers, multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, or the like. Thus, in one embodiment, client device  may be configured to operate over a wired and\/or a wireless network.","Client device  typically range widely in terms of capabilities and features. For example, a handheld device may have a numeric keypad and a few lines of monochrome LCD display on which only text may be displayed. In another example, a web-enabled client device may have a touch sensitive screen, a stylus, and several lines of color LCD display in which both text and graphics may be displayed.","A web-enabled client device may include a browser application that is configured to receive and to send web pages, web-based messages, or the like. The browser application may be configured to receive and display graphics, text, multimedia, or the like, employing virtually any web based language, including a wireless application protocol messages (WAP), or the like. In one embodiment, the browser application is enabled to employ Handheld Device Markup Language (HDML), Wireless Markup Language (WML), WMLScript, JavaScript, Standard Generalized Markup Language (SMGL), HyperText Markup Language (HTML), eXtensible Markup Language (XML), or the like, to display and send information.","Client device  also may include at least one application that is configured to receive content from another computing device. The application may include a capability to provide and receive textual content, multimedia information, components to a computer application, such as a video game, or the like. The application may further provide information that identifies itself, including a type, capability, name, or the like. In one embodiment, client device  may uniquely identify themselves through any of a variety of mechanisms, including a phone number, Mobile Identification Number (MIN), an electronic serial number (ESN), mobile device identifier, network address, or other identifier. The identifier may be provided in a message, or the like, sent to another computing device.","Client device  may also be configured to communicate a message, such as through email, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), instant messaging (IM), internet relay chat (IRC), Mardam-Bey's IRC (mIRC), Jabber, or the like, between another computing device. However, the present invention is not limited to these message protocols, and virtually any other message protocol may be employed. Thus, in one embodiment, client device  may enable users to participate in one or more messaging sessions, such as a chat session, a gaming session with messaging, or the like. Such messaging sessions may be text oriented, in that the communications are achieved using text. However, other messaging sessions may occur using client device  that employ other mechanisms to communicate, include, but not limited to audio, graphics, video, and\/or a combination of text, audio, graphics, and\/or video.","Client device  may be configured to receive messages, images, and\/or other biofeedback measures, from various biofeedback sensors . Illustrated in  are non-limiting, non-exhaustive examples of possible physical biofeedback sensors  that may be connected or unconnected to the user, replace, and\/or otherwise augment traditional physical game controllers. Thus, as illustrated biofeedback sensors  may be integrated within a game controller (sensor ), one or more keys, wheels, or the like, on a keyboard (sensor ). In one embodiment, the game controller may include modular and\/or pluggable components that may include modular and\/or pluggable sensors ().","Similarly, biofeedback sensors  may include a camera , a touch pad , or even a head device . However, as noted, other biofeedback sensors  may also be employed, including, eyeglasses, wrist bands, finger sensor attachments, sensors integrated within or on a computer mice, microphones for measuring various voice patterns, or the like. Thus, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that various embodiments may employ virtually any mechanism configurable to obtain biofeedback measures of the game player.","The biofeedback sensors  may be arranged to gather various measures of a game player before, after, and\/or during a video game play. Such measures include, but are not limited to heart rate and\/or heart rate variability; galvanic skin responses; body temperature; eye movement; head, face, hand, or other body movement, gestures, positions, facial expressions, postures, or the like. Additionally, biofeedback sensors  may collect other measures, including, blood oxygen levels, other forms of skin conductance levels, respiration rate, skin tension, voice stress levels, voice recognition, blood pressure, Electroencephalography (EEG) measures, Electromyography (EMG) measures, response times, or the like.","Biofeedback sensors  may provide the measures to client device . In one embodiment, the measures may be provided to client device  over any of a variety of wired and\/or wireless connections. Thus, biofeedback measures may be communicated over various cables, wires, or the like, with which other information may also be communicated for a game play. For example, biofeedback measures might be transmitted over a USB cable, coaxial cable, or the like, with which a mouse, keyboard, game controller, or the like, is also coupled to client device . However, in another embodiment, a distinct wired connection may be employed. Similarly, biofeedback sensors  may employ various wireless connections to communicate biofeedback measures. In addition, any of a variety of communication protocols may be used to communicate the measures. Thus, the invention is not to be construed as being limited to a particular wired or wireless communication mechanism and\/or communication protocol.","In one embodiment, client device  may include a biofeedback device interface (BFI) that is configured to determine whether one or more physical sensors  are operational, and to manage receipt of biofeedback measures from physical sensors . One embodiment of a BFI is described in more detail below in conjunction with . Briefly, however, the BFI may further timestamp the received biofeedback measures, buffer at least some of the measures, and\/or forward the measures to GSD  for use in modifying a state of a video game play. Buffering of the received biofeedback measures may enable the BFI to perform quality analysis upon the received measures, and to provide alert messages based on a result of the analysis.","Wireless network  is configured to couple client device  with network . Wireless network  may include any of a variety of wireless sub-networks that may further overlay stand-alone ad-hoc networks, or the like, to provide an infrastructure-oriented connection for client device . Such sub-networks may include mesh networks, Wireless LAN (WLAN) networks, cellular networks, or the like.","Wireless network  may further include an autonomous system of terminals, gateways, routers, or the like connected by wireless radio links, or the like. These connectors may be configured to move freely and randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily, such that the topology of wireless network  may change rapidly.","Wireless network  may further employ a plurality of access technologies including 2nd (2G), 3rd (3G), 4th (4G) generation radio access for cellular systems, WLAN, Wireless Router (WR) mesh, or the like. Access technologies such as 2G, 2.5G, 3G, 4G, and future access networks may enable wide area coverage for client devices, such as client device  with various degrees of mobility. For example, wireless network  may enable a radio connection through a radio network access such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM), General Packet Radio Services (GPRS), Enhanced Data GSM Enviromnent (EDGE), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA), Bluetooth, or the like. In essence, wireless network  may include virtually any wireless communication mechanism by which information may travel between client device  and another computing device, network, or the like.","Network  is configured to couple computing devices, such as GSD  to other computing devices, including potentially through wireless network  to client device . However, as illustrated, client device  may also be connected through network  to GSD . In any event, network  is enabled to employ any form of computer readable media for communicating information from one electronic device to another. Also, network  can include the Internet in addition to local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), direct connections, such as through a universal serial bus (USB) port, other forms of computer-readable media, or any combination thereof. On an interconnected set of LANs, including those based on differing architectures and protocols, a router acts as a link between LANs, enabling messages to be sent from one to another. Also, communication links within LANs typically include twisted wire pair or coaxial cable, while communication links between networks may utilize analog telephone lines, full or fractional dedicated digital lines including T, T, T, and T, Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDNs), Digital Subscriber Lines (DSLs), wireless links including satellite links, or other communications links known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, remote computers and other related electronic devices could be remotely connected to either LANs or WANs via a modem and temporary telephone link. In essence, network  includes any communication method by which information may travel between computing devices.","One embodiment of GSD  is described in more detail below in conjunction with . Briefly, however, GSD  may include any computing device capable of connecting to network  to enable a user to participate in one or more online games, including, but not limited multi-player games, as well as single player games. Thus, while  illustrates a single client device  with biofeedback sensors , the invention is not so limited, and a plurality of similar client devices with biofeedback sensors may be deployed within system .","Therefore, GSD  is configured to receive various biofeedback measures from one or more game players and to employ the received measures to modify a state of the video game. GSD  may employ the biofeedback to dynamically adjust a game play difficulty, and\/or other aspects of a video game based on the biofeedback measures. For example, in one embodiment, if it is determined that a user is experiencing a level of stress defined as excessive, based on a threshold, the video game within GSD  might provide a different game play to enable reduction in the determined stress level.","GSD  may also enable the video game to provide a unique experience each time it is played based on the biofeedback measures of the game player. For example, in one embodiment, a color of an object, size, shape, and\/or action of a game character, or the like, may be adjusted based on biofeedback measures. That is various aspects of a background displayed within the background of the game may be modified based on the results of an analysis of the biofeedback measures.","In one embodiment, historical measurements may be stored, and analyzed to enable GSD  to detect a particular game player. Such stored measurements may then be used to personalize the game play for the particular game player, identify changes in a game play by the particular game player based on a determined trend determination, or the like. In one embodiment, historical measurements together with analysis of the biofeedback measures may be used to determine whether the game player is currently associated with a prior user profile\u2014that is, is this game player someone that has played before? GSD  may also adjust a type of game play offered based a determination of the game player's level of engagement during a game play, historical patterns, or the like.","GSD  may further provide matchmaking decisions based in whole or in part on a physiological or emotional state of a game player that may seek a multiplayer game session. In still other embodiments, GSD  may dynamically adjust game play instructions, tutorials, or the like, based on the received biofeedback measures. For example, where it might be determined that the game player is determined to be bored or otherwise uninterested in the instructions, tutorials, or the like, GSD  might enable the material to be sped up, skipped or the like.","GSD  is not limited to these examples of how biofeedback measures may be used however, and others ways of employing the biofeedback measures to modify a game play state may also be used. For example, the biofeedback measures may be employed to directly control an aspect of the game play. One non-limiting example of such is described in more detail below in conjunction with .","In still other embodiments, GSD  may depict the game player's emotional, physiological state and\/or other aspects of the game player's expression within a game character. For example, a game player's avatar might be modified to display a heart that beats at the rate of the game player's heart, or the avatar might be shown to breathe at the game player's rate, or sweat, or even show a facial expression, or body position based on the received biofeedback measures for the game player. Thus, GSD  may employ biofeedback measures in any of a variety of ways to modify a state of a game play.","Devices that may operate as GSD  include personal computers, desktop computers, multiprocessor systems, video game consoles, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, server devices, and the like.","Moreover, although GSD  is illustrated as a single network device the invention is not so limited. For example, one or more of the functions associated with GSD  may be implemented in a plurality of different network devices, distributed across a peer-to-peer system structure, or the like, without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. Thus, as described below in conjunction with , is a network device  configured to manage a game play using biofeedback measures to modify a state of the game. However, other configurations are also envisaged.","For example, in another embodiment, the client device  may be configured to include components from GSD  such that client device  may operate independent of GSD . That is, in one embodiment, client device  may include game software with biofeedback, biofeedback Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and the like, and operate without use of a network connection to GSD . Client device  may therefore, operate as essentially a standalone game device with interfaces to the biofeedback sensors, and other input\/output devices for user enjoyment. Therefore, the invention is not constrained or otherwise limited by the configurations shown in the figures.","Although a single client device  is illustrated in  having a single game player and a \u2018single set\u2019 of biofeedback sensors , other embodiments are also envisaged. For example, in one embodiment, a plurality of game players, each having their own biofeedback sensors might interact and play together a same video game through the same client device . Thus, multi-player configurations may include such variations as multiple game players employing the same or different client devices. Therefore,  is not to be construed as being limited to a single game player configuration.","Illustrative Client Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","200","200","101"]},"As shown in the figure, client device  includes a processing unit (CPU)  in communication with a mass memory  via a bus .

Input\/output interface  can utilize one or more communication technologies, such as USB, infrared, Bluetooth\u2122, or the like. Haptic interface  is arranged to provide tactile feedback to a user of the client device. For example, the haptic interface may be employed to vibrate client device  in a particular way when another user of a computing device is calling.","GPS transceiver  can determine the physical coordinates of client device  on the surface of the Earth, which typically outputs a location as latitude and longitude values. GPS transceiver  can also employ other geo-positioning mechanisms, including, but not limited to, triangulation, assisted GPS (AGPS), E-OTD, CI, SAI, ETA, BSS or the like, to further determine the physical location of client device  on the surface of the Earth. It is understood that under different conditions, GPS transceiver  can determine a physical location within millimeters for client device ; and in other cases, the determined physical location may be less precise, such as within a meter or significantly greater distances. In one embodiment, however, client device  may, through other components, provide other information that may be employed to determine a geo physical location of the device, including for example, a MAC address, IP address, or other network address.","Mass memory  includes a RAM , a ROM , and other storage means. Mass memory  illustrates another example of computer storage media for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data.

Thus, while described herein as employing biofeedback measures to modify a state of a video game play, the invention is not to be construed as being limited to video game play, and states of other applications may also be modified. For example, a presentation, tutorial, or the like, may be modified based on biofeedback measures.","Thus, in one embodiment, game engine  represents a client component useable to enable online multi-user game play, and\/or single game player use. Non-exhaustive, non-limiting examples of such computer games include but are not limited to Half-Life, Team Fortress, Portal, Counter-Strike, Left 4 Dead, and Day of Defeat developed by Valve Corporation of Bellevue, Wash.","BFI  is configured to detect a connection of one or more biofeedback sensors, and to collect measures received from such sensors. In one embodiment, BFI  may provide information to a remote network device, and\/or to game client  indicating that a connection with a biofeedback sensor is detected. BFI  may further buffer at least some of the received measures. In another embodiment, BFI  may select to instead, provide the received measures to the remote network device, absent buffering, virtually in real-time. In one embodiment, BFI  may convert the measures into a format and\/or protocol usable to communicate the measures over a network to the remote network device. In another embodiment, BFI  may select to not communicate the measures over a network, such as when client device  may be configured as a standalone type of video game console. In one embodiment, BFI  may also time stamp the received measures such that the measures may be readily correlated. Further, BFI  may provide a sensor source identifier to the measures so that measures may be distinguished based on its sensor source.","BFI  may further perform one or more analysis on the received measures to determine if a sensor is providing faulty readings, has become disconnected, or the like. Such determinations may be based on a comparison over time of a plurality of received measures for a given sensor to detect changes from an anticipated range of values for a received measure. For example, if BFI  detects that the sensor measure is a heart rate sensor, and the measures indicate a heart rate of, for example, 2 beats per minute, or even 100 beats per second, then BFI  may determine that the sensor measures are faulty. It should be clear; however, that BFI  may employ other range values, and is not constrained to these example range values. Moreover, BFI  may employ different range values for different sensors. In one embodiment, BFI  might provide the determined faulty measures over the network at least for a given period of time, under an assumption that the game player is temporarily adjusting the sensor. However, in another embodiment, if the sensor is determined to be faulty beyond the given time period, BFI  may select to cease transmission of the measures, and\/or send a message to the remote network device.","As noted above, in conjunction with , client device  may be configured to include components of network device  (described below in conjunction with ), including biofeedback APIs, game server components, and the like.

In one embodiment, BAPI  may collect and store received biofeedback measures in data store  to enable data analysis to be performed, auditing over a time period to be performed, historical data to be collected and analyzed, or the like. In one embodiment, BAPI  may perform at least some analysis upon the received biofeedback measures substantially in real-time. That is, as soon as the measures are received by BAPI , at least some analysis is performed on the measures.","As noted, BAPI  may receive biofeedback measures from a variety of different biofeedback sensors, including, but not limited to those described above in conjunction with . In one embodiment, the received measures may be identified as a sensor source, such as a heart rate sensor, a galvanic skin sensor, or the like.","BAPI , as stated, may perform analysis on the received measures. For example, BAPI  may receive \u2018raw\u2019 biofeedback measures, and determine from the measures a heart beat based on the measures. In another embodiment, BAPI  may employ one or more measures to determine other physiological information about an associated game player. For example, BAPI  might compute a heart rate variability from heart sensor measures. Similarly, BAPI  might compute a standard deviation of heart rate activity over a defined time period, determine a trend over time in a heart rate, and\/or determine other heart patterns. BAPI  may analyze frequency spectrums of heart rate data, including breaking down beat-to-beat intervals into various frequencies using, for example, Fourier transforms, or similar analysis techniques.

BAPI  may further recognize when one game player disconnects from the sensors and\/or is replaced by another game player, based on such activities as missing and\/or corrupt biofeedback measures, pattern changes, or the like.","BAPI  may also be configured to detect particular patterns, conditions, or the like from analyzing the received biofeedback measures. For example, in one embodiment, BAPI  might detect and\/or even predict an onset of motion sickness based, for example, on a causal coherence between a heart rate, blood pressure, and\/or other measures. However, BAPI  may further detect other situations that may be of a severity that warrants sending of an alert message to the video game player, and\/or to GSB  to cease game play. However, BAPI  is not constrained to these actions, and others may also be performed.","As noted above, BAPI  is further configured to make inferences about a state of arousal, emotional states, or the like, of a game player based on analysis of the received biofeedback measures. Such inferences may be performed based on the measures as received, and\/or based on historical data about the game player, and\/or other game players. GSB  may query BAPI  for information about one or more game player's state or arousal, and\/or other information about the game player(s) based in part on the inferences.","In one embodiment, GSB  may send a query request for information about the game player's state of arousal.

For example, as shown, GSB  may query to obtain a comparison between a current state and a previous state of the game player, as well as perform a comparison of the game player to other game players, a baseline, a benchmark, or the like. While  provides numerous examples of possible queries, it should be apparent that other queries may also be performed. Thus, the invention is not constrained to these examples.","In any event, GSB  then employs the results of the queries to modify a state of game play in any of a variety of ways. In one embodiment, and as used herein, a result of a query to GSB  may then provide a result that may be termed as biofeedback information or a \u201cbiocharacteristic.\u201d Using such biocharacteristics obtained from biofeedback of the game player is directed towards providing a more immersive experience of game play over traditional game play. For example, the state of the game play may be modified by enabling avatar mimicry of a player's emotional state. For example, if the player is determined to be happy, the player's avatar may be modified to appear happy. Similarly, if the player is determined to be angry, the game state may be modified to present to the player a different set of game play experiences than if the player is determined to be happy.","Further, in at least one embodiment, the biocharacteristics, such as the state of arousal of the game player may be used to modify a characteristic of an input and\/or input\/output user device. For example, a color of a joystick, a level of resistance on the joystick, or the like, may be modified as a result of a state of arousal of the game player. Similarly, a color of some other input\/output user device might vary based on a heart beat rate, change levels of intensity and\/or color based on the heart rate, level of stress, boredom, or other biocharacteristic indicating a state of arousal of the game player.","It should be noted that while GSB  and BAPI  are illustrated as residing in a network device remote from the client device (such as client device  of ), the invention is not so constrained. Thus, in another embodiment GSB  and\/or BAPI  may reside in the client device, a plurality of different client devices, and\/or across one or more different network devices. Similarly, BAPI  may reside within GSB , without departing from the scope of the invention.","Generalized Operation","The operation of certain aspects of the invention will now be described with respect to .  illustrates a flow chart for one embodiment of a process of employing biofeedback measurements from a game player to modify a game play state in a video game.

In another embodiment, a determination may be made based on receiving biofeedback measures from one or more biofeedback sensors, where the measures are determined to be within an expected range. For example, where measures are received for a heart rate sensor that appears to indicate background noise measurements, it may be determined that the sensor is either faulty and\/or otherwise not connected, or the like. In any event, if it is determined that biofeedback sensors are not connected for the purpose of modifying a state of a game play, processing flows to block ; otherwise, processing flows to block .","At block , other user inputs are received. Such other user inputs may include, but are not limited to joystick, game controller, keyboard, mouse inputs, audio inputs, or the like. Such inputs are typically considered a result of a voluntary or conscious action on the part of the game player, as opposed to biofeedback measure inputs. Processing then continues to block , where the state of game play is modified based on such other user inputs. Processing then flows to decision block , where a determination is made whether the game play is to continue. If game play is to continue, processing loops back to decision block ; otherwise, processing flows to block , where game play terminates.

Examples of modifying a game play state includes, but are not limited to modifying a type and\/or number of opponents in a game; modifying a pace or tempo of the game; increasing\/decreasing a time limit for a game event; modifying a combat, puzzle, or other challenge degree of difficulty; modifying an availability of supplies, power-up items, and or other aspects of items in the game; modifying a volume and\/or type of sound, music, and\/or other audio feature; modifying a color, or other aspect of the game, including a background feature of the game; modifying lighting, weather effects, and\/or other environmental aspects within the game; modify a dialog of various characters within the game including possibly modifying an avatar representing the game player; providing or inhibiting game hints, suggestions, modifying an appearance or function of an application, or the like. For example, in one embodiment a user interface may be modified based on various biocharacteristics. Similarly, tutorials, instructions, or the like, may also be modified by skipping, slowing down\/speeding up a rate of presentation, or the like.

For example, where a user is typing into a keyboard a particular command, text, or the like, the text or command may be used to complement an interpretation of a heart rate variability, or the like. Similarly, flowing to block , other game state data may be selectively received and employed to further assist in an analysis of the biofeedback measures. For example, such game state data might indicate that the game is presenting to the game player an extremely difficult challenge, or the like.

It will also be understood that each block of the flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems, which perform the specified actions or steps, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","As can be seen from the above game examples, biofeedback measures may be used in a variety of ways to modify a state of a game play. However, the variations are not limited to those described above. For example, in variation to the above games, the biofeedback measures may be used to control an input to the game. For instance, if a large creature is hunting the game player's character, then the player might be expected to maintain or reduce their stress level to avoid alerting the creature of their positions. In a similar game, the player might be required to demonstrate sharp physiological arousal to break out of handcuffs or other restraints or break through a locked door to escape a threat.","In another game scenario, little elf characters that give cookies to the user might only appear when the player is calm, and stay away if the user is not determined to be calm. A player desiring the cookies (or other reward) must achieve a state of calmness to attract the characters. In still another game scenario, in a forest adventure, it may be sunny with lush, green trees, when the player is determined to be in a particular physiological state of arousal. As the player deviates from that state, the sky might darken, the trees may wither and\/or blacken, and\/or various colors, music, and\/or other sounds may change. Thus, various background aspects within the game may be dynamically modified based on the biofeedback measures of the player.","Similarly, based on biofeedback measures from the player, various non-player characters may make dialog choices, vary their display or the like, including commenting directly on the user's inferred state of arousal or other biocharacteristic.","In still other examples, a user's avatar might show a visible heart, brain, or other bodily aspect, which may be modified based on the biofeedback measures. For example, the heart might change color to show boredom, anger, happiness, or the like. Similarly, the heart might beat to coincide with the heart rate of the player. In still another embodiment, the heart rate of the avatar might be modified to be slightly slower than the heart rate of the player\u2014to attempt to direct the player to become calm. The avatar's facial expressions may also vary as a result of the inferred player's state of arousal, including showing a smile, a frown, anger, or the like.","In addition, a user interface device, screen display or the like, might be modified based on the players' inferred state of arousal. Thus, if it determined that the player is stressed, the user interface might display a help feature to guide the player to a solution for a problem in the game play they are experiencing. There are still a plurality of other ways in which the biofeedback measures may modify a state of game play. Thus, as noted, the invention is not limited to those described above.","However, the above specification, examples, and data provide a complete description of the manufacture and use of the composition of the invention.
