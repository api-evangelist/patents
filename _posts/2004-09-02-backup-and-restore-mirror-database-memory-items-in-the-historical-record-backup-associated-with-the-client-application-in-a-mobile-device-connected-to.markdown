title: Backup and restore mirror database memory items in the historical record backup associated with the client application in a mobile device connected to a communion network
abstract: The need for backup and restore arises in a mobile device based system when a client application is discarded along with its historical record. In a system that provides the backup and restore capability, a server is configured with a request handler, an application storage upload/download handler, and a device storage mirror database. In a mobile device (also client), the transaction listener provides a transaction associated with memory items to the crumb sticker which, in turn, sends to the request handler a recording request with the transaction along with a request URL (uniform resource locator). The data for the recording request is channeled from the client storage to the device storage mirror database via the application storage upload/download handler. The memory items are accumulated in a file at the client and in a backup at the device storage mirror database, and are restorable to the client from the backup.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of and incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Application 60\/518,898 entitled \u201cBACK BUTTON IN MOBILE APPLICATION,\u201d U.S. Provisional Application 60\/518,858, entitled \u201cNAVIGATION PATTERN ON A DIRECTORY TREE,\u201d U.S. Provisional Application 60\/518,857, entitled \u201cBACKUP AND RESTORE IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS,\u201d and U.S. Provisional Application 60\/518,897, entitled \u201cUPLOAD SECURITY SCHEME,\u201d all of which were filed Nov. 10, 2003.","The present invention relates generally to wireless mobile devices and more particularly to applications that offer backup and restore capabilities. Among such applications, one type is a mobile photos application.","Mobile-friendly technologies are advanced to provide a rich multimedia environment and enhance the wireless device users' experience. An outcome of this evolution is the manifest closeness between the wireless universe and the Internet domain, as well as the advent of wireless devices with multimedia capabilities. The newest versions of mobile wireless devices such as digital mobile phones, pagers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handsets, and any other wireless terminals, have multimedia capabilities including the ability to retrieve e-mail, and push and pull information via the Internet.","Because mobile devices have limited memory capacity the likelihood of them running out of memory space is quite high. Many devices can only store 2-3 J2ME\u2122 applications before the memory is filled up (J2ME\u2122 is Java\u2122 2 platform, Micro Edition, by Sun Microsystems, Inc.). As a result, users must frequently delete applications (i.e., client-side applications) from their mobile devices and re-load them at a later time.","At the same time, it is common for applications to store in the local mobile memory the history of user preferences or user actions. Thus, when such applications are deleted from the mobile devices the historical information is lost because there are no standards for preserving these preferences or action histories.","The present invention is based, in part, on the observation that a need exists for better management of the memory space in mobile devices and for easier navigation in restoring historical information, and that it can be improved as described below. Specifically, the backup and restore concept is implemented in mobile applications so as to increases their usability despite the limited memory capacity of mobile devices. Because many of the preferences, actions or any other historical activity and related data (\u201cmemory items\u201d) are either extremely difficult or practically impossible to recapture, having the ability to restore, and preferably the ability to automatically restore, these \u201cmemory items\u201d simplifies the process of restoring them when the related program is reloaded.","The broader concept of preserving and restoring these memory items applies to any mobile application. The Yahoo!\u2019 Photos application is one example in which the capability of preserving and restoring memory items includes mobile album backup and restore.","For the purpose of this invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and a system are proposed as possible implementations of the backup and restore concept. These implementations typically involve a server in communication link with a plurality of mobile devices. In the context of the Yahoo! Photos application, the mobile devices are typically wireless devices such as wireless camera phones and the memory items includes photograph data (or simply one or more photos).","In one embodiment, a method for providing the backup and restore includes maintaining in a mobile device a file that accumulates a historical record of memory items associated with a client application. This method further includes sending a recording request to a backup device for each memory item accumulated in the file in order to create a backup of the historical record in the backup device, wherein the backup is accessible from the mobile device for restoring the historical record in case it is not existing in the mobile device. The method further includes for each memory item, in response to the recording request from the mobile device, saving the memory item in the backup device. Typically, the mobile device is a wireless device and the backup device is a server, both of which being capable of communicating with each other via a wireless carrier network and a network that includes the Internet.","In one implementation, the client application is a client photo application and the memory items are any recordable action, for example, any one or a combination of a mobile album, a selected photo data, a page navigation and a back in sequence navigation. The file in which the memory items are accumulated, typically in a compressed form, is an archive file such as a Java archive (JAR) file.","In this context, the selected photo data includes photo image data and any combination of a photo name, a screen size and a path into a database record in the backup device for the selected photo data. Hence, the method further includes, in response to the recording request from the mobile device, saving the selected photo data in the database record. Typically, the database record has a capacity suitable for a predetermined number of photos which if it were to be exceeded by the saving of the selected photo data includes another step. That is, the step of saving further includes discarding from the database record photo data for the oldest photo in order to make room for saving the selected photo data. Then, the historical record is restored from the backup in the server once log in to the server is done.","The restoring step comprises receiving at the mobile device a list of memory items from which any one or all of the memory items is selectable for recovery from the backup. Where the client application is a client photo application, the restoring step comprises receiving at the mobile device a mobile album list of photos from which any one or all of them is selectable for recovery from the backup. Upon selecting from the mobile album list photos for recovery from the backup, the selected photos are retrieved, unless before all of them are retrieved the mobile device reaches full memory capacity.","In one implementation, once the client application is re-downloaded and log in to the server is done, the historical record is restored from the backup in the server by automatically receiving all photos in the historical record without need for the mobile device to initiate further interactions with the server. Upon re-downloading the client application from the server to the mobile device, or downloading the client application from the server to another mobile device, the downloaded or re-downloaded client application is pre-populated with the historical record from the backup.","In another method that implements backup and restore in a system with mobile devices in communication with a server, the memory items are saved in mirror database by the server and restored by the mobile device from the historical record backup in the mirror database. Specifically, this method includes maintaining in a server a mirror database with a historical record backup for a client application uploaded from the server to a mobile device. Preferably this is done for each such application. The mirror database accumulates memory items in the historical record backup that are associated with the client application and mirror its historical record. The method further includes receiving a recording request from a mobile device for each memory item accumulated in the mirror database in order to create a respective the historical record backup in the server and saving in the mirror database the memory item associated with each respective recording request. This way, for each client application its historical record backup is accessible from the mobile device for restoring its respective historical record.","The approach described above can be implemented in a computer readable medium embodying a computer program with program code for providing the backup and restore. In this implementation, the computer program is divided into parts, one part being at a server side, a second part being at a client side and a third part being at a networking service. Alternatively, a system for providing the backup and restore includes the server, plurality of the mobile devices and typically also a wireless network, the Internet and a gateway through which the server communicates with the mobile devices. The server is configured with a processor and a memory embodying the server-side program as a portion of the computer application. The mobile devices are, in turn, configured with a processor and memory embodying the client-side program portion of the computer application.","In a particular system that provides the backup and restore capability, the server is configured with a request handler, an application storage upload\/download handler, and a device storage mirror database. A mobile device, also at times referred to as a client, is configured with a client storage, a transaction listener, and a crumb sticker. The transaction listener is configured to provide a transaction to the crumb sticker which is configured, in turn, to send to the request handler the transaction along with a request URL (uniform resource locator) in a recording request. The crumb is attached to a normal client-server request. This request is typically used by a client-side application, for instance, to get a list of albums. For the purpose of the backup and restore, the crumb is piggy-backed on the tail of the URL of the normal request in order to avoid the need for additional requests specifically for backup and restore. The data for the recording request is channeled from the client storage to the device storage mirror database via the application storage upload\/download handler. Each transaction sent in a recording request is associated with a memory item, the memory items being accumulated in a file in the client and in a backup historical record in the device storage mirror database, wherein the memory items are restorable to the client from the backup historical record.","As can be understood from these examples, by introducing the backup and restore capability to the system, the present invention makes better use of the limited facilities of mobile device. Such advantages will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art from the description and practice of the invention disclosed herein.","The present invention contemplates backup and restore and the implementation of this concept in mobile applications, as illustrated in FIGS. E and A-C and discussed in more detail in conjunction with these Figures. One such application is mobile photos, an example of which is referred to as the Yahoo! Photos\u2122 application. Yahoo! and Yahoo! Photos are trademarks of Yahoo! Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif. Any other trademarks are the property of their respective holders.","Although it can be implemented in various applications, for clarity and for illustration, the approach contemplated by the present invention is described here in the context of the Yahoo! Photos application, as illustrated in . The server side of this application is the \u201cserver Yahoo! Photos,\u201d and the client side of this application is the mobile client application, or \u201cclient Yahoo! Photos.\u201d A client application is generally considered to be a downloadable application; namely, J2ME\u2122 (Java\u2122 2 platform, Micro Edition, by Sun Microsystems, Inc.), Yahoo! Photos\u2122, or any other application that is downloadable to the mobile device. In the example here, the client Yahoo! Photos runs on a mobile phone, and more specifically, a mobile camera phone.","The Wireless Communication Environment","A. Wireless Communication Protocols","Wireless protocols, the standards which govern communications of data between wireless devices and the Internet, utilize and support the enhanced capabilities of modern mobile wireless devices and Internet content technologies. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is an often used standard, and other standards include the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), M-services, i-Mode and Web clipping. Although other protocols are also possible, WAP appears to provide a proper framework for the content sharing. Therefore, adoption of standards such as WAP is suitable for the purpose of the present invention, and it is discussed in some detail below.","The adoption of WAP builds on existing Internet standards and protocols adapted for use in wireless communication networks and addresses the unique characteristics of mobile wireless devices (with limited computing, memory, display, user interface, and power capabilities). WAP is a specification suite defining a set of protocols for presentation and delivery of wireless information and telephony services on mobile wireless devices. WAP services provide information access and delivery to WAP-enabled devices. WAP was designed to empower users with easy and instant access to information and interactive services. Thus, interoperability between WAP-enabled device is possible through any WAP-compliant infrastructure to deliver timely information and accept transaction and queries.","WAP can be built on any operating system, including PalmOS, EPOC, Windows CE, FLEXOS, OS\/9, JAVA OS etc. Being air interface independent, WAP is designed to be scalable to new networks as they develop, allowing bearer independence and development of common solutions across disparate networks.","The term \u201cWAP\u201d is commonly used to refer to the wireless application environment (WAE) although it is WAE that includes the WAP suit of protocols and technologies. WAE provides the rich application environment which enables delivery of information and interactive services to mobile wireless devices. An important aspect of the WAE is the WAP stack, namely the wireless protocol layers, as shown for example in . At the bottom of the WAP stack  is a network layer, topped by the transport layer, the security layer, the transaction layer, and the session layer.","Briefly, the network protocol layer supports network interface definitions, governing interface with the networks of wireless service providers (wireless bearers) such as short message service (SMS), code division multiple access (CDMA), cellular digital packet data (CDPD), general packet radio service (GPRS), high speed circuit-switched data (HSCSD), third generation (3G), GSM (global system for mobile communications), and unstructured supplementary service data (USSD) channel. The wireless transport layer supports the wireless datagram protocol (WDP), and when operating over an IP (Internet protocol) network layer WDP is replaced with user datagram protocol\/IP (UDP\/IP). WDP offers to the upper protocol layers a datagram service and transparent communication over the underlying bearer services. In other words, WDP offers to the upper protocol layers a common interface to and ability to function independent of the type of bearer wireless network. The wireless transport layer security (WTLS) provides a secure transport service to preserve the privacy, authentication and data integrity of the transport service at the layer below, as well as the ability to create and terminate secure connections between communicating applications. The transaction protocol (WTP) layer provides transaction oriented protocol for the WAP datagram service, including, for example, request-response transactions. The wireless session protocol (WSP) layer provides HTTP\/1.1 functionality and features such as session suspend\/resume. The WSP provides the upper-level application lever of the WAE with an interface to connection and connectionless services operating above the transaction protocol and the datagram transport layers, respectively.","The WAE (i.e., the wireless application environment) is further fashioned with a wireless markup language (WML) micro-browser, a WML script virtual machine, a WML script standard library, a wireless telephony application interface (TAI), and WAP content types. The WAP micro-browser, also referred to as the \u201cWAP browser,\u201d facilitates interaction between WAP\/Web applications and WAP-enabled devices. The micro-browser is a tag-based wireless browser application supporting wireless markup language (WML), and extensible transport hyperlink markup language (XTHML). The micro-browser uses the \u201ccard\u201d metaphor for user interface, where user interactions are split into cards. The WAP card metaphor provides a common interface to which all applications can conform, much like the desktop metaphor in PCs. The micro-browser supports user actions, defined at tree levels (deck, card, and select & link options, i.e., ACCEPT, PREV, etc.) and default tasks (PREV, NOOP, etc.). For example, a deck of cards is split into a navigation card, variables card, and input elements card. A navigation card is formed as a script encapsulated with the \u2018card\u2019 tags. The following example of a card includes the type of interaction (DO TYPE=\u201cACCEPT\u201d) and link (GO URL=\u201c#eCARD\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<CARD>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<DO TYPE=\u201dACCEPT\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<GO URL=\u201d#eCARD\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/DO"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003WELCOME!"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/CARD>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"B. Wireless Communication Infrastructure",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","100","18","16","18","18"]},"Indeed, with this capability, users can capture photo images in their mobile devices, store and manipulate the captured images, and upload data of the captured images to a server (e.g., server ). Thus, the server  operates as a repository for the data of photo images, and users can download from the server to their mobile devices data of previously captured photo images, as well as store and manipulate such images. Photos resident on one mobile device can be shared with another via the server  and the communication network(s)  and .","In this wireless interconnect model, the mobile phones used to download the Yahoo! Photos client side program are WAP-enabled. As shown in , the WAP-enabled devices  support the WAP protocol and the server  typically supports the WWW (world-wide web) protocol. In particular, the wireless application environment at the mobile device side  includes the micro-browser, a suite of WAP protocols at the network through session layers, and the downloadable (client-side) Yahoo! Photos application program. The micro-browser defines how WML documents and WML script applets should be interpreted and presented to the mobile device user. The Micro-browser's WTA (wireless telephone application) functionality provides call control, phone book access and messaging within WML script applets to allow selective call forwarding or other secure telephony. The wireless application environment at the server side  includes the server-side Yahoo! Photos in addition to a standard web browser and WWW protocol stack (HTTP and TCP\/IP).","To enable web-based access to content, service providers deploy wireless data through the carrier network  while controlling the data communications to their subscribers and tracking the billable activity. Typically, the gateway  is tasked with tracking subscriber activities, controlling access and, in addition, functioning as the proxy for the mobile device , on the one hand, and for the server , on the other hand. The gateway  is implemented, building on standard web proxy technology, to interconnect the services offered by the wireless service providers to the HTTP protocol so as to permit access to content on the wired Internet.","One model of interaction between a WAP-enabled device, the WAP-enabled proxy\/gateway, and the server, is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 1.1 response\/request transaction, where HTTP 1.1 is profiled for the wireless environment. The gateway ( & ) translates requests from the WAP protocol to the WWW protocol, and vice versa; translating WML(\/HTML) documents to HTML(\/WML), resolving domain names in URLs and providing a control point for managing access. From the WAP-enabled gateway with encoders\/decoders, the URL requests or WML documents (possibly in encoded form) can be sent encoded\/decoded to add security to the user interaction. Note that, unlike the flat structure of HTML documents, WML documents are divided into a set of user interaction units, namely a deck of cards. Each user interaction unit is a card (or page), and the user can navigate between cards in one or more WML documents.","Another model of interaction between a WAP-enabled device, the WAP-enabled proxy\/gateway, and the server, is the HTTP response\/request transaction (protocol running on top of the Internet's TCP\/IP suite of protocols). This model is appropriate for the newer WAP 2.0 (with protocol stack not shown in ). Unlike the above-mentioned, and illustrated, WAP stack , WAP 2.0 stack includes the IP, TCP (transmission control protocol), TLS, HTTP and WAE layers atop the network layer (all of which are profiled for wireless environment). For example, the wireless profile for the TLS protocol will permit interoperability for secure transactions.","Yet another model of interaction via bearer networks, between 3-generation (3G)-enabled mobile devices and servers or other devices, is shown in . As shown, a 3G terminal supports higher-speed, wider-band wireless cellular service communications based on various technologies, including wide code division multiple access (W-CDMA), general packet radio service (GPRS), global system for mobile communications (GSM), enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), unified threat management system (UMTS), and high speed circuit switched data (HSCSD). A 3G terminal is equipped with cordless connections for local, short distance communications. The communication protocols in the 3G terminal are comparable to the open system interconnection (OSI) protocols, layered in the OSI stack.","Various services are supported by these protocols, including web browsing, short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), e-mail, M-commerce, real-time video, and pre-paid. The MMS, for example, is a store and forward messaging service capable of adding multimedia elements to SMS, including images, text, audio clips, and video clips. MMS is synchronized across a common timeline, rather than being discrete like e-mail and SMS; it is akin to a presentation layer over e-mail and looking like a slide show with images. On a compatible phone, the MMS message will appear with a new message alert. The picture message will open on the screen, the text will appear below the image and the sound will begin to play automatically.","Downloadable applications such as Yahoo! Photos and network games are likewise supported in the 3G terminal and interact with services such as MMS. The originator can easily create a multimedia message, either using a built-in or accessory camera, or can use images and sounds stored previously in the phone (and possibly downloaded from a web site). However, for simplicity, the following description assumes that the mobile device is a WAP-enabled camera phone used for downloading photo applications such as the Yahoo! Photos.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["100","100","112","100","114","116","118","110"]},"As further shown in , the Yahoo!-enabled phone  supports wireless cellular service communications based on various technologies such as the GPRS and GSM. This device is configured for supporting WAP communication protocols (at all layers of the WAP stack). Various services shown as being supported by these protocols, include web browsing, SMS, MMS, e-mail, M-commerce, real-time video, and pre-paid. The downloadable programs shown to interact with such services include the network games and Yahoo! Photos.","The mobile device functionality is preferably implemented using a platform, such as the J2ME\u2122 platform, which is tailored for a broad range of embedded devices including mobile phones. The J2ME\u2122 platform includes a set of standard Java APIs (application programming Interface), and provides a user interface, a security model, built-in network protocols (e.g., WAP, as shown in ), and support for networked and disconnected applications (Yahoo! Photos is a networked application).","With the J2ME\u2122 platform, applications are written once for a wide range of device. Applications leveraging each device's native capabilities are then downloaded dynamically. The J2ME\u2122 platform defines configurations, profiles and optional packages as elements for building complete Java run time environments. Configurations are composed of a virtual machine and a minimal set of class libraries and provide the base functionality for a particular range of devices that share similar characteristics. Current configurations include connected limited device configuration (CLDC) for devices with limited memory and processing capabilities (e.g., mobile phones, two-way pagers, and PDAs) and connected device configuration (CDC) for devices with better memory, processing and network bandwidth capabilities (e.g., TV set-top boxes, residential gateways, in-vehicle telematics systems, and hi-end PDAs). However, in order to provide a complete runtime environment targeted at specific device categories, the configurations must be combined with a set of the high-level APIs, or profiles, that further define the application life cycle model, access to device-specific properties, and user interface.","One example of profiles is the mobile information device profile (MIDP) which is designed for mobile phones and entry-level PDAs. MIDP offers a core application functionality required by mobile applications, including user interface, network connectivity, local data storage, and application management. The J2ME\u2122 can be further extended by combining various optional packages and their corresponding profiles to address specific market requirements, e.g., Bluetooth\u2122, web services, wireless messaging, multimedia, and database connectivity.","Backup and Restore in the Context of Mobile Yahoo! Photos","Note that the example here focuses on the camera phone, but the principles of the present invention are not limited to camera phones. Any phone or other wireless mobile device can embody a variation of the present invention. When the mobile device is a smart handset, downloading application programs and implementing the backup and restore scheme are possible even though the communications with the service provider may be different in character.","It should be mentioned that, although the manufacturer provides the Yahoo!-enabled phone  with camera functionality\u2014i.e., functionality for capturing images, and saving, displaying, manipulating, transmitting and receiving data of images\u2014this camera functionality is independent from the Yahoo! Photos program. That is, data of the captured images reside in the mobile phone outside the Yahoo! Photos environment until such time that this data is introduced to the Yahoo! Photos environment by being first uploaded to the Yahoo! server and then downloaded to the local (mobile) Yahoo! Photos album, as will be later explained.","On mobile devices, various client application programs are offered to the user on a default start-up or main menu screen or on a manufacturer-installed virtual vending machine screen (vending machines for client (J2ME) applications are the digital rights management systems of the carriers designed to manage the ownership or licensing of applications from the carrier on behalf of the application developer\/distributor to be purchased by the consumer). Other selection items include, for example, the menu item for setting the sound. These start up and vending screens show a menu with a list (or icons) of applications which the user can obtain by following an install procedure. The menu provides links to various service web sites, including, for example, the Yahoo! Photos site. The links, of course, are URLs (Uniform Resource Locator)\u2014i.e., the world wide web address of a site on the Internet, and on the Yahoo!-enabled phone, at least one such menu item is the link for downloading the Yahoo! Photos application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["302","303","304","304","306","306","306","400","320","500"],"i":["a","b","d"],"sub":"A-D"},"If the user accepts the offer to buy the application, the order is confirmed  and the application is downloaded into the mobile phone, becoming resident on the mobile phone.  show the respective PC-based and mobile-based registration and buy flow diagrams.","Incidentally, as shown in , if the user confirms acceptance, assuming the user has an account on the server having signed in before, the user is prompted to provide the telephone number of the mobile phone. With that phone number, the server sends a short message embedded with a link to the mobile phone and causes the mobile phone to vibrate or, otherwise, signals the user with a message requesting confirmation of the purchase . With this confirmation  the server proceeds to send the program to the mobile phone.","As shown in , registration can originate on the PC or the mobile phone. In the PC-based registration process, once, the compatible phone list is reviewed  and the phone is deemed compatible, registration can go forward starting with the user entering the 10-digit mobile phone number . The service provider dials the 10-digit phone number and requests confirmation from the user via that mobile phone . The user is also prompted to follow the buy instructions  or follow the link to the vending machine  (as mentioned, vending machines for client (J2ME) applications are the digital rights management systems of the carriers designed to manage the ownership or licensing of applications from the carrier on behalf of the application developer\/distributor to be purchased by the consumer). Once the download takes place the Yahoo! Photos client home page  is presented on the mobile screen. Alternatively, rather than indirectly via the PC, a program such as Yahoo! Photos can be purchased directly via the mobile phone, as shown in . That is, the registration process originating from the mobile phone is launched from the menu page, e.g. Yahoo! home pages  or .

Photos account (on the server) . The user is additionally prompted to enter one or more of the user's e-mails, e.g., <user reg. #@messaging.sprintPCS> or other e-mails, e.g., <jsmith@sprintpcs.com>, through which the photos are uploaded to the user account .

Photos prompts this program to display the \u2018home\u2019 page 2.0 with two main options: mobile album, and online album (as shown in ). The mobile album is an album of photos stored locally on the mobile phone, so that the user need not go out over the network to obtain them. The online album is an album of photos stored on the server in the user's account.","As mentioned before, photo images can be captured and manipulated by the mobile phone outside the Yahoo! Photos environment. These photo images will not be available at the mobile or online albums until they are uploaded to the server and then (selectively or in batch) downloaded from the server. Accordingly, selecting \u2018online album\u2019 allows the user to access and manipulate photo images that have already been uploaded to the server from the user's PC or mobile phone and stored in the online album. The online album is dynamically rendered within the client (mobile device) based on the client-server interactions (i.e., photos are pulled from the server dynamically and placed in the online album). It reflects the exact state of the server at the time of the query and requires a live online connection. To save a photo from the online album to the mobile album the user clicks \u201cSave to Mobile Album.\u201d This process takes time, in some instances approximately 10 seconds, depending on the device and network connectivity. Each time this action takes place it is recorded (as backup) by the server.","By analogy, selecting \u2018mobile album\u2019 allows the user to access and manipulate photo images that have been already downloaded from the server and saved in the mobile album. If the user saves, for example, 5 photos to the mobile album, the user is then able to view the 5 photos without again accessing the server via the network (wireless and Internet). Viewing these photos in the mobile album is significantly faster than viewing them in the online album because they are native (present locally) instead of being dynamically pulled from the server over the network.","Then, if the \u2018online album\u2019 option is selected from the Yahoo! Photos client program \u2018home\u2019 page (.), as shown in , it prompts the program to display the next page which is the \u2018sign-in\u2019 page (.). It requires the user to follow a sign-in procedure that typically includes providing a Yahoo! ID and user password. The sign-in procedure will, among other things, bring up the user's account and relate it to the user's online albums. That is, the sign-in procedure allows the user to access his account via the Internet (and other proprietary network if applicable).","The next page is the \u2018my online albums\u2019 page (.). For the specific user, this online albums page lists the names of photo albums available to the named user which are associated with the user's account. Of course, the album listing includes only albums that are on the server and can be dynamically pulled from it. If the selected album is empty the next page will display an indication to that effect (i.e., \u201cthis album is currently empty\u201d at page; ..). Alternatively, if the album is not empty, selecting that album will bring up the next page, the \u2018photo list\u2019 page for that album (..). In the \u2018photo list\u2019 page, a photo can be selected for downloading it from the server onto the mobile phone. Additionally, a selected photo can be opened or other actions can be invoked in relation to it. The other actions are presented in a menu that is shown on the screen as a pull-down menu, pop-up menu, or a menu superimposed on any part of the current page (in this example the menu is shown as a pull-down menu).","Such menu (hereafter \u201cphoto options menu\u201d) provides a number of selection items, each of each representing an action, including: \u2018save to mobile,\u2019 \u2018email photo,\u2019 \u2018screen saver,\u2019 \u2018thumbnails,\u2019 \u2018online albums,\u2019 and \u2018home.\u2019 Each selection brings up a page that corresponds to the selected action item. Two of the action items have already been discussed above, \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018online album.\u2019 Selecting home, will lead the user back to the home page (.), and selecting online album, will lead the user to the aforementioned \u2018my online albums\u2019 page (.).","Selecting \u2018thumbnails\u2019 brings up a \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page .. that shows a group of thumbnail photo images from the selected album. Note that the number of photo thumb groups downloaded from the server depends on the memory size of the mobile phone (or whatever device is used). With this feature, the user can then thumbnail through the groups of photos in the album. The groups of thumbnail photo images in this album are each loaded from the server. The user can then move between the images back and forth (scroll back and forth) and select any one of the photos in the \u2018thumbnails\u2019 page. A selected thumbnail image will be enlarged in the next page, the \u2018online photo\u2019 page (..).","As can be seen, each of the pages, \u2018photo list\u2019 (..), \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 (..), and \u2018online photo\u2019 (..), includes the photo options menu feature. Among these action items, when \u2018save to mobile\u2019 is invoked from the \u2018photo list\u2019 page, \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page, or \u2018online photo\u2019 page, it causes the selected photo image (previously downloaded from the server) to be saved in the mobile album on the mobile phone. The \u2018added to mobile\u2019 page (..) is brought up in this case to show the photo being saved and to give an indication that saving is done.","When \u2018email photo\u2019 action is invoked, the \u2018share as email\u2019 page comes up (..). This page shows the photo(s) selected for emailing and prompts the user for the email address. In this implementation, a number of recently-used email addresses are provided. Incidentally, \u2018email\u2019 is simply a transport mechanism which is presently used to send photos from camera phones. Other transport mechanisms may be developed and employed for this application. Then, when the photo is emailed from the mobile phone to the selected e-mail address, a message pops up indicating that the email has been sent or, if not, that an error occurred. For example, a transmission will fail if the user is not authorized to upload photos to the selected e-mail. An error message of this kind is a product of the upload security scheme as embodied in the Yahoo! Photos application program.","When the \u2018screen saver\u2019 action is invoked, the selected photo will be used to populate the screen when the phone is idle, standing by, or starting up. The \u2018screen saver\u2019 option is associated with screen saver page (..) which shows the selected photo and requires the user to select \u2018OK\u2019 or \u2018cancel\u2019 to add this photo to the screen saver photo roster. A message pops up to indicate the status of the photo download.","Going back to the mobile album is possible with the photo options menu via the \u2018home\u2019 page, using the \u2018home\u2019 option as discussed above. Another way for getting to the mobile album or any other previous page is with the \u201cback\u201d action using the \u2018back\u2019 button. Also, as mentioned above, when the Yahoo! Photos application is invoked from the landing\/menu page, the \u2018home\u2019 page (.) presents the \u2018mobile album\u2019 as one of the selection items. Accordingly, the mobile album can be accessed directly via the \u2018home\u2019 page.","The mobile album screen flow, shown in , starts with the \u2018home\u2019 page (.) and selection of the mobile album brings up the \u2018mobile photo\u2019 list page (..). This page presents two action menus, \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018action.\u2019 Thus, selection of any of the listed photos can be followed by selecting \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018action.\u2019 As before, when \u2018open\u2019 is selected the photo is shown on the screen in the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page (..). When \u2018actions\u2019 is selected, a mobile photo action menu is provided. This menu includes action items such as \u2018slide show,\u2019 \u2018move,\u2019 \u2018delete photo,\u2019 \u2018delete all\u2019 (photos), \u2018thumbnails,\u2019 \u2018history,\u2019 and \u2018home.\u2019","Except for the photos being local (at the mobile album), the thumbnails feature, associated with the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page (..), works as described above with reference to the online album. A photo selected on the mobile \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 page can be enlarged as shown in the next page, the \u2018mobile photo\u2019 page (..). The menu for the \u2018photo thumbs\u2019 and \u2018mobile photo\u2019 pages includes a subset of the aforementioned mobile photo action menu.","When the slide show is invoked from such a menu the \u2018mobile slide show\u2019 page comes up (.). While this feature is active, the slide show scrolls through the mobile album photos, showing each photo for a certain period. The slide show goes on until the user selects \u2018stop\u2019 on the bottom of the page. If the user selects \u2018actions\u2019 a slide show menu gives the user the options of \u2018pause,\u2019 \u2018show,\u2019 \u2018normal,\u2019 and \u2018fast.\u2019 The \u2018pause\u2019 option is selected for pausing the slide show; \u2018slow\u2019 will slow down the slide show, \u2018speed\u2019 will speed up the slide show, and \u2018normal\u2019 will bring it to normal speed. (, parts (i) and (ii), describes setting up favorites for the mobile album slideshow; part (i) describes the process in the mobile device, and part (ii) describes the process originating at the PC).","As further shown in , the \u2018move\u2019 page comes up (..) when the \u2018move\u2019 action (referred to also as \u2018rearrange\u2019 action) is selected from any one of the three pages (.., .. and ..). In this page, the program displays a group of photos (thumbnails) and the user can rearrange the photos using the 5-point navigation key, as well as choose to drop a photo or save it ( shows flow diagrams for photos view, share and save). When the \u2018delete\u2019 or \u2018delete all\u2019 actions are selected, the user has the option of deleting or canceling the delete action (as shown in pages .. and ..). The \u2018delete\u2019 page shows the photo selected for deletion to allow the user to change their mind. When all the photos are deleted, or when the mobile album is empty to begin with, the \u2018mobile album empty\u2019 page is displayed (..). It allows the user to select the home page or select the answer to any one of the queries, such as \u201cwhere are my photos?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the mobile album?.\u201d Selection of the latter will bring up the \u2018about\u2019 page (...), and in this page pressing \u2018OK\u2019 provides user access to the online album(s). Selection of the former brings up the \u2018restore album\u2019 page .... The backup and restore function (also known as the history feature) is later explained in more detail.","As with the previous page (\u201cwhere are my photos?\u201d page ..), the \u2018restore album\u2019 page (...) allows the user to go to the \u2018home\u2019 page (.). This time, via \u2018OK\u2019, it allows the user to go to the next mobile \u2018restore album\u2019 page (....) for a historical photo download list (of photos previously downloaded to the mobile phone).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 5E","b":["2","0","3","1","4","3","1","4","2","33","35","3","1","4","2","1","37","3","1","1"]},"Note that the pages shown in  and discussed herein are exemplary rather than exhaustive, and they do not necessarily include all possible pages (or user interaction cards) that a photo application such as Yahoo! Photos presents. Moreover, the reference designations (call-out numbers) typically refer to the pages themselves rather than any portion of their content. Where applicable, similar pages appear in different figures with the same call-out numbers, e.g., home page ., although their respective contents can vary slightly.","While  illustrates one aspect of backup and restore in the context of Yahoo! Photos, namely the flow or restoring the mobile album from the server backup, the principles of backup and restore are discussed more fully below. When the client Yahoo! Photos application is run, various user actions (e.g., navigation), choices of preferences, photo downloads to the mobile album and the like are experienced at the mobile device. The navigation history, mobile album, choices of preferences and the like are the memory items which form the historical record for the particular application.","Historical records are maintained in a storage area associated with the client application. Because mobile devices have a limited memory space that frequently causes them to reach full or near full capacity, users are frequently forced to swap between client applications (i.e., discard unused applications). However, deleting a client application is likely to result in the clearance of this storage area. Moreover, in most carrier-provided vending machines for client applications or in typical application provider's websites, only the client-side applications rather than the actual files with the memory items are available. When the user chooses to delete or \u201cupload\u201d their application to a vending machine, the user is actually deleting the JAR\/JAD files (with the historical record). Thus, when a user re-loads an application from either the vending machine or the application provider's own website, the application being delivered is an entirely new client-side application. The new application has no inherent basis of knowledge of the \u201cmemory items\u201d from the previously discarded application. This is because the protocols, including current J2ME and other protocols, eliminate the historical record even when the user merely upgrades the application to a new version. Also, when the user replaces one mobile device with another, the historical record related to the client-side application in the first mobile device is not available in the replacement mobile device.","Accordingly, a server-client backup and restore system is provided in which the historical records (memory items) are saved and from which the historical records can be restored. The software aspects of this functionality are embodied in the client-side applications and their supporting server handlers.  illustrate the backup and restore functionality and system components implemented for the Yahoo! Photos application.","In the context of the Yahoo! Photos program, as shown in , the backup and restore system records a history of memory items on the Yahoo! server each time a \u201crecordable\u201d action is taken . A recordable action in this context is, for example, the saving of a photo from an online album to a mobile album or rendering the online album. In the Yahoo! server, photos are recorded along with their name and path into the user's record in the database . Typically, the user is allocated room for a given number of photos, and if that number is exceeded old photos are discarded . In the mobile device, the mobile album is the local collection of photos downloaded  from the online album and now living within the JAR file.","It is important to remember that although the backup and restore functionality (i.e., the history feature) is described in the context of the Yahoo! Photos program, it is useful in any mobile device application where backup is desired. Thus, although this feature is implemented for the Yahoo! Photos application, it can be implemented more generically for other applications.","In the context of Yahoo! Photos, every photo from the user's online album that is saved to the mobile album is \u2018remembered\u2019 by the server. Indeed, any action (for example, the history required for the back in sequence implementation), not just a photos download history, can be recorded as a backup on the server side . Preferably, since the page traversal path is not predictive the history is recorded accurately and fully. Thus, if the Yahoo! Photos program is erased, for any reason, from the mobile phone memory and the user then reloads it, the backup historical record is retrieved to restore the historical record. This is made possible with the association of the user's Yahoo! ID to the user's historical record on the server.","Note that each mobile phone device is distinctly identified to the server, and a user may have more than one device. Therefore, each device can in principle have its own distinct historical record on the server. However, when the user first establishes or later updates his account it can be arranged that the user's Yahoo! ID is associated with a plurality of mobile phones. Then, the user can sign in and have access to his historical record on the server from any one of these mobile phones.","Because of the backup, at any given time, the historical record with all the \u201cmemory items\u201d resides not only at the client in the storage area but also at the Yahoo! server. However, upon deleting the client Yahoo! Photo application the action of deleting the archive (JAR\/JAD) file and associated storage area from a user's mobile device is not captured by the Yahoo! server because this action does not involve network connectivity. After that point, the mobile device may deviate in data from the server. When a user intends to download a new version of Yahoo! Photos, the user must first log in to the new client application with his Yahoo! ID and password so that the Yahoo! server can associate the Yahoo! ID with the historical record. Thus, when a new \u201clogin\u201d event occurs (i.e., when a Yahoo! Photos application attempts to validate itself), the Yahoo! server determines whether the application is \u201cin synchronization,\u201d i.e., the historical record in not synchronized. Upon realizing that the application is not in synchronization or is new, the server then provides the user with a list of the previous photos.","In one implementation, as shown in , when a client logs in to the Yahoo! server to fetch the online album, it knows the state of the \u201ctrigger\u201d (in this case the trigger is the fact that the mobile album is empty ). This \u201ctrigger\u201d results in the server being able to trigger the restoration of the \u201cmemory items\u201d (in this case, for example, the history of mobile album photo downloads ). The user selects the photos to download  and then they are sent to the user in a batch process , thereby saving the trouble of having to individually select and download each one separately.","Rather than having the user select the items from the historical record to be restored, these items can be provisioned to the application automatically once the user logs in to the new application. Specifically, when the user logs in after re-downloading the client Yahoo! Photos application, the Yahoo! ID and password are validated by the Yahoo! server. Because the specific Yahoo! ID shows up as having used the Yahoo! Photos application before, the Yahoo! server pulls the photos and re-sends them to the mobile device without any further interaction (steps , ). The re-downloaded client Yahoo! photos application starts to retrieve the historical record and it continues to retrieve photos until the Yahoo! server has no more photos on its list and\/or the mobile device memory is full. In the second case, the client Yahoo! photos simply stops the sequence of requesting the photos.","Where the Yahoo! server, rather than the carrier (e.g., AT&T Wireless), hosts the new application for re-load, the Yahoo! server pre-populates  the historical record in the JAR file prior to its delivery to the user. This is possible because the Yahoo! server knows the Yahoo! ID for the user who is logged in and can associate the Yahoo! ID with the user's backup. In this case, the user's mobile album can be pre-populated with additional photos or any other personalization and\/or preference up to the maximum size of the file allowed by the carrier's systems.","As shown in , which illustrates the backup and restore system configuration, the system contains modules that reside in the client-side application as well as in the server handlers. The device storage mirror database  maintains the backup of client-side application data (i.e., memory items, historical record). This database is indexed based on user IDs. Synchronization is done at two different levels, transaction level and upload level.","At the transaction-level Synchronization, in the mobile device (i.e., the client ), a transaction listener  monitors transactions and record these transactions in the transaction log . For any client request  (e.g., downloading a photo or any other recordable action) that is going to the server , the crumb sticker  attaches the transaction with a crumb. The crumb is simply a string that represents transactions occurring at the client. On the server side , the application request handler  separates the crumb from the request and passes it to the transaction synchronizer . The transaction synchronizer modifies the device storage mirror database  according to the transactions it receives.","At the upload synchronization level, the client  can initiate a batch job request to upload the current client data to the application server . The upload handler  processes the data (historical record) and saves it in the database record at the device storage mirror database .","One navigation feature of the Yahoo! Photos that benefits from the aforementioned backup and restore of history records is the back functionality, particularly the back in sequence functionality. As to navigating through the pages on the mobile phone, the pages can be traversed forward as described above and they can be traversed backwards using the \u201cback button\u201d feature.  provides a simplified diagram to illustrate the \u201cback button\u201d feature.","As can be seen, the \u201cback a level\u201d mode allows hierarchical backwards sequence traversal one level each time the \u2018back\u2019 button is touch activated or clicked (hereafter \u201cclicked\u201d). The \u201cback in sequence\u201d mode allows sequential backwards one page each time the \u2018back\u2019 button is pressed. For example, in back a level mode, back a level takes the application from a photo page (e.g., ) one level up to the list of photos page (); and from there one more level up to the list of albums page () and one more level up to the home page (). As can be further seen in this example, the back in sequence mode functions to take the application from the current photo page () to the former photo page (), rather than up one level (), when the back button is touched. Additional activations of the back button will traverse through all the pages in reverse sequence.","It makes no difference if the \u201cback button\u201d feature is used while in the online album or mobile album part of the application. The principles apply equally well to both situations. Either way, the steps (pages traversed) are remembered, and they can be recorded server side, locally, or both on the server side and locally.","In view of the above, the backup and restore functionality allows backup of a historical record with memory items related to a client-side application running on the mobile device. This functionality allows restoration of the historical record for the client-side application, or a new version thereof, when re-downloaded to the mobile device. Backup and restore reduces the navigation required for restoring the historical record and in some cases, such as back in sequence, it enables preservation and restoration of memory items that otherwise would be lost and have to be recreated.","Implementation Details","Additional implementation details associated with the foregoing description are provided below.
