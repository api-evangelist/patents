In 1980, smallpox became the only known human infectious disease to have been completely eradicated through a vaccination campaign conducted by the World Health Organization. However, illicit and surreptitious stocks of the virus pose a bioterrorism threat to the current population (Longini, et al. 2007, 11, 98-108), the vast majority of whom have never been vaccinated due to its general discontinuance since 1980. In addition, the vaccine is contraindicated for the immune compromised segment of the population that has expanded in more recent times with the advent of AIDS and transplant recipients. In the event of a smallpox outbreak, the timing required to develop immunity by vaccination might not be sufficient for a large portion of the population. Therefore, effective therapeutics are needed to safeguard the largely immunologically na\u00efve human population by providing immediate protection.","In one aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula (I):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"43.94mm","wi":"62.31mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{}},"R, R, R, R, R, R, R, R, and R are independently selected from the group consisting of H, C-Calkyl, halo, cyano, nitro, C-Chaloalkyl, OR, SR, NRR, NRCOR, SOR, SOR, COR, COOR, aryl, heteroaryl, C-Ccycloalkyl, 3-7 membered heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, and heteroarylalkyl;","Rand Rare each independently selected from the group consisting of H, Calkyl, Chaloalkyl, C-Calkenyl, C-Calkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, and heteroarylalkyl;","Rand Rare independently selected from the group consisting of H, C-Calkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, and heteroarylalkyl;

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.), unless otherwise noted, and used without further purification. African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (BSC-1) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (growth medium), 50 \u03bcg\/mL gentamicin in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0 C. and 5% CO. Cells were not used beyond 10 passages. Vaccinia virus (WR strain) was a kind gift from G. H. Cohen and R. Eisenberg. Recombinant VACV (vL1Ri) was obtained from B. Moss.vL1Ri, under the control of the T7 promoter and lac operator, was propagated in growth medium containing 50 \u03bcM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Compounds were prepared at 100 mM stocks in DMSO. \u03b2-actin (mouse, monoclonal) antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A4 (rabbit, polyclonal) antibody was a kind gift from G. H. Cohen and R. Eisenberg. E3 (mouse, monoclonal) was generously given by S. N. Isaacs. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, and ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, N.Y.). Mouse anti-BrdU was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, Mass.).","De Novo Protein Prediction and Molecular Docking.","A20NT100 was obtained through Rosetta de novo structure prediction (Bonneau, et al. 2002, 322, 65-78). D4 was uploaded as a modified version of an X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB accession no. 2OWQ) inserted with missing amino acids from R167 to P173, which corresponded to an unresolved loop (Schormann, et al. 2007, 7, 45). This prevented a false pocket as the result of the missing residues in the crystal structure. PDB files of A20NT100 and D4 were uploaded to the ICM-Pro software (Molsoft LLC, San Diego, Calif.) for protein-protein molecular docking (Abagyan, et al. 1994, 15, 488-506). The D4 structure was removed of ligands and cofactors, while A20NT100 was subjected to regularization to ensure global energy minimization. Both structures were then converted to ICM objects and docked. The protein conformation of A20NT100-D4 dimer complex to be used as receptor for subsequent compound docking was chosen through the aid of FTMAP (Brenke, et al. 2009, 25, 621-627). The probe set consisted of acetamide, acetonitrile, acetone, acetaldehyde, methylamine, benzaldehyde, benzene, isobutanol, cyclohexane, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl ether, ethanol, ethane, phenol, isopropanol, and urea. Through FTPMAP, A20NT100 and D4 were individually identified of low molecular weight ligand binding sites (Brenke, et al. 2009, 25, 621-627). The sites of ligand clustering, therefore, are identified as hot spots for protein-protein interaction. The docked A20NT100-D4 conformation chosen, thus, contained hot spots within the protein-protein interface to serve as targets for compound design. Compounds were drawn by Symyx Draw 4.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.) and uploaded to ICM-Pro, where they were parameterized for the docking procedure. Docking \u201cthoroughness\u201d was set at 10.","Viral Plaque Reduction Assay and Cytotoxicity.","Experiments were performed as previously described (Nuth, et al. 2011, 54, 3260-7) in triplicates and independently repeated at least twice for the assessment of antiviral activity (IC) and cytotoxicity (CC).

One or 100 \u03bcM compound 24a or CDV, respectively, was added to cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C., followed by the addition of vL1Ri at 5 MOI for 1 h at 25\u00b0 C. Cells were further incubated at 37\u00b0 C. for an additional 8 h prior to microscopy. DMSO was maintained at 1% for all experiments. Live cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, N.Y.). At least five random fields of view were imaged for each treatment, and experiments were independently repeated.

The test compounds were added to a final concentration of 20 nM and incubated at 37\u00b0 C. Infection time points were obtained by removing the media, lysing and scraping the cells into pre-cooled tubes. Total RNA from the samples were isolated using RNeasy mini RNA kit from Qiagen and quantified by measuring the absorbance on Nanodrop (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington Del.). Equal aliquot volumes of each sample were reverse transcribed according to Superscript first strand DNA synthesis system (Invitrogen) protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using LightCycler DNA Master Sybr Green from Roche, and primers designed to probe for early E3, late F9 viral genes and host GAPDH mRNA expression.

A DNA standard calibration curve was plotted using known concentrations of standard cDNA and primers.","Methyl placement on the indolic benzene at the R, R, or Rposition yielded the constitution isomers 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively, with comparable antiviral activities (IC=46-86 \u03bcM) and binding efficiency indices (BEI=12.8-13.0) to 1. The ethyl-substituted 1h and the dimethyl product 1j showed similar profiles. Halide replacement at the Rmethyl did not afford significant activity improvement to the isosteres 1e, 1f, and 1g (IC=40-51 \u03bcM) over the parent 1 (Table 1). In contrast, the esterification of the Rmethyl or the complete removal of the methyl group yielded the loss of activity to 1i or 1d, respectively. In sum, these observations indicate, while substitution at the indolic benzene is necessary for function, none of the altered substitution was able to substantially increase inhibition over 1.","The potential contribution by the Rmodification on the indolic pyrrole was examined (Table 1). Since there appeared to be no preference for the site of methyl placement on the indolic benzene, the Rmethyl-substituted analogs for consistency were chosen to focus on. Test compounds 2 (R=Me) and 3 (R=Et) represent the acid forms at the pyrrolic Rposition, while 4 (R=Me) and 5 (R=Et) are representative methyl esters (Table 1). The Rethyl analogs 3 and 5 showed a modest 1.5 and 4-fold improvement in activity (IC=86 and 39 \u03bcM) over the corresponding Rmethyl analogs 2 and 4 (IC=135 and 163 \u03bcM), respectively, suggesting a potential contribution from the Rposition. However, removal of the Rfunctional group led to a more active 6 (R\u2550H, R\u2550COMe, IC=19 \u03bcM), implying the Ras a better design route than the Rposition. This is further supported by a modest 2-fold improvement in activity of 5 (R=Et, R\u2550COMe) over 3 (R=Et, R\u2550COH) (Table 1). To test whether further improvement could indeed be achieved through the Rmodification, straight chain (COMe and COEt), branched (COPr), and aromatic (COPh and COBn) esters were generated. While 10-17 were no longer active, the methyl esters 8 and 9 exhibited comparable activities (IC=23 and 21 \u03bcM, respectively) to 6 (Table 1), and constitutional isomer of 6, 8, and 9, compound 7 (R=Me) failed to show activity. The observation shown for 6, 8, and 9, nonetheless, reinforces the Rposition as an important site for compound improvement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0397","num":"0396"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE

F and CFappear to be interchangeable with the parental Cl, the chloro analogs exclusively was chosen to focus on, largely due to the lack of improvement with either For CF. As such, the potential to improve activity with increasing number of chloride atoms was interrogated by examining dichloro (Table 3) and trichloro analogs (Table 4). The dichloro compounds 20, 21, 22, and 24 represent constitutional isomers containing the Rposition acid that differ in the indole methyl and thiophenyl chloride attachment, while 30, 30a, and 30b are comparable trichloro constitutional isomers only differing in methyl placement on the indolic benzene. Analogs 30, 30a, and 30b shared similar potency (IC=25, 21, and 18 \u03bcM, respectively) and cytotoxicity (CC=78, 93, and 65 \u03bcM, respectively) profiles (Table 4). Alternatively, the dichloro analogs 20, 21, 22, and 24 showed approximately 2-11-fold activity improvement (IC=7-37 \u03bcM) over the parent 1 (Table 3), thereby prompting to proceed optimization with the dichloro analogs instead of the trichloro substituents. Specifically, chloro substitutions at the R and Rpositions appeared responsible for the improved activity of 24 (IC=7 \u03bcM) over 20-22 (IC=34-37 \u03bcM), which contain chlorides at the R and R positions (Table 3). Next, the contribution from the Rposition of 24 to compound activity was examined. This was accomplished by the removal or ethyl replacement of the Rmethyl to yield 26 or 25, respectively. While 25 showed comparable activity (IC=9 \u03bcM) to 24, \u02dc6-fold decrease in activity (IC=43 \u03bcM) was observed for 26 (Table 3), thereby suggesting the contribution of activity from the Rposition. In comparison to 24, both 25 and 26 resulted in slightly lower BEI values (14.6 vs. 13.8 and 12.9, respectively), indicating the Rmethyl to be the preferred route. Moreover, since the requirement of the Rposition for compound function was observed, it was tested whether modification at this position could lead to further improvement, as based on the chemical scaffold of 24. To assess this, the amide analog 28 (R\u2550CONHMe) was generated, but resulted in the loss of activity (Table 3). Next, a methyl ester 27 was generated, that also led to the loss of activity (Table 3). This was surprising since 27 is the dichloro form of 6, which showed an IC=19 \u03bcM (Table 1). Experimentally, an increase in cytotoxicity was observed, which may be responsible for the inability to determine an accurate ICvalue. To address whether the chlorides could indeed contribute to cytotoxicity, both thiophenyl chlorides were removed from the scaffold of 24 to generate the methyl ester 29. Within experimental errors, the potency (IC=10 \u03bcM) and cytotoxicity (CC=26 \u03bcM) profiles were observed to be comparable to 24 (Table 3). Taken together, an internal amide at the Rposition does not appear to be tolerated, while compound improvement is not supported by the additional chloride. In agreement, the monochloro 6 and dichloro 24 showed similar BEI values (14.5 vs. 14.6, respectively). Moreover, no increase in cytotoxicity is observed with the additional chloride. So with respect to the loss of activity observed for 27, there might be an imparting of electronic properties of the chlorides onto the Rester as to render the compound less active. In proceeding with compound design, 29 (BEI=16.8), along with 6 and 24, serve as desirable scaffolds.","In an attempt to select a compound amenable for further improvement, the binding efficiency index (BEI) as a useful index was considered. Proposed by Abad-Zapatero and Metz (Abad-Zapatero, et al. 2005, 10, 464-469), the BEI (pIC\/MW) serves as a useful metric for compound optimization. With BEI values of 14.5, 14.6, and 16.8, compounds 6, 24 and 29 represent the highest ranked compounds, respectively, among the 57 analogs synthesized. Since the pICterm in the BEI calculation corresponds to antiviral activity, these three compounds, therefore, reflect leads with high potency. Notably, all three compounds exhibited comparable cytotoxicity profiles. In the current study, compound 24 was chosen to develop mainly due to the apparent increase in compound solubility as the result of the introduced chlorides, since many of these indole analogs tend to exhibit poor solubility as to become problematic for in vitro experiments.","While A20 has been recently shown to play a critical role in processive DNA synthesis of vaccinia virus (Klemperer, et al. 2001, 75, 12298-12307; Stanitsa, et al. 2006, 281, 3439-3451; and Druck Shudofsky, et al. 2010, 84, 12325-12335), there is a lack of biochemical and structural information. Moreover, the problems associated with A20 protein expression remains elusive. Since standard sequence homology-based structure design proved unsuccessful, a de novo approach was undertaken by way of the Rosetta procedure, which allows for the prediction of low energy global conformations built from energy minimized ensemble of local structure fragments (Bonneau, et al. 2002, 322, 65-78; Bonneau, et al. 2001, 43, 1-11; and Simons, et al. 1999, 34, 82-95).","The increasing length of A20 (starting from the N-terminus) was examined for protein fold. Peptides consisting of 25, 50, and 100 amino acids were superimposable (). The N-terminal 100-amino acid peptide of A20 (hereafter referred to as A20NT100) was chosen to focus on largely due to the inclusion of residues shown necessary for D4 binding (Ishii, et al. 2002, 303, 232-239). In addition, the protein fold, consisting of three peripheral helices and a potential core made up of three O-sheets (), appears contiguous and undisruptive (). Increased chain length led to increasing loss of superimposition of structures, as well as the failure of the prediction by the Rosetta procedure (data not shown). A20NT100 was next docked with the crystallographic form of D4 (Schormann, et al. 2007, 7, 45). The choice of docked pose was aided with the help of FTMAP, a computational fragment-based approach that uses a fast Fourier transform correlation technique to identify low molecular weight ligand binding sites (Brenke, et al. 2009, 25, 621-627. Thus, hot spots represent regions where the ligands cluster and are potential druggable sites. A20NT100 and D4 were individually subjected to FTMAP, and the conformation of the heterodimer chosen was the highest ranked pose identified by ICM-Pro (\u221240.3 kcal molbinding energy) which bears two hot spots on the A20N100 surface and one on the D4 surface at the protein-protein interface (). The interface is brought about largely through contacts of the C-terminal region of D4, encompassing residues 159-204, with the middle region of A20NT100, consisting mainly of residues of helix 2 ( and Table 6). The docked protein complex served as receptor for subsequent interrogation of compound binding.","The docking of Compound 1 and analog 24 to the A20NT100-D4 heterodimer was localized to a newly formed pocket nearby the opening of the heterodimer interface with residues P68 of A20NT100 and R193 of D4 within proximity (). Both compounds are superimposable, with the thiophenyl ring seemingly solvent exposed and exhibiting favorable docking scores of \u221250.0 and \u221246.6 kcal\/mol for 1 and 24, respectively ( and Table 7). Due to the importance of the pyrrolic Rposition for compound activity, the Rposition formate of 24 was replaced with a propanamide, producing 24a (Scheme 1). Significantly, in a viral plaque reduction assay, 24a exhibited a dramatic improvement in antiviral activity (IC=42 nM) (Table 4). The docking of 24a yielded a pose similar to 1 and 24, but with an improved score of \u221262.8 kcal\/mol. Since the docking procedure assumes a rigid body receptor, it is unlikely the score reflects the ability of the propanamide extension to disrupt the protein-protein interface. Nevertheless, the pose suggests the proximity of the terminal amide to residues P68 of A20NT100 and R193 of D4.","Unlike early VACV genes, expression of late genes is dependent upon viral DNA synthesis. Since A20 and D4 are critical components of the DNA replication machinery, the ability of 24a to inhibit late viral gene expression was tested by using a recombinant VACV (vL1Ri)that encodes the EGFP marker under the control of a synthetic early\/late promoter. Indeed, 24a (at 1 \u03bcM) significantly reduced EGFP expression at 8 h post-infection (hpi), a time at which the EGFP signal is normally amplified due to the increase in viral DNA replication (). In comparison, the chain terminator, cidofovir (CDV), was equally effective at a higher dose (100 \u03bcM). Notably, a lowered cytophathic effect (CPE) was observed for 24a treatment, compared to either vehicle or CDV treatments.","To further assess the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis by 24a, the levels of actual early and late vaccinia virus marker proteins were compared. First the response to 24a was examined by the early protein encoded by the E3L gene, which is an inhibitor of dsRNA-binding in immune evasion (Chang, et al. 1992, 89, 4825-4829). The E3 protein was detectable at 4 hpi (an early time point), with further accumulation at 8 and 12 hpi (late time points) (). Only a slight decrease in protein level was observed following treatment with 1 \u03bcM of compound 24a at 8 hpi (). As a marker of late gene expression, the product of the A4L gene was examined, which is present in the viral core (Maa, et al. 1987, 61, 3910-3919) and is associated with morphogenesis (Risco, et al. 1999, 265, 375-386). As seen in , at a late time-point of infection (12 hpi), the levels of A4 protein in 24a treated cells were dramatically reduced in a dose-dependent manner (). These experiments clearly demonstrate that 24a prevents late gene expression, while exhibiting minimal effects on early gene expression, which is consistent with its ability to block viral DNA synthesis.","Poxviruses are unusual in that they replicate in the cytoplasm, where they are visualized as focal sites of DNA replication, often referred to as viral factories. In order to to directly examine the effect of 24a on viral replication, its ability to prevent incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into viral DNA was examined. As seen in , BrdU labeling was localized to viral factories in untreated treated cell, but was significantly suppressed in infected cells treated with 24a. This preclusion of BrdU incorporation by 24a is consistent with the ability of this analog to block viral DNA synthesis and replication.","The docked pose of 24a suggests the potential interaction of the propanamide with the nearby residues P68 of A20NT100 and R193 of D4 (Scheme 1, inset). Since 24 is an acid at the pyloric Rposition, it was hypothesized that, in addition to the potential contribution of the propanamide extension of 24a in comparison to the formate of 24, the improvement in activity may be due to the H-bond donating and accepting properties of the terminal amide. As such, it was reasoned that the stabilization of 24a might be achieved through newly formed H-bond pairing. To explore this possibility, the propanoic acid precursor 24d was synthesized and examined for antiviral activity (Scheme 1). An approximate 5-fold decrease in potency (IC=244 nM) by 24d indicates that the terminal amide is preferred (Table 5), whereby weaker charge and\/or van der Waals contributions may compensate for the loss of the amide nitrogen. Since H-bond requires distant constraint, compound 24a was shortened or lengthened by a methylene to generate the alkylamide analogs 24b or 24c, respectively (Scheme 2). While the butanamide analog 24c showed \u02dc5-fold loss of activity (IC=208 nM), the acetamide analog 24b retained an activity (IC=46 nM) comparable to 24a. Compound 24b (BEI=20.1) represents an improvement of 5.4 units over the parent 1 (BEI=14.7) (Table 5). Since the BEI contains a logarithmic term, this represents several orders of magnitude improvement of the design. Lastly, compound 24e, the N-hexylation product of 24a (Scheme 1), showed a complete loss of activity (Table 5). Taken together, the hypothesis of a mechanism by which H-bond contributes to the improvement of compound activity is supported. However, a small set of analogs is limited and therefore cannot rule out other potential chemical contributions. In addition, applying similar Rposition alkylamide modifications to scaffold 29 was to be tested to see if similar improvements are achieved. With a BEI value of 16.8, it represents an attractive starting point. Also, with respect to cytotoxicity, 24a and 24b represent the top two compounds with the highest selectivity indices (SI=374 and 570, respectively). As such, it was assessed whether improvement to cytotoxicity by 24a and 24b could be achieved by removal of the chlorides similarly to 29.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0412","num":"0411"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"266pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 5"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Structure-activity relationships of compound 24 analogs"},{"entry":{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00031","num":"00031"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00031","he":"30.48mm","wi":"41.99mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00031.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}}},{"entry":{}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"133pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["cmpd","R","IC(nM)","CC(\u03bcM)","BEI","SI"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["24",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00032","num":"00032"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00032","he":"11.43mm","wi":"11.18mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00032.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"7000 \u00b1 1460","75","14.7","\u200211"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["24a",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00033","num":"00033"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00033","he":"10.84mm","wi":"20.57mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00033.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"42 \u00b1 16","16 \u00b1 5","19.5","374"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["24b",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00034","num":"00034"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00034","he":"10.84mm","wi":"15.66mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00034.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"46 \u00b1 10","26 \u00b1 3","20.1","570"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["24c",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00035","num":"00035"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00035","he":"10.84mm","wi":"25.48mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00035.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"208 \u00b1 42\u2002","243 \u00b1 2\u2002","17.0","115"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["24d",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00036","num":"00036"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00036","he":"10.24mm","wi":"20.57mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00036.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"244 \u00b1 27\u2002","\u200236 \u00b1 14","17.4","152"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["24e",{"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00037","num":"00037"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00037","he":"12.28mm","wi":"44.11mm","file":"US09233921-20160112-C00037.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"table","img-format":"tif"}}}},"NA","27 \u00b1 4","nd","nd"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00006"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"left","id":"FOO-00007"},"sup":"b","sub":["50","50"]}}]}}]}}},"The structure of the N-terminal 100 amino acid stretch was designed de novo by way of the Rosetta procedure.
