title: User interface indirect interaction
abstract: One or more techniques and/or systems are provided for utilizing input data received from an indirect interaction device (e.g., mouse, touchpad, etc.) to launch, engage, and/or close, etc. an object within a user interface. For example, a sensory surface of the indirect interaction device may be divided into two (or more) portions, a first portion utilized to launch, engage, and/or close an object and a second portion utilized to navigate (e.g., a cursor) within the user interface. When an object is launched based upon receipt of a predefined gesture(s), the first portion of the sensory surface may be mapped to the object to provide for interaction with the object via an interaction between a contact (e.g., finger) and the first portion. Also, the surface area of the first portion may be altered (e.g., enlarged) when it is mapped to the object and/or according to operations performed on the object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Conventionally, users interact with elements of a user interface using a variety of input devices. Generally, these input devices can be classified as direct interaction devices and\/or indirect interaction devices based upon the type of interaction the device has with the user interface. For example, a direct interaction device, such as a touchscreen, is configured to enable a user to interact directly with what is displayed on a monitor, whereas an indirect interaction device, such as a mouse or keyboard, for example, is configured to enable a user to indirectly interact with what is displayed on a monitor.","A mouse and devices that emulate a mouse, such as a touchpad, for example, are some of the more popular types of indirect interaction devices. The user interacts with the device, and the interaction is mapped to a position on the display. For example, a mouse may sense movement, which is mapped to a position based upon a presumed starting position and the sensed interaction with the device. A touchpad is commonly used in a manner similar to a mouse. The motion of a contact (e.g., finger, stylus, etc.) on the touchpad is sensed, and the sensed motion is treated in a manner similar to a mouse input.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques for utilizing a first portion of a sensory surface of an indirect interaction device to perform a first task while a second portion of the sensory surface is utilized to perform a different task are provided. As an example, a first portion of a sensory surface may be utilized to open and\/or close an object (e.g., a menu, on-screen keyboard, etc.) on a user interface of a computer system and\/or to transition between objects on the user interface while another portion of the sensory surface may be utilized to navigate within the user interface. When a contact (e.g., a finger, stylus, etc.) is applied in a predefined manner (e.g., makes a particular gesture\/movement and\/or is applied with a specified amount of pressure, etc.), relative to the first portion of the sensory surface, a task that has been associated with the gesture may be initiated.","In one embodiment, when an object is opened\/launched via input from the indirect interaction device, the two or more portions of the sensory surface may be mapped to different regions of the user interface. For example, the first portion of the sensory surface may be mapped to the launched object (e.g., or a portion of the launched object) while the second portion is mapped to the user interface more generally (e.g., so that a pointer can navigate within the user interface). Because the first portion is mapped to the object and the second portion is mapped to the user interface more generally (e.g., and includes the object), in one example, the second portion may be mapped to (e.g., overlap) a portion of the user interface that the first portion is also mapped to. For example, at least some of the second portion may be mapped to the object that the first portion is mapped to. In another embodiment, the first and second portions of the sensory surface may be mapped to different regions of the display (e.g., such that there is no overlap in the mapped regions).","In another embodiment, the relative surface areas of the first and second portions may be altered based upon initiated tasks. For example, in one embodiment, the initiation of a task based upon gestures (e.g., manners of movement) applied relative to the first portion of the sensory surface may cause an amount of surface area associated with the first portion to increase or decrease relative to the surface area associated with the second portion. By way of example, when an object is opened in the user interface (e.g., based upon a gesture applied to the sensory surface), the surface area of the first portion may be enlarged, and the enlarged first portion may be mapped to the opened object. Similarly, when an object is closed, the surface area of the first portion may be reduced (e.g., back to its initial size).","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are illustrated in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","Among other things, one or more systems and\/or techniques are provided for utilizing portions of an indirect interaction device to launch objects within a user interface of a computer system and\/or for mapping portions of a sensory surface (e.g., touch-sensitive surface, heat sensitive surface, etc.) of the indirect interaction device to the object (e.g., such that the mapped portion of the sensory surface can be used to manipulate the object). For example, in one embodiment, one or more edge portions of the sensory surface may comprise an area that is sensitive to various predefined gestures (e.g., movement in predefined manner(s)) that may be made by a contact (e.g., finger, stylus, etc.) that is applied relative to the sensory surface. Upon the detection of a predefined gesture, initiated within and\/or comprised within the area, for example, a task corresponding to the predefined gesture may occur. As an example of such a task, a menu of a user interface presented on a display of the computer system may launch, an on-screen keyboard may launch within the user interface, and\/or a portion of the presented user interface may transition between presenting a first application and presenting a second application, for example.","Further, in one embodiment, one or more edge portions may be mapped to an object comprised within the user interface, such as the object (e.g., menu, on-screen keyboard, etc.) that was launched, based upon the detection of the predefined gesture. Thus, a user can manipulate and\/or control the object using the one or more edge portions while navigating within the user interface via a second portion of the sensory surface. In one embodiment, when an edge portion of the sensory surface is mapped to an object, the edge portion of the sensory surface may be enlarged relative to its initial size (e.g., prior to the detection of the gesture). When the edge portion is no longer mapped to the object (e.g., because the object has been hidden in the user interface), its size may be reduced (e.g., back to its initial size) until a second object is launched via the edge portion (e.g., and until the edge portion gets remapped to another object, such as the second object).","While specific reference is made herein to using one or more edge portions of an indirect interaction device to launch objects, transition between applications, and\/or manipulate objects, others portions of the indirect interaction device may be utilized as well or alternatively (e.g., the instant application is not meant to be limited to edge portions). Moreover, it will be appreciated that unless specifically stated otherwise, a single portion of the sensory surface may be utilized for a plurality of functions. For example, the sensory surface may comprise merely a single portion, with the single portion configured to detect predefined gestures (e.g., that may initiate specified tasks) and configured to be utilized to navigate within a user interface.","Further, to the extent the sensory surface is described as comprising a plurality of portions, it will be appreciated that it may be difficult and\/or impossible for a user to visually distinguish between the plurality of portions because such portions may be comprised of substantially the same and\/or similar hardware. Although, in one embodiment, the various portions may be visually distinguishable. For example, LED lighting and\/or other effects may be utilized to assist a user in visually distinguishing between portions (e.g., where a first portion is lit-up differently than a second portion). Also, one or more additional and\/or different types of sensors may be used in conjunction with, to supplement, etc. the sensory surface. For example, extra sensors may be located around the edge of the sensory surface to detect when a gesture begins outside the sensory surface and then enters the sensory surface (e.g., bezel sensors, optical, magnetic, electromagnetic, etc.). Such sensors may, for example, be useful to, among other things, discriminate an edge of the sensory surface from other portions of the sensory surface, to detect a contact (e.g., finger) approaching, departing, etc. the sensory surface, etc. In any of such scenarios, the sensory surface may nevertheless be said to comprise these additional, other, etc. sensors.","It may be appreciated that \u201cindirect interaction\u201d and\/or the like are used in a broad sense herein to describe a form of interaction where an entity (e.g., user) interacts with a device other than a display to cause a user interface on the display to change. For example, a touchpad of a laptop computer may be an example of an indirect interaction device because a user may interact with the touchpad to control a pointer that is presented on the display\/monitor of the laptop. It will also be appreciated that in some applications, a direct interaction device may be utilized as an indirect interaction device. As an example, where a mobile device comprising a touchscreen is utilized as a remote control for controlling a television, the touchscreen of the mobile device may be utilized as an indirect interaction device to manipulate a user interface (e.g., a target, cursor, etc. thereon) that is being displayed on the television, for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","100"]},"It will be appreciated that while the example method  provides for launching, engaging, and hiding an object using an indirect interaction device, one or more of these acts may be performed using techniques other than those described herein. For example, in another embodiment, the object may be hidden and\/or closed automatically after a predetermined amount of time has expired and\/or when another aspect of the user interface is engaged. Thus, the instant disclosure, including the scope of the claims, is not intended to be necessarily limited to including each of the acts described herein. As another example, the second input data that is received at  and indicative of a contact being applied in a second predefined manner relative to a first portion of the sensory surface may be utilized to engage the object and\/or hide the object (e.g., thus the act described with respect to  may be omitted). For example, if the contact is applied in a first manner relative to the first portion of the sensory surface (e.g., the contact is applied with a specified amount of force, the contact makes a particular gesture, etc.), the object may be engaged at . If (e.g., instead of being applied in the first manner) the contact is applied in a second manner relative to the first portion of the sensory surface (e.g., the contact is moved in a predefined manner (e.g., the contact performs a predefined gesture), the contact applies a different amount of force to the sensory surface, etc.), the object may be hidden at  (e.g., bypassing the acts described at  and\/or ). Thus, the example method is intended to illustrate merely one example method, and a method that is actually implemented in an application may comprise additional actions that may not be described herein and\/or the method described herein may comprise additional actions that may not be performed in one or more applications (e.g., acts such as ,  and\/or  (or others) may be omitted depending upon the application, implementation, configuration, etc.). Moreover, the event that occurs (e.g., whether the object is launched, engaged, and\/or hidden) when input data is received may be a function of how a contact is applied relative to the sensory surface. Thus, the example method is not intended to be interpreted as necessarily describing a flow of events (e.g., because input data indicative of a gesture that is intended to cause an object to be hidden may be received before input data indicative of a gesture that is intended to cause an object to be engaged).","The example method  begins at , and an indirect interaction device that has been coupled to a computer system is detected at . By way of example, a touchpad may be coupled to the computer system via a wired connection (e.g., universal serial bus (USB), etc.) and\/or a wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth connection, infrared connection, etc.). Moreover, it will be appreciated that the indirect interaction device may be coupled to the computer system at the time the computer system is manufactured, and thus the indirect interaction device may be detected upon the initial boot-up of the computer system, for example. Alternatively, the indirect interaction device may be coupled to the computer system by the end-user, for example, and may be detected upon the indirect interaction device being coupled and\/or upon a subsequent reboot, for example.","Upon detection of the indirect interaction device, the computer system and\/or a component thereof may be configured to install drivers that are configured to provide for the transference of data between the indirect interaction device and the computer system and\/or otherwise prepare the computer system for interaction with the indirect interaction device and\/or vice-versa, for example.","The example method  also comprises receiving first input data indicative of a contact being applied in a first predefined manner relative to the sensory surface of the indirect interaction device at . By way of example and not limitation, input data may be received that indicative of a contact moving in a predefined manner (e.g., performing one or more predefined gestures), indicative of a contact applying a particular amount of pressure relative to the sensory surface, etc. It will be appreciated that for purposes of brevity, gesture and\/or the like may be used herein to describe a contact being applied relative to the sensory surface. Use of such a term is not intended to imply a particular type of application, such as movement, but it used more generally to refer to a contact being applied relative to a sensory surface.","As an example, a table or other data structure may comprise a plurality of gestures that have been predefined (e.g., by a user, application developer, computer manufacturer, etc.) to trigger particular tasks\/events within the user interface. For example, such tasks\/events may comprise, among other things, opening an object in a user interface, closing an object, transitioning between applications presented in the user interface, transitioning between objects presented in the user interface, etc. While input data indicative of gestures that have not been predefined may also be received (e.g., by a computer system to which the indirect interaction device is operable coupled), such input data may be utilized for other purposes (e.g., such as for navigating within the user interface (e.g., similar to a mouse pointer navigating within a user interface)).","Predefined gestures may include, among other things, rotating the contact in a particular manner (e.g., clockwise, counter-clockwise, etc.), changing the direction of a contact's movement in a particular manner, beginning and\/or ending the gesture in a particular region\/portion of the sensory surface, applying specified amount of force, touching a particular portion of the sensory surface, beginning the gesture outside of the sensory area but ending inside, beginning the gesture inside of the sensory area but ending outside, etc. As an example, the sensory surface may be divided into two or more portions (e.g., prior to receiving the first input data). A first portion may be utilized to trigger some event in the user interface (e.g., such as initializing a launch of one or more objects and\/or closing an object in the user interface), and a second portion may be utilized for some other function\/purpose, such as to navigate within the displayed user interface, for example. Thus, gestures that occur within, begin within, and\/or end within the first portion of the sensory surface may trigger some event in the user interface, while gestures that occur within, begin within, and\/or end within the second portion of the sensory surface may be utilized to navigate a target (e.g., pointer) within the user interface, for example.","At  in the example method , an object is launched in a user interface in response to receiving the first input data (e.g., at ). That is, when the received input data is indicative of a gesture that corresponds to launching an object, the object may be launched (e.g., opened) in the user interface. Such an object may include, among other things, a menu, an on-screen keyboard, and\/or other user interface feature that was not displayed (e.g., or was not actively displayed (e.g., because it was at least partially obscured)) prior to receiving the first input data, for example. In this way, an indirect interaction device may be utilized to open a menu and\/or on-screen keyboard, for example, that appeared closed (e.g., and\/or otherwise inactive) in the user interface prior to receipt of the first input data, for example.","At  in the example method , at least a first portion of the sensory surface of the indirect interaction device is mapped to the launched\/opened object presented within the user interface (e.g., using absolute mapping, relative mapping, and\/or other mapping techniques). That is, stated differently, at least a portion (e.g., which may comprise all or less than the entire sensory surface) of the sensory surface is mapped to the object. In this way, when a contact is applied to the first portion of the sensory surface, the object may be engaged. By way of example, the object may comprise a menu comprising five selections (e.g., 5 buttons). The first portion of the sensory surface may therefore be divided into five sections, and respective sections may be mapped to one of the five selections, for example. Subsequently, when a contact is applied relative to one or more of the five sections, the one or more selections corresponding to the section(s) to which the contact is applied may be selected and\/or distinguished in the user interface (e.g., by highlighting the selection), for example. It will be appreciated that such a feature may be further illustrated with respect to .","Absolute mapping techniques are generally configured to scale an axis of the indirect interaction device to a corresponding axis of a display and\/or a particular object(s) within the display (e.g., when a portion of the indirect interaction device is merely mapped to an object(s)). For example, an x-axis of the indirect interaction device may be scaled with a corresponding x-axis of the display\/object such that, in the x-direction, respective points on a sensory surface of the indirect interaction device map to merely one point (e.g., or a specific number of points) on the display\/object. Similarly, a y-axis of the indirect interaction device may be scaled with a corresponding y-axis of the display\/object such that, in the y-direction, respective points on the sensory surface of the indirect interaction device map to merely one point (e.g., or a specific number of points) on the display\/object. Conventionally, touchscreens and\/or pen digitizers have utilized absolute mapping techniques.","Relative mapping techniques are different than absolute mapping techniques in that the sensory surface is generally mapped to a moveable subregion of a display\/object (e.g., which may not be shown to a user). That is, the mapping is a function of a present location of a target (e.g., pointer) on the display\/object at the time a contact (e.g., finger) is detected by the sensory surface and may change based upon a change in a location of the target. For example, where the target is centered in an upper right quadrant of the display\/object when a contact is detected, the sensory surface may be mapped such that a center point of the sensory surface corresponds to a location of the target (e.g., causing less than all of the display\/object to be mapped to points on the sensory surface) (e.g., merely the upper right quadrant of the display\/object may be mapped, for example). If no contact is detected by the sensory surface for a period of time, when a contact is again detected, the mapping may be altered such that the position of the target is mapped to a center point of the sensory surface, for example. Conventionally, mice and\/or mice-emulating trackpads have utilized relative mapping techniques.","If at least some of the sensory surface is not mapped to the launched object, the remaining portion (e.g., or at least a portion of the sensory surface that was not mapped to the object at ) may be mapped to the user interface using one or more mapping techniques (e.g., absolute mapping, relative mapping, a combination of absolute and relative mapping, etc.) at  in the example method. Typically, the remaining portion is mapped to portions of the user interface that do not comprise the object (e.g., to which the first portion was mapped at ), although in one embodiment, the second portion may be at least partially mapped to the object. For example, the second portion may be mapped to the entire user interface. Because the object is comprised within the user interface, the second portion may be at least partially mapped to the object (e.g., although at least some of the second portion may be mapped to portions of the user interface that do not comprise the object, unless the object fills the display). In this way, a target (e.g., pointer) may maneuver over the object based at least in part upon input data indicative of a contact applied relative to the second portion, and the object may be engaged based at least in part upon input data indicative of the same and\/or a different contact applied relative to the first portion.","It will be appreciated that by mapping the second portion of the sensory surface to the user interface, the second portion may be utilized to navigate the user interface and\/or perform some other function while the first portion that is mapped to the object may be (concurrently) utilized to engage the object, for example. That is, stated differently, the first portion of the sensory surface (e.g., mapped to the object at ) may be utilized to navigate and\/or engage the object while the second portion of the sensory surface may be (concurrently) utilized to navigate and\/or engage other portions of the user interface and\/or may be utilized to perform some other function (e.g., serve as an enter, select, return, etc. button or key when tapped).","At  in the example method , second input data indicative of a contact being applied in a second predefined manner relative to the first portion of the sensory surface is received, and the object is engaged at  based at least in part upon the second input data. For example, as described above, the object launched\/opened at  may comprise five selections (e.g., five buttons), and the first portion of the sensory surface may be divided into five sections, with respective sections corresponding to one of the five selections. The second input data may be indicative of a contact being applied relative to one or more of those five sections, and based upon the second input data, selections corresponding to the sections to which the contact was applied may be engaged, for example.","It will be appreciated that in the claims and\/or throughout the description, the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used to distinguish between elements. However, such terms are not intended to imply that an object\/feature is unique and\/or to imply a temporal order. For example, a statement may provide for, among other things, receiving first input data indicative of a first contact being applied relative to the sensory surface and receiving second input data indicative of a second contact being applied relative to the sensory surface. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, the first and second contacts may be the same contact and\/or the first contact may be different than the second contact (e.g., such that the first and second contacts are unique contacts).","It will be appreciated that while specific reference is made herein to receiving second input data and\/or using the second input data to engage the object, other input data (e.g., which does not engage the object may also be intermittently received). For example, where the sensory surface comprises first and second portions, input data may also be received indicative of one or more contacts being applied relative to the second portion. Such input data may be utilized to, among other things, navigate a target (e.g., pointer) within the user interface and\/or to engage other aspects\/objects of the user interface, for example.","At  in the example method , third input data indicative of a contact being applied in a third predefined manner relative to the sensory surface of the indirect interaction device is received, and the object is hidden\/closed in response to receiving the third input data at . For example, in one embodiment, an object (e.g., which was launched at ) may be hidden and\/or closed when a contact performs a gesture that is opposite to the gesture that caused the object to launch at , although other types of gestures may cause the object to be hidden (e.g., such that it is at least partially obscured) and\/or closed. By way of example, where an object is launched\/opened based upon a one or more contacts moving away from an edge of the sensory surface, an object may be hidden\/closed by a contact moving toward a same and\/or different edge of the sensory surface. As another example, a contact applied relative to a first edge of the sensory surface may cause an object to launch at  while a contact (e.g., the same contact and\/or a different contact) applied relative to a second edge of the sensory surface may cause the object to be hidden\/closed at .","It will be appreciated that there are numerous gestures that are contemplated that may be applied to a sensory surface of an indirect interaction device to illicit the launch and\/or engagement of an object and\/or to illicit an object to be hidden\/closed. The foregoing gestures and the gestures described below are merely intended to provide examples of some of the virtually countless gestures that can be applied, and the instant disclosure, including the scope of the claims, is not intended to be limited to specific gestures\/movements described herein to the extent practical.","Moreover, while reference has been made throughout the example method to receiving input data indicative of a contact being applied relative to the sensory surface, the input data may also and\/or instead be indicative of a plurality of contacts being applied relative to the sensory surface. Further, in one embodiment, different tasks may occur if input data is indicative of a plurality of contacts as opposed to merely one contact. For example, input data indicative of a gesture that was performed by merely one contact (e.g., one finger) may cause a first object to launch while input data indicative of a similar gesture that was performed with two contacts may cause the first object to be hidden\/closed and\/or may cause a second object, different than the first object, to launch. Further, a contact need not actually \u201ccontact\u201d a sensory surface to be applied relative thereto. For example, a contact may be applied relative to a sensory surface by merely coming close to the sensory surface where the sensory surface is heat sensitive, magnetic, conductive, etc.","The example method  ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-5","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 3","FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 4"],"b":["200","106","100","300","400","300","406","108","100","500","200","502","406","110","100","402","400"]},"As illustrated in  and as further described with respect to the example method  of , in one embodiment, the sensory surface  may be comprised of two or more portions (e.g., which may or may not be visually (and\/or otherwise) distinguishable). For purposes of clarity, in the illustrated embodiment, a first portion  is filled in a darkened grey pattern, while a second portion  is not filled.","Prior to launch of the object (e.g., at  in the example method  of ), the first portion  may comprise a relatively small portion of a total surface area of the sensory surface . For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first portion  consumes merely the top 9 mm of the sensory surface.","When a first contact  (e.g., a finger) is applied relative to the sensory surface , input data indicative of a location where the first contact  is applied and\/or indicative of movement of the first contact  relative to the sensory surface  may be generated by the indirect interaction device (e.g., and received by the computer system at  in the example method  of ). Such input may be used to navigate a target (e.g., pointer) within the user interface and\/or to initiate a task\/event (e.g., such as the launch of an object, for example).","A computer system receiving such input data may comprise a set of predefined gestures, and the input data may be compared to the set of predefined gestures to determine whether the input data is indicative of a gesture that corresponds to a predefined gesture. If the input data is indicative of the first contact  substantially performing one or more of the predefined gestures, the computer system and\/or a portion thereof may initiate a task\/event associated with the predefined gesture that corresponds to gesture indicated by the input data (e.g., such as opening a menu, closing a menu, opening an on-screen keyboard, transitioning between applications presented in the user interface, etc.).","By way of example, the computer system may provide that a menu and\/or on-screen keyboard is to launch if received input data is indicative of a contact being applied to the first portion  of the sensory surface  and being dragged downward (e.g., towards the second portion  of the sensory surface ) as illustrated by the arrow  in . If input data is received indicative of the first contact  performing such a gesture, the computer system and\/or a portion thereof may initiate the event associated with the corresponding predefined gesture (e.g., launch the menu and\/or on-screen keyboard). If input data is received indicative of the first contact  being applied to the first portion , but performing some other gesture, a different event may be initiated and\/or no event may be initiated depending upon whether the gesture corresponds to a predefined gesture in a database of the computer system, for example.","Further, it will be appreciated that if input data is instead and\/or also indicative of the first contact  and\/or another contact being applied to the second portion , the computer system may utilize the input data to perform other functions. For example, in one embodiment, input data indicative of a contact(s) applied to the second portion  may be utilized to navigate a target (e.g., mouse pointer) within the user interface and\/or to engage other objects\/aspects that are presented within the currently displayed user interface (e.g., the second portion may be utilized in a manner similar to the way touchpads are conventionally utilized).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","302","300","206","106","100","302","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["400","300","402","302","106","100","206","202","200","200","406","402","406","406","406","402","404","304","406"]},"As described with respect to act  in the example method  of , at least a portion of the sensory surface may be mapped to the menu  opened in the user interface .

For example, if the contact  is applied to a section of the first portion  that is mapped to item A, item A may be highlighted and\/or otherwise distinguished relative to the other items in the menu . In this way, a user may be aware of what item is being engaged, for example. Also, when a portion of the sensory surface is mapped to an object or portion thereof, a target (e.g., pointer, etc.) may not be needed (e.g., may be omitted because it may be redundant) where the object (e.g., a portion or the entirety thereof) is configured to provide a visual or other indication of a contact being applied to a corresponding portion of the sensory surface.","Portions of the sensory surface  that are not mapped to the menu , for example, may be utilized to perform other functions.

For example, the second portion  of the sensory surface  may be utilized to navigate a target (e.g., mouse pointer) within the application  and\/or may be utilized to engage aspects of the application  (e.g., in a manner similar to a manner in which conventional touchpads would interact with a user interface ).","Moreover, as illustrated by comparing  with , in one embodiment, a surface area of the first portion  and\/or the second portion  of the sensory surface  may be adjusted when an object is launched, hidden, and\/or otherwise manipulated (e.g., based upon input data received from the indirect interaction device). For example, as illustrated in , prior to receiving the first input data indicative of a predefined gesture, the first portion  of the sensory surface  was defined as the top 9 mm of the sensory surface . As illustrated in , after the first input data was received and a menu  was opened based upon the received input data, the first portion  of the sensory surface  was defined as the top 20 mm of the sensory surface . Thus, surface area of the first portion  was enlarged relative to its size prior to receiving the first input data (e.g., as illustrated in ). Similarly, a surface area of the second portion  of the sensory surface  was reduced relative to its size prior receiving the first input data (e.g., as illustrated in ) to accommodate an expansion of the first portion .","It will be appreciated the  are merely intended to provide one example of how an object may be launched and\/or engaged using a sensory surface of an indirect interaction device and is not intended to be interpreted in a limiting manner. For example, in one embodiment, a plurality of edges of a sensory surface may respectively comprise portions for launching\/opening and\/or engaging a launched\/opened object. For example, the top, bottom, left, and\/or right edges of the sensory surface may comprise portions for launching and\/or engaging an object. Moreover, the placement of the object in the user interface and\/or the type of object that is engaged may depend upon, among other things whether a contact engages a left, right, top, or bottom edge of the sensory surface and\/or the type of gesture that is received. For example, in one embodiment, the placement of the object in the user interface may correspond to an edge with which the contact(s) interacted. As an example, if the contact(s) was applied relative to the left edge, the object may be placed on a left edge of the user interface and\/or if the contact(s) was applied relative to the bottom edge, the object may be placed on a bottom edge of the user interface.","It will also be appreciated that while  illustrates less than all of the sensory surface  being mapped to the launched object (e.g., menu  in ), the amount of the sensory surface  that is mapped to the launched object may depend upon, among other things, the type of object that is launched. For example, in one embodiment, an entity (e.g., user, developer, etc.) may define one or more gestures that are configured to launch an on-screen keyboard. Although such a keyboard may not comprise the entire user interface that is presented on the display, it may be desirable to map substantially all of the sensory surface to the keyboard (e.g., to provide sufficient space for a user to select respective keys of the on-screen keyboard using the indirect interaction device). In such an embodiment, little if any of the sensory surface may therefore be utilized to navigate the user interface while the on-screen keyboard is launched (e.g., the first portion  of the sensory surface  may comprise substantially all of the sensory surface , with the second portion  comprising little, if any, of the sensory surface  while the on-screen keyboard is displayed within the user interface).","In one example, when an on-screen keyboard and\/or other object is closed or hidden in the user interface (e.g., based upon received input indicative of another predefined gesture), the portion of the sensory surface that was mapped to the object (e.g.,  in ) may be unmapped. Moreover, where the mapped portion (e.g.,  in ) was enlarged or otherwise adjusted based upon the object (e.g., menu  in ) being launched, the surface area of the portion of the sensory surface that was mapped to the object may be readjusted. For example, in one embodiment, the surface area of the mapped portion may be returned to the size it was prior to the object being enlarged (e.g., reducing the first portion  in  from the top 20 mm of the sensory surface  to merely the top 9 mm as illustrated in ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 5","FIG. 5","FIGS. 6 and 7","FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["606","506","600","500","704","706","404","702","402","700","400"]},"It will be appreciated that while  does not illustrate first and second portions of the sensory surface , in one embodiment, the sensory surface  may comprise first and second (e.g., and\/or other) portions similar to those illustrated in . For example, a left edge of the sensory surface  (e.g., where the contact is being applied) may comprise a thin strip (e.g., 9 mm wide) that is configured to be utilized to determine when to transition between applications. As described in , the remaining surface area of the sensory surface  (e.g., if any) may be utilized to perform some other function (e.g., such as to navigate within the user interface  in  and\/or engage aspects of the user interface ).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["606","604","600","702","702","704","706","602","600","702","704","706"]},"Upon receipt of input data indicative of the u-shaped gesture and\/or other predefined gesture, a corresponding event may be initiated. For example, as illustrated in , receipt of input data indicative of the u-shaped gesture may trigger a computer system to transition (e.g., as represented by an arrow ) the user interface  from displaying merely a first application  to displaying a split screen of the first application  and a second application . In this way, an indirect interaction device may be utilized to transition between applications ,  and\/or other objects that may be presented on a user interface , for example.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8"],"b":["800","804","800","804","802","814","804","802"]},"The example system  comprises an input receiver component  that may be configured to receive input from the indirect interaction device . As an example, the indirect interaction device  (e.g., which may comprise a touch sensitive surface, such as a touchpad, a heat sensitive surface, etc.) may be configured to detect particular types of interactions with a contact (e.g., finger, stylus, etc.) and\/or to translate those interactions into input data. Such input data may provide information regarding (e.g., indicative of), among other things, a location of the contact(s) applied relative to the sensory surface, movement of a contact(s) if one or more contacts are moved relative to the sensory surface, etc., for example.","The example system  also comprises a sensory component . The sensory component , which may comprise hardware and\/or software implemented at least in part via hardware, is configured to cause a sensory surface of the indirect interaction device  to comprise at least first and second portions. That is, stated differently, the sensory component  is configured to cause input data indicative of a contact(s) applied to a first portion of the sensory surface to be treated differently than input data indicative of a contact(s) applied to a second portion of the sensory surface (e.g., in essence causing the sensory surface to be divided into two or more portions respectively configured to serve different functions). For example, in one embodiment, a first portion (e.g.,  in ) of the sensory surface may be configured by the sensory component  to be utilized to alter a user interface in response to detecting one or more predefined gestures performed by a first contact(s) applied relative to the first portion. A second portion (e.g.,  in ) of the sensory surface may be configured to be utilized for some other function. As an example, the second portion may be configured by the sensory component  to be utilized to navigate within the user interface.","By way of example and not limitation, when an indirect interaction device  is coupled to a computer system and\/or sometime thereafter, the sensory component  may be configured to divide a sensory surface of the indirect interaction device  into two or more portions. It will be appreciated that such a division may or may not be known to the indirect interaction device . As an example, when input data is received by the input data component , a determination may be made regarding whether such data is indicative of a contact being applied to a first portion or a second portion, for example, of the sensory surface. In such an embodiment, it may not be necessary and\/or desirable to provide the indirect interaction device  with information regarding the division of the sensory surface into two or more portions. Rather, the division may be utilized during the processing of data received from the indirect interaction device , for example. However, in other embodiments, it may be advantageous to provide information regarding the division of the sensory surface into two or more portions to the indirect interaction device . For example, using such information, the indirect interaction device  may change a visual appearance of the sensory surface, audio interaction(s) with the sensory surface, etc. (e.g., so that a user is aware of such divisions).","It will also be appreciated that while  illustrates the sensory component  as being comprised within the system , in another embodiment, the sensory component  may be comprised within the indirect interaction device . In such an embodiment, the indirect interaction device  may independently (e.g., and\/or with input from the system ) divide the sensory surface of the indirect interaction device  into two or more portions, for example.","Respective portions of the sensory surface are configured to be utilized to perform different functions (e.g., although their functions may overlap). As an example, input data received by the input data component  indicative of an interaction(s) between one or more contacts (e.g., fingers, styli, etc.) and the sensory surface that initiated within, ended within and\/or was comprised within a first portion (e.g., one or more edge portions) of the sensory surface may be utilized to alter the user interface (e.g., open\/close a menu and\/or onscreen-keyboard, to transition between applications and\/or other objects that may be presented within a user interface, and\/or to initiate some other event\/task), for example. Input data received by the input data component  indicative of an interaction(s) between one or more contacts and the sensory surface that initiated within, ended within, and\/or was comprised within a second portion of the sensory surface (e.g., as specified by the sensory component ) may be utilized to navigate and\/or engage objects presented within the user interface, for example.","It will be appreciated that the particular events\/tasks that are triggered by the receipt of input data indicative of a contact(s) interacting with the first portion may be depend upon, among other things, user specifications, developer specifications, manufacturer specifications, etc. As an example, the system  may comprise a database (not shown) comprising one or more predefined gestures (e.g., predefined interactions between the contact(s) and the sensory surface) and an associated event\/tasks to be performed if input data is indicative of one or more of the predefined gestures.","The system  of the example environment  also comprises a processing component  configured to, among other things, process input data received by the input data component . For example, the processing component  may be configured to determine whether the input data is indicative of an interaction that occurred in the first and\/or second portions of the sensory surface. If the interaction occurred in the second portion, the processing component  may be configured to perform the one or more functions of the second portion based at least in part upon the received input data. For example, where the second portion is configured to be utilized to navigate a user interface presented on the display , the processing component  may be configured to maneuver a target (e.g., mouse pointer) about the user interface.","If the interaction at least partially occurred in the first portion, the processing component  may be configured to determine if the input data is indicative of a gesture that is intended to initiate a specified event\/task. As an example, the processing component  may compare the input data to the database comprising information indicative of one or more defined gestures to determine whether the input data is indicative of a gesture that has been predefined. If the input data is indicative of a gesture that has been predefined, the processing component  may identify an event that is associated with the gesture indicated in the input data and perform the identified event. By way of example, the processing component  may be configured to launch one or more objects (e.g., open a menu and\/or an on-screen (e.g., piano) keyboard), transition between two or more objects (e.g., applications) configured to be displayed in the user interface, and\/or close\/hide one or more objects (e.g., closing a menu and\/or on-screen keyboard).","In one embodiment, when an object is launched via an interaction that occurs on the indirect interaction device  (e.g., when input data indicative of a predefined gesture is received), the object may be mapped to at least a portion of the sensory surface via a mapping component  of the example system . For example, in one embodiment, the mapping component  may be configured to map the object to a first portion of the sensory surface (e.g., as defined by the sensory component ) (e.g., as described in more detail with respect to ). In this way, a contact may engage aspects of the launched object via the first portion of the sensory surface, for example.","As described above with respect to , it will be appreciated that when a portion of the sensory surface is mapped to an object, it may be desired to adjust a surface area of one or more portions of the sensory surface to accommodate the mapping. For example, in one embodiment, the first portion may (e.g., prior to the launch\/opening of the object) merely comprise a top 9 mm of the sensory surface. Such a small amount of surface area may make it difficult for a user to interact with aspects of the mapped object via the first portion. Therefore, in one embodiment, the sensory component  may alter the surface area of at least one of the first and second portions when an object that is to be mapped to a portion of the sensory surface is launched. For example, when an object is launched based upon input data indicative of a predefined gesture, the sensory component  may be configured to enlarge the surface area of the first portion while reducing the surface area of the second portion (e.g. so that the total area of the surface remains constant). In this way, the mapping component  may map the object to a larger portion of the sensory surface (e.g., relative to its size prior to the object being opened).","It will be appreciated that when the object that is mapped to a portion of the sensory surface is closed and\/or hidden, the surface area of the first and\/or second portions may be adjusted again by the sensory component , for example. As an example, when an object is closed, the surface area of a portion of the sensory surface that was mapped to the object may be adjusted (e.g., reduced) to its size prior to the launch of the object.","Still another embodiment involves a computer-readable medium comprising processor-executable instructions configured to implement one or more of the techniques presented herein.
