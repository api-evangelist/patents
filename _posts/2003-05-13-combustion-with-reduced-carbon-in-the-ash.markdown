{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/380,717 filed May 15, 2002.","This invention was made with United States Government support under Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC26-00NT40756 awarded by the Department of Energy. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to production of salable ash from combustion of hydrocarbon fuels such as coal.","In combustion of coal in furnaces such as in utility boilers, a large amount of ash is produced from the mineral matters originally contained in coal. The ash content of coal ranges from a few percent to over 30%, but the bulk of bituminous coal used for power generation in the U.S. has ash content within the range of 6 to 20. Ash generated in utility boilers is often sold as raw material for cement manufacture and for other processes. If the residual carbon content in ash is more than several percent, it is not acceptable for cement manufacture due to its color and its impact on the properties of cement. Ash with high carbon content, if no other uses could be found, is land filled at a significant cost.","Another concern with high carbon content in ash is potential increase in slagging and fouling tendency by ash. It has previously been stated that if carbonaceous residues become embedded in the deposits, a locally reducing atmosphere can be created in the deposit which can lead to a significant depression of slag melting point temperatures, especially if the ash is of high iron content.","The residual carbon content in ash is strongly influenced by the combustion conditions as well as the type of coal and mineral matters and the fineness of pulverized coal particles. In general the carbon content in ash increases with decreasing excess air for combustion. On the other hand, NOx emissions decrease significantly with decreasing excess air. Due to the more stringent emissions regulations for NOx, many coal fired combustion systems have been converted to low NOx combustion systems, in which combustion takes place in two stages, a fuel rich first stage where fuel bound nitrogen species are converted to molecular nitrogen and a fuel lean second stage where additional combustion air is mixed to complete combustion. The fuel rich combustion process used in low NOx combustion methods delay the combustion of char and tends to increase carbon content of ash at the furnace exit. Thus low NOx combustion methods tend to cause problems in the quality of ash as a salable by-product.","In combustion of coal, volatile combustion is very rapid and char combustion is slow. The unburned carbon content (UBC) in ash is determined by the slower char combustion step. The rate of carbon burnout depends on the particle size, pore structure, reactivity of char, temperature and partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere, among other things. Rapid mixing of coal and combustion air and more intense combustion with high excess oxygen are effective in reducing UBC. However, these conditions tend to increase NOx emissions sharply. Thus, design compromise is generally made in the burner-boiler design to achieve acceptable UBC while minimizing NOx emissions.","Ultra fine grinding of coal is an effective way of accelerating the char burn out and to reduce UBC. However, the cost of new coal pulverizing machine and the extra energy required for ultra fine grinding often make it uneconomic for most retrofit applications. Post combustion treatment of ash is possible and technologies exist to oxidize the residual carbon in ash in a separate process. However, post combustion treatment is expensive and not widely practiced.","Oxygen enrichment was tried in a test furnace fired with a coal-water slurry for NOx and carbon emission control under unstaged conditions. (W. F. Farmayan, et.al., \u201cNOx and Carbon Emission Control in Coal-Water Slurry Combustion\u201d, Sixth International Symposium on Coal Slurry Combustion and Technology, Orlando, Fla., Jun. 25\u201327, 1984.) Oxygen was injected from four injection tubes (about \u00bc\u2033 ID) around the center fuel pipe. ( of the paper) The amount of oxygen injection was equivalent to oxygen enrichment of combustion air to 22 to 24% O. This paper concluded that the effect of Oenrichment near the burner on carbon burnout was found to be weak, particularly toward the flame tail end. The reason is thought to be that the relatively large unburned particles experience the same oxygen-depleted environment at the flame tail end as would those in a flame without oxygen enrichment. It is expected that more benefit would be gained from the point of view of carbon burnout by injection of Owhere it is needed most, e.g., behind the flame front rather than before.","Comparison of the oxygen injection method and results from this reference to the present invention has to consider the difference in burner configurations and fuel property. Coal water slurries (CWS) typically contain about 30% water and have to be atomized for combustion. The paper concluded that atomization quality of the slurry was the critical variable affecting carbon burn out. Unlike the traditional pulverized coal combustion, CWS must be atomized, and the droplets containing multiple coal particles must vaporize water before coal devolatilization and ignition can take place. Multiple coal particles in a single water droplet may agglomerate to form a larger particle. Thus the results from this reference cannot be applicable directly to pulverized coal combustion.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,874 discloses oxygen enrichment of primary and\/or secondary air in pulverized coal fired burners in order to increase the steam rate of a boiler firing high ash pulverized coal. Although the patent does not teach the effects of oxygen enrichment on UBC,  shows significant increases in furnace temperatures near the burner with 2% oxygen enrichment, but little with 1% oxygen enrichment.","U.S. Pat. No. 4,596,198 discloses oxygen enrichment of primary air in pulverized coal fired burners in order to reduce slag deposition in coal fired utility boilers. The patent teaches 1% to 7% oxygen enrichment, preferably 2 to 5% enrichment, (which as defined in that patent is based on the oxygen addition to the total amount of combustion air) of primary air to reduce slag deposition. Furthermore it states that oxygen enrichment of 1% offers little, if any, benefit in slagging reduction.","O. Marin, et.al., discuss the benefits of oxygen for coal combustion in a paper entitled \u201cOxygen Enrichment in Boiler\u201d (2001 AFRC\/JFRC\/IEA Joint International Combustion Symposium, Kaui, Hi., Sep. 9\u201313, 2001). They proposed injection of oxygen in the over fire air (also described as \u201ctertiary air\u201d in this paper), to reduce unburned carbon in ash, or Loss on Ignition (LOI), without increasing NOx emission. The computer simulation results reported by Marin, et al. compared the baseline air case and an oxygen enriched case with a high velocity, oxygen enriched stream in the tertiary air (also termed over-fire air). According to Marin, et.al., \u201cAn increase of 5% on heat transfer in the combustion chamber, combined with a 7% absolute increase in char burnout are noted.\u201d (page 8)","Broadly stated, the present invention is a method for combusting coal and producing ash which has a reduced carbon content, comprising providing a combustion device, feeding air and a nonaqueous stream of coal through a burner into said device, and combusting the coal in the combustion device, while","feeding oxygen into said coal as the coal emerges from said burner so that said oxygen combusts with said coal in an amount of said oxygen which is less than 20% or even than 25% of the stoichiometric amount required for complete combustion of said coal, wherein the carbon content of the ash generated by said combustion is lower than the carbon content of ash generated by combustion carried out without said oxygen feeding step but under otherwise identical conditions.","One aspect of the present invention, which can be considered a method for retrofitting existing combustion devices, is a method for reducing the carbon content of ash formed by combustion of coal in a combustion device, comprising providing a combustion device that has a primary combustion zone and a burnout zone, feeding air and a nonaqueous stream of coal through a burner into said primary combustion zone and combusting the coal in the primary combustion zone in a flame that contains a fuel-rich zone, while","feeding oxygen into said coal as it emerges from said burner so that said oxygen combusts with said coal in said fuel-rich zone, wherein the amount of oxygen fed is less than 20%, preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than 10%, most preferably less than 5% of: the stoichiometric amount required for complete combustion of said coal and keeps the fuel-rich zone fuel-rich, while reducing the amount of air fed into said fuel-rich zone through said burner by an amount containing within 10% of the amount of oxygen fed into said fuel, wherein the carbon content of the ash generated by said combustion is lower than the carbon content of ash generated by combustion carried out without said oxygen feeding step but under otherwise identical conditions.","Another aspect of the present invention can be considered a method for operating a combustion device, whether retrofitted or constructed new embodying the features of this invention, comprising feeding air and a nonaqueous stream of coal through a burner into said device, and combusting said coal in said device in a flame that has a fuel-rich zone, while feeding oxygen into said coal as it emerges from said burner so that said oxygen combusts with said coal in said fuel-rich zone, wherein the amount of oxygen fed is less than 20%, preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than 10%, most preferably less than 5% of the stoichiometric amount required for complete combustion of said coal and keeps the fuel-rich zone fuel-rich, while feeding air from a source other than said burner into a region within said device outside said fuel-rich zone, in an amount containing sufficient oxygen that the total amount of oxygen fed into said device is at least the stoichiometric amount needed for complete combustion of said coal, wherein the carbon content of the ash generated by said combustion is lower than the carbon content of ash generated by combustion carried out without said oxygen feeding step but under otherwise identical conditions.","Tests by the present inventors have unexpectedly shown significant reduction in unburned carbon in the ash when a small amount of oxygen is injected near the burner toward the coal stream. These results were opposite to the teaching of prior art sources such as W. F. Farmayan, et.al. and O. Marin, et.al. that injection of oxygen in the later stage of combustion was recommended and expected to provide more benefits for reduction in the amount of unburned carbon. These results are also not suggested by the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,495,874 and 4,596,198, particularly in that said patents are directed to reduction of slagging during combustion of coals having ash contents above 5 wt. % with oxygen enrichment of primary or secondary air, whereas the present invention is directed to reduction of the carbon content of ash formed with direct injection of oxygen near the burner toward the coal stream.","The present invention will often provide the additional benefit that combustion carried out as described herein produces a significantly lower amount of nitrogen oxides (\u201cNOx\u201d), that is, oxides of nitrogen such as but not limited to NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, and mixtures thereof.","As used herein the term \u201cstoichiometric ratio\u201d or SR when used in the context of an oxygen-containing stream and a feed stream of material that can be combusted with oxygen in the stream means the ratio of oxygen in the oxygen-containing stream to the total amount of oxygen that would be necessary to convert fully all carbon, sulfur and hydrogen present in the substances comprising the feed stream into carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and water.","As used herein, the term \u201cfuel-rich\u201d means having a stoichiometric ratio less than 1.0.","As used herein, \u201cnonaqueous\u201d means not suspended in, dissolved in, or dispersed in water, and not containing water, except that it does not exclude adsorbed water or water of hydration.","As used herein, the term \u201cprimary combustion zone\u201d means the region within a combustion device immediately adjacent the burner outlets and which is mostly occupied by the flame or flames from the burner or burners.","As used herein, the term \u201cburn out zone\u201d means the region within a combustion device that is between the primary combustion zone and the flue, outside the flame or flames that are in the primary combustion zone, where overfire air is injected and the residual fuels and combustibles from the primary combustion zone are burned with overfire air.","As used herein, the term \u201cprimary combustion air\u201d means air that has already been commingled with fuel as the fuel and this air are fed into a combustion device, e.g. through an orifice of a burner.","As used herein, the term \u201csecondary combustion air\u201d means air that is fed into a combustion device through one or more orifices of a burner, but which has not been commingled with fuel as this air is fed into the combustion device.","A burner that has orifices for secondary air may have additional orifices for feeding air which additional orifices are further from the point of entry of the fuel through the burner than are the orifices for the secondary air. As used herein, the term \u201ctertiary combustion air\u201d means air that is fed into a combustion device through such additional orifices. If a burner also has orifices positioned even further from the point of entry of the fuel than the orifices for the tertiary air, then air fed through such further orifices is termed herein \u201cquaternary combustion air\u201d.","As used herein, the term \u201cover fire air\u201d (or \u201cOFA\u201d) means air which is injected into a combustion device separately from the burner or burners in the combustion device to provide a large fuel rich primary combustion zone and a burnout zone where combustion is completed by mixing OFA with the unburned fuel and the products of partial combustion from the primary combustion zone.","References herein to feeding \u201coxygen\u201d, to the \u201coxygen\u201d that is fed, and other references herein to the use of \u201coxygen\u201d in an analogous context, mean gaseous streams that contain at least 35 vol. % O\u2014Preferably, oxygen is provided as a gaseous stream containing at least 50 vol. % O, more preferably containing at least 80 vol. % O, and even more preferably containing at least 90 vol. % O. It should also be understood that references herein to combustion or reaction involving \u201coxygen\u201d refer to Oitself.","As used herein, the \u201ccarbon content\u201d of ash is the amount of the ash that is either carbon or a chemical compound that contains carbon, e.g. any organic (carbonaceous) compound.","The invention will be described with reference to the Figures, although a description that refers to the Figures is not intended to limit the scope of that which is considered to be the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["1","11"]},"Burner  in an end wall of combustion device  feeds coal, air and oxygen from sources thereof outside the combustion device  into the interior  of combustion device . Burner  is preferably comprised of several concentrically arranged passages, details of which are as shown in , although other constructions to the same effect can be used. The coal with primary combustion air  is fed into combustion device  through annular passage , disposed concentrically around lance  through which oxygen  is fed as described herein. Preferably, the coal is propelled through burner  into the interior  of combustion device , by blowers and impellers of conventional design which conventionally feed pulverized coal with the aid of transport air or primary air.","Secondary combustion air  is fed through swirl vanes  to impart swirling motion into combustion device , preferably through a concentrically arranged space  surrounding the annular space through which the coal is fed. Preferably tertiary combustion air  is fed through swirl vanes.  to impart swirling motion into combustion device , preferably through a concentrically arranged space  surrounding the annular space . Preferably, the oxygen is fed into the interior  of the combustion device separately and spaced apart from the secondary and tertiary combustion air. That is, the oxygen that is fed through burner  in accordance with this invention is not commingled with the combustion air before it is fed into combustion device .","Before a combustion device is retrofitted in accordance with the present invention to reduce the carbon content of the ash, lance  for feeding oxygen is not yet present. Combustion is carried out between the coal and the oxygen in the combustion air, resulting in formation of a flame . In the region of the flame closest to the end of burner , that is, where the coal emerges from the burner, that region of the flame is a fuel-rich zone . The area of the flame around its periphery is relatively lean due to secondary and tertiary air which have not been fully mixed and reacted with coal.","Then, lance  is added. Alternatively, a burner that feeds coal and combustion air is replaced with a burner that performs as shown in .","Preferably, air (known as overfire air) is also fed through opening  into the interior of combustion device , to provide additional oxygen helping to achieve complete combustion of the coal while achieving reduced NOx emissions. The oxygen in the combustion air fed through burner , combined with the oxygen fed at opening , are sufficient to enable complete combustion of the coal, possibly with up to 10 to 20 volume percent excess oxygen over the stoichiometric amount required for the complete combustion of the coal.","Preferably, the combustion air and the coal are fed so as to swirl about a longitudinal axis, thereby improving commingling of air and coal. Swirl can be achieved by known techniques, such as providing swirl vanes  and  before the outlets of the burner which direct the flow of the streams in the desired swirling direction.","The present invention improves, that is, lessens, the retention of carbon in the ash formed upon combustion, by feeding a small amount of oxygen into the entering coal stream as described herein. More specifically, the oxygen (by which is meant a gaseous stream comprising at least 35 vol. % O, preferably at least 50 vol. % O, more preferably at least 80 vol. % O, most preferably at least 90 vol. % O) is fed directly into the coal as it emerges from the burner and enters the interior  of combustion device . Thus, the particles of coal enter the combustion device with transport air (i.e., primary air) and the fuel-rich portion of flame , and mixed with a gaseous atmosphere that comprises at least 35% oxygen.","The oxygen is preferably fed through a lance or similar feed line that can be open at the end that opens into combustion device , or that is closed at the end and has one or more openings in its periphery adjacent that closed end, such that oxygen flows out through those openings directly into the coal entering the combustion device from the burner.","Referring to , a tangentially fired furnace  comprises an array of ports for injecting coal, and ports for injecting combustion air, into the furnace interior. Typically the coal ports and the combustion air ports are arrayed in a vertical row, alternating with each other, as is illustrated in  wherein ports  for injecting coal alternate with ports  for injecting combustion air. The coal combusts in the furnace interior with the combustion air. The furnace is also equipped with overfire air ports .","The present invention is readily adapted to furnaces having this type of construction, for instance by providing a lance  in one or more of the fuel ports for which it has been determined that oxidant needs to be injected so as to reduce the carbon content of the ash that will be produced, and then feeding oxidant in the required amounts through each such lance. Oxygen lances  can also be placed in one or more of the combustion air ports or outside of the air and fuel ports, and oxygen is injected from the lance(s) toward the adjacent coal stream.","The amount of oxygen fed in this manner is preferably sufficient to establish a stoichiometric ratio in the fuel-rich zone of flame  which is less than about 0.85 in order to achieve low NOx emissions as well as to produce ash with a low carbon content. The amount of oxygen fed through line  should be less than 20% or even than 25% of the stoichiometric amount required to the complete combustion of the coal. More preferably, the amount corresponds to less than 15% of the stoichiometric amount required for complete combustion of the coal.","At the same time, the amount of secondary combustion air  and tertiary combustion air fed through burner , into combustion device , need to be decreased by a stoichiometrically equivalent amount corresponding to the amount of oxygen fed via line .","Without intending to be bound by any particular explanation of the unexpected performance of this invention, the performance of the combustion device operated in accordance with this invention is consistent with a mechanism in which injection of oxygen near the coal stream promotes early ignition of the coal stream and significantly enhances the rate and the amount of the volatile yield from coal. Higher volatile yield reduces the amount of char that has to be oxidized in the later stage of combustion. Although the present oxygen injection method does not increase the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere during the slow char burnout stage, as taught by the prior art, the reduction in the amount of char produced during the initial devolatilization and combustion stage is believed to provide an overwhelmingly beneficial impact in reducing the amount of unburned carbon remaining in the ash.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 3","FIG. 3"],"i":["a ","d ","a"],"b":["3","5","31"]},"In , the end of lance  is closed and two or more, preferably two to sixteen, more preferably four to eight nozzles  along the perimeter of the lance near the hot end of the lance are provided for radial oxygen injection. One to four or more nozzles can also be provided in the end of this lance.","In , two or more and preferably two to sixteen, more preferably four to eight nozzles  are provided radially near the closed downstream end of the lance , and two or more, preferably two to sixteen, preferably four to eight nozzles  are provided each of which forms an angle greater than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees to the axis of the direction of flow of oxygen into the lance .","In , two or more and preferably two to eight nozzles  are provided along the perimeter of the lance  near the hot end of lance , each of which forms an angle of 30 to 90 degrees, preferably an angle of 30 to 60 degrees with respect to the reverse of the direction of flow of oxygen into the lance .","In these and other lance embodiments the nozzles through the side of the lance can be arrayed on one or more than one circumference.","The optimal angle of oxygen injection for NOx control depends on the tangential and radial momentum of the surrounding air, the burner port geometry and the nature of the burner airflow pattern near the oxygen lance. Accordingly, for better results in burners having low radial air momentum, the optimal angle is 90\u00b0 or greater from the axis of the burner, whereas obtaining better results in burners having higher radial momentum will generally require the angle to be reduced to avoid mixing the oxygen with the air stream. With highly radial air flow the optimal angle is 15\u00b0 or less (largely axial injection). For those burners that use techniques that create a strong air flow component in the radial direction, such as high swirl with a shallow diverging burner port or air deflectors, oxygen nozzles that are primarily angled in the axial direction (angle of less than 30\u00b0 from the axis) are optimal. For burners in which the air flow is predominantly axial (that is, the radial component of the air flow is small or non-existent) it is preferred to inject the oxygen in the radial direction (angles between 45\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 from the axial flow component).","Practice of the present invention in a manner as described herein that feeds the oxygen so that it combusts with the coal in the fuel-rich zone of the flame provides the advantage of reduced NOx formation along with the benefits of reduced carbon content in the ash.","The details of tests and simulation conditions are provided below.","A low NOx coal-air burner was fired at about 4 MMBtu\/hr in a refractory lined test furnace with internal dimensions of about 3.6 ft wide \u00d73.6 ft high and 41 ft long. A pair of over fire air ports were located at about 10.5 ft inches from the burner exit. The burner is similar to one shown in  and consists of a central round passage and several annular passages for coal, air, oxygen and natural gas streams. The central passage was either used to insert an 1.9\u2033 OD and 1.5\u2033 ID oxygen lance-or blocked to provide a bluff body to enhance gas recirculation for flame stability. Coal and primary air were injected from the first annular passage of 3.068\u2033 OD and 1.9\u2033 ID. The second annular passage (4.026\u2033 OD and 3.5\u2033 ID) was used to inject either natural gas or oxygen. The third (6.065\u2033 OD and 4.5\u2033 ID) and the fourth (7.981\u2033 OD and 6.625\u2033 ID) annular passages were used for secondary and tertiary air flows and were equipped with variable swirl generators to impart swirling flows. The burner is designed to provide an aerodynamically staged combustion condition. The axial velocities of the primary air and secondary air are similar to provide a slow mixing of the secondary air with the coal stream. The tertiary air has a significantly higher velocity than that of the second air. Thus, the secondary air provides a \u201cbuffer\u201d for mixing between the tertiary air and the coal stream. A relatively large fuel rich combustion zone is created along the axis of the burner with relatively gradual mixing of secondary and tertiary air along the length of the furnace.","Oxygen was injected through a round lance located in the axis of the burner. An oxygen nozzle, which has eight \u00bc inch diameter radial holes and four \u00bc inch diameter axial holes at the end of the lance, was used to inject oxygen and to mix with the surrounding annular coal stream.","With no oxygen addition at the burner, the loss on ignition (LOI) of ash samples collected in the furnace near flue port, was slightly over 10 wt. %. Adding oxygen at the burner corresponding to replacement of 10% of the combustion air, loss on ignition was about 7.5 wt. %, representing a reduction by about 25%.","A commercial low NOx coal-air burner, the RSFC\u2122 burner described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,724, was fired at about 24 MMBtu\/hr in a refractory lined test furnace with internal dimensions of about 7.5 ft wide\u00d77.5 high and 34 ft long. One or two opposed pairs of over fire air ports were located at about 26 feet from the burner exit. The burner consists of a central round passage and several annular passages for coal, air, oxygen streams. The central passage was used to insert an 1.9\u2033 OD and 1.5\u2033 ID oxygen lance. Coal and primary air were injected from the first annular passage. The second, third and the fourth annular passages were used for secondary, tertiary, and quaternary air flows and were equipped with variable swirl generators to impart swirling flows. The burner is designed to provide an aerodynamically staged combustion condition. A relatively large fuel rich combustion zone is created along the axis of the burner with relatively gradual mixing of tertiary and quaternary air along the length of the furnace.","Oxygen was injected through a round lance located in the axis of the burner. The oxygen nozzle with eight \u215c inch diameter radial holes and four \u215c inch diameter axial holes was used to inject oxygen and to mix with the adjacent annular coal stream. The amount of oxygen injected ranged form 5 to 10% of the stoichiometric oxygen. When oxygen was injected, the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of air was taken out of the secondary, tertirary and quaternary air streams so as to maintain the same primary combustion zone and overall combustion stoichiometric ratio (SR=1.15). The primary air flow rate was kept constant at about SR=0.20. The over fire air for global combustion staging was injected perpendicular to the axis of the furnace from two to four directly opposed air ports.","The settings of adjustable swirl vanes for secondary, tertiary, and quaternary air flows were optimized to give lowest NOx emissions for air only firing and the same settings were used when oxygen was injected.

Representative data on the effect of both staging and oxygen injection on LOI are shown in . As the burner stoichiometric ratio was reduced from the unstaged condition to approximately 0.92 for the air only firing conditions, the LOI increased significantly. When the burner stoichiometric ratio was further reduced to approximately 0.85 and a small amount oxygen, corresponding to 2 to 8% of the stoichiometric oxygen, was added, the LOI was decreased significantly.

(1% oxygen enrichment is equivalent to about 8% stoichiometric oxygen injection.) Without intending to be bound by any particular explanation of the unexpected performance of this invention, direct injection of oxygen through the burner into the combustion device, without the oxygen having already been mixed with air, near the coal stream, rather than enrichment of air by premixing oxygen with an air stream, is believed to be a critical step.","When oxygen is premixed or mixed rapidly into the coal transport stream (i.e., primary air stream) using 20% of stoichiometric air and the overall combustion stoichiometric ratio is kept constant at 1.15 by reducing the stoichiometrically equivalent amount of air from secondary or tertiary air(*), the following concentrations of oxygen in the transport air stream and in the overall combustion air are calculated.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["% of",{},"Avg.

Furthermore, mixing of oxygen into the coal transport air increases the risk of premature ignition of coal particles within the coal pipe and raises a safety concern. A preferred method is to inject oxygen into the coal\/primary air stream at the tip of the nozzle. In this case some of the coal particles are mixed with oxygen jets and locally create zones of coal high Omixture. Such conditions may provide zones of rapid ignition sources and facilitate early ignition and devolatilization as compared to the case oxygen is premixed with the transport air stream.","Another preferred method is to inject oxygen from the inner or outer annular space adjacent to the coal stream. In this case the favorable oxygen rich combustion condition is provided at the boundary of the coal and oxygen streams.","When oxygen is injected separately at high velocity parallel to the fuel stream, as was the case for Farmayan, et al., the oxygen jet(s) may be diluted quickly with surrounding gases and its effectiveness may be retarded. Thus, the method of oxygen injection has to be carefully designed.","Another potential method for the proposed invention is to preheat the incoming oxygen. The preheated oxygen, with temperatures up to 1600\u00b0\u20131800\u00b0 F., will increase the temperature of the fuel rich zone, enhance combustion in this zone, and increase volatile yield. Material issues for process piping will limit the upper temperature.","While the present invention has been described with principal reference to wall-fired boilers such as the type illustrated in , this description is not intended to suggest that the invention is limited in applicability to that type of combustion system. Instead, the invention is applicable to other systems wherein fuel and air are combusted, including without limitation the tangentially-fired systems of the type described with respect to , and combustion systems is known in the art as \u201ccyclone\u201d furnaces, wherein the primary combustion zone of the furnace includes one or more enclosures each having a cylindrical wall, a closed end wall, and an open end that opens into the main chamber of the furnace through a wall of the furnace, wherein fuel, combustion air and oxidant (fed in the amounts as taught herein into the fuel) are fed through the cylindrical wall and the end wall into the enclosure in a direction such that they rotate around the central axis of rotation of the enclosure and combust to form a flame and heat of combustion which are emitted through the open end into the main chamber of the furnace.","Other types of burners can be employed in addition to those exemplified herein, such as so-called split-stream burners wherein the stream of fuel is split into a plurality of streams separated from each other, and even diverging from each other, as the fuel enters the combustion chamber. With this type of burner, the oxygen is fed from a corresponding plurality of lances into each stream of fuel, or from a lance with a plurality of nozzles oriented toward each stream of fuel, and the stoichiometric requirements of oxygen are based on the total amounts of fuel and oxygen being fed."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION","EXAMPLE 1","EXAMPLE 2","EXAMPLE 3"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","i":["a","d "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7C"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
