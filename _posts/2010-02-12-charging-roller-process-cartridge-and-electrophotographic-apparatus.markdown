Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a charging roller which charges a subject to be charged by a contact charging method, a process cartridge, and an electrophotographic apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2007-127777 discloses a charging roller having a surface layer containing resin particles which are formed of a resin in which a carbon black is dispersed (hereinafter, also, referred to as \u201cCB-dispersed resin particles\u201d).","The present inventors have studied, based on the conventional technique, a charging roller having a surface layer which contains CB-dispersed resin particles and has, on its surface, convex portions derived from the CB-dispersed resin particles. As a result, the present inventors have found that the CB-dispersed resin particles forming the convex portions easily induce electrostatic discharge because the CB-dispersed resin particles are made conductive by carbon black, and thus such a charging roller exhibits a stable chargeability even if toner and external additives adhere on its surface according to the use thereof. It has also been found that on the other hand, \u201cfogging\u201d can take place on an electrophotographic image formed through a charging step using such a charging roller.","Then, the present invention is directed to providing a charging roller having a stable chargeability and capable of preventing the occurrence of \u201cfogging\u201d on an electrophotographic image. The present invention is also directed to providing a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus each capable of stably offering high-quality electrophotographic images.","A charging roller according to the present invention is a contact charging type charging roller which includes a conductive support, and a surface layer, wherein the surface layer contains a binder, resin particles containing a carbon black dispersed in the binder, and graphitized particles dispersed in the binder; and the surface layer has, on its surface, convex portions derived from the resin particles, and convex portions derived from the graphitized particles, wherein the number of convex portions derived from the graphitized particles having a distance, as a positive value, from a plane surface including each vertex of three convex portions derived from the resin particles adjacent to one convex portion derived from the graphitized particles is 80% or more of the total number of the convex portions derived from the graphitized particles.","An electrophotographic apparatus according to the present invention includes the charging roller and an electrophotographic photosensitive member which is arranged so as to be charged by the charging roller. Further, a process cartridge according to the present invention includes the charging roller, and the electrophotographic photosensitive member, wherein the process cartridge is adapted to be detachably mounted to a main body of an electrophotographic apparatus.","The charging roller of the present invention can prevent the occurrence of lateral steak images due to a charging defect of a photosensitive member, which is caused by extraneous matter attached onto a surface of the charging roller and can prevent degradation of image quality with increased image density. The charging roller of the present invention is capable of stabilizing the discharge property even under application of a large output current load and is suitably used for electrophotographic apparatuses, in which attempts are made to achieve further higher image quality, higher speed performance, and longer lives.","Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the attached drawings.","The present inventors have presumed that the mechanism by which \u201cfogging\u201d occurs in an electrophotographic image by using a charging roller having, on its surface, convex portions derived from carbon black (CB) dispersed-resin particles as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":["101","105","103","111","107","105","113","109","103","105","105","115","117","115","117","109","115","117","119","120","119"]},"Based on the presumption, the present inventors thought that it would be possible to prevent \u201cfogging\u201d from adhering onto an electrophotographic photosensitive member by effecting electricity to be stably and appropriately discharged also from a plane portion between two CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions while maintaining suitable discharge generated from the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions so as to weaken the intensity of the local electric fields generated at the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. To this end, the present inventors produced a charging roller in which convex portions derived from graphitized particles (hereinafter, also referred to as \u201cgraphitized particle-derived convex portions\u201d) having a height lower than that of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions are formed in the plane portion . Then, the present inventors studied and examined the chargeability of the thus produced charging roller and \u201cfogging\u201d in electrophotographic images formed using the charging roller. As a result, the present inventors have found that the charging roller has a stable chargeability, and the occurrence of \u201cfogging\u201d is substantially reduced in electrophotographic images formed using the charging roller. The present invention has been accomplished based on the findings.","The reason why the occurrence of \u201cfogging\u201d onto electrophotographic images can be reduced by use of the charging roller of the present invention can be considered as follows.  is a diagram schematically illustrating a discharge phenomenon generated in a nip portion formed between a charging roller according to the present invention and an electrophotographic photosensitive member. A surface layer  of the charging roller contains CB-dispersed resin particles  and graphitized particles  having a higher conductivity than the CB-dispersed resin particles . The surface layer  has, its surface, the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions , and graphitized particle-derived convex portions . Further, the graphitized particle-derived convex portions  are basically constructed so as not to come closer to the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member  than the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions  do. In this case, from the graphitized particle-derived convex portions , a discharge  is generated which is more intensive than a discharge  generating from the plane portion  in  toward the electrophotographic photosensitive member, which is not as intensive as a discharge intensity  of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions . Therefore, it is possible to prevent two areas  and  each having a difference in the electrical potential, as illustrated in , from being formed in the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member . That is, it is possible to weaken the intensity of a local electric field  which is formed at a surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. As a result, it is conceivable that the travel distance of a toner  traveling to the non-latent image portions along the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member can be made as short as possible, and adhesion of toner onto the non-latent image portions can be suppressed.","Hereinafter, the configuration of the charging roller of the present invention will be further described in detail.","<Conductive Support>","As materials of the conductive support, for example, metals such as iron, copper, stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, and alloys thereof are exemplified.","<Surface Layer>","The surface layer contains a binder and conductive resin particles containing a carbon black dispersed in the binder (CB-dispersed resin particles), and graphitized particles dispersed in the binder. Further, the surface layer has, on its surface, convex portions derived from the CB-dispersed resin particles (CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions), and convex portions derived from the graphitized particles (graphitized particle-derived convex portions).","As to the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, the number of convex portions derived from the graphitized particles having a distance, as a positive value, from a plane surface including each vertex of three convex portions derived from the resin particles adjacent to one convex portion derived from the graphitized particles is 80% or more of the total number of the convex portions derived from the graphitized particles. Here, as for a certain graphitized particle-derived convex portion, the description \u201chaving a distance, as \u201ca positive value\u201d, from a plane surface including each vertex of three convex portions derived from the resin particles adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portion\u201d is defined as follows. In other words, it means that a vertex of the graphitized particle-derived convex portion is positioned lower than the plane surface including each vertex of three CB-dispersed resin particles-derived convexes adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portion.","One of the technical meanings of employing the above-mentioned configuration is to prevent the graphitized particle-derived convex portions from making contact with the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. More specifically, the graphitized particles are more conductive than the CB-dispersed resin particles. Therefore, when the graphitized particle-derived convex portions directly come in contact with the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, leakage may take place. In order to prevent the graphitized particle-derived convex portions from making contact with the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member has a technical meaning for avoiding the occurrence of leakage.","In relation to the definition that the number of graphitized particle-derived convex portions that are not directly contacted with the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is 80% or more of the total number of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, the value \u201c80%\u201d itself has no critical meaning. It represents a specific numerical value and means that almost or all of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions are not in contact with the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member.","The following describes a method of observing a relationship of the height of a graphitized particle-derived convex portion to the height of CB-dispersed resin particles lying around the graphitized particle-derived convex portion. As illustrated in , a laser beam is irradiated to convex portions of the surface layer using a laser microscope (not illustrated) to obtain a reflection spectrum, and graphitized particle-derived convex portion  is detected from the reflection spectrum. Then, CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions  adjacent to the one graphitized particle-derived convex portion  are detected using the laser beam. The description \u201cCB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portion \u201d means three resin particle-derived convex portions each having a vertex, i.e., three vertexes, lying, in a dimensional distance, in the shortest length to the third shortest length from the vertex of the graphitized particle-derived convex portion. Next, a plane including the three vertexes is determined, and a distance  between the plane and the vertex of the graphitized particle-derived convex portion  is determined. Then, a surface (a plane portion) of the surface layer which is not provided with any convex portion is defined as a reference plane, the number of graphitized particle-derived convex portions which are placed, with respect to the reference plane, at a position lower than the plane is determined, and a ratio of the number of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions thus determined to the total number of graphitized particle-derived convex portions is calculated. The resulting calculated value is 80% or more. When the ratio of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions that are placed at a position lower than the plane is 80% or more, it is possible to prevent high-potential areas caused by high-intensity discharge from being formed on the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, to prevent the occurrence of high-intensity electric field near the electrophotographic photosensitive member, and to prevent the occurrence of increased image density in non-latent image portions.","Hereinafter, a method of measuring graphitized particle-derived convex portions will be further described in detail. First, a surface of the surface layer in a field of view of 0.5 mm\u00d70.5 mm is observed by a laser microscope (trade name: LSM5 PASCAL, manufactured by Carl Zeiss AG). Whether the convex portions in the filed of view are derived from CB-dispersed resin particles or derived from graphitized particles is identified by varying a wavelength of a laser to be excited and examining the given spectrum of the excitation light beam. Then, an x-y plane within the view is scanned with the laser to obtain dimensional image data, and graphitized particle-derived convex portions and CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions are detected from the dimensional image data. Further, the focal point of the laser is moved in a Z-direction, and the scanning is repeated to obtain three-dimensional data. Next, a graphitized particle-derived convex portion is arbitrarily selected, and three CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portion are determined. A distance of a plane including vertexes of the three CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions, being away from vertex of the selected graphitized particle-derived convex portion is calculated from the three-dimensional data. This procedure is carried out for 10 graphitized particles in the field of view. Similarly to the above, the surface of the charging roller in a longitudinal direction is examined to measure for 10-field-of-views at substantially regular intervals. A distance of each vertex of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions in the thus obtained 100 portions in total being away from a plane including three vertexes of CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions was examined. When the number of graphitized particle-derived convex portion is less than 100, the number of field of views is increased, and the measurement is repeated.","When a vertex of a graphitized particle-derived convex portion lies, with respect to the reference plane, lower than the plane including three vertexes of CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portion, the distance is defined as \u201cpositive\u201d, and when it lies, with respect to the reference plane, upper than the plane, the distance is defined as \u201cnegative\u201d. The number of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions with this distance being \u201cpositive\u201d expressed in percentage is defined as \u201ca ratio of positive graphitized particle-derived convex portions\u201d. In the charging member of the present invention, it is necessary that \u201cthe ratio of positive graphitized particle-derived convex portions\u201d be set to 80% or more.","The distance between the plane including three vertexes of adjacent CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and a graphitized particle-derived convex portion whose vertex lies at a position lower than the place is preferably 0.5 \u03bcm to 15 \u03bcm, more preferably 3 \u03bcm to 10 \u03bcm. With the distance being in the above range, it is effective to prevent the occurrence of \u201cfogging\u201d in an electrophotographic image because the intensity of a local electric field is reduced.","Preferably, the conductivities in the graphitized particle-derived convex portions and CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions when a voltage of 15V being applied between a surface of the charging roller and the conductive support satisfy inequalities (1), (2) and (3) below.\n\n()<()<()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\n3()\/()\u2266100\u2003\u2003(2)\n\n10 nA\u2266()\u2003\u2003(3)\n","In the above inequalities, I(A) represents an average electric current value in CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions; I(B) represents an average electric current value in graphitized particle-derived convex portions; and I(C) represents an average electric current value in plane portions. As described above, the conductivities are higher in order of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions, and plane portions. When a voltage 15V is applied thereto, an average electric current value in graphitized particle-derived convex portions is 10 nA or higher, preferably three times or more than and 100 times or less than the average electric current value in the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions. When the average electric current value in the graphitized particle-derived convex portions is 10 nA or higher, the surface of a photographic photosensitive member can be charged by discharge generated from the graphitized particle-derived convex portions. By satisfying the inequality (2), a properly small amount of discharge is generated from the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, as compared to the discharge from the resin particle-derived convex portions, it is possible to obtain a further advantageous effect of reducing the occurrence of local electric fields across the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member, combined with the effect obtained from the heights of these convex portions.","As the conductivities in the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and plane portions, it is possible to employ conductivities measured, in a conductivity mode, by an atomic force microscope (AFM) (trade name: Q-SCOPE250, manufactured by Quesant instruments Corp.).  is a configuration diagram of a conductivity measuring apparatus for a charging roller according to the present invention. A direct current power source (6614C: manufactured by Agilent Technologies)  is connected to a conductive support of a charging roller , a voltage of 15V is applied to the conductive support, a free end of a cantilever  is brought into contact with a surface layer of the charging roller , and an electric current is measured under the conditions shown in Table 1 below. Electric current values at 100 points for the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, resin particle-derived convex portions and plane portions, respectively, are measured with varying the field of view to give an average value. It is desired that the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and plane portions, as measurement targets, be measured in the same field of view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 1"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Measurement mode","contact(i)"]},{"entry":[{},"Cantilever","CSC17"]},{"entry":[{},"Measurement range","80 \u03bcm \u00d7 80 \u03bcm"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Scan rate","4","Hz"]},{"entry":[{},"Applied voltage","15","V"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}}},"As each density of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and the graphitized particle-derived convex portions present on the surface of the surface layer in a 0.5 mm-square plane, the number of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions is preferably 10 to 1,000, and the number of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions is preferably 100 to 10,000.","The following describes materials constituting the above surface layer.","<<Binder>>","As the binder, a thermosetting resin, thermoplastic resin, rubber, and thermoplastic elastomer can be used. Specific examples thereof include urethane resins, fluororesins, silicone resins, acrylic resins, polyamide resins, butyral resins, styrene-ethylene butylene-olefin copolymers, olefin-ethylene butylene-olefin copolymers. These may be used alone or in combination. Among these, preferred are thermosetting resins for their superiority in releasability to a photosensitive member and resistance to stain.","<<CB (Carbon Black)-Dispersed Resin Particle>>","The CB-dispersed resin particles dispersed in the surface layer are conductive particles comprised of a resin in which a carbon black is dispersed, and forming convex portions, serving as discharge points, on the surface layer. An average particle diameter of the CB-dispersed resin particles is 1 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm, especially 2 \u03bcm to 20 \u03bcm. Here, as the average particle diameter of the CB-dispersed resin particles in the surface layer, a volume average particle diameter measured by the following method is employed. The surface layer is cut out from arbitrarily selected points over a distance of 500 \u03bcm, on a 20 nm basis, by a focused ion beam (FB-2000C, manufactured by Hitachi Ltd.), and cross-sectional images thereof are photographed by an electron microscope. Images taken for the same particle are then combined at 20 nm-intervals, and a stereoscopic particle-shape is calculated. This work is carried out for arbitrarily selected 100 particles from resin particles, and these 100 particles are intended to measure the volume average particle diameter. An equivalent diameter of a sphere having the same volume calculated from the individual stereoscopic particle-shapes obtained is defined as a volume average particle diameter. An average value of volume average particle diameters of all the target particles is defined as an average particle diameter.","In a particle size distribution of the CB-dispersed resin particles, 90% or more of the particles preferably have a particle diameter of from A\/5 \u03bcm to 5A \u03bcm, more preferably from A\/3 \u03bcm to 3A \u03bcm, provided that an average particle diameter of the CB-dispersed resin particles is represented by A \u03bcm. When the resin particles have a particle size distribution in the above-range, the intensity of discharge generated from the convex portions derived from the resin particles can be made more uniform. A particle size distribution of such resin particles is a distribution where an average particle diameter A \u03bcm is in the above range of volume average particle diameter.","As the particle size distribution of the CB-dispersed resin particles, values calculated for the 100 measurement target particles which have been determined for their stereoscopic particle shapes by the above-mentioned method can be employed.","The closer to a sphere the shape of the CB-dispersed resin particles, the smoother the surface of convex portions formed on a surface of the surface layer, the more difficult extraneous matter accumulates, and thus the more preferred. The ratio of the number of particles having a degree of circularity, as an indicator representing a spherical shape, of 0.9 or higher to the total number of resin particles dispersed in the surface layer is 80% or more. With the ratio of the particles having a degree of circularity 0.9 or higher being 80% or more, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of image nonuniformity like spotted stains resulting from smear of a surface of a charging roller. As the degree of circularity of resin particles dispersed in the surface layer, a value calculated from the following equation can be employed using the measurement results of the 100 particles that have been determined for their stereoscopic particle shapes by the above method.\n\nDegree of circularity=(Circumferential length of a circle having an area identical to that of a projected particle image)\/(Circumferential length of the projected particle image)\n","When the particle has a completely spherical shape, the degree of circularity is 1.000. The more complicated the surface shape, the lower the circularity.","Note that the above-mentioned average particle diameter, particle size distribution and degree of circularity of the CB-dispersed resin particles are values obtained by measuring resin particles which have been dispersed in the surface layer. It is, however, also possible to employ a value obtained by using resin particles before being dispersed in the surface layer. First, 100 resin particles, in which secondarily aggregated particles have been removed so as to be primary particles alone, are observed by a microscope, such as a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The resulting image is analyzed in a computer using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus, manufactured by Planetron Inc.) to automatically calculate the degree of circularity through a count\/size function.","The volume resistivity of the CB-dispersed resin particles is preferably selected in view of the relationship with the volume resistivity of the graphitized particles. A volume resistivity of the CB-dispersed resin particles is 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm, especially 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm to 1.0\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm. This is because, with the volume resistivity being in the above range, it is possible to form discharge points with which a surface of an electrophotographic photosensitive member can be favorably contact-charged. As the volume resistivity of the CB-dispersed resin particles, it is possible to employ a value measured when a voltage of 10V being applied to a sample under an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a relative humidity of 50%, using a resistance meter (trade name: LORESTA-GP, manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Ltd.). As target samples for measuring the volume resistivity, those compressed by applying a pressure of 10.1 MPa (102 kgf\/cm) can be used.","As a resin constituting the CB-dispersed resin particles, there may be exemplified acrylic resins, polybutadiene resins, polystyrene resins, phenol resins, polyamide resins, nylon resins, fluororesins, silicone resins, epoxy resins, and polyester resins. As a carbon black to be dispersed in the resin, there may be exemplified furnace black, thermal black, acetylene black, and KETJEN BLACK (trade name). As to the average particle diameter, these carbon blacks desirably have a primary particle diameter of 10 nm to 300 nm, because such carbon blacks can be uniformly dispersed in the resin. As the average particle diameter of the carbon black, a value measured according to the following method can be employed. From a cross-sectional image of resin particles photographed, 100 carbon black particles are arbitrarily selected. A projected area of each carbon black particle is determined, and a diameter equivalent to a circle having an area identical to that of the projected particle image is determined, and the result can be regarded as the average particle diameter of the carbon black. On this occasion, only particles having a circle-equivalent diameter in the range of from 5 nm to 500 nm are used for the measurement.","The amount of the carbon black contained in the CB-dispersed resin particles is an amount required to give the above-mentioned volume resistivity to the CB-dispersed resin particles. Generally, it is desired that the amount of the carbon black be suitably adjusted to be in the range of 1 part by mass to 15 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of resin components of the resin particles. With the amount of the carbon black being in this range, it is possible to give the above-mentioned conductivity as well as a suitable hardness to the CB-dispersed resin particles.","As an example of the method of producing CB-dispersed resin particles, the following methods can be exemplified. There are, for example, a method in which a resin and a carbon black are kneaded so that the carbon black is dispersed in the resin, the dispersed product is cooled to be solidified, pulverized to form particles, the particles are mechanically processed and thermally treated so as to have a spherical shape, and then classified; and a method in which a polymerization initiator, a carbon black and other additives are added to a polymerizable monomer, the monomer composition is suspended, for polymerization, in an aqueous phase containing a dispersion stabilizer by a stirrer so as to have a predetermined particle diameter.","<<Graphitized Particle>>","As the graphitized particles, preferred is a substance which contains carbon atoms forming a laminar structure through SPcovalent bond and which has a half-value width \u0394\u03bdof a peak derived from graphite at 1,580 cmin a Raman spectrum of 80 cmor lower. The half-value width \u0394\u03bdis an indicator of the degree of graphitization and an indicator of broadening of graphite surface in its SPorbit, resulting in an indicator of the conductivity of graphitized particles. The lower the half-value width \u0394\u03bdis, the higher the degree of graphitization will be, the wider the graphite distribution will be, and the higher the conductivity will be.

In order to produce artificial graphite, it is possible to use a method of calcining particles of graphite precursor (graphitized particle precursor). The shape and conductivity of resultant graphitized particles can be controlled by selecting the type of graphitized particle precursor and calcination conditions. The shape of the resultant graphitized particles is more or less determined by the shape of the graphitized particle precursor. Specific examples of usable graphitized particle precursor include bulk-mesophase pitch, mesocarbon microbeads, phenol resins, phenol resin coated with mesophase, and coke coated with a pitch. The conductivity of resultant graphitized particles varies depending on the calcination conditions. Generally, graphitized particles obtained by calcination of graphitized particle precursor at higher temperature for a longer period of time will have higher conductivity. Further, the conductivity also varies depending on the chemical bond structure of the graphitized particle precursor used. Since the ease of change in crystallinity, such as hard-graphitization and easy-graphitization, differs depending on the graphitized particle precursor used, the same conductivity could not be obtained even under the same calcination conditions. Specific production methods of the graphitized particles will be described below, however, the graphitized particles used in the present invention are not limited to those obtained by these production methods.","<Graphitized Particle Obtained by Calcination of Coke Coated with Pitch>","Graphitized particles obtained by calcination of coke coated with a pitch can be produced by adding a pitch to coke, molding the resulting product and then calcining the molded product. As the cokes, an oil residue in petroleum distillation, and a crude coke obtained by heating a coal tar pitch at a temperature of about 500\u00b0 C., and the crude coke further heated at a temperature of 1,200\u00b0 C. or higher and 1,400\u00b0 C. or lower can be used. As the pitch, a pitch obtained as a distillation residue of tar can be used.","As a method for obtaining graphitized particles using these raw materials, first, a coke is finely pulverized and mixed with a pitch to prepare a mixture, the mixture is kneaded under application of heat at a temperature of about 150\u00b0 C., and the kneaded product is molded using a molding machine. The molded product is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 700\u00b0 C. or higher and 1,000\u00b0 C. or lower to impart thermal stability to the molded product. Next, the molded product is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 2,600\u00b0 C. or higher and 3,000\u00b0 C. or lower to thereby obtain desired graphitized particles. In the heat treatment, it is desired to cover the molded product with packing-coke in order to avoid the molded product from being oxidized.","<Graphitized Particles Obtained by Calcination of Bulk-Mesophase Pitch>","A bulk-mesophase pitch can be obtained by extracting \u03b2-resin from coal-tar pitch by solvent fractionation and hydrogenating the \u03b2-resin to carry out heavy-duty treatment. Also, usable is mesophase pitch obtained by finely pulverizing the \u03b2-resin after its heavy-duty treatment and then removing the solvent-soluble matter using benzene or toluene. The bulk-mesophase pitch preferably contains 95% by weight or more of quinoline-soluble matter. If a bulk-mesophase pitch containing less than 95% by weight of the same is used, the interiors of particles can not easily be liquid-phase carbonized, and hence may come solid-phase carbonized to form carbonized particles whose shape is kept in a crushed state. In order to make the particles have a shape close to a spherical shape, it is more preferred to control the amount of the quinoline-soluble matter.","As a method for obtaining graphitized particles using the mesophase pitch, the bulk-mesophase pitch is finely pulverized to obtain particles, and the particles obtained are subjected to heat treatment in air at 200\u00b0 C. or higher and 350\u00b0 C. or lower to carry out oxidation treatment lightly. This oxidation treatment makes the bulk-mesophase pitch particles infusible only at their surfaces, and the particles are prevented from melting or fusing at the time of heat treatment for graphitization in the subsequent step. The bulk-mesophase pitch particles having been subjected to oxidation treatment may preferably have an oxygen content of from 5% by mass or more and 15% by mass or less. If the oxidized bulk-mesophase pitch particles have an oxygen content of 5% by mass or more, they can be prevented from fusing one another at the time of heat treatment. If the oxidized bulk-mesophase pitch particles have an oxygen content of 15% by mass or less, they can be prevented from being oxidized up to their interiors, and may be graphitized with their shape being in a crushed state, making it possible to obtain spherical particles. Next, the bulk-mesophase pitch particles having been subjected to oxidation treatment are subjected to heat treatment at 1,000\u00b0 C. or higher and 3,500\u00b0 C. or lower in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon, thereby obtaining the desired graphitized particles.","<Graphitized Particles Obtained by Calcination of Mesocarbon Microbeads>","As a method for obtaining mesocarbon microbeads, for example, there is, for example, a method in which coal type heavy oil or petroleum type heavy oil is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of from 300\u00b0 C. or higher and 500\u00b0 C. or lower to effect polycondensation to form crude mesocarbon microbeads, then the reaction product is subjected to treatment such as filtration, sedimentation by leaving at rest, or centrifugation, to separate mesocarbon microbeads, and thereafter the mesocarbon microbeads are washed with a solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene, and further dried to obtain mesocarbon microbeads.","As a method for obtaining graphitized particles using the mesocarbon microbeads, the mesocarbon microbeads having been dried are kept mechanically primarily dispersed by a force mild enough not to break them. This is preferred in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization and to obtain uniform particles. The mesocarbon microbeads having been thus kept primarily dispersed are subjected to primary heat treatment at a temperature of from 200\u00b0 C. or higher and 1,500\u00b0 C. or lower in an inert atmosphere to produce a carbonized product. The particles of the carbonized product thus obtained are mechanically dispersed by a force mild enough not to break them. This is preferred in order to prevent particles from coalescing after graphitization and to obtain uniform particles. The carbonized particles having been subjected to secondary dispersion treatment are subjected to secondary heat treatment at a temperature of from 1,000\u00b0 C. or higher and 3,500\u00b0 C. or lower in an inert atmosphere, thereby obtaining desired graphitized particles.","In the surface layer of the present invention, it is important to control the height of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and graphitized particle-derived convex portions. A first element for controlling the height of each of the convex portions is the particle diameters of the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles. That is, it is necessary for the CB-dispersed resin particles to select an average particle diameter greater than that of the graphitized particle diameter. More specifically, as the CB-dispersed resin particles, it is desired to use their particles having an average particle diameter of 0.5 \u03bcm or more, especially 3 \u03bcm or more greater than the average particle diameter of the graphitized particles. The upper limit of the difference in average particle diameter between the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles is not particularly limited. The difference is, however, practically, 25 \u03bcm or less, especially, 15 \u03bcm or less.","A second element for controlling the height of each of the convex portions is the preparation method of a surface layer-forming coating for use in formation of the surface layer. More specifically, in the preparation of a surface layer-forming coating, CB-dispersed resin particles and graphitized particles are dispersed in the binder resin. It is important, before\/after this dispersion process, to secure the above-mentioned relationship of average particle diameters between the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles. Under ordinary conditions for dispersing a filler in a binder for the purpose of effecting uniform dispersion, graphitized particles and CB-dispersed resin particles may undesirably crushed. In particular, graphitized particles are inherently brittle and easily crushed. There are possibilities that the average particle diameter of graphitized particles could be significantly smaller than the original average particle diameter, or, on the contrary, excessively crushed particles could aggregate to each other to exist, as aggregates having a greater average particle diameter, in the surface layer-forming coating. In light of the above, the dispersion conditions are relaxed, such as shortening the dispersion time, to eliminate the possibility as much as possible that the graphitized particles and CB-dispersed resin particles could be crushed in the process of dispersing the graphitized particles and CB-dispersed resin particles in the binder resin to prepare the surface layer-forming coating. More specifically, first, components other than the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles, for example, conductive fine particles, are mixed along with glass beads in the binder resin and dispersed over 24 hours to 36 hours, using a paint shaker dispersion machine. Next, CB-dispersed resin particles and graphitized particles are added to the dispersion, and further dispersed. The dispersion time at this stage is one minute to 60 minutes, preferably 5 minutes to 10 minutes. With this, it is possible to prevent the graphitized particles and CB-dispersed resin particles from being crushed and to virtually secure the original relationship of average particle diameters between the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles in the surface layer-forming coating.","A third element for controlling the height of each of the convex portions is the thickness of the surface layer. The surface layer can be formed by applying, in a predetermined thickness, a surface layer-forming coating in which a binder resin, CB-dispersed resin particles and graphitized particles are dispersed, onto a support or an elastic layer formed on the support, by a known method. On this occasion, it is desired that the film thickness of the surface layer to the average particle diameter A \u03bcm of the CB-dispersed resin particles be A\/3 to 10A, especially A\/2 to 5A. When the surface layer is made excessively thick, the CB-dispersed resin particles and graphitized particles are embedded in the surface layer, and undesirably convex portions having desired heights may not be formed on the surface layer. With the thickness of the surface layer being in the above range, each of the particle diameters of the CB-dispersed resin particles and the graphitized particles can affect the height of the CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions and the height of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions. Here, the amount of the CB-dispersed resin particles added to the surface layer coating is preferably 2 parts by mass to 80 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the binder resin, particularly preferably 5 parts by mass to 40 parts by mass. The amount of the graphitized particles added to the surface layer coating is preferably 0.5 parts by mass to 40 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the binder resin, particularly preferably 1 part by mass to 20 parts by mass. Then, a ratio of the addition amount of the CB-dispersed resin particles to the addition amount of the graphitized particles is, in terms of mass ratio, from 0.1 to 10, more preferably from 0.5 to 2. With this, The CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions can be allowed to exist around almost all the graphitized particle-derived convex portions. As a result, for almost all the graphitized particle-derived convex portions, the distance of the graphitized particle-derived convex portions is positive from a plane surface including each vertex of three CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions adjacent to the graphitized particle-derived convex portions. The thickness of the surface layer can be controlled by suitably controlling the solid content, viscosity, and coating speed of the after-mentioned surface layer coating. The higher the solid content, the viscosity and the coating speed of the surface layer coating are, the thicker the film thickness can be. As the values of the film thickness, cross-sections of the surface layer are measured at three points in an axial direction, and three points in a circumferential direction, i.e., nine points in total. The cross-sections are observed by an optical microscope, an electron microscope or the like, and an average value of the measured values can be employed.","As a coating method of the surface layer-forming coating, there are, for example, slit coating, roll coating, ring coating, spray coating, and dip coating. Particularly, when dip coating is employed, the CB-dispersed resin particles and graphitized particles are less likely to be crushed in coating process. For this reason, the original relationship of average diameters between the CB-dispersed resin particle and the graphitized particles is easily secured, and thus dip coating is favorably employed.","The surface layer may contain an ion conductive agent, and an electron conductive agent without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims. Further, for the purpose of uniformly improving the electric resistance of the surface layer, controlling the dielectric constant and the coefficient of elasticity thereof, insulating inorganic fine particles may be added to the surface layer. As the inorganic fine particles, particles of silica, and titanium oxide are preferred.","A coating film after applying the surface layer coating is preferably heated, and exposed to ultraviolet ray or an electron beam, or subjected to moisture to accelerate crosslinking, because thereby it is possible to prevent resin particles and graphitized particles contained in the surface layer from falling off.","<<Elastic Layer>>","The charging roller of the present invention may include layers having other functions, within the range not impairing the functions of the conductive support and the surface layer. By way of example, as illustrated in , there may be exemplified a configuration in which a conductive elastic layer  is provided between the conductive support  and the surface layer .","As a rubber constituting the conductive elastic layer , epichlorohydrin rubber, nitrile rubber (NBR), chloroprene rubber, urethane rubber, and silicone rubber are exemplified. As thermoplastic elastomers, styrene-butadiene-styrene-block copolymer (SBS), and styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene block copolymer (SEBS) are exemplified. Among these, epichlorohydrin rubber is preferably used, because the rubber itself have conductivity of about 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm to about 1\u00d710\u03a9\u00b7cm in intermediately resistive regions and can prevent a variation in electric resistance of the conductive elastic layer. Specific examples of the epichlorohydrin rubber include epichlorohydrin (EP) monopolymers, EP-ethylene oxide (EO) copolymers, EP-acryl glycidyl ether (AGE) copolymers, and EP-EO-AGE terpolymers. Among these, particularly preferred are EP-EO-AGE terpolymers, because the conductivity and processability of the conductive elastic layer can be controlled by controlling the polymerization degree and composition ratio of EP-EO-AGE terpolymers, and by using EP-EO-AGE terpolymers, an elastic layer having high mechanical strength and high conductivity can be obtained. In the conductive elastic layer, typical compounding agents can be used within the range not impairing the properties, such as conductivity and mechanical strength, required for the charging roller of the present invention.","As a method of forming an elastic layer, a method can be exemplified in which raw materials of these rubber and elastomer, and compounding agents to be compounded as required are kneaded and then molded. As a method of kneading the raw materials, a method of using a sealed kneader such as a Banbury mixer, intermix mixer, and pressurizing kneader; and a method of using an open kneader such as an open roll can be used. As a method of forming a kneaded product on the conductive support, a molding method, such as an extrusion molding, injection molding, and compression molding can be used. In consideration of working efficiency, cross-head extrusion molding is preferred in which a kneaded product to be formed into an elastic layer is extruded together with the conductive support. As the conductive support, a conductive support coated with an adhesive intended for adhesion with the elastic layer can also be used as required, within the range not losing high conductivity of the conductive support. As the adhesive, thermosetting resins, and thermoplastic resins containing conductive agent are exemplified. Specifically, a urethane resin adhesive, acrylic resin adhesive, polyester resin adhesive, polyether resin adhesive and epoxy resins adhesive can be used. Afterward, when it is necessary to carry out crosslinking of the elastic layer, it is desired that the elastic layer undergo a crosslinking process, such as crosslinking during molding, crosslinking using a vulcanizer, continuous crosslinking, crosslinking by far far\/near-infrared radiation, and crosslinking by induction heating. A molded elastic layer may be ground to smooth the surface thereof and to precisely finish the shape thereof. As the grinding method, traverse grinding mode, and wide-width grinding mode can be employed. In the traverse grinding mode, a roller surface is ground by moving a short grindstone along the surface thereof. In contrast, in the wide-width grinding mode, a surface of the elastic layer is ground using a wide-width grindstone, i.e., a grindstone having a width longer than the length of the elastic layer in a short period of time. In terms of the working efficiency, the wide-width grinding mode is preferred.","As the hardness of the elastic layer, it is appropriate for the elastic layer to have a microhardness of from 30\u00b0 to 80\u00b0, more preferably from 45\u00b0 to 65\u00b0. With the hardness of the elastic layer being within the above range, when the charging roller is contacted with a photographic photosensitive member, a distance between a vertex of the resin particle-derived convex portion and a vertex of the graphitized particle-derived convex portion can be maintained at a distance therebetween, in a state where the charging roller is not contacted with the photographic photosensitive member. With this, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of discharge nonuniformity due to the narrow nip width. Here, as the microhardness, a value measured by the following method can be employed. A charging roller, which is left standing in an environment of normal temperature and normal relative humidity (23\u00b0 C.\/55% RH) for 12 hours or longer. The charging roller is intended to measure the microhardness by using a micro-area rubber hardness meter (ASKER MD-1: manufactured by Kobunshi Keiki Co., Ltd.) in a 10-N peak hold mode.","The surface of the charging roller of the present invention preferably has such a ten-point average roughness (Rzjis) that a common charging roller has. Specifically, the charging roller has a Rzjis of about 2 \u03bcm to about 30 \u03bcm and a Sm of about 15 \u03bcm to about 150 \u03bcm. Concerning the ten-point average roughness (Rzjis) and the average irregularity interval (Sm) of the surface of the charging roller, values determined by a measurement method according to the surface roughness defined in JIS B0601-2001 can be employed. In the surface roughness measurement, a surface roughness meter (SE-3400, manufactured by Kosaka K.K.) can be used. Here, Sm is an average interval measured between 10-point-irregularities (10-point concavo-convexes) in the measurement length. As values of Rzjis and Sm, the charging roller is randomly measured at six portions thereof, and an average value obtained from the measured results can be employed. As the measurement length, a standard measurement length defined in JIS B0601-2001 is used. The electric resistance of the charging roller may be a typical value of a contact type charging roller. More specifically, it is about 1\u00d710\u03a9 to about 1\u00d710\u03a9 in an environment of a temperature of 23\u00b0 C. and a relative humidity (RH) of 50%.","(Electrophotographic Apparatus)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["301","302","301","308","303","305","304","307","306","301","301","302","301","302","301","301","313","301","301","301","303","301","305","301","304","307","301","306","304"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["302","301","303","307"]},"Hereinafter, the present invention will be further described in detail with reference to specific examples.","A \u03b2-resin that had been extracted from a coal tar pitch by solvent fractionation was hydrogenated.

By the above-described procedure, a charging roller having an elastic layer and a surface layer on a conductive support was obtained. As to the resulting charging roller, electric current values of I (A), I (B), and I (C) were measured by AFM. Also, a ratio of the number of graphitized particle-derived convex portions having a distance, as \u201ca positive value\u201d, from a plane surface including each vertex of convex portions derived from three CB-dispersed resin particle-derived convex portions adjacent to graphitized particle-derived convex portions to the total number of graphitized particle-derived convex portions was determined. The measurement results are shown in Table 6.","<Evaluation of \u201cImage Fogging\u201d in Non-Latent Image Portion>","Image formation was carried out using the resulting charging roller in the following manner to evaluate the image formed. Specifically, an electrophotographic apparatus (LBP5400, manufactured by Canon Inc.) was remodeled so that the output speed of a recording medium was 200 mm\/sec, and the charging roller thus produced was attached to a black cartridge in the remodeled machine. An entire-blank image was output after setting V(a voltage obtained by subtracting a voltage applied to a developing roller from a surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member) to \u221220V and \u221270V. Since the toner placed in the electrophotographic apparatus is a negatively chargeable toner, the value of Vis usually set to about \u221270V to about \u2212150V. With the voltage of Vbeing set to \u221220V and \u221270V, the toner is not developed on a surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member under normal circumstances. Setting of Vto \u221220V was employed because this voltage setting correlates to the image density of non-latent image portions at from about \u221270V to about \u2212150V, and a difference of image density in non-latent image portions can be clearly discriminated. It is presumed that a toner developed under this condition is developed because the toner is trapped by local electric fields across the surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member due to nonuniformity of potential on the electrophotographic photosensitive member, which is produced by nonuniform discharge of a charging roller. The image was output by the remodeled machine thus configured, under an environment of a temperature of 15\u00b0 C. and a relative humidity of 10%. The degree of whiteness of the image output when setting the Vto \u221220V was measured using a whiteness photometer (trade name: TC-6DS\/A, produced by Tokyo Denshoku Co., Ltd.) according to the method defined in JIS P8148. A difference in degree of whiteness indicating a degree of increased image density in non-latent image portions was calculated by subtracting the average value of five points of degree of whiteness of paper sheets after the image output, from the average value of five points of degree of whiteness of paper sheets before the image output.","Meanwhile, as to the degree of whiteness of the image output when setting the Vto \u221270V, a difference in image density before\/after image output was visually observed and evaluated according to the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 6.","A: lower than 2.0% (A difference in image density before and after image output cannot be distinguished.)","B: equal to or higher than 2.0% and lower than 5.0% (It can be distinguished that the image density after image output is very slightly higher than the image density before image output.)","C: equal to or higher than 5.0% and lower than 7.0% (It can be distinguished that the image density after image output is slightly higher than the image density before image output.)","D: 7.0% or higher (It can be clearly distinguished that the image density after image output is higher than the image density before image output.)","<Image Nonuniformity Due to Streak Running in the Lateral Direction>","Image output was carried out in the same manner as in the measurement of the degree of increased image density in non-latent image portions except that the image output conditions were changed to the following conditions. A sheet of image was output using an image randomly printed at 1% area of an image formation area of A4-size paper, the operation of the electrophotographic apparatus was stopped, and 10 seconds later, the image forming operation was restarted. This operation was repeated, and 30,000 sheets of electrophotographic images were formed. Thereafter, electrophotographic images for evaluation were formed. The electrophotographic images for evaluation were halftone images (an image with an intermediate image density, which is a one-dot-width horizontal line in two-dot intervals was drawn in a direction perpendicular to the rotational direction of the electrophotographic photosensitive member). Printed images were evaluated according to the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 6.","A: Image nonuniformity due to a streak running in the lateral direction is not observed.","B: Image nonuniformity due to a streak running in the lateral direction in short length (shorter than 1 mm) is observed, but no problem in practical use.","C: Image nonuniformity due to a streak running in the lateral direction in long length (from several mm to several cm) is observed.","Surface layer-forming coatings were prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the Coating material, Graphitized particle, and CB-dispersed resin particle were changed to those shown in Table 5 below.
