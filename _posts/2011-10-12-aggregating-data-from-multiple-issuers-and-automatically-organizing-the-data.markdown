title: Aggregating data from multiple issuers and automatically organizing the data
abstract: Some implementations provide techniques and arrangements to aggregate data from multiple issuers. An aggregator server may receive data associated with a user from an issuer. The data may include an issuer identifier associated with the issuer, account access data associated with the user, and a storage location identifier. The aggregator server may authenticate an identity of the issuer based on the issuer identifier and determine whether the issuer is authorized to provide the data for the user. In response to determining that the issuer is authorized to provide the data for the user, he aggregator server may identify an account associated with the user based on the account access data and store the data in the account associated with the user based at least partially on the storage location identifier.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["An individual may receive documents, such as healthcare records, financial statements, or government statements, that the individual desires to preserve. If the documents are provided as hard copies (e.g., paper documents), then the individual may physically organize them using a filing cabinet. If the documents are electronically provided, in some cases, the individual may print off the electronic documents to create paper documents and physically organize them. However, this manual process of physically organizing documents is tedious and time consuming.","In some cases, the individual may create directories on a computer-accessible storage device and organize the electronic documents using the directories. However, this is still a manual process that may be time consuming for a user to perform. In addition, the electronic documents may be difficult to access remotely via other devices. For example, the user may be unable to access the electronic documents when the user is not at home. Furthermore, if the storage device malfunctions (e.g., hard disk crash), then some or all of the stored documents may become inaccessible.","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter; nor is it to be used for determining or limiting the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Some implementations provide techniques and arrangements to aggregate data, such as financial statements, healthcare records, or government statements, from multiple issuers. The data may be received from the multiple issuers via secure means to prevent unauthorized usage. An individual may provide the issuers with account access data that enables the issuer to send data to an account associated with a particular individual and to specify a location in the account in which the data is to be stored.","Content Aggregation","An issuer may be any entity (e.g., an individual or a corporate entity) with whom a user has a relationship (e.g., customer relationship, client relationship, patient relationship, and the like). The issuer may provide documents (e.g., paper documents, electronic documents, or both) that include details associated with the relationship. For example, a merchant may issue a receipt to a user at a point-of-sale (POS) system after the user has made a purchase via the merchant. As another example, a financial institution (e.g., a bank, an investment company, a credit card provider, and the like) may provide the user with monthly statements. As yet another example, a healthcare provider (e.g., a doctor, a dentist, a hospital, a lab, and the like) may provide the user with a document in response to the user visiting the healthcare provider. In some cases, the document from the healthcare provider may include financial data as well as healthcare-related data (e.g., test results).","Users may find it tedious or cumbersome to organize paper documents by filing them into folders in a filing cabinet, etc. As used herein, the term \u201cuser\u201d may refer to an individual, a group of related individuals (e.g., a family or an organization), a business entity, or any other type of entity for which an issuer may generate data. Organizing electronic documents received from multiple issuers may also be difficult for a variety of reasons. For example, some issuers may not transmit sensitive information electronically because of security concerns. Instead, issuers may provide documents on a secure website and enable users to securely access the documents. However, this arrangement may still be tedious or cumbersome as a user may have to create accounts on multiple websites and periodically login to multiple websites to electronically retrieve the documents. In addition, many issuers may retain documents for a particular time period, after which the documents are no longer available. If the user does not retrieve the documents within the particular time period, the user may be unable to access the documents.","After retrieving the information electronically, the user may store the retrieved information on a storage device, such as a disk drive. If the storage device malfunctions, at least some of the information may become inaccessible. Moreover, if the storage device is part of a portable device (e.g., a laptop computer or mobile phone) and the portable device is stolen, the user may not only lose the stored information, but the information may be used for identity theft or fraud.","In some implementations described herein, An aggregator may provide accounts to subscribers and electronically aggregate sensitive, confidential, or other types of information from multiple issuers, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, or governmental entities. The aggregator may use a security mechanism, such as encryption, to enable issuers to securely provide the information to the aggregator via a public network, such as the Internet.","The aggregator may create a hierarchical account structure or other general linked structure based on the issuers associated with a particular user. A user may specify a set of issuers from which the user desires to receive data. The aggregator may identify what type of information the issuer provides and automatically (e.g., without human interaction) create an appropriate hierarchical structure for the user's account. The user may modify the hierarchical user account structure created by the aggregator. The aggregator may contact the set of issuers specified by the user and indicate to the issuers that the aggregator is authorized to receive information from the issuers on behalf of the user.","When the aggregator receives data from an issuer, the aggregator may authenticate the issuer to determine whether the issuer is authorized to provide data for the user. In some cases, the issuer may provide an authentication code that the user has configured for the issuer, such as a personal identification number (PIN) number or code. This may prevent unauthorized data (e.g., \u201cspam\u201d) from being added to the user's account. If the data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized usage, the aggregator may decrypt the data prior to storing the data. Based on user account information in the data, the aggregator may identify an account of a user and store the data in a particular location of the account. The location where the aggregator stores the data may be determined based on a location provided by the issuer in the data, a location specified in a user profile hosted by the issuer, a location specified in a user profile hosted by the aggregator, a default location specified by the aggregator, or any combination thereof.","In some cases, the issuer may include tags associated with the data to identify various characteristics of the data, such as the type of data. For example, a credit card statement may be tagged with \u201cfinancial,\u201d \u201ccredit card,\u201d an issuer identifier (e.g., \u201cBank XYZ\u201d), another tag associated with a characteristic of the data, or any combination thereof. The aggregator may associate tags with data based on the user's profile before storing the data in the user's account. The tags may enable the user to search, sort, and organize the data stored in the user's account.","Thus, a user may login to an associated user account hosted by the aggregator and view multiple data items associated with the user, including confidential and sensitive information. The multiple data items may be received from multiple issuers and may be organized in the account via a hierarchical structure. The aggregator may automatically store data received from an issuer in a particular location in the account, thereby relieving the user from manually organizing the data.","A user may have more than one account with the aggregator. For example, a user may have a first account for data items associated with a business owned and\/or managed by the user. The user may have a second account for data items associated with individuals related to the user. For example, the second account may be used for data items associated with the user's spouse, the user's children, the user's parents, other related individuals, or any combination thereof.","Illustrative Framework for Aggregating Content from Multiple Issuers",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","114","116","102","118","104","112"]},"The aggregator  may provide user accounts to multiple users, such as the users  or . For example, the users  or  may be subscribers to a service provided by the aggregator . The aggregator  may provide various services to subscribers, including hosting user accounts  and user profiles . The user accounts  may include accounts associated with multiple subscribers, such as the users  or . For example, the user accounts  may include a first user account  associated with the first user  and a second user account  associated with the second user . The user profiles  may include user profiles associated with the multiple subscribers, such as a first user profile  associated with the first user  and a second user profile  associated with the second user . The user profiles  may include preferences associated with each subscriber. For example, the first user profile  may indicate how the first user  prefers to have the first user account  organized, how the first user  prefers to be contacted\/notified (e.g., voice call, text message, email, and the like), the issuers from which the first user  prefers to receive data, how long particular data is to be retained, under what conditions data is to be archived, compressed, or deleted, other user preferences, or any combination thereof.","The issuers , , or  may be entities that generate information associated with users (e.g., the users  and ). For example, the issuers , , or  may include financial issuers (e.g., banks, credit card issuers\/managers, investment management firms, and the like), health-related issuers (e.g., hospitals, doctors, dentists, and the like), other types of issuers, or any combination thereof. In some instances, the information generated by the issuers , , or  may include private (e.g., confidential or sensitive) information, such as account balance information or lab results (e.g., blood tests, x-rays, and the like). Because of privacy concerns, issuers may not send private information via email to users and instead request that users create an account, and securely login to an issuer website to retrieve user-related documents. The aggregator  may address this issue by enabling issuers that have privacy concerns to securely transmit documents to a user account provided by the aggregator .","The issuers , , or  may enable users (e.g., the users  or ) to provide preferences identifying how to contact or provide information to the users. Initially, the user preferences may include default values provided by the issuers , , or . The users  or  may modify the user preferences, including the default values. For example, the preferences may specify a mailing address, one or more phone numbers, an email address, an account identifier (e.g., for an account with the aggregator ), a location in the user's account in which to store the data, rules for associating tags with data, under what conditions data should be sent, how often data should be sent, other preferences, or any combination thereof. The first issuer  may host user preferences  that include user preference files associated with multiple users, such as a first user preferences  associated with the first user  and a second user preferences  associated with the second user . The second issuer  may host user preferences  that include user preference files associated with multiple users, such as a first user preferences  associated with the first user  and a second user preferences  associated with the second user . The third issuer  may host user preferences  that include user preference files associated with multiple users, such as a first user preferences  associated with the first user  and a second user preferences  associated with the second user . The first user preferences , , and  may include preferences for the first user  with reference to each of the issuers , , and , respectively.","The preferences may include account identifiers to enable the issuers , , or  to identify the user accounts that are associated with the users. For example, the first user preferences  may include an account identifier of the first user account  associated with the first user . The first issuer  may include the account identifier in data sent to the aggregator  to enable the aggregator to place the data in the first user account .","In operation, multiple users, such as the users  or , may subscribe to services provided by the aggregator . In response to subscribing to services, the aggregator  may provide the users with associated user accounts, such as the user account  and the user account , respectively. The users may then notify issuers (e.g., the issuers , , or ) that the users have established accounts with the aggregator . In some cases, the user preferences hosted by the issuers may be created based on the user profiles . For example, the first user  may instruct the first issuer  to create the first user preferences  based on the first user profile . As another example, in response to the first user  creating an account with the aggregator , the aggregator may create the first user preferences  based on the first user profile  and send the first user preferences  to the first issuer .","The first issuer  may send first data  to the aggregator  via the network . The first data  may include an issuer identifier that enables the first issuer  to establish its credentials with the aggregator . For example, the aggregator  may authenticate an issuer identifier provided by the first issuer . In some cases, data sent by an issuer may be in the form of an electronic mail (\u201cemail\u201d) sent to an email address associated with a user. For example, the first data  may be in the form of an email that is sent to an email address associated with the user account .","The first data  may include information identifying which user account is associated with the first data . The first data  may include information identifying a restricted public key that the issuer may use to store data into the user's account that is hosted by the aggregator . The restricted public key may include identification data that the user may configure at the aggregator  and provide to the issuer to enable the issuer to provide data to the user's account. The restricted public key may help reduce or eliminate spam because only issuers with knowledge of the data key will be able to issue information to user accounts that are hosted by the aggregator . For example, the aggregator  may receive the first data , identify account related information that is included in the first data , determine that the first data  is associated with the first user , and after determining that a provided restricted public key corresponds to the users account, place the first data  in the first user account  that is associated with the first user . The first data  may include a location identifier of a location in the user account in which to place the first data . For example, the aggregator  may place at least a portion of the first data  in a particular location in the first user account  based on the location identifier that is included in the first data . To illustrate, the aggregator  may place a bank statement from issuer Bank XYZ in the folder labeled \u201cBank XYZ\u2014Savings Account.\u201d If the first data  does not include a location identifier, the location where the first data  is stored may be determined based on the first user profile  of the first user  or a default location specified by the aggregator .","The first issuer  may send second data  to the aggregator . For example, the first data  may include a first monthly statement and the second data  may include a second monthly statement. The second data  may include information identifying a particular user associated with the second data . For example, the aggregator  may determine that the second data  is associated with the first user  and place the second data  in the first user account . The aggregator  may place at least a portion of the data  in a particular location of the first user account  based on the second data , the first user profile , a default location provided by the aggregator , other preference information associated with the first user , or any combination thereof.","The second issuer  may provide third data  associated with the second user . The aggregator  may examine the third data  and determine that the third data  is associated with the second user . The aggregator  may store the third data  in the second user account  associated with the second user . The aggregator  may place at least a portion of the third data  in a particular location of the second user account  based on the third data , the second user profile , a default location provided by the aggregator , other preference information associated with the second user , or any combination thereof.","The third issuer  may provide fourth data  associated with the second user . The aggregator  may examine the fourth data  and determine that the fourth data  is associated with the second user . The aggregator  may store the fourth data  in the second user account  associated with the second user . The aggregator  may place at least a portion of the fourth data  in a particular location of the second user account  based on the fourth data , the second user profile , a default location provided by the aggregator , other preference information associated with the second user , or any combination thereof.","In some instances, one or more of the data , , , or  may be encrypted using an encryption scheme. The encryption scheme may use 32-bit or greater (e.g., 56-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, 256-bit, and the like) encryption and may comply with an encryption standard, such as the data encryption standard (DES). For example, the issuers , , or  may use public keys to encrypt data (e.g., the data , , , or ) sent to the aggregator . The aggregator  may use a private key to decrypt the encrypted data received from the issuers before storing the data in a user account corresponding to a subscriber. By encrypting the data (e.g., the data , , , or ), the issuers , , or  may prevent the unauthorized use of the data in the event that the data is electronically intercepted. In addition, the data stored in the user's account may be encrypted with a user configured key to prevent unauthorized use of the data. This ensures that data in the user's account hosted by the aggregator  is secure even from employees of the aggregator .","The aggregator  may store at least a portion of the data (e.g., the data , , , or ) in a particular location in a user account. The particular location where data is stored for a particular user may be determined based on information provided in the data (e.g., based on a default value provided by the issuer or based on the user preferences that are hosted by the issuer), the user profile hosted by the aggregator , a default value provided by the aggregator , or any combination thereof. In some instances, the first user preferences  may include override information identifying which location preference overrides another location preference. For example, the first user profile  may specify that when the first data  is provided to the aggregator , a location where the first data  is stored is determined by first determining whether the first user profile  specifies a location. If the first user profile  specifies a location to store the first data , then the aggregator  may use that location. If the first user profile  does not specify a location, and the first data  specifies a location, then the aggregator  may use that location. If the first user profile  does not specify a location, and the first data  does not specify a location, then the aggregator  may provide a default location. Of course, other combinations of user preferences (e.g., the user preferences , , or ), user profiles (e.g., the user profiles  or ), default locations provided by the issuers (e.g., the issuers , , or ), or default locations provided by the aggregator  are possible.","Data (e.g., the data , , , or ) stored by the aggregator  may include zero or more associated tags. The tags may be associated with the data by an issuer (e.g., the issuers , , or ), by the aggregator , by the user preferences hosted by the issuer, by user preferences hosted by the aggregator , or any combination thereof. For example, the first issuer  may associate tags  with the first data  based on the first user preferences  before sending the first data  to the aggregator . As another example, the aggregator  may associate tags with the first data  based on the first user profile , based on default tags, or both.","In response to receiving a data item, such as the data , ,  or , the aggregator  may send a notification  to the appropriate user. For example, the aggregator  may receive the first data  from the first issuer , place the first data  in the first user account , and send the notification  to the first user  to notify the first user  that the first data  has been stored in the first user account . As another example, in response to receiving the third data , the aggregator  may store the third data  in the second user account  and send the notification  to the second user . The notification  may notify the second user  that the aggregator  received the third data  and stored the third data  in the second user account . The notification  may include an email, a text message sent to a wireless phone, a telephone call made by an automated voice response system, a notification via an internet-based social networking site, another type of communication, or any combination thereof. The type of notification that is sent may be based on the user profiles . For example, the first user profile  may specify the conditions, which when satisfied, cause the aggregator  to send the notification  and may specify the method used to send the notification . For example, the first user  may specify in the first user profile  that the notification  is sent when data is received from a particular issuer and\/or when tagged with a particular keyword. To illustrate, the first user  may specify in the first user profile  that data sent from the first issuer  and tagged with a first particular tag (e.g., \u201cbank deposit\u201d) does not cause the notification  to be sent but that data tagged with a second particular tag (e.g., \u201coverdrawn account\u201d) causes the notification  to be sent. As another example, the first user  may specify that data from the first issuer , a financial institution, causes a text message (cellular short message service) notification to be sent while data received from the second issuer , a healthcare provider, causes an email notification to be sent.","In some cases, a particular issuer may be unable to send data to the aggregator . In these cases, a user may create an account with the particular issuer that enables the user to log in to the account to access data associated with the user. The user may provide account credentials (e.g., user name, password, other account access-related information, and the like) associated with the account to the aggregator . The aggregator  may store the account credentials in the corresponding user profile of the user profiles . The user may specify (e.g., via the user profiles ) a particular frequency or conditions when the aggregator  is to automatically login and retrieve the data associated with the user from the particular issuer. After retrieving the data, the aggregator  may store the retrieved data in the account associated with the user. In this way, the aggregator  may automatically retrieve and store documents from issuers that are unable to send data directly to the aggregator, thereby relieving users from the burden of having to manually retrieve the data and manually organize the data items.","A user may manually send documents to the aggregator  for storage in the account associated with the user. For example, if a particular issuer is unable to send data to the aggregator , the user may retrieve the data electronically or physically receive the data (e.g., in the form of a paper document). If the data is physically received, the user may convert the data to an electronic format, such as an image file or a portable document format. After converting physical data to an electronic format or if the data is retrieved electronically, the user may electronically send the data to the aggregator , in a manner similar to how an issuer sends data associated with the user to the aggregator  or via a separate user interface provided by the aggregator , such as a rich client or a web-based client. To illustrate, the user may retrieve the data from a website of the issuer, associate tags with the data, specify a location in the account of the user in which to store the data, encrypt the data, or any combination thereof, before sending the data to the aggregator . As another illustration, prior to obtaining an account with the aggregator , the user may retrieve and store electronic documents in a location that is accessible to the user, such as a computing device associated with the user. After the user obtains an account with the aggregator , the user may send at least a portion of these stored electronic documents to the aggregator  for storage in the user's account. In this situation, the user may be referred to as a \u201cself-issuer.\u201d","The aggregator  may provide additional services to subscribers (e.g., the users  or ), such as contact information (e.g., physical mailing address, phone number, etc.) confirmation or updates. For example, the user profiles  may include contact information, such as a home number, a cell phone number, a work number, a physical mailing address, and the like for each subscriber. To illustrate, the first user profile  may include contact information associated with the first user . If a subscribe moves from a first location to a second location, the subscriber may authorize the aggregator  to electronically notify the issuers associated with the subscriber that the subscriber has moved to the second location. For example, after the first user  moves from Dallas to Phoenix, the first user  may instruct the aggregator  to notify the issuers  and  associated with the first user  with new contact information for the first user . In addition, an issuer may send a request to the aggregator  to provide or confirm contact information associated with a particular user. The issuer may periodically send a request to the aggregator  to confirm whether a user has changed the user's contact information. The aggregator  may provide the user's contact information or confirm the user's contact information if the particular user has authorized the aggregator  to do so.","Thus, the aggregator  may receive multiple data items from multiple issuers. In some instances, the data received by the aggregator  may include confidential data, such as financial information, healthcare information, or government-issued information. The aggregator  may authenticate an identity of the issuer before placing at least a portion of the data in a user account associated with a user to prevent the user from receiving data from unauthorized issuers. The aggregator may automatically organize and maintain an account for the user by placing each of the multiple data items in particular locations of the account.","In this way, the user expends very little effort to organize and maintain the multiple data items in the account as compared to physically or electronically organizing and maintaining documents without the aggregator . The data items in a user account may be retained by the aggregator  until the user decides to delete them, or based on policies of the aggregator . For example, an amount in monthly or annual subscription that the aggregator  charges a user may be based at least partly on an amount of storage that the data in the user's account occupies. The user can access the information from any location that enables the user to access the network . The communication protocol between the issuer (e.g. , , ) and the aggregator  via the network  may use conventional session-level protocols (e.g., SOAP\/XML, SMTP, and the like) and\/or transport level internet protocols (e.g., TCP\/IP, UDP\/IP, and the like). These communication protocols may be abstracted and made exportable via means such as an application programming interface (API) that may use the underlying session-level and transportation protocols. The aggregator  may offer a presentation layer based interface to the issuer  via a single sign-on (SSO) technology (or similar technology). For example, when the user  access a user interface via the issuer , the user interface may be temporarily redirected to the aggregator  to perform certain operations. The aggregator may also offer a presentation layer user interface via a rich-client or a web application to enable an issuer to manually send data to a user. A communication protocol between the user computing devices  and  and the aggregator  via the network  may use access protocols consistent with the nature of the communication component in the computing device (e.g., wired, wireless, and the like) and the nature of the access link between the computing devices  and  and the network . The aggregator  may enable issuers (e.g., the issuers , , or ) to send data (e.g., the data , , , or ) via one or more mechanisms, including but not limited to application programming interfaces (APIs), a web service, plug-in modules, or other mechanisms.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","116","112","116","202","112","112","202","102","114","112","204","116","112","124","124","116"]},"The issuer  may register with the aggregator  to enable the issuer  to send data associated with users, such as clients of the first issuer . To register with the aggregator , the first issuer  may send an issuer registration request  to the aggregator . In response, the aggregator  may send the first issuer  issuer registration data . The issuer registration data  may include an issuer identifier that is associated with the issuer that enables the aggregator  to authenticate an identity of the first issuer .","The first user  may desire to have data provided by the first issuer  sent directly to the aggregator . The first user  may provide the first issuer  with at least a portion of the user registration data  to enable the first issuer  to access the first user account  associated with the first user . In some cases, when the first user  registers with the aggregator , the first user  may provide the aggregator  with issuer-related information, such as with which issuers the first user  is associated. The aggregator  may use the issuer-related information to instruct issuers to provide data associated with the first user  to the aggregator . For example, the first user  may provide the aggregator  with the names of financial institutions (e.g., with which the first user  has accounts) and account information, such as an account number, a type of account (e.g., checking savings, credit card and the like), other account-related information (e.g., social security number), or any combination thereof. The aggregator  may automatically notify issuers, such as the first issuer , that the first user  has authorized the aggregator  to receive data associated with the first issuer  from the issuers. The aggregator  may provide the issuers with account-related information specifying the accounts associated with the first user  for which the aggregator  is to receive data.","When the first issuer  sends the first data  to the aggregator , the first data  may include the issuer identifier , account access data , a storage location , other information (e.g. tags) or any combination thereof. In response to receiving the first data , the aggregator  may authenticate an identity of the first user  based on the issuer identifier . The aggregator  may use the account access data  to identify the first user account  associated with the first user . Based on the storage location , the aggregator  may place a portion of the first data  into an appropriate location of the first user account .","The first user account  may include multiple records containing multiple data items organized in a hierarchical structure. For example, at a first level, the first user account  may include healthcare records  and financial records . Additional directories may be placed at a second level that is hierarchically below the first level. For example, the healthcare records  may include doctor records , dentist records , or ophthalmologist records . For example, the doctor records  may include records received from a healthcare issuer that include doctor-provided data associated with the first user . The dentist records  may include dentist-provided data associated with the first user . The ophthalmologist records  may include data provided by an eye doctor for whom the first user  is a patient.","The financial records  may similarly include additional lower level directories. For example, the financial records  may include bank records , investment records , credit card records , other financial record directories, or any combination thereof. The bank records  may be used to store data provided by financial institutions where the first user  has bank accounts. The investment records  may be used to store investment records provided by financial institutions where the first user  has investment accounts. The credit card records  may include additional directories, such as credit card records provided by one or more credit card merchants with which the first user  has an account.","The aggregator  may also include a first user event log  associated with the first user account . The first user event log  may enter a log into the first user event log  when particular events occur, such as when data is received from an issuer. The log may include a time stamp associated with when the data was received, a location identifier identifying a particular location where the data was stored, an issuer identifier, other information related to when data is received and\/or stored, or any combination thereof.","The aggregator  may include default values  that specify various defaults, such as a default location to store data. For example, when the first user  registers with the aggregator , the first user  may provide account information associated with accounts that the first user  has with one or more issuers. The aggregator  may create an initial hierarchical account structure based on the account information provided by the first user  and based on the default values . For example, one or more of the healthcare records , the financial records , the doctor records , the bank records , the investment records , or the credit card records  may be default locations that are automatically created when the aggregator  creates a particular user account. After the default hierarchical account structure is created, the first user  may modify the structure to suit their specific needs. In response, the aggregator may physically and\/or logically organize the data to reflect the new user specified structure.","In operation, the aggregator  may receive the first data  from the first issuer . The aggregator  may authenticate the first issuer  based on the issuer identifier . In response to determining that the issuer  is authorized to provide the data for the first user , the aggregator  may identify the first user account  that is associated with the first user . In addition, if configured by the user, the aggregator  may authenticate a restricted public key that the issuer provides in the first data . If the aggregator  cannot authenticate the restricted public key provided by the issuer, the aggregator  may reject the first data  to prevent storing an unauthorized communication (e.g., \u201cspam\u201d). If the aggregator  authenticates the restricted public key provided by the issuer, the aggregator  may store at least a portion of the first data  in the first user account  that is associated with the first user  based on the storage location identifier . For example, when the first issuer  is a credit card provider, the storage location  may specify that the first data  is to be stored in the credit card records . As another example, when the first issuer  is a doctor, the storage location  may instruct the aggregator  to store the first data  in the doctor records . The portion of the first data  that is stored may include document . For example, the document  may be a financial statement, a healthcare statement, or a document issued by a governmental agency (e.g., at the city, state, or Federal level). In some instances, at least a portion of the first data  may be encrypted. In response to determining that the first data  is encrypted, the aggregator  may decrypt the first data  before storing the first data  in the first user account .","A particular user may have relationships with several different types of issuers. A first type of issuer may regularly (e.g., periodically or based on predetermined conditions) may issue documents associated with the user. The first type of issuer may be known as a \u201cregular issuer\u201d or an \u201cauto-issuer\u201d because the issuer regularly and\/or automatically sends data associated with the user to the aggregator . An auto-issuer may chose a programming application programming interface (API) that is either provided by the aggregator  or provided by the issuer. The API may enable a particular issuer to send data automatically (e.g., without human interaction) to one or more user accounts hosted by the aggregator .","A second type of issuer may have a non-regular relationship with the user because the issuer does not regularly generate data associated with the user. For example, the user may travel for business and the user's employer may require the user to submit an expense report for expense reimbursement. As part of the travel, the user may stay at a hotel or eat at a restaurant that the user does not regularly frequent. For example, the hotel or restaurant may be located in a different location (e.g., different city, different state, different country, etc.) from where the user lives. The user may provide the second type of issuer with account access information to enable the second type of issuer to send data associated with one or more transactions to the aggregator . The second type of issuer may not store the account information (e.g., in a user preferences file) for the user because the second type of issuer may not have an on-going relationship with the user. The second type of issuer may be known as a \u201cmanual issuer\u201d or a \u201cnon-regular issuer.\u201d The manual-issuer may use a rich client or a web based application that the aggregator  provides to enable the manual issuer to select the data to be sent to the user's account at the aggregator . The manual issuer may include a restricted public key provided by the user in the data that is sent to the aggregator. Data received from a manual issuer that does not include the user's restricted public key may be considered unwanted (e.g., \u201cspam\u201d) or unauthorized data by the aggregator  and the aggregator  may reject the data or store it in a spam directory in the user's account to enable the user to confirm whether the issuer is an authorized issuer or an unauthorized issuer. Another form manual issuer may be the \u201cself-issuer\u201d, where the issuer and the user to whom the data is being sent are the same person.","Hierarchical Structure of a User Account",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","116","116","124"]},"As illustrated in , a highest level of the first user account  includes the healthcare records directory  and the financial records directory . The healthcare records directory  may include the doctor records directory , the dentist records directory , and the ophthalmologist records directory . The doctor records directory  may include additional directories, such as a blood test records directory , a back injury directory , and an allergies directory . For example, the blood test directory  may be used as a location to store data associated with the results of blood tests ordered by a particular doctor. For example, the blood tests may be organized by date and time, such as an ascending or descending order, based on the date. The blood test directory  may include blood test data  and blood test data . The blood test data  may include data from a blood test that was performed on a first particular date. The blood test data  may include data from a blood test that was performed on a second particular date. The blood test data  may have one or more tags  associated with it (e.g., \u201cfasting glucose\u201d, \u201cwhite cell count\u201d and the like). The blood test data  may have one or more associated tags . The tags  or  may be associated with the blood test data  or  by the issuer (e.g., based on user preferences, such as the user preferences , , , , , or ), by the aggregator  (e.g., based on the user profiles ), or both. The back injury  directory may include injury data , such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, or other related data, and have associated tags . The allergies directory  may include allergy data  and allergy data . The allergy data  may have associated tags  and the allergy data  may have associated tags .","The financial records  may include lower-level directories, such as the bank records  directory, the investment records  directory, and the credit card records  directory. The locations , , and  may include additional lower-level directories. For example, the bank records  may include monthly statements . The monthly statements  may include a December statement  and a November statement . The December statement  may have associated tags  and the November statement  may have associated tags . The investment records  may include additional directories, such as Individual Retirement Account (IRA) records  and (K) records . The credit card records  may include a December statement  and a November statement . The December statement  may have associated tags  and the November statement  may have associated tags .","The first user account  may include a navigation tool  that enables the user to sort, filter, or search data items stored in the first user account . For example, the navigation tool  may include a filter , a from-date , a to-date , search engine  an issuer name , and a tag search . Of course, the navigation tool  may include other types of navigational tools instead of or in addition to those illustrated in . The navigation tool  may enable the user to filter data items in the first user account  based on a date range, such as between the from-date  to the to-date . For example, the user may be able to identify data items stored in the last twenty-four hours, in the last week, in the last month, in the last quarter, in the last year, and the like.","The search engine  may enable the user to enter one or more search terms to identify particular data items that match the search terms and that are stored in the first user account . For example, the search engine  may be used to search for the name of a particular data item or the contents of a particular data item. The issuer name  may enable the user to enter an issuer identifier to display data items received from specified issuers. The tag search  may enable the user to enter particular tags to be used to search and display data items that include those particular tags. In particular, the tags may enable the user to associate tags that are meaningful to the user and use the tags to filter and search the data. Because the tags are meaningful to the user, the user may be able to navigate, filter, and\/or search the contents of the user's account more easily than if the user has to try and remember terms in the documents that are provided by the issuer of the documents.","Thus, a user account provided by the aggregator  may be hierarchically organized and used to store data items received from multiple issuers. The user account may provide navigational tools that enable the user to search or filter the items stored in the user account and display only those data items that match the specified criteria.","Modular Software Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402","112","114","402","404","406","408","408","410","404","402","102","104","106","108","110","402"]},"The aggregator  may include one or more servers . Each of the servers  may include one or more processors , a communication interface , and a memory  The communication interface  may enable the aggregator  to communicate with issuers and users via the network .","The memory  may include various modules that include instructions executable by the one or processors  to perform the various functions of the aggregator . For example, the memory  may include an issuer registration module , a subscriber registration module , a data placement module , an authentication module , a search module , a notification module , a default settings , the user profile , a logger module , an analysis module , a graphing module , a filtering module , other modules , or any combination thereof.","The issuer registration module  may be used to receive a registration request from an issuer and to send issuer registration data that includes an issuer identifier. The subscriber registration module  may be used to register users. For example, the subscriber registration module  may receive a registration request from a user. In response, the subscriber registration module  may create a user account for the user and provide user account data to the user to enable the user to access the user's account. The data placement module  may determine where to place a particular data item that is received from an issuer. For example, the data placement module  may use the storage location , the user profile , or other user preferences to determine a location to store data. The authentication module  may be used to authenticate an issuer, such as one of the issuers ,  or  when the issuer sends data to the aggregator  or to authenticate a user, such as the users  or , when the user logs in to manage their account.","The search module  may enable a user to search the user's account to identify items that match the search criteria. The notification module  may send a notification, such as the notification , to a user in response to the aggregator receiving and\/or storing a data item. The notification  may be sent when conditions specified in a user profile associated with the user, such as the user profile , are satisfied. The default settings  may be used to provide default settings for users when an account is initially created. The default settings  may also identify default locations to store data. The default settings  may be overridden by the user profile or the user preferences. The logger module  may be used to generate a log events when the aggregator  performs an action, such as receiving data, storing data, deleting data, moving data, and other account-related actions. For example, when the aggregator performs an action with data associated with the first user , the logger module  may generate a log and store the log in the first user event log .","The analysis module  may analyze at least a portion of the data items in a user account. For example, the analysis module  may keep metrics associated with data received by each user, such as the number of files received from auto issuers, the number of files received from manual issuers, the number of files received from financial institutions etc. As an another example, the analysis module  may be used to analyze the performance of a stock portfolio over a specified period of time, track doctor visits over a specified period of time, track vehicle maintenance over a specified period of time, etc. For example, the analysis module  may analyze the records associated with the maintenance of a vehicle to determine when it would be cheaper for the user to buy a new car then to continue maintenance of an older car. The graphing module  may be used to graph the output of the analysis module . For example, the graphing module  may display a graph of the performance of a stock portfolio of a user. The filtering module  may be used to filter data items based on tags, data ranges, or other user specified criteria. The other modules  may implement other functions and services that the aggregator  may offer.","The processors  or  may be a single processing unit or a number of processing units, all of which may include single or multiple computing units or multiple cores. The processors  or  can be implemented as one or more microprocessors, microcomputers, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, central processing units, state machines, logic circuitries, and\/or any devices that manipulate signals based on operational instructions. Among other capabilities, the processors  or  can be configured to fetch and execute computer-readable instructions stored in the memory  or , mass storage devices, or other computer-readable media.","Memory  and  are examples of computer storage media for storing instructions which are executed by the processors  and  to perform the various functions described above. For example, memory  and  may generally include both volatile memory and non-volatile memory (e.g., RAM, ROM, or the like) as well as, mass storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, removable media, including external and removable drives, memory cards, flash memory, floppy disks, optical disks (e.g., CD, DVD), a storage array, a network attached storage, a storage area network, or the like.
