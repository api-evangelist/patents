The government has certain rights in the described subject matter.","This Application is related to PCT Patent Application, Serial Number PCT\/US10\/31790 by Zhiyong Li, et al., filed on Apr. 20, 2010, entitled \u201cMULTI-PILLAR STRUCTURE FOR MOLECULAR ANALYSIS,\u201d and assigned to the assignee of the present technology. This Application is also related to PCT Patent Application, Serial Number PCT\/US10\/31809 by Zhiyong Li, et al., filed on Apr. 20, 2010, entitled \u201cA SELF-ARRANGING, LUMINESCENCE-ENHANCEMENT DEVICE FOR SURFACE-ENHANCED LUMINESCENCE,\u201d and assigned to the assignee of the present technology.","Embodiments of the present technology relate generally to devices for surface-enhanced luminescence.","Surface-enhanced luminescence techniques, such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), have emerged as leading-edge techniques for the analysis of the structure of inorganic materials and complex organic molecules. For example, in SERS, scientists engaged in the application of Raman spectroscopy have found that by decorating a surface, upon which a molecule is later adsorbed, with a thin layer of a metal in which surface plasmons have frequencies in a range of electromagnetic radiation used to excite such a molecule and in which surface plasmons have frequencies in a range of electromagnetic radiation emitted by such a molecule, it is possible to enhance the intensity of a Raman spectrum of such a molecule.","In addition, spectroscopists utilizing spectroscopic techniques for the analysis of molecular structures have a continuing interest in improving the sensitivity of their spectroscopic techniques. Not only is improved sensitivity desirable for reducing the time of analysis, but also improved sensitivity can provide previously unachievable results. For example, improved sensitivity is directly related to lower detectability limits for previously undetected molecular constituents. Thus, scientists engaged in the application of surface-enhanced luminescence techniques are motivated to improve the sensitivity of surface-enhanced luminescence techniques, for example, SERS, for the detection of molecules and the spectral signatures of moieties in these molecules.","The drawings referred to in this description should not be understood as being drawn to scale except if specifically noted.","Reference will now be made in detail to the alternative examples of the present technology. While the technology will be described in conjunction with the alternative examples, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the technology to these examples. On the contrary, the technology is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the technology as defined by the appended claims.","Furthermore, in the following description of examples of the present technology, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However, it should be noted that examples of the present technology may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well known methods, procedures, and components have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure examples of the present technology. Throughout the drawings, like components are denoted by like reference numerals, and repetitive descriptions are omitted for clarity of explanation if not necessary. As used herein, the articles, \u201ca\u201d and \u201can,\u201d will also be understood as including the plural referents. Also, as used herein, the article, \u201cthe,\u201d and \u201csaid\u201d will also be understood as including the plural referents.","Examples of the present technology include an asymmetrical-nanofinger device for surface-enhanced luminescence. The asymmetrical-nanofinger device for surface-enhanced luminescence includes a substrate, and a plurality of nanofingers coupled with the substrate. The plurality of nanofingers includes at least one primary nanofinger having a primary active-material cap, and at least one secondary nanofinger having a secondary active-material cap. A nanofinger of the plurality includes a flexible column, and an active-material cap coupled to a tip of the flexible column. An average diameter of the primary active-material cap is substantially greater than an average diameter of the secondary active-material cap. At least the primary nanofinger and at least the secondary nanofinger of the plurality of nanofingers are to self-arrange into a close-packed configuration with at least one analyte molecule disposed between at least the primary active-material cap and at least the secondary active-material cap. Examples of the present technology also include a method for fabricating the asymmetrical-nanofinger device, and an optical apparatus including an optical component that includes the asymmetrical-nanofinger device.","With reference now to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a perspective view  is shown of an asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence. The asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence includes a substrate , and a plurality  of nanofingers, for example, nanofingers -, -, -, - and -, coupled with the substrate . The plurality  of nanofingers includes at least one primary nanofinger - of the plurality  having a primary active-material cap -B, and at least one secondary nanofinger - of the plurality  having a secondary active-material cap -B. A primary nanofinger - of the plurality  includes a primary flexible column -A, and a primary active-material cap -B. Similarly, other nanofingers, for example, nanofingers -, -, - and -, of the plurality  include flexible columns, for example, flexible columns -A, -A, -A and -A, respectively, and active-material caps, for example, active-material caps -B, -B, -B and -B, respectively. Thus, secondary nanofinger - of the plurality  includes a secondary flexible column -A, and a secondary active-material cap -B.","As shown in , by way of example, a row of nanofingers includes nanofingers -, -, -, - and -, without limitation thereto; and, by way of example, an array of nanofingers includes several rows, without limitation thereto. Thus, in accordance with one example of the present technology, the plurality  of nanofingers includes the array of nanofingers including several rows of nanofingers. However, other arrangements of nanofingers that are less well-ordered than shown in  are also within the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology. The arrangement shown in  is illustrative of but one example of an arrangement of the plurality  of nanofingers in an asymmetrical-nanofinger device  as may be fabricated in a top-down fabrication procedure, which employs a reticulated mask in a photolithographic process; but, other methods of fabrication are also within the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology, which are subsequently described.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the nanofingers in the plurality  of nanofingers have active-material caps, for example, active-material caps -B through -B, that may have different average diameters. As shown in , active-material caps -B, -B, -B and -B have an average diameter substantially greater than an average diameter of active-material caps -B, -B, -B through -B, -B, -B, and -B through -B. In particular, in accordance with one example of the present technology, by way of example without limitation thereto, an average diameter  of the primary active-material cap -B is substantially greater than an average diameter  of the secondary active-material cap -B. Similarly, in one example of the present technology, by way of example without limitation thereto, an average diameter  of the primary flexible column -A is substantially greater than an average diameter  of the secondary flexible column -A.","Although, by way of example without limitation thereto, the diameters of the active-material caps, for example, active-material caps -B through -B, are shown as being substantially greater than respective diameters of tips of their respective flexible columns, for example, respective flexible columns -A through -A, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the diameter of an active-material cap may be only slightly larger than a diameter of a tip of its respective flexible column, for example, as shown in ,  and . In accordance with examples of the present technology, a diameter of an active-material cap that is only slightly larger than a diameter of a tip of its respective flexible column may be fabricated, as subsequently described in the discussion of , by the deposition of thin films of active material having thickness on the order of a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers on the tips of respective flexible columns to produce active-material caps with a disk-like shape, by way of example without limitation thereto. Thus, in  the active-material caps are shown having an ellipsoidal shape suggestive of a disk-like shape, which is by way of example without limitation thereto, as other shapes of active-material caps are also within the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology.","As described herein, the term of art, \u201cprimary,\u201d refers to nanofingers, active-material caps, tips, and flexible columns of respective nanofingers that have a respective active-material cap with an average diameter substantially greater than an average diameter of a secondary active-material cap; and, the term of art, \u201csecondary,\u201d refers to nanofingers, active-material caps, tips, and flexible columns of respective nanofingers that have a respective active-material cap with an average diameter substantially lesser than an average diameter of a primary active-material cap. Thus, active-material caps -B, -B, -B and -B may be referred to herein as primary active-material caps; and, active-material caps -B, -B, -B through -B, -B, -B, and -B through -B may be referred to herein as secondary active-material caps. Similarly, of the flexible columns labeled in , so as not to make the figure overly busy, flexible columns -B and -B may be referred to herein as primary flexible columns; and, flexible columns -B, -B and -B may be referred to herein as secondary flexible columns.","In addition, as described herein, the term of art, \u201csubstantially greater than,\u201d refers to a dimension of a component part of a nanofinger, for example, a flexible column, or an active-material cap, that is greater than a corresponding dimension of a corresponding component part of another nanofinger, with which it is compared, by an amount that is greater than the variability of the dimension of the component part expected due to statistical variations alone of a dimension of a component part fabricated to have a constant dimension in an associated manufacturing process. Conversely, as described herein, \u201csubstantially lesser than,\u201d refers to a dimension of a component part of a nanofinger, for example, a flexible column, or an active-material cap, that is less than a corresponding dimension of a corresponding component part of another nanofinger, with which it is compared, by an absolute amount that is greater than the variability of the dimension of the component part expected due to statistical variations alone of a dimension of a component part fabricated to have a constant dimension in an associated manufacturing process.","Therefore, in accordance with another example of the present technology, the respective component parts of the plurality  of nanofingers may be fabricated not having all of certain dimensions made uniformly constant, for example, average diameters of all the active-material caps; but rather, the plurality  of nanofingers may be fabricated to include at least two populations of nanofingers: at least a plurality of primary nanofingers, and at least a plurality of secondary nanofingers. Thus, as certain dimensions of component parts of the plurality of primary nanofingers is substantially greater than certain corresponding dimensions of corresponding component parts of the plurality of secondary nanofingers, the inventor has used the figurative term of art, \u201casymmetrical-nanofinger,\u201d to describe examples of the present technology for the asymmetrical-nanofinger device. On the other hand, with reference to , in accordance with an example of the present technology, by way of example without limitation thereto, an average height  of the primary flexible column -A may be about equal to an average height  of the secondary flexible column -A.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a nanofinger, for example, primary nanofinger -, of the plurality  of nanofingers is shown with a shape resembling what may be figuratively described as, a \u201cmushroom,\u201d which is by way of example without limitation thereto. However, in accordance with examples of the present technology, a nanofinger is not limited to having such a shape, as other shapes are also within the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology. Moreover, by way of example, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the flexible columns may have the form of nanocones, as shown in , without limitation thereto; but, more generally, the flexible columns may be selected from the group consisting of: nanocones, nanopyramids, nanorods, nanobars, nanopoles and nanograss, without limitation thereto. As used herein, the terms of art, \u201cnanocones, nanopyramids, nanorods, nanobars, nanopoles and nanograss,\u201d refer to structures that are substantially: conical, pyramidal, rod-like, bar-like, pole-like and grass-like, respectively, which have nano-dimensions as small as a few tens of nanometers (nm) in height and a few nanometers in diameter, or width. For example, flexible columns may include nano-columns having the following dimensions: a diameter of 50 nm to 500 nm, a height of 50 nm to 2 micrometers (\u03bcm), and a gap between flexible columns of 20 nm to 500 nm. The terms of art, substantially conical, substantially pyramidal, substantially rod-like, substantially bar-like, substantially pole-like and substantially grass-like, means that the structures have nearly the respective shapes of cones, pyramids, rods, bars, poles and grass-like asperities within the limits of fabrication with nanotechnology.","Furthermore, by way of example, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the active-material caps may have the form of oblate nanospheroids, as shown in , without limitation thereto; but, more generally, the active-material caps may be selected from the group consisting of: nanospheres, prolate nanospheroids, oblate nanospheroids, nanodisks, and nanoplates, without limitation thereto. As used herein, the terms of art, \u201cnanospheres, prolate nanospheroids, oblate nanospheroids, nanodisks, and nanoplates,\u201d refer to structures that are substantially: spherical, prolate spheroidal, oblate spheroidal, disk-like, and plate-like, respectively, which have nano-dimensions as small as a few nanometers in size: height, diameter, or width. For example, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the diameter of the active-material caps is on the order of 20 nm to 500 nm. In addition, the terms of art, substantially spherical, substantially prolate spheroidal, substantially oblate spheroidal, substantially disk-like, and substantially and plate-like, means that the structures have nearly the respective shapes of spheres, prolate spheroids, oblate spheroids, disks, and plates within the limits of fabrication with nanotechnology. Thus, in accordance with one example of the present technology, a shape of the primary active-material cap -B may be substantially spherical. Similarly, in accordance with another example of the present technology, a shape of the secondary active-material cap -B may also be substantially spherical.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the primary active-material cap -B is coupled to a primary tip -C (not shown in , but see ) of the primary flexible column -A. Similarly, other active-material caps, for example, active-material caps -B, -B, -B and -B, are coupled to tips, for example, tips -C, -C, -C and -C, respectively, (not shown in , but see ) of flexible columns, for example, flexible columns -A, -A, -A and -A, respectively. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the secondary active-material cap -B is coupled to a secondary tip -C (not shown in , but see ) of the secondary flexible column -A.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at least one primary active-material cap -B of a plurality  of active-material caps may be disposed adjacent to secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B that are disposed as satellites proximate to the primary active-material cap -B. By way of example without limitation thereto, primary active-material cap -B is surrounded by secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B, -B, -B, -B and -B that are disposed as satellites proximate to the primary active-material cap -B. In this regard, secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B and -B are disposed as first nearest neighbors to the primary active-material cap -B; and, secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B, and -B are disposed as second nearest neighbors to the primary active-material cap -B. Similarly, by way of example without limitation thereto, primary active-material cap -B is partially surrounded by secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B that are disposed as satellites proximate to the primary active-material cap -B. Also, by way of example without limitation thereto, primary active-material cap -B is disposed adjacent to secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B that are disposed as satellites proximate to the primary active-material cap -B. Although the plurality  (See ) of active-material caps is shown arranged in a square lattice, this is by way of example, without limitation thereto as other arrangements are also within the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a plurality of interstices is disposed between active-material caps of the plurality  of nanofingers. For example, a small interstice  is located between primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B. By way of further example, an interstice of a different kind, a large interstice , is located between four active-material caps: secondary active-material caps -B, -B and -B, and primary active-material cap -B. Such interstices are to receive molecules (not shown, but see ) for the purpose of surface-enhanced luminescence.","As used herein, the term of art, \u201csurface-enhanced luminescence,\u201d also embraces within the scope of its meaning surface-enhanced Raman emission, as in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and surface-enhanced fluorescence. In accordance with examples of the present technology, at least one primary active-material cap -B of a plurality  (see ) of active-material caps is to enhance luminescence from a molecule - (not shown, but see ) disposed in close proximity to the primary active-material cap -B. In accordance with examples of the present technology, at least the primary nanofinger - and a secondary nanofinger - of the plurality  are to self-arrange into a close-packed configuration with at least one molecule - (not shown, but see ) disposed between at least the primary active-material cap -B and a secondary active-material cap -B of respectively primary nanofinger - and secondary nanofinger -, for example, at the location of the small interstice , as is next described with the aid of a cross-section through line -.","With reference now to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a cross-sectional elevation view  is shown of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  through line - of .  shows a row of nanofingers -, -, -, - and - in profile; nanofingers -, -, -, - and - include flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, and active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B, respectively. As shown in , the range of flexibility of each of the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A is indicated by the example double headed arrow , which is shown overlaying flexible column -A. As further shown in , the row of nanofingers -, -, -, - and - of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  is to come into contact with a fluid carrier  carrying a plurality  of molecules, for example, molecules - and -. The fluid carrier  includes a fluid  and the plurality  of molecules, for example, molecules - and -.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, by way of example, the fluid carrier  may be in motion, without limitation thereto, as indicated by flow vectors, of which flow vector - is an example; such a configuration might be suitable for sampling an environment with the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for the presence of a suspect molecule. Alternatively, the fluid carrier  may be static without motion, as might be the case for immersion of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  in a solution, including the fluid carrier , containing an analyte and the fluid  and molecules of which the analyte is composed. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the term of art, \u201cfluid,\u201d is used in a general sense so that the fluid  may be a liquid, or alternatively, a gas. Thus, the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  is to receive molecules of an analyte for spectroscopic analysis as is SERS, surface-enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy, or other surface-enhanced luminescence applications.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, an analyte molecule - may approach the site of an interstice, for example, interstice , where adjacent active-material caps, for example, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, are separated by a distance . In accordance with an example of the present technology, an active-material cap, for example, secondary active-material cap -B, of the plurality  of nanofingers is to bind to a molecule - disposed in close proximity to the secondary active-material cap -B. By way of example, such binding may occur through Van der Waals forces between the secondary active-material cap -B and the molecule -, without limitation thereto; or alternatively, such binding may occur through other types of binding forces, such as surface physisorption or surface chemisorption of the molecule by the secondary active-material cap -B, without limitation thereto. Once the molecule is bound to an active-material cap, for example, secondary active-material cap -B, and\/or primary active-material cap -B, in accordance with an example of the present technology, at least one active-material cap, for example, secondary active-material cap -B, and\/or primary active-material cap -B, of a plurality  (see ) of active-material caps is to enhance luminescence from the molecule - disposed in close proximity to the secondary active-material cap -B, and\/or primary active-material cap -B.","Moreover, in accordance with another example of the present technology, at least one active-material cap, for example, secondary active-material cap -B, and\/or primary active-material cap -B, of the plurality  (see ) of active-material caps may be composed of a constituent that enhances surface luminescence, such as an active material selected from the group consisting of copper (Cu), silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), platinum (Pt) and gold (Au), or any combination of Cu, Ag, Al, Pt and Au, without limitation thereto. As used herein, the term of art, \u201cactive-material,\u201d refers to a material that can support formation of surface plasmons in an active-material cap, for example, a primary active-material cap -B, and\/or a secondary active-material cap -B, to enhance the local electromagnetic field for surface-enhanced luminescence, as for example, in SERS, without limitation thereto. In accordance with another example of the present technology, at least one primary active-material cap -B, and\/or secondary active-material cap -B, of the plurality  of active-material caps may include a layered structure including a plurality of metallic layers, such that a metallic layer of the plurality of metallic layers is composed of a constituent selected from the group consisting of Cu, Ag, Al, Pt and Au, or any combination of Cu, Ag, Al, Pt and Au.","Furthermore, in accordance with another example of the present technology, the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A of the plurality  of nanofingers -, -, -, - and - further include a flexible material selected from the group, which includes both dielectric and non-dielectric materials, consisting of a highly cross-linked uv-curable or thermal-curable polymer, a highly cross-linked uv-curable or thermal-curable plastic, a polysiloxane compound, silicon, silicon dioxide, spin-on glass, a sol-gel material, silicon nitride, diamond, diamond-like carbon, aluminum oxide, sapphire, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide, the purpose of which is next described.","With reference now to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a cross-sectional elevation view  is shown of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  through line - of .  shows nanofingers -, -, - and - self-arranging into close-packed configurations with molecules, for example, molecule -, disposed between primary active-material cap -B of primary nanofinger - and secondary active-material cap -B of secondary nanofinger -, and, for example, molecule -, disposed between primary active-material cap -B of primary nanofinger - and secondary active-material cap -B of secondary nanofinger -. Because the flexible columns -A, -A, -A and -A of the plurality  of nanofingers include a flexible, or compliant, material as described above, in accordance with an example of the present technology, at least one secondary flexible column -A is to bend towards at least a primary flexible column -A, and to dispose the molecule - in close proximity with at least the primary active-material cap -B on the primary flexible column -A. Alternatively, at least one primary flexible column -A may bend towards at least a secondary flexible column -A, and dispose a molecule, such as molecule -, in close proximity with at least the secondary active-material cap -B on the secondary flexible column -A. However, as a primary flexible column has a substantially larger diameter than a secondary flexible column, the secondary flexible column is expected to be more compliant and bend easier than the primary flexible column.","In the case where the fluid carrier  includes a liquid, small amounts of liquid, for example, liquid pools  and , may remain trapped between the flexible columns, for example, primary flexible column -A and secondary flexible column -A, and secondary flexible column -A and primary flexible column -A, respectively, which give rise to microcapillary forces exerted upon the flexible columns; the microcapillary forces serve to draw together the flexible columns, for example, primary flexible column -A and secondary flexible column -A, and secondary flexible column -A and primary flexible column -A, as the liquid evaporates. For example, evaporation of the liquid from liquid pool  allows the primary nanofinger - and secondary nanofinger - to self-arrange into a close-packed configuration with at least one molecule - disposed between at least the primary active-material cap -B and the secondary active-material cap -B of respectively primary nanofinger - and secondary nanofinger -.","Thus, with further reference to , in the case where the fluid carrier  includes a liquid, in accordance with examples of the present technology, at least the secondary flexible column -A is to bend towards the primary flexible column -A under action of microcapillary forces induced by removal of the fluid , a liquid, provided to carry the molecule - into proximity with the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B. In accordance with another example of the present technology, a spacing  of the close-packed configuration between the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B with a molecule, for example, molecule -, disposed between the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B is determined by a balance of binding forces, between the molecule - and the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, with restoring forces exerted by at least the secondary flexible column -A due to displacement of the secondary flexible column -A towards the primary flexible column -A. Thus, in accordance with an example of the present technology, the spacing  approaches a limit determined by the size of the molecule -, which may be as small as 0.5 nm; the spacing  approaches the physical limit of the smallest possible separation between primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B. The close proximity of the primary active-material cap -B to the secondary active-material cap -B enables the active-material caps act as two antennas approaching the largest coupling that may be possible between at least two such antennas for surface-enhanced luminescence. Moreover, the effect of coupling more than two active-material caps acting as antennas is also within the spirit and scope examples of the present technology, which is next described.","With reference now to  and further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, another perspective view  is shown of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  of . As shown in , some of the nanofingers of the plurality  have self-arranged into close-packed configurations with molecules, for example, molecules -, - and , disposed between the active-material caps, for example, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, and primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material caps -B, -B and -B, respectively. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the corresponding flexible columns coupled with the active-material caps have bent towards adjacent flexible columns, as might occur under action of microcapillary forces induced by removal of the fluid , which in this case is a liquid.","For example, the small interstices, similar to interstice , are to capture smaller molecules, for example, molecules - and -; and, the large interstices, similar to interstice , are to capture larger molecules, for example, molecule . In accordance with examples of the present technology, the size of the molecules captured is determined by the self-arranging spacing between the active-material caps, for example, the spacing  of the close-packed configuration between the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B with the molecule - disposed between the primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B. By way of example, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the size of the self-arranging spacing may be on the order of 2 nm, without limitation thereto. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  may provide a substrate to capture molecules of various sizes from a solution carrying an analyte of at least one particular molecular species. For example, the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  may then be used in SERS analysis of the captured molecules of an analyte, which is next described in greater detail.","With reference now to  and further reference to ,  and , in accordance with other examples of the present technology, a schematic diagram  is shown of an optical apparatus . As shown in , the optical apparatus  includes an optical component  that includes the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence of . By way of example, in accordance with one example of the present technology, an example configuration is shown for SERS, without limitation thereto, of molecules disposed between the active-material caps of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device . In accordance with examples of the present technology, the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence includes a substrate , and a plurality  of nanofingers coupled with the substrate .","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality  of nanofingers includes at least one primary nanofinger - having a primary active-material cap -B, and at least one secondary nanofinger - having a secondary active-material cap -B. In accordance with examples of the present technology, an average diameter  of the primary active-material cap -B is substantially greater than an average diameter  of the secondary active-material cap -B. In accordance with examples of the present technology, at least the primary nanofinger - and at least the secondary nanofinger - of the plurality  of nanofingers are to self-arrange into a close-packed configuration with at least one analyte molecule - disposed between at least the primary active-material cap -B and at least the secondary active-material cap -B. Thus, previously described examples of the present technology for the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  may be incorporated within the environments of the optical component  and the optical apparatus , without limitation thereto. Moreover, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the optical component  may be selected from the group consisting of a mirror, a grating, a wave-guide, a cuvette, a test strip, and an analytical cell.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the optical apparatus  may include a luminescence analyzer, such that the luminescence analyzer is to accept the optical component  for measuring surface-enhanced luminescence from a molecule, for example, molecule , and\/or molecules - and -. By way of another example, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the optical apparatus  may include a spectrometer, for example, a Raman spectrometer, without limitation thereto.  shows the configuration of the optical apparatus  including a spectrometer to accept the optical component  for performing spectroscopy, for example, SERS, of at least one molecule, for example, molecule -, molecule -, or molecule .","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the spectrometer includes a source  of exciting electromagnetic radiation  that is used to excite at least one molecule, for example, molecule . The source  of exciting electromagnetic radiation  may be a laser (not shown). The energy of a photon of the exciting electromagnetic radiation  is given by Planck's constant times the frequency of the laser source, given by: h\u03bd. In addition, the spectrometer includes an analyzer (not shown) and a detector  that are used to analyze and detect emitted electromagnetic radiation . The emitted electromagnetic radiation  emerges from the molecule  in response to the exciting laser source. For example, in the case of SERS, the energy of a photon of the emitted electromagnetic radiation  from the molecule  is given by Planck's constant times the frequency of the molecular source, given by: h\u03bd=h\u03bd\u00b1h\u0394, where \u03bdis the frequency of the incident laser field and \u0394 the Raman shift, where the plus sign applies to an anti-Stokes type of Raman emission, and the minus sign to a Stokes type of Raman emission. Because of the interaction with surface plasmons excited in the plurality of active-material caps, for example, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material cap -B, and primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material caps -B, -B and -B, of the plurality of nanofingers, the magnitude of the local electric field E, at a molecule for example, molecule -, molecule -, or molecule , respectively, is enhanced compared to the incident field Eof the exciting electromagnetic radiation .","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a secondary active-material cap, for example, one or more of secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B through -B, -B, -B, and -B through -B, may be tuned to a frequency of exciting electromagnetic radiation ; and, the primary active-material cap -B may be tuned to a frequency of emitted electromagnetic radiation . For example, as shown in , a photon of exciting electromagnetic radiation  generated by source  is shown as being incident upon secondary active-material cap -B, where it may be absorbed generating surface plasmons that excite the emission of Raman radiation from molecule ; and, a photon of emitted electromagnetic radiation  is shown as propagating from primary active-material cap -B, from whence it may be detected by detector .","Moreover, with further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, more than one secondary active-material cap may be tuned to the frequency of exciting electromagnetic radiation . For example, secondary active-material caps -B and -B may also be tuned to the frequency of exciting electromagnetic radiation  absorbing photons of exciting electromagnetic radiation  that are absorbed generating surface plasmons in the secondary active-material caps -B and -B that further excite the emission of Raman radiation from molecule . The effect of absorbing additional photons that generate additional plasmons that increase intensity of the excited emission of Raman radiation from a molecule, for example, molecule , is referred to herein by the term of art, \u201cplasmonic focusing.\u201d Thus, at least the plurality of secondary active-material caps -B, -B and -B may participate in a plasmonic focusing effect that excites the emission of Raman radiation from molecule .","For another example, with further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a photon (not shown) of the exciting electromagnetic radiation  generated by source  may be incident upon secondary active-material cap -B, where it may be absorbed generating surface plasmons that excite the emission of Raman radiation from molecule -; and, a photon of emitted electromagnetic radiation  may propagate from primary active-material cap -B, from whence it may be detected by detector . In accordance with examples of the present technology, an average diameter of a secondary active-material cap, for example, average diameter  of secondary active-material cap -B, may be tuned to a frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation ; and, an average diameter of a primary active-material cap, for example, average diameter  of primary active-material cap -B, may be tuned to a frequency of emitted electromagnetic radiation . For example, in accordance with one example of the present technology, an average diameter of a secondary active-material cap may be about 100 nm; and, an average diameter of a primary active-material cap may be about 500 nm to about 800 nm, which would be suitable for a Stokes type Raman emission, where the frequency of the emitted Raman electromagnetic radiation is less than the frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation.","In another alternative example, with further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a primary active-material cap, for example, one or more of primary active-material caps -B -B, -B and -B, may be tuned to a frequency of exciting electromagnetic radiation ; and, a secondary active-material cap, for example, one or more of secondary active-material caps -B, -B, -B through -B, -B, -B, and -B through -B, may be tuned to a frequency of emitted electromagnetic radiation . Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, an average diameter of a primary active-material cap, for example, the average diameter  of the primary active-material cap -B, may be tuned to a frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation ; and an average diameter of a secondary active-material cap, for example, average diameter  of secondary active-material cap -B, may be tuned to a frequency of the emitted electromagnetic radiation . For example, in accordance with one example of the present technology, an average diameter of a secondary active-material cap may be about 100 nm; and, an average diameter of a primary active-material cap may be about 500 nm to about 800 nm, which would be suitable for an anti-Stokes type Raman emission, where the frequency of the emitted Raman electromagnetic radiation is greater than the frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, the composition of an active-material cap is such that the surface plasmons excited in the active-material cap are within the wavelength ranges of the exciting electromagnetic radiation  and the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the molecule ; these wavelength ranges may extend from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality of active-material caps may be composed of a noble metal constituent; or alternatively, the plurality of active-material caps may be composed of a constituent selected from the group of constituents consisting of Cu, Ag, Al, Pt and Au. In accordance with an example of the present technology, the signal associated with the emitted electromagnetic radiation  is amplified by increasing the number of active-material caps in proximity to which a molecule is disposed. Embodiments of the present technology increase the number of active-material caps, for example, primary active-material cap -B and secondary active-material caps -B, -B and -B, in proximity to a molecule, for example, molecule , by employing a plurality  of nanofingers including a plurality  (see ) of a flexible columns upon which the plurality  (see ) of active-material caps are disposed. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, due to the increased number of active-material caps, an increase in the excitation of surface plasmons in proximity to the molecule  is expected to enhance the signal from the molecule  in SERS. Therefore, examples of the present technology provide an asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence, for example, for SERS, without limitation thereto.","With reference now to ,  and , in accordance with yet other examples of the present technology, a schematic diagram  is shown of an example sequence of processing operations, of a method described in , used in fabrication of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  for surface-enhanced luminescence.  shows the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  in a sequence of cross-sectional elevation views, through line - of , at various stages in its fabrication, corresponding to the processing operations of . At , the substrate  is provided upon which the rest of the structure of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  is fabricated. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the substrate may be a material selected from the group consisting of silicon, glass, quartz, silicon nitride, sapphire, aluminum oxide, diamond, diamond-like carbon, one or more plastics, and one or more metals and metallic alloys. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the substrate may be in a form selected from the group consisting of a sheet, a wafer, a film and a web. For example, if the substrate is in the form of a web, the substrate may be used as feed stock, as rolls of material in a roll-to-roll fabrication process. For another example, the substrate may be in the form of a flexible polymer film composed of a plastic material, such as polyimide, polyethylene, polypropylene, or some other suitable polymeric plastic. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the substrate may be either rigid, as for a semiconductor wafer, or flexible, as for the web.","With further reference now to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , a cross-sectional elevation view is shown of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  of  at an intermediate stage of fabrication. At , a plurality  of flexible columns, for example, flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, are fabricated on the substrate . Each of the flexible columns of the plurality  of flexible columns, for example, flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, includes a tip of a plurality  of tips, for example, tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality  of flexible columns may be produced utilizing a process selected from the group consisting of growing nanowires on the substrate , etching the substrate , nano-imprinting a coating on the substrate , and hot nano-embossing a coating on the substrate , and the laser interference lithography or photolithography technique on substrate . For example, in growing nanowires to produce the flexible columns, nanowire seeds are deposited onto the substrate , for example, silicon; and, the nanowire is grown during chemical vapor deposition from silane.","By way of another example, at , in etching the substrate to produce the flexible columns, a reactive ion etching (RIE) process may be applied to the substrate , for example, silicon; and, flexible columns, for example, in the form of nanocones, without limitation thereto, are produced by removing material from the substrate  through the action of reactive gaseous species, such as, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or a halogen, in the presence of gaseous nitrogen, argon, or oxygen. By way of yet another example, at , in nanoimprinting the substrate to produce the flexible columns, a thermal or photo-curable thin film, for example, a highly cross-linkable resist material, is applied to the substrate , for example, in the form of a web, to produce a coating on the web; and, flexible columns, for example, in the form of nanopoles, without limitation thereto, are produced by rolling the web between a pair of rolls, one of which is a die having a relief pattern that is impressed into the highly viscous thin film coating of the web leaving a negative of the relief pattern of the die in the form of a plurality of nanopoles on the web, substrate , either through thermal or photo-curing process. By way of yet a further example, at , with further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, in hot nano-embossing a coating on the substrate , a polymer, or plastic, is applied to the substrate  to produce a coating on the substrate ; and, flexible columns, for example, in the form of nanopoles, without limitation thereto, are produced by hot embossing the coating with a die, which has a relief pattern that is impressed into the polymer, or plastic, that coats the substrate  leaving a negative of the relief pattern of the die in the form of a plurality of nanopoles on the substrate .","As shown in , at , the fabricated nanopoles may be fabricated with two different average diameters  and  depending on the diameter of corresponding features produced in the die to produce respectively primary flexible columns, for example, primary flexible columns -A and -A, and secondary flexible columns, for example, secondary flexible columns -A, -A and -A. Also, the plurality  of flexible columns may be fabricated so that an average height  of a primary flexible column, for example, primary flexible column -A, is about equal to an average height  of a secondary flexible column, for example, secondary flexible column -A. By way of example, the flexible columns in  are shown as having the morphology of truncated cones; but, other shapes may be produced depending upon corresponding features fabricated in the die, being also with the spirit and scope of examples of the present technology. In particular, flexible columns having the shape of pyramids, or truncated pyramids, may be fabricated. The average diameters, for example, average diameters  and , of the plurality  of flexible columns in proximity to the plurality  of tips of the plurality  of flexible columns provides a template that determines the subsequent respective average diameters, for example, respective average diameters  and , of the plurality  of active-material caps fabricated on the plurality  of flexible columns.","In accordance with examples of the present technology, a diameter of an active-material cap that is only slightly larger than a diameter of a tip of its respective flexible column may be fabricated, as subsequently described in the of the deposition of thin films of active material having thickness on the order of a few nanometers to a few tens of nanometers on the tips of respective flexible columns to produce active-material caps with a disk-like shape, by way of example without limitation thereto. In this way, the tips of the flexible columns provide a template for the further growth of the active-material caps, whose size is determined by both the amount of thin-film material deposited, as well as the sizes of the underlying tips of the flexible columns. Also, although the term of art, \u201caverage diameter,\u201d is used herein, this is by way of example without limitation thereto, as the term of art, \u201csize,\u201d and\/or \u201caverage lateral dimension,\u201d may also be understood to describe the various size relationships between component parts of a nanofinger, instead of \u201caverage diameter.\u201d Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, active-material caps of different average diameters may be fabricated, for example, a primary active-material cap -B with an average diameter  greater than the average diameter of  of a secondary active-material cap , because the thickness of the layers of metal deposited on the plurality  of tips, for example, tips of truncated cones, is about the same in each of the active-material caps of the plurality  of active-material caps, the fabrication of which is next described.","With further reference now to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , a cross-sectional elevation view is shown of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  of  nearing a final stage in fabrication. At , the fabrication of a plurality  of nanofingers, for example, nanofingers -, -, -, - and -, is completed on the substrate . Each of the nanofingers, for example, nanofingers -, -, -, - and -, includes a flexible column of the plurality  of flexible columns, for example, flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, and an active-material cap of a plurality  of active-material caps, for example, active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B, such that each active-material cap is disposed upon a tip of the plurality  of tips, for example, tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C, respectively. Thus, in accordance with examples of the present technology, at least one primary nanofinger - of the plurality  includes the primary flexible column -A that has the primary tip -C coupled to the primary active-material cap -B; and, at least one secondary nanofinger - of the plurality  includes a secondary flexible column -A that has a secondary tip -C coupled to the secondary active-material cap -B. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality  of active-material caps of the plurality  of nanofingers may be produced utilizing a process selected from the group consisting of evaporating an active-material cap, electroplating an active-material cap, precipitating an active-material cap from a colloidal suspension of metallic nanoparticles, lifting-off portions of a deposited metallic layer to form an active-material cap, and reducing adsorbed metalo-organic compounds by energetic particle bombardment to form an active-material cap.","For example, with further reference to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , in evaporating to produce the active-material caps, a stream of metal vapor  may be produced, using thin-film vacuum-evaporation techniques, to deposit metal onto the plurality  of tips of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. The plurality  of active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B are grown from the metal vapor depositing metal onto the plurality  of tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. In accordance with examples of the present technology, fabricating the plurality  of active-material caps may include evaporating metal at an angle  of about 90\u00b0 to a surface of the substrate  onto a plurality  of tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. Alternatively, in another example of the present technology, the angle  may be slightly less than 90\u00b0 and the substrate  may be rotated to provide a more uniform coating on the surface of the plurality  of tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. Moreover, in accordance with examples of the present technology, the size, and consequently the spacing, of the active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B can be controlled by limiting the amount of material deposited from the metallic vapor during the evaporation process.","By way of another example, with further reference to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , in electroplating an active-material cap, the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A may be immersed in a plating solution containing metal cations. An electrical potential is applied to the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, which results in an enhanced electrical field at the tips of the flexible columns, of which primary tip -C of primary flexible column -A is an example. The enhanced electrical field attracts the metal cations to the tips of the flexible columns, of which primary tip -C of primary flexible column -A is an example, where chemical reduction of the metal cations occurs and metal is deposited to grow the active-material caps, of which primary active-material cap -B is an example.","Similarly, by way of another example, with further reference to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , in precipitating active-material caps from a colloidal suspension of metallic nanoparticles, the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A may be immersed in a colloidal suspension of metallic nanoparticles; an electrical potential is applied to the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A, which results in an enhanced electrical field at the tips of the flexible columns, of which primary tip -C of primary flexible column -A is an example; the enhanced electrical field attracts metallic nanoparticles from the colloidal suspension to the tips of the flexible columns, of which primary tip -C of primary flexible column -A is an example, where the metallic nanoparticles are deposited to grow the active-material caps, of which primary active-material cap -B is an example.","By way of yet another example, with further reference to ,  and , at , in accordance with examples of the present technology, in a lift-off process for lifting-off portions of a deposited metallic layer to produce the active-material caps, a layer of photoresist may be applied to the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. An undercut structure is produced in the photoresist adjacent to the sides of the columns, and the photoresist is etched away from the tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. A stream of metal vapor  is deposited, using thin-film deposition techniques, for example, sputtering or evaporation, onto the plurality  of tips of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. A thin film is deposited over the surface of the combined photoresist and partially fabricated asymmetrical-nanofinger device . The photoresist and portions of the metal layer adhering to the photoresist between the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A is then removed and the plurality  of active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B is left adhering to the plurality  of tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A.","By way of yet a further example, with further reference to ,  and , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , in reducing adsorbed metalo-organic compounds by energetic particle bombardment to produce the active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B, the substrate  including the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A may be exposed to a vapor of a chemical compound bearing a metal moiety, for example, a metalo-organic compound as used in chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, the metalo-organic compound may be provided in the form of a gas admitted to a vacuum chamber, such as, the vacuum chamber of a focused-ion beam (FIB) tool, a scanning electron microscope (SEM), or the target chamber of a laser ablation system, without limitation thereto. A suitable gas-injection system (GIS) interfaced to the vacuum chamber may be used to provide the chemical vapor bearing a metal moiety, for example, the metalo-organic compound. The gaseous vapor of the metalo-organic compound adsorbs on the surface of the substrate  including the tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. An energetic beam of particles, for example, ions, electrons, or photons, without limitation thereto, irradiates the tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A. Such energetic beams of particles, for example, ions, electrons, or photons, without limitation thereto, may be provided, for example, by: the ion gun of a FIB tool, the electron gun of an SEM, or a laser of a laser ablation system, without limitation thereto. The energetic beam of particles, for example, ions, electrons, or photons, without limitation thereto, reduces the adsorbed gaseous vapor of the metalo-organic compound and grows the plurality  of active-material caps -B, -B, -B, -B and -B onto the plurality  of tips -C, -C, -C, -C and -C of the plurality  of flexible columns -A, -A, -A, -A and -A.","With reference now to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, a flowchart  is shown of a method for fabricating an asymmetrical-nanofinger device for surface-enhanced luminescence. The method for fabricating an asymmetrical-nanofinger device for surface-enhanced luminescence includes the following. At , a substrate is provided.

In accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality of flexible columns includes at least one primary flexible column and at least one secondary flexible column, such that an average diameter of the primary flexible column is substantially greater than an average diameter of the secondary flexible column. In accordance with examples of the present technology, producing the plurality of flexible columns on the substrate may also include a process selected from the group consisting of growing nanowires on the substrate, etching the substrate, hot nano-embossing a coating on the substrate, and nano-imprinting a coating on the substrate, as previously described.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, at , a plurality of active-material caps is fabricated on a plurality of tips of the plurality of flexible columns, the plurality of active-material caps includes at least one primary active-material cap and at least one secondary active-material cap disposed on respective tips of the primary flexible column and the secondary flexible column, to produce a plurality of nanofingers including at least one respective primary nanofinger and at least one respective secondary nanofinger. In accordance with examples of the present technology, an average diameter of the primary active-material cap is substantially greater than an average diameter of the secondary active-material cap. In accordance with examples of the present technology, the plurality of flexible columns are composed of a material that allows at least the primary flexible column and at least the secondary flexible column of the plurality of flexible columns to self-arrange at least the primary nanofinger and at least the secondary nanofinger into a close-packed configuration with a molecule if the molecule is disposed in proximity to at least the primary active-material cap and the secondary active-material cap, and the primary active-material cap and the secondary active-material cap are composed of a material that enhances a luminescence of the molecule if the molecule is disposed in proximity to at least one primary active-material cap and at least one secondary active-material cap.","With further reference to , in accordance with examples of the present technology, fabricating the plurality of active-material caps includes depositing a metal onto the plurality of tips of the plurality of flexible columns, such that a thickness of respective metallic layers of the deposited metal is substantially the same in at least one primary active-material cap and in at least one secondary active-material cap that are disposed on respective tips of the primary flexible column and the secondary flexible column. Thus, the thickness of the metallic layer of the deposited metal in the primary active-material cap is substantially equal to a respective thickness of a corresponding metallic layer of the deposited metal in the secondary active-material cap. In addition, in accordance with examples of the present technology, fabricating the plurality of active-material caps may include a process selected from the group consisting of evaporating an active-material cap, electroplating an active-material cap, precipitating an active-material cap from a colloidal suspension of metallic nanoparticles, lifting-off portions of a deposited metallic layer to form an active-material cap, and reducing adsorbed metalo-organic compounds by energetic particle bombardment to form an active-material cap, as previously described. Moreover, in accordance with examples of the present technology, fabricating the plurality of active-material caps may also include evaporating metal at an angle of about 30\u00b0 to the surface of the substrate onto the plurality of tips of the plurality of flexible columns, as previously described.","Embodiments of the present technology include an asymmetrical-nanofinger device  that can provide enhanced sensitivity for the presence of molecules during surface-enhanced luminescence. Moreover, examples of the present technology provide for lower detectability limits for surface-enhanced luminescence of an analyte associated with a molecule in solution. For example, examples of the present technology provide for lower detectability limits in SERS analysis of a molecule. Through the tuning of the active-material caps of the asymmetrical-nanofinger device  to respective exciting and emitted electromagnetic radiations  and  (see ), the sensitivity for detecting molecular species having absorption bands within which the frequency of the exciting electromagnetic radiation  lies and emission bands within which the emitted electromagnetic radiation  lies may be enhanced. In this way, examples of the present technology provide a means for selectively detecting molecular species with absorption and emission frequencies near those of the exciting and emitted electromagnetic radiations  and  (see ), respectively.
