{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12\/769,318 filed on Apr. 28, 2010 now U.S Pat. No. 8,437,339, entitled TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED VOICE SERVICE MANAGEMENT, and claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/477,112, filed Apr. 19, 2011, titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING INTEGRATED VIDEO COMMUNICATION APPLICATIONS ON A MOBILE COMPUTING DEVICE. The aforementioned applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","The disclosed embodiments relate generally to the field of operating mobile computing devices. In particular, embodiments described herein pertain to a system and method for integrating third party communication applications with various core applications of a mobile computing device.","With the recent development of technology over the past few years, mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, have been drastically improved to allow for a variety of different communication methods. For example, not only can smart phones be used for making standard telephone calls, but they can also be used for email services, text messaging, instant messaging, and web access, among other services.","Typically, a cell phone carrier enables a user to make a phone call to another wired device or wireless device over a cellular network (for wired devices, also partially over the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)). However, with the development and improvement of Voice Over Packet (VOP) services, such as Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), various communication methods may be allowed over both wireless and wired data networks. VOP services allow for the transmission of voice communications over internet protocol networks, such as the Internet.","With the improvement of such services, a user may choose to use different communication transports that use VOP services for communicating with other users. For example, a user may download various applications to his or her mobile computing device, including third party communication applications. A user may use a third party message application to send and receive text messages, for example, from another user. Because there may be a number of different applications that a user can download to his or her device, what is needed is a system to integrate the different communication applications with various operating system resources of the mobile computing device. This can allow for a more efficient and improved use of communication applications on the device.","Embodiments described herein include a mobile computing device that provides various user interfaces for enhancing the functionality of the mobile computing device. According to some embodiments, third party communication applications are integrated with applications that are provided as part of the operating system (\u201ccore applications\u201d) of the mobile computing device. Among other uses, the various user interfaces that correspond to core applications of the mobile computing device may be used to access different third party communication transports for initiating communication sessions. A user may access some or all of the features of the third party communication applications from the core application user interfaces of the mobile computing device. This may provide a more efficient and enhanced user experience.","Embodiments enable multiple resident or core applications to include a user interface feature from which a third-party communication application can be executed. More specifically, embodiments enable a third-party\/proprietary application to be executed by operating a core application. In some embodiments, user-interface features associated with a third party application are integrated into the user-interface of the core application. Still further, in some embodiments, core applications can be used to launch third-party communication applications using primarily (e.g., the framework) the user interface of the core application. For example, the user-interface of the core application may carry one or more features for using and integrating the third-party application. When the third-party application is executed, the other user-interface features of that application may be suppressed and\/or made non-functional.","In some embodiments, core applications of the mobile computing device may include applications that are incorporated with or come standard with the mobile computing device. For example, a typical or exemplary set of core applications for multi-functional telephony device include phone, contact records, calendar and messaging. Depending on the core application selected by a user, such as a phone application, the mobile computing device may present a user interface corresponding to the selected core application. The user interface includes selectable features to enable a user to select a third party communication application to make or initiate a communication session, such as a video call, from the core application user interface. The mobile computing device may communicate with another device by using a communication service transport corresponding to the selected third party application.","According to an embodiment, in response to the user selecting a third party communication application from the user interface of a core application, the selected third party communication application is executed by the mobile computing device. With execution of the third-party application, a user can operate the mobile computing device without the user having to separately open or launch a third party communication application to perform a communication session with another device.","Additionally, some embodiments enable one or more of the core applications to control the communication sessions that are made using the third party applications and corresponding service transports. The user may make a video call using a third party service transport, for example, from the phone application of the mobile computing device. The user may also make the selection by selecting a graphic representation that corresponds to that third party communication service transport.","Third party communication applications may include a variety of different applications, such as applications that provide voice communication services. In some embodiments, third party communication applications may include video communication applications that allow for video calling between users on two different devices. Upon selecting a third party video communication service from a user interface of the mobile computing device, the third party video communication application can be executed to initiate a video communication session (e.g., a video call).","In other embodiments, the user interfaces of the mobile computing device may vary depending on the corresponding application. The standard or core applications of the mobile computing device can include a phone application, a messaging application, a contacts application, a calendar application or a search application. For example, a phone application may include a call log that provides a list of communication sessions that were initiated or received by the user during a period of time. The list may include both voice and video communication sessions using services provided by a carrier (e.g., the cell phone service provider of the mobile computing device) or by any of the different third party communication applications downloaded by a user.","In various embodiments, the system may allow third party developers who develop (or provide service for) various third party communication applications to modify the user interfaces of the core applications. The third party developer may, for example, customize the selectable graphic representation on the user interfaces to include their logo. In other embodiments, the third party developer may provide for additional features or options for the user interfaces of the applications of the mobile computing device.","Some embodiments described herein may be implemented using programmatic elements, often referred to as modules or components, although other names may be used. Such programmatic elements may include a program, a subroutine, a portion of a program, or a software component or a hardware component capable of performing one or more stated tasks or functions. As used herein, a module or component can exist on a hardware component independently of other modules\/components or a module\/component can be a shared element or process of other modules\/components, programs or machines. A module or component may reside on one machine, such as on a client or on a server, or a module\/component may be distributed amongst multiple machines, such as on multiple clients or server machines. Any system described may be implemented in whole or in part on a server, or as part of a network service. Alternatively, a system such as described herein may be implemented on a local computer or terminal, in whole or in part. In either case, the implementation of a system provided for in this application may require use of memory, processors and network resources, including data ports, and signal lines (optical, electrical, etc.), unless stated otherwise.","Some embodiments described herein may generally require the use of computers, including processing and memory resources. For example, systems described herein may be implemented on a server or network service. Such servers may connect and be used by users over networks such as the Internet, or by a combination of networks, such as cellular networks and the Internet. Alternatively, one or more embodiments described herein may be implemented locally, in whole or in part, on computing machines such as desktops, cellular phones, personal digital assistances, laptop computers, tablet devices, or other computing devices. Thus, memory, processing and network resources may all be used in connection with the establishment, use or performance of any embodiment described herein (including with the performance of any method or with the implementation of any system).","Furthermore, some embodiments described herein may be implemented through the use of instructions that are executable by one or more processors. These instructions may be carried on a computer-readable medium. Machines shown in figures below provide examples of processing resources and computer-readable mediums on which instructions for implementing embodiments of the invention can be carried and\/or executed.

In particular, embodiments described herein may apply to numerous kinds of mobile or small form-factor computing devices. One type of mobile computing device that may be configured to include embodiments described herein includes a computer telephony device, such as a cellular phone or mobile device with voice-telephony applications (sometimes called \u201csmart phone\u201d). A computing device such as described may be small enough to fit in one hand, while providing cellular telephony features in combination with other applications, such as messaging, web browsing, media playback, personal information management (e.g., such as contact records management, calendar applications, tasks lists), image or video\/media capture and other functionality. Mobile computing devices in particular may have numerous types of input mechanisms and user-interface features, such as keyboards or keypads, mufti-directional or navigation buttons, application or action buttons, and contact or touch-sensitive display screens. Some devices may include combinations of keyboard, button panel area, and display screen on one facade. The button panel region may occupy a band between the keypad and the display area, and include a navigation button and multiple application buttons or action buttons.","Specific types of messaging that may be performed include messaging for email applications, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, Multimedia Message Service (MMS) messages, and proprietary voice exchange applications (such as SKYPE). Still further, other types of computing devices contemplated with embodiments described herein include laptop or notebook computers, ultra-mobile computers, personal digital assistants, and other multi-functional computing devices or mobile\/portable devices.","Still further, one or more embodiments may be implemented through any type of computing device such as a desktop computer that is configured to include real-time voice data exchange (e.g. through use of Internet Protocol telephony). Still further, other types of computer telephony devices exist, including standalone devices that connect directly to a telephone network (whether Internet Protocol or Public Switch Telephony System (PSTN)) and provide software interfaces and applications.","In one embodiment, system  includes a service manager  that manages various communication services on a mobile computing device. The service manager  may communicate with core applications  of the mobile computing device and third party communication applications  that are downloaded by a user. The service manager  also communicates with radio resources of the mobile computing device to communicate with the service transports wirelessly. In some embodiments, one or more third party communication applications  may be originally included with the mobile computing device. Core applications  may also communicate with the user interface component  so that user interfaces of core applications  may be presented on a display of the mobile computing device.","As described herein, core applications  may include applications that are originally included with a mobile computing device (e.g., come standard with the device) or may include applications that are necessary for communication functionalities. For example, core applications  may include, without limitation, a phone application, messaging applications, contacts application, and a search application. In other embodiments, core applications  may also include a web browsing application, personal information management applications (e.g., calendar, scheduling, tasks, notes, clock), word processing applications, media applications (e.g., photos, camera, music), and game applications.","The user interface component  may receive information from various applications in order to display user interfaces corresponding to the applications. Depending on the application, a user interface that is generated by the user interface component  may include selectable and non-selectable icons, graphics, buttons, menu choices, or any other images. The user interface component  may receive user commands via a user input (e.g., a touch screen, keypad, scroll wheel, etc.) to enable navigation and selection. The user interface component  may also communicate with third party communication applications . For example, if a user individually launches a third party communication application  (e.g., from an application launcher page), the user interface corresponding to the launched third party communication application may also be generated and provided on the display of the mobile computing device.","As discussed, a service manager  manages various communication services for the mobile computing device. The service manager  includes a voice service manager  and a video service manager  that communicate with each other. In some embodiments, the voice service manager  and the video service manager  may be combined to provide the service manager . The service manager  is configured to manage different types of service features that are associated with various service transports.","A communication service transport may be a message service transport and\/or voice service transport and\/or a video service transport. As discussed, one example of a message and voice communication service transport is a carrier that may provide text messaging and voice services to a user. Other examples of service transports include third party transports, such as SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE. In some embodiments, a service transport may provide both voice and video communication services, such as SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE. These service transports are developed and provided by third party developers (e.g., not the carrier of a user's cell phone service) who may provide services to a user.","According to an embodiment, the voice service manager  may manage voice service features, while the video service manager  may manage video service features (e.g., video calling services). The service manager  communicates with the radio module of the mobile computing device to enable communications between the mobile computing device and the various communication service transports. For example, service features associated with voice and video service transports, such as a carrier (e.g., a provider of cellular telephone services to a user), may include voice or video calling services, voicemail services, messaging services, caller-ID services, call forwarding, call switching, call blocking, text transcription, video conferencing, etc. The service manager  enables a user to access a core application and also communicates with a cellular and\/or data networks so that the user may use a video or voice service transport and its associated service features. The service manager  may establish a voice or video communication session with another device over a wireless communication network using the selected service transport.","In one embodiment, one or more service transports may be a transport that uses a Voice Over Packet (VOP) service. The VOP service implements transmission technologies for delivery of voice and data service features over a packet-switched network, such as a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), IP telephony, Internet telephony, Voice Over Broadband (VoBB), broadband telephony, etc. Examples of VOP service transports includes web-based voice and data services, such as SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE. Other transports may also be available.","A user may download, from an application catalog, different third party voice and video communication applications that may be used with corresponding service transports. These third party communication applications  are stored on the mobile computing device. For example, a user may download the SKYPE application from the application catalog so that the SKYPE application is stored on the user's mobile computing device. While accessing a core application, the user may make a phone call (a voice communication session) or send a message over VoIP using the user's SKYPE account (e.g., through use of the SKYPE application). Similarly, the user may make a video call (a video communication session) using the SKYPE application. While voice service transports and corresponding applications may be managed by the service manager , some embodiments provided may discuss only video service features and transports for simplicity purposes.","Core applications  may access various service features provided by video service transports via the third party communication applications  and the service manager . In some embodiments, core applications  may communicate with third party communication applications  directly or via the service manager . In this manner, core applications  may integrate features from third party communication applications , so that a user may access service features from various service transports by using a core application . For example, the contacts application may incorporate a user's SKYPE account so that the user's friends and contacts may be automatically added to the contacts on the mobile computing device. The user may navigate the user interface corresponding to the contacts application, and see contacts for friends who also have SKYPE. In another example, the user interface for a contacts application may include a video call icon for a contact record with a corresponding identifier for the service transport.","In some embodiments, core applications  may provide data to the user interface component  so that a user interface feature for a core application , such as a phone application, may be presented on the display of the mobile computing device. The user may navigate the user interface of the phone application and see integrated features from various third party communication applications . The user may choose to make a video call, for example, by selecting a third party communication application  to initiate the video call with another user. The user interface component  receives user input (e.g., selection and navigation input), which enables the corresponding core application to perform an action, such as connect the video call using the third party service transport. The phone application may communicate with the selected third party communication application to trigger or enable the communication to occur.","According to an embodiment, the service manager  exchanges control information between core applications  and third party communication applications , and also communicates with the various service transports via the radio module. In some embodiments, the service manager  may provide a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow video service transports to provide a list of capabilities, services and notifications to the service manager  (via the third party communication applications ) so that the core applications  may control the video service features automatically. The APIs may enable the third party communication applications  to plug into the core applications . Examples of core applications  with integrated third party communication applications  may be seen in .","The third party communication applications  may enable a user to make video phone calls with another user. However, instead of operating the application individually (e.g., launching the application from a launcher page), the user may use the phone application or contacts application (or other core applications ) to use a third party communication application, as discussed above. In such embodiments, the user interface of the third party communication application may be disabled or suppressed when its services are being used to communicate with the corresponding service transports. For example, if a user is making a video call from the phone application using her SKYPE account, the SKYPE application is being used to provide the video calling service. However, the user interface feature corresponding to the actual SKYPE application is not presented on the display of the mobile computing device because it is suppressed. In this manner, the user may view the video calling service to be fully integrated with the core applications  of the mobile computing device. On the other hand, if the user launches or uses a third party communication application independently of a core application, the user interface of the third party communication application would not be disabled or suppressed.","In other embodiments, APIs may be provided by system  to allow the third party communication applications  to modify the user interfaces of the core applications . Third party developers may program their application so that when the application is downloaded to the mobile computing device, the user interface features of the core applications  may be automatically modified to include various images, such as a logo (e.g., SKYPE logo), or other features for accessing or controlling the video services. Extra features may be provided to the phone application, for example, that have not been present previously (e.g., an icon for video calling, preferences for settings for video calling, altering video sizes and video windows). Allowing the third party developer to customize the user interface features and add in controls allows a user to fully control the video call from the core applications. Other examples include changing the look and feel of the variety of different user interfaces or allowing advertisements while the service is being used.","In some embodiments, because the third party communication applications  may be downloaded from an application catalog, the application catalog may be used by a third party developer as a delivery mechanism for their voice and video services. The third party developer may include features to modify the user interface features of the core applications . For example, the system  may provide APIs that allow the voice and video calling applications to automatically modify different UIs. The third party developer may, for example, have customization data included with the third party communication applications .","Flow Chart",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"According to an embodiment, in step , a user may launch or open a core application of the mobile computing device. As discussed, an example of a core application may be a phone application that enables a user to make or receive a phone call. Upon launching the core application, the user interface corresponding to the core application is presented on the display of the mobile computing device. The user interface of the phone application, for example, may vary depending on the whether the user wants to enter in a phone number, search for a number, or look at a call log showing past communication sessions (voice or video calls initiated or received by the user).","In step , the core application may be executed in a manner that integrates user interface features of a third party communication application. To this end, the third-party communication application may be launched or utilized from the user interface of the core application. The core application is integrated with the various third party communication applications so that a user may access the third party communication applications from the user interface of the core application. For example, if the user has downloaded SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE, some phone application user interfaces may present a graphic representation for each of them. If the user types in a friend's name in the phone application and that friend is a contact on the user's SKYPE account, a SKYPE graphic representation (e.g., the name \u201cSKYPE\u201d or icon) may be provided with the friend's name.","In one embodiment, the user may select a third party communication transport to initiate a communication session from the user interface of the core application (step ). The user may choose out of a variety of choices, such as the carrier voice or video service transport or other third party transports, that are provided on the user interface. Referring back to the example above, if the user wants to call his friend using SKYPE, the user may select the graphic representation for SKYPE. In some embodiments, even if the other user (in this example, the user's friend) does not have a SKYPE account, the user may still use the SKYPE transport to make the call (either voice or video) depending on compatibility. For example, a user can use SKYPE to make a phone call to a wired landline phone.","Upon selection of the communication transport, the preferred communication session is enabled (step ). The user may perform a voice call or video call using the selected transport. For example, because the user wanted to call his friend using SKYPE, the SKYPE application stored on the mobile computing device enables the user to communicate with the corresponding SKYPE transport. In some embodiments, because the user is performing the call using the core application, the user interface of the SKYPE application is not presented on the display of the mobile computing device. As discussed previously, the SKYPE application features may be suppressed even though it is being used to perform the communication session.","Although the steps in  were described with reference to one particular exemplary application, the steps apply to a variety of different applications. In addition, in some embodiments, the steps may be rearranged or may be performed in different order or concurrently.","User Interfaces",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-16","FIGS. 3-16","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 1 and 2","FIGS. 3-16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","300","305","310","315","310","315","310","315"]},"In some embodiments, the record objects ,  may also include metadata that may be displayed with the record objects , . The record object  indicates that the telephone number listed is for Patricia Campanella's work phone. Similarly, the record object  indicates that the user name \u201cpcampanella\u201d corresponds to Patricia Campanella's SKYPE account.","As discussed above, because the system integrates various third party communication applications, such as SKYPE, with core applications of the mobile computing device, the user may use the phone application to access one or more third party communication applications. In the example provided, the user has already downloaded the SKYPE application to his or her mobile computing device. The user may make a SKYPE phone call to Patricia Campanella by selecting (e.g., tapping with a finger or pointer on a touch screen display) the record object . In other embodiments, the user may make a SKYPE video call to Patricia by selecting the video call icon . Once the call (either voice or video) is initiated, a different UI view is provided to show that the call is being connected.","Additional record objects may be provided with the contact record if the user has additional third party communication applications installed on his or her device. For example, if the user has multiple third party communication applications downloaded (e.g., SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE) and Patricia Campanella is in the user's buddy list or contacts for both the SKYPE and GOOGLE VOICE accounts, then additional record objects may be provided.","View  illustrates a favorites UI of the phone application. In the favorites UI view, different record objects ,  are shown for contacts that the user has tagged or determined to be his or her favorite contacts to call. Record object  shows the name (\u201cBarry S. Pendleton\u201d) of the contact, the contact identifier (\u201cb.pendleton\u201d) and metadata corresponding to the service transport (\u201cSkype\u201d). The user may also add more favorites by selecting the option . In some embodiments, the user may select the record object  to make a SKYPE call (video or voice) to the contact listed using the selected third party communication application and corresponding service transport.","In view , a video call UI of the phone application is illustrated. The video call UI provides record objects  for video calls and voice calls initiated or received during a period of time. Each record object  includes a contact name, contact identifier, a time, an image, and metadata corresponding to the service transport (e.g., \u201cS\u201d for SKYPE, \u201cM\u201d for Mobile, \u201cW\u201d for work, etc.). The record objects  may include a video call icon  for video communication sessions. In some embodiments, the video call icon  may be included with a record object  even if the video call was only a partial communication session (e.g., the user switched from video to voice, or vice versa during the call).","The phone UIs that are provided with views ,  and  also include graphic options  provided below to switch between the different phone UIs. For example, a user may select the star graphic option  for the favorites UI view.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","410","420","430","440","450","460","460"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","505","510","515","520","500","520"]},"Again, because the system integrates third party communication applications, such as SKYPE and AIM, with core applications (e.g., messaging application) of the mobile computing device, the user may use the messaging application to access one or more third party communication applications. In view , after the contact object  has been expanded, record objects  are displayed on the UI. The user may initiate a communication session by selecting a record object , or if more than one communication session is available for a transport (such as for SKYPE), an option is provided for the user to make another selection. The user is selecting the button with the \u201c+\u201d sign to see more options.","In view , in response to the user selecting the \u201c+\u201d sign, an option window  is provided. Because the SKYPE transport enables messaging, voice calls, and video calls, the option window  allows a user to select a communication session from the messaging application (e.g., without having to individually and separately open\/launch the SKYPE application from a launch page or home page). The user may select \u201cVideo Call\u201d to initiate a video call with Mike Woods.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","610","620","610","630"]},"In some embodiments, the user may also expand the window by selecting an icon  to show other options for a communication session. For example, the user may expand the SKYPE contact object  to show an expanded window for either messaging, voice calling, or video calling Mike Woods using the SKYPE transport. In this manner, the user may access the third party communication transport from the messaging application of the mobile computing device.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["700","710","720","730","730","740","700","730"]},"In some embodiments, a user may use a third party communication application and corresponding service transport (such as SKYPE) to call a phone number that is not a SKYPE account. For example, a SKYPE user may call a landline phone. According to one or more embodiments, when a user chooses to make a phone call (or video call), the system may automatically select a particular service transport to initiate the call. In view , if the user wants to call Patricia at her work number and selects the record object  for the work number, the mobile computing device may automatically select a service transport as a means for connecting the call (e.g., the carrier, or a third party application such as SKYPE or GOOGLE VOICE). The selection may be made in accordance with one or more communication parameters and\/or selection rules. In other embodiments, the user may set his or her preferences so that the system selects the service transport the user wants.","Some parameters include available service transports, a transmission quality parameter, a reliability parameter, a communication protocol, a device capability, a voice or video service feature, cost value, a power parameter, a location, a calling region, a network scanning threshold parameter, a radio-frequency channel parameter, an access point parameter, a rate selection parameter, a frame size parameter, an aggregation size parameter, a packet retry parameter, a protocol parameter, a radio parameter, modulation and coding schemes, media access control layer parameter, physical layer parameter, and any other communication parameters affecting operations for a radio implemented by the mobile computing device.","In view , a user may expand the window  for the SKYPE record object so that the user may initiate a communication session using the SKYPE service transport and application.
