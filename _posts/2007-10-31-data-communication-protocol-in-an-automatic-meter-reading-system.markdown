Generally the AMR system comprises a reader and an endpoint that is interfaced to a meter. In a typical system, the endpoint obtains the consumption reading from the meter and then bubbles up every few seconds to send that consumption reading, via RF signal, to the reader. Alternatively, the endpoint receives a wake-up tone from the reader that prompts the endpoint to send the consumption reading to the reader.","All that is obtained from this configuration is a single consumption reading from the meter and that reading is based on what meter register the endpoint was programmed with initially at the factory.","As such, there is a need for an AMR system that enables the user of the system to have more access to and more control over the information that the meter and endpoint can provide.","One aspect of the invention is directed to an automatic meter reading (AMR) system that includes a reader and an endpoint interfaced to a utility meter. In operation, the reader and the endpoint communicate with one another via radio frequency (RF) communication according to a communication protocol. The communication protocol includes a transport layer that provides slot assignments, timing, and packetization for all data transferred between the reader and the endpoint. The packetization defines packets to include the following fields: a preamble field; a preface following the preamble field that includes at least a message type field; an endpoint type field following the message type field; a message field following the endpoint type field; and a validation field.","In an AMR system comprising a reader and an endpoint interfaced to a utility meter according to another aspect of the invention, in operation, the reader transmits a command and control frame to the endpoint via radio frequency (RF) communication. The command and control frame includes a system ID that indicates a specific AMR system with which the endpoint is associated; a frame ID that indicates a position in a wake-up sequence of the reader; and a cell ID that indicates at least one subset of the specific AMR system.","In a further aspect of the invention, a RF communication sent by an AMR system reader to an endpoint occurs through the use of at least one packet that includes a message type field and a message field. The message type field indicates a command type of a first command to be carried out that is selected from a predetermined set of commands. The message field indicates specific data associated with the first command.","According to another aspect of the invention, in an AMR system comprising a reader and an endpoint interfaced to a utility meter, the endpoint and reader communicate with one another via a RF communication. The RF communication occurs through the use of at least one packet that includes a message type field and a message content field that is distinct from the message type field. The message type field indicates a message type indicator of a first message to be conveyed that is selected from a predetermined set of messages, and wherein the message content field indicates specific data associated with the first message.","Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of communicating between the endpoint and the reader. At least one of the reader and the endpoint transmits a packetized RF communication that includes a first packet. In the first packet, a message type field and a message content field that is distinct from the message type field are provided. In the message type field, a message type is indicated for a first message to be conveyed that is selected from a predetermined set of messages. In the message content field, specific data associated with the first message is indicated.","The present invention is a data communication protocol for automatic meter reading (AMR) systems. The protocol is designed to be flexible and expandable enabling both one-way and two-way meter reading in both fixed and mobile meter reading systems.","I. System Components","In an AMR system , as depicted in , that is utilized with the present invention, the components generally include a plurality of telemetry devices including, but not limited to, electric meters , gas meters  and water meters . Each of the meters may be either electrically or battery powered. The system further includes a plurality of endpoints , wherein each corresponds and interfaces to a meter. Each of the endpoints  preferably incorporates a radio receiver\/transmitter, e.g., the Itron, Inc. ERT. The system additionally includes one or more readers that may be fixed or mobile,  depicts: (1) a mobile hand-held reader , such as that used in the Itron Off-site meter reading system; (2) a mobile vehicle-equipped reader , such as that used in the Itron Mobile AMR system; (3) a fixed radio communication network , such as the Itron Fixed Network AMR system that utilizes the additional components of cell central control units (CCUs) and network control nodes (NCNs); and (4) a fixed micro-network system, such as the Itron MicroNetwork AMR system that utilizes both radio communication through concentrators and telephone communications through PSTN. Of course other types of readers may be used without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Further included in AMR system  is a head-end, host processor . The host processor incorporates software that manages the collection of metering data and facilitates the transfer of that data to a utility or supplier billing system .","The AMR system  and the data protocol is usable in both one-way meter reading and in two-way meter reading. The one-way meter reading system enables the reader to listen to messages sent asynchronously from the endpoint while the two-way meter reading system enables the reader to communicate with and command the endpoint while also enabling the endpoint to respond to the reader.","II. System Protocol","The present communication protocol will be described with reference to the 1430 MHz band that may be utilized within North America, however, it should be understood that any other radio frequency band may be used, as suitable, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. The present communication protocol will also be described with reference to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack of the International Standards Organization which includes: (1) the physical layer; (2) the data link layer; (3) the network layer; (4) the transport layer; (5) the session layer; (6) the presentation layer; and (7) the application layer.","II.A. System Protocol\u2014Physical Layer","The physical layer describes the physical characteristics of the communication. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier. The physical layer specifications for the reader may be found in  wherein: (1) the operational modes; (2) the frequency band; (3) the channel bandwidth; (4) the modulation scheme; (5) the deviation; (6) the encoding; (7) the bit rate; (8) the frequency stability; (9) the minimum reception sensitivity; (10) the transmission power; (11) the preamble length; and (12) the transmission modes are provided.","The physical layer specification for the endpoint in a two-way AMR system, at a first data rate and a second data rate, are found in the tables of  and , respectively. The specifications provided include: (1) the operational modes; (2) the frequency band; (3) the channel bandwidth; (4) the modulation scheme; (5) the deviation; (6) the encoding; (7) the bit rate; (8) the frequency stability; (9) the minimum reception sensitivity; (10) the minimum preamble length; and (11) the factory default frequency. The physical layer specification for the endpoint in a one-way AMR system is provided, similarly, in the table of . However, it should be understood that any other physical layer specifications may be used, as suitable, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.","II.B. System Protocol\u2014Data Link Layer","The data link layer specifies how packets are transported over the physical layer, including the framing, i.e., the bit patterns that mark the start and end of packets. This layer provides synchronization for the physical level. It furnishes transmission protocol knowledge and management. In the present data communication protocol, all outbound data transmissions, i.e., all communications from the reader's central radio to endpoint, are Manchester encoded with the guaranteed transition mid-bit and each data bit encoded as aa(bar). (See  for the Manchester Encoding Structure). Inbound transmissions from the endpoint are either transmitted as Manchester encoded data, identical to outbound transmissions, or are transmitted as NRZ (non-return to zero) data. Selection is based on the value of the MCH flag in the command and control frame.","The data link layer provides a countdown timer. The countdown timer uses Sequence Inversion Keying to represent timer bits. Each system is assigned a 10-bit pseudo noise (PN) sequence (for valid sequences, see Table 1 below). That sequence in the data stream represents a timer bit value 0 and the inverse of that sequence in the data stream represents a timer bit value 1. Timer values are composed of 10 timer bits, or 100 data bits. The countdown timer begins at 1023, or 1111111111 binary, and counts sequentially to zero, encoding all timer bits as either the system PN sequence or its inverse. The total counter time, in seconds, is 102400\/r, where r is the bit rate, in bits per second.  provides an example of a Sequence Inversion Keyed Countdown Timer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"PN Sequences"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sequence",{},{},"Inverted"]},{"entry":["Number","Usage","Sequence = 0","Sequence = 1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0","Factory Default","0000000010","1111111101"]},{"entry":["1","Electric Devices","0000000110","1111111001"]},{"entry":["2","Electric Devices","0000001010","1111110101"]},{"entry":["3","Electric Devices","0000001110","1111110001"]},{"entry":["4","Electric Devices","0000011010","1111100101"]},{"entry":["5","Electric Devices","0000010110","1111101001"]},{"entry":["6","Electric Devices","0000111010","1111000101"]},{"entry":["7","Battery Devices","0000101110","1111010001"]},{"entry":["8","Battery Devices","0001110110","1110001001"]},{"entry":["9","Battery Devices","0001101110","1110010001"]},{"entry":["10","Battery Devices","0000011110","1111100001"]},{"entry":["11","Battery Devices","0001011110","1110100001"]},{"entry":["12","Battery Devices","0001111010","1110000101"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}},"br":[{},{}]},"The network layer specifies how packets get from the source network to the destination network.

Level 1 provides simple encryption for the transfer of normal data while level 2 provides write security to the endpoint to prevent unauthorized users from changing endpoint parameters.","Level 1 is intended for use on ordinary data being transmitted from the endpoint to the head end.

Any write command must include the current password to be considered valid by the endpoint. For added security, the Level 1 encryption mask may be applied to the password, if Level 1 functionality is active. There is no compression performed on packet data.","II.G.

(This layer is not the application itself, although some applications may perform application layer functions.) In the present data communication protocol, an endpoint application layer is used in conjunction with the application programming interface (API). When data is requested by the presentation layer, via the API, the application layer performs its processing and returns the requested message as a single block, along with one 8-bit value. The value represents the message type.","III. System Operation","The two-way AMR system of the present invention, at 1430 MHz, is designed to operate most efficiently in five contiguous RF channels. This allows the use of a cheaper (wider) receiver section in the endpoint while still maintaining the FCC mandated 50 KHz maximum transmit spectrum. The transmit spectrum in all devices, endpoints, and readers, must maintain a 50 KHz or less occupied bandwidth during transmit. The receiver in the reader must also have a good selectivity on the channel of interest. The endpoint receiver is allowed to accept a wider receive bandwidth primarily to reduce the cost of the endpoint.","Refer to  to observe the 250 KHz of spectrum allocated to the system. As shown, the spectrum is divided in to five 50 KHz channels. The center channel, i.e., channel , is designated as the control channel for the system . All endpoints  listen on this channel. As such, if the readers are quasi-synchronized in their outbound transmissions the center channel approach allows the endpoints to use a wider receive bandwidth while avoiding the interference that would normally be a problem (synchronization is described in further detail below). The diagram of , illustrates the bandwidth differences graphically. Since the reader has good selectivity the endpoints can respond on a different channel in each cell simultaneously allowing the maximum data throughput in the system (cell re-use is described in further detail below).","By utilizing an appropriate RF ASIC, the architecture can be reduced to three contiguous channels with the reaming two or more channels scattered throughout the band to ease spectrum allocation requirements. With a reduction in the interference protection to the end point, a completely separated channel model could be used in an alternative configuration. However, in the separate channel model, the endpoint requires additional base band filtering and is still slightly more susceptible to adjacent channel interference on the control channel especially if operating in the high power portion of the band. The separate channel option also allows multiple control channels in the system when mobile operation is used with multiple outbound channels. When using the separate channel model, channels  and , of a 5-channel block, are used for control signals.","To alleviate cell-to-cell interference in a system with a single control channel the readers must be synchronized in time so that the control frames, which are described in further detail below, do not overlap. The addition of \u201cdead time\u201d in between sequential control frames allow for the receivers to be quasi-synchronized instead of in perfect lock step. In the preferred embodiment, quasi-synchronized means that the receivers are within 0.5 seconds of each other, which can easily by achieved via protocols such as NTP (network time protocol). Other quasi-synchronization times may be used without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. As such, a GPS or other high accuracy time base is not required within the readers.","Within the AMR system, each reader is assigned a frame ID to use based on its position in a wakeup sequence. The position in the wakeup sequence is directly related to the frequency reuse pattern used in a given system. The timings in the diagram of  are provided as an example of a staged wakeup sequence for three cell reuse. As shown, the timings are for an endpoint to endpoint clock accuracy of +\/\u22120.5 seconds, if the value obtainable is only +\/\u22121 second then the dead time must be increased to 5 and the nominal frame time to 22.5 seconds. All other timings remain the same. If GPS is available in the reader, the dead time can be reduced and the time frame timing can be shortened. In any case, the minimum dead time is preferably 0.5 seconds.","As shown in , the first wake-up sequence is initiated at time T=0. For the first 18.5 seconds, get wakeup (SIK countdown timer), next 0.25 seconds (command and control, frame ), and last 2.5 second is dead time. The remaining time in the timeline is the hold off time for response slots, which is the frame number*the nominal frame time, or 2*20=40 seconds of hold off time. At T=20, the second wake-up sequence is initiated. Similarly, the first 18.5 seconds, get wakeup (SIK countdown timer), next 0.25 seconds (command and control, frame ), and the last 2.5 seconds is dead time. The hold off time for response slots in this instance is, again, the frame number*the nominal frame time, which is 1*20=20 seconds off hold off time. At T=40, the third wake-up sequence is initiated. For the first 18.5 seconds, get wakeup (SIK countdown time), the next 0.25 seconds (command and control, frame ), and the last 2.5 seconds is dead time. The hold off time for response is calculated as follows, frame number*nominal frame time, or 0*20=0 seconds hold off time meaning the endpoints have 2.5 seconds before the beginning of slot  in this cell.","As mentioned, the example of  is for a three cell reuse pattern. However, the example can be easily extended to higher cellular reuse ratios by adding more frames as appropriate. In the 1430 MHz system, the maximum recommended cellular reuse is 5. This leads to a hold off time of 100 seconds in the first cell transmitted which is short enough for the endpoint to maintain accurate timing with regard to slot timings.","Unless otherwise specified by the system, the frame ID is preferably tied to the cellular frequency used based on Table 13 below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0102","num":"0101"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 13"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Frame ID"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cell Reuse Ratio","Channel to Frame ID mapping"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["3 Cell","Channel 1 = Frame ID 0"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 3 = Frame ID 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 5 = Frame ID 2"]},{"entry":["4 Cell","Channel 1 = Frame ID 0"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 2 = Frame ID 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 4 = Frame ID 2"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 5 = Frame ID 3"]},{"entry":["5 Cell","Channel 1 = Frame ID 0"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 2 = Frame ID 1"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 3 = Frame ID 2"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 4 = Frame ID 3"]},{"entry":[{},"Channel 5 = Frame ID 4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"To maximize throughput in the system , a cellular reuse scheme is employed in the 1430 MHz band. The reuse ratio is preferably a 3, 4, 5, 7, or 9 cell pattern. Smaller patterns are preferred from a delay perspective, however, the final choice is preferably made during the RF planning and installation of actual systems in the field. The 7 and 9 patterns are preferably used in the virtual cell model. The reuse patterns are provided in , , and  depicting three-cell (ABC), four-cell (ABCD), and five-cell reuse patterns (ABCDE), respectively.","IV. Mobile and Hand-Held Operation","When operating in the mobile or hand-held mode, the 2.5 seconds of \u201cdead time\u201d does not apply. Rather slot \u201c0\u201d occurs at the end of the command and control frame plus 25 milliseconds. Note, that due to time required to read the attached meter and\/or bring the charge pump to full operation the endpoint may or may not respond in slot \u201c0\u201d even if told to respond immediately.","In programming mode, the hand-held control may reduce its sensitivity by as much as 30 dB to avoid overload conditions at close programming distances. The hand-held and endpoint must work with programming distances as close as 0.5 meters and as far as 300 meters when in the mobile mode of operation with a line of site propagation path.","In mobile operation the wake-up sequence, the command & control data, and the receive portions of a standard read cycle are continuously repeated as the mobile moves through the system. The timing is preferably in the range of a one to five second cycle. The diagram depicted in  gives a general over view of the mobile operation over the five channels.","The command & control frame preferably contains a group call read that solicits a consumptive type reading from all of the endpoints that can hear the mobile and that have the correct system ID. The endpoint responds to the group call in a random slot, on a random channel. The random channel is chosen from the list of available channels that is provided in the command & control frame. The random slot is one of the 50 ms slots in the Slotted-ALOHA portion of the frame. (Slotted ALOHA is a random access scheme just like regular ALOHA except that the transmissions are required to begin and end within the predefined timeslot. The timeslots are marked from the end of the command & control frame just like in the fixed network).","When the reader hears a response from a given endpoint, it knows that it is within range and can request a specific response from the endpoint in the next command & control frame. The command & control frame is expected to contain both a standard command frame and an extended control frame to allow for the mobile to access the most endpoints possible in a single pass. When the mobile requests a response from the end point it will tell it the channel and time slot that it is supposed to respond on. This is to minimize the chances of a collision on the longer messages that can be delivered in the MDP type of responses. During the mobile cycle, battery endpoints may be required to bubble up their receivers up at a higher rate than normal or synchronize to the first command & control frame to improve mobile performance.","If the van is moving at a maximum of 30 miles per hour it will travel 440 feet in 10 seconds. The van will also have a communications radius of approximately 500 feet give a 1400 MHz system operating at a data rate of 22.6 Kchips\/second, with the expected power levels and receiver sensitivities (e.g., +14 dBm endpoint TX power, \u2212110 dBM RX sensitivity in the van, 20 dB margin, endpoint at 5\u2032). The margin is included because the MDP data packet is much longer than the current SCM type messages and is not repeated unless an error occurs. To achieve a low re-try rate, it is desirable to bring the BER down to 0.01%. To do this under normal situations would require an additional 20 dB of margin, however, a diversity setup on the van receivers can be used to achieve the same results. This requires two antennas on the van placed five to six feet apart along with an additional receiver demodulator chain per channel. For SCM data that is repeated multiple times, the system can operate at a much lower margin and still achieve excellent read reliability in the van. A coverage radius of about 1200 feet is obtained for the system when collecting standard consumptive data.","The diagram of , shows the coverage rings for low margin SCM messages and for the 20 dB margin IDR messages for the present system in comparison with the current 0 dB margin SCM messages from the ERT.","With the current mobile protocol each endpoint is, on average, in the range of the van for approximately 12 to 25 seconds. This is an appropriate amount of time to wake up the endpoint, identify who it is, request an MDP (mobile data packet=250 bytes of raw data maximum) to be sent, receive the MDP and potentially retry the request and receive portions of the process if necessary.","In the basic system, there are five channels at a maximum 75% utilization for MDP responses. This gives an effective data rate of 42375 BPS or 5296 bytes per second or 21 blocks per second. Since the system is looking at a single block per meter, the system can support 21 new meters per second. The mobile then has a nominal range of 500 feet. This gives the system of about 175 meters in range at any given time, even in the densest specified systems. If the van is moving at 30 mph, the system gets 44 feet of new meters per second. In performing a geometric approximation, the result is about 12 new meters per second. So, the system can handle  new meters per second but can only get in the range of 10 to 12 meters per second. This allows for a full set of retries in a dense system. (This assumes the low 11.36363 KBPS data rate and the full 250 byte MDP, for smaller packets and with the higher data rate option, the situation is even better.","V. Response Optimization for Mobile and Fixed Network Operation","In order to optimize the batter efficiency, range, and overall system robustness for endpoints that must operate in both a mobile and fixed network scenario without reprogramming, the following methodology is preferably used. The outbound transmission from the reader includes a flag that states the response mode of the endpoint. When the response mode flag is set to \u201cmobile\u201d the endpoint responds at a lower power (e.g., +14 dBm) and in a dynamically randomized slot determined as described above. When the endpoint sees the \u201cfixed network\u201d flag set it responds in its assigned slot at high power (e.g., +30 dBm). The advantage provided by this scenario is that in the mobile case the reader is not burdened with slot dynamic allocation of multiple, which can be computationally intensive and consume additional air time to successfully communicate to all the in-range endpoints. It also allows the endpoint to conserver power and reduce interference. This leads to the ability to transmit more data with less retries. In the fixed network case, the high power mode enables the system to get maximum range from the device (reducing infrastructure costs) while interference is mitigated by assigned slots. The slots are efficiently assigned in the fixed network case because of the pseudo-static nature of the system. Note that prior art systems enabled only static programming of the endpoint to operate in one mode or the other. As such, the previous methodology did not allow for mixed mode operation without reprogramming the endpoint. Thus, the present invention presents the combination of low power operation and dynamic slot assignment for mobile operation with the high power slotted operation for the fixed network all controlled by a flag in the outbound wakeup data. Refer to field \u201c8,\u201d bits  and , of the command & control frame that define the transmit\/response mode.","The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit of the essential attributes thereof; therefore, the illustrated embodiment should be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing description to indicate the scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 3B","b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 12","b":"48"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 13","b":"49"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"50"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 16"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 17"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 18"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 19"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 20"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 21"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
