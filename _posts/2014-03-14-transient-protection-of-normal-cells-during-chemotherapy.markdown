title: Transient protection of normal cells during chemotherapy
abstract: This invention is in the area of improved compounds, compositions and methods of transiently protecting healthy cells, and in particular hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) as well as renal cells, from damage associated with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. In one aspect, improved protection of healthy cells is disclosed using disclosed compounds that act as highly selective and short, transiently-acting cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors when administered to subjects undergoing DNA damaging chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of proliferative disorders.

The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes.","The U.S. Government has rights in this invention by virtue of support under Grant No. 5R44AI084284 awarded by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease.","This invention is in the area of improved compounds, compositions and methods of transiently protecting healthy cells, and in particular hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) as well as renal cells, from damage associated with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. In one aspect, improved protection of healthy cells is disclosed using disclosed compounds that act as highly selective and short, transiently-acting cyclin-dependent kinase 4\/6 (CDK 4\/6) inhibitors when administered to subjects undergoing DNA damaging chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of proliferative disorders.","Chemotherapy refers to the use of cytotoxic (typically DNA damaging) drugs to treat a range of proliferative disorders, including cancer, tumors, psoriasis, arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis, among others. Chemotherapeutic compounds tend to be non-specific and, particularly at high doses, toxic to normal, rapidly dividing cells. This often leads to a variety of side effects in patients undergoing chemotherapy.","Bone marrow suppression, a severe reduction of blood cell production in bone marrow, is one such side effect. It is characterized by both myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocytopenia) and lymphopenia. Neutropenia is characterized by a selective decrease in the number of circulating neutrophils and an enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infections. Anemia, a reduction in the number of red blood cells or erythrocytes, the quantity of hemoglobin, or the volume of packed red blood cells (characterized by a determination of the hematocrit) affects approximately 67% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in the United States. See BioWorld Today, page 4, Jul. 23, 2002. Thrombocytopenia is a reduction in platelet number with increased susceptibility to bleeding. Lymphopenia is a common side-effect of chemotherapy characterized by a reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes (also called T- and B-cells). Lymphopenic patients are predisposed to a number of types of infections.","Myelosuppression continues to represent the major dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy, resulting in considerable morbidity along with the potential need to require a reduction in chemotherapy dose intensity, which may compromise disease control and survival. Considerable evidence from prospective and retrospective randomized clinical trials clearly shows that chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression compromises long-term disease control and survival (Lyman, G. H., Chemotherapy dose intensity and quality cancer care (Oncology (Williston Park), 2006. 20(14 Suppl 9): p. 16-25)). Furthermore, treatment regimens for, for example, lung, breast, and colorectal cancer recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines are increasingly associated with significant myelosuppression yet are increasingly recommended for treating early-stage disease as well as advanced-stage or metastatic disease (Smith, R. E., Trends in recommendations for myelosuppressive chemotherapy for the treatment of solid tumors. J Natl Compr Canc Netw, 2006. 4(7): p. 649-58). This trend toward more intensive treatment of patients with cancer creates demand for improved measures to minimize the risk of myelosuppression and complications while optimizing the relative dose-intensity.","In addition to bone marrow suppression, chemotherapeutic agents can adversely affect other healthy cells such as renal epithelial cells, resulting potentially in the development of acute kidney injury due to the death of the tubular epithelia. Acute kidney injury can lead to chronic kidney disease, multi-organ failure, sepsis, and death.","One mechanism to minimize myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, and other chemotherapeutic cytotoxicities is to reduce the planned dose intensity of chemotherapies. Dose reductions or cycle delays, however, diminish the effectiveness and ultimately compromise long-term disease control and survival.","Small molecules have been used to reduce some of the side effects of certain chemotherapeutic compounds. For example, leukovorin has been used to mitigate the effects of methotrexate on bone marrow cells and on gastrointestinal mucosa cells. Amifostine has been used to reduce the incidence of neutropenia-related fever and mucositis in patients receiving alkylating or platinum-containing chemotherapeutics. Also, dexrazoxane has been used to provide cardioprotection from anthracycline anti-cancer compounds. Unfortunately, there is concern that many chemoprotectants, such as dexrazoxane and amifostine, can decrease the efficacy of chemotherapy given concomitantly.","Additional chemoprotectant therapies, particularly with chemotherapy associated anemia and neutropenia, include the use of growth factors. Hematopoietic growth factors are available on the market as recombinant proteins. These proteins include granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and their derivatives for the treatment of neutropenia, and erythropoietin (EPO) and its derivatives for the treatment of anemia. However, these recombinant proteins are expensive. Moreover, EPO has significant toxicity in cancer patients, leading to increased thrombosis, relapse and death in several large randomized trials. G-CSF and GM-CSF may increase the late (>2 years post-therapy) risk of secondary bone marrow disorders such as leukemia and myelodysplasia. Consequently, their use is restricted and not readily available any more to all patients in need.","Further, while growth factors can hasten recovery of some blood cell lineages, no therapy exists to treat suppression of platelets, macrophages, T-cells or B-cells.","Roberts et al in 2012 reported that Pfizer compound PD-0332991 induced a transient cell cycle arrest in CDK4\/6 dependent subsets of healthy cells such as HSPCs (see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012; 104(6):476-487). This compound is currently being tested by Pfizer in clinical trials as an anti-neoplastic agent against estrogen-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.","Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood as shown in  (e.g., lymphocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, granulocytes, monocytes). HSPCs require the activity of CDK4\/6 for proliferation (see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JNCI 2012; 104(6):476-487). In healthy kidneys, the renal epithelium infrequently enters the cell cycle (about 1% of epithelial cells). After a renal insult, however, a robust increase in epithelial proliferation occurs (see Humphreys, B. D. et al. Intrinsic epithelial cells repair the kidney after injury.

The use of these CDK4\/6 specific, short, transient G1-arresting compounds as chemoprotectants allows for, for example, an accelerated cell lineage recovery, reduced cytotoxicity risk due to replication delay, and\/or a minimization of chemotherapeutic agent induced cell death.","Despite reports using known CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as 2BrIC and PD0332991 to demonstrate chemoprotection, it has been discovered that these inhibitors may not be the most ideal compounds for use in pharmacological quiescence (PQ) strategies. For example, the use of 2BrIC in vivo is limited by its restricted bioavailability, and despite the relative selectivity for CDK4\/6 exhibited by PD0332991, the compound has a relatively long-acting intra-cellular effect (see Roberts et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. JCNI 2012; 104(6):476-487 ()), extending the transiency of G1 arrest beyond what may be necessary for sufficient protection from chemotherapeutic treatments. Such a long acting effect delays, for example, the proliferation of HSPC cell lineages necessary to reconstitute the hematological cell lines that are adversely affected by chemotherapeutic agents or are cycled out during their natural life-cycle. The long-acting G1 arrest provided by PD0332991 may limit its use as a potential chemoprotectant in subjects whose chemotherapeutic treatment regimen requires a rapid reentry into the cell cycle by HSPCs in order to reconstitute the erythroid, platelet, and myeloid cells (monocyte and granulocyte) adversely effected by chemotherapeutic agents or acute HSPC G1-arrest in order to limit myelosuppressive or hematologic toxicity effects. Furthermore, PD0332991 may be limited in its use as a chemoprotectant in subjects exposed to chemotherapeutic agents at regular and repeated intervals, for example, on regimens that are repeated every several days, as it may limit the ability of these subjects' HSPCs to reenter the cell-cycle quickly before it would be necessary to arrest them again prior to the subject's next chemotherapeutic cycle. With respect to other affected tissues, for example renal cells, the timely resumption of proliferation is critical to tissue repair, for example renal tubular epithelium repair, due to nephrotoxic agents, and therefore, an overly long period of PQ is undesirable.","Thus in an alternative embodiment, the invention includes administering a compound described herein in an effective amount to a host in need thereof, such compound displaying one or any combination of the following factors which provide an improved therapeutic effect (either alone or in any combination thereof, each of which is considered specifically and independently described): i) wherein a substantial portion of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells (e.g. at least 80% or greater) return to or approach pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e., reenter the cell-cycle) in less than 24 hours, 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of the active compound in humans or for example, using a protocol described in the Examples below; ii) wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours, 30 hours or 36 hours from the last administration of the active compound; (iii) wherein the dissipation of the active compound's CDK4\/6 inhibitory effect occurs in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the administration of the inhibitor; (iv) wherein the active compound has an 1050 for CDK4 and\/or CDK6 inhibition that is more than 1500 times less than its 1050 concentration for CDK2 inhibition; (v) wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells return to or approach pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e., reenter the cell-cycle) in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the dissipation of the active compound's CDK4\/6 inhibitory effect; (vi) wherein the pre-treatment baseline cell cycle activity (i.e. reenter the cell-cycle) within less than about 24 hours, about 30 hours, or about 36 hours from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration; or (vii) wherein a substantial portion of the healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle synchronously in less than 24 hours, 30 hours, or 36 hours from the last administration of the chemotherapeutic agent.","The compounds described herein can be administered to the subject prior to treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent, during treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent, after exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent, or a combination thereof. The compound described herein is typically administered in a manner that allows the drug facile access to the blood stream, for example via intravenous injection or sublingual, intraaortal, or other efficient blood-stream accessing route; however, oral, topical, transdermal, intranasal, intramuscular, or by inhalation such as by a solution, suspension, or emulsion, or other desired administrative routes can be used. In one embodiment, the compound is administered to the subject less than about 24 hours, 20 hours, 16 hours, 12 hours, 8 hours, or 4 hours, 2.5 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour, \u00bd hour or less prior to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent.

In one embodiment, the active compound is administered concomitantly, or closely thereto, with the chemotherapeutic agent exposure. If desired, the active compound can be administered multiple times during the chemotherapeutic agent treatment to maximize inhibition, especially when the chemotherapeutic drug is administered over a long period or has a long half-life. The active compound described herein can be administered following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent if desired to mitigate healthy cell damage associated with chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In certain embodiments, the active compound is administered up to about \u00bd hour, up to about 1 hour, up to about 2 hours, up to about 4 hours, up to about 8 hours, up to about 10 hours, up to about 12 hours, up to about 14 hours, up to about 16 hours, or up to about 20 hours or greater following the chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In a particular embodiment, the active compound is administered up to between about 12 hours and 20 hours following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent.","The CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein show a marked selectivity for the inhibition of CDK4 and\/or CDK6 in comparison to other CKD, for example CDK2. For example, CDK4\/6 inhibitors described in the present invention provide for a dose-dependent G1-arresting effect on a subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs or renal epithelial cells, and the methods provided for herein are sufficient to afford chemoprotection to targeted CDk4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells during chemotherapeutic agent exposure, for example, during the time period that a DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent is capable of DNA-damaging effects on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells in the subject, while allowing for the synchronous and rapid reentry into the cell-cycle by these cells shortly after the chemotherapeutic agent dissipates due to the time-limited CDK4\/6 inhibitory effect provided by the compounds described herein compared to, for example, PD0332991. Likewise, CDK4\/6 inhibitors useful in the present invention provide for a dose-dependent mitigating effect on CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells that have been exposed to toxic levels of chemotherapeutic agents, for example an accidental overdose, allowing for repair of DNA damage associated with chemotherapeutic agent exposure and synchronous, rapid reentry into the cell-cycle following dissipation of the CDK4\/6 inhibitory effect compared to, for example, PD0332991. In one embodiment, the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1-arresting effect on the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells dissipating following administration of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor so that the subject's healthy cells return to or approach their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, or 40 hours, of administration. In one embodiment, the G1-arresting effect dissipates such that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells return to their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, or 40 hours.","In one embodiment, the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1-arresting effect dissipating such that the subject's CDk4\/6-dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, or 40 hours of the chemotherapeutic agent effect. In one embodiment, the G1-arresting effect dissipates such that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells return to their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, or 40 hours, or within about 48 hours of the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent administration. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are HSPCs. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-dependent healthy cells are renal epithelial cells.","In one embodiment, the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein results in the G1-arresting effect dissipating so that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells return to or approach their pre-administration baseline cell-cycle activity within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, or within less than about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.","In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein are used to protect renal epithelium cells during exposure to a chemotherapeutic agent, for example, a DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agent, wherein the renal epithelial cells are transiently prevented from entering S-phase in response to chemotherapeutic agent induced renal tubular epithelium damage for no more than about 24 hours, about 30 hours, about 36 hours, about 40 hours, or about 48 hours from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration, from the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent effect, or from administration of the CDK4\/6 administration.","CDK4\/6 inhibitors useful in the described methods may be synchronous in their off-effect, that is, upon dissipation of the G1 arresting effect, CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells exposed to a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein reenter the cell-cycle in a similarly timed fashion. CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells that reenter the cell-cycle do so such that the normal proportion of cells in G1 and S are reestablished quickly and efficiently, within less than about 24 hours, 30 hours, 36 hours, 40 hours, or within about 48 hours of the from the point in which the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's concentration level in the subject's blood drops below a therapeutic effective concentration.","This advantageously allows for a larger number of healthy cells to begin replicating upon dissipation of the G1 arrest compared with asynchronous CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as PD0332991.","In addition, synchronous cell-cycle reentry following G1 arrest using a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein provides for the ability to time the administration of hematopoietic growth factors to assist in the reconstitution of hematopoietic cell lines to maximize the growth factor effect. As such, in one embodiment, the use of the compounds or methods described herein is combined with the use of hematopoietic growth factors including, but not limited to, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin, interleukin (IL)-12, steel factor, and erythropoietin (EPO), or their derivatives. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered prior to administration of the hematopoietic growth factor. In one embodiment, the hematopoietic growth factor administration is timed so that the CDK4\/6 inhibitor's effect on HSPCs has dissipated.","In one aspect, the use of a CDK4\/6-inhibitor described herein allows for a chemo-protective regimen for use during standard chemotherapeutic dosing schedules or regimens common in many anti-cancer treatments. For example, the CDK4\/6-inhibitor can be administered so that CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure wherein, due to the rapid dissipation of the G1-arresting effect of the compounds, a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after chemotherapeutic agent exposure, for example, within less than about 24, 30, 40, or 48 hours, and continue to replicate until administration of the CDK4\/6-inhibitor in anticipation of the next chemotherapeutic treatment. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-inhibitor is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells between G1-arrest and reentry into the cell-cycle to accommodate a repeated-dosing chemotherapeutic treatment regimen, for example including but not limited to a treatment regimen wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is administered: on day 1-3 every 21 days; on days 1-3 every 28 days; on day 1 every 3 weeks; on day 1, day 8, and day 15 every 28 days, on day 1 and day 8 every 28 days; on days 1 and 8 every 21 days; on days 1-5 every 21 days; 1 day a week for 6-8 weeks; on days 1, 22, and 43; days 1 and 2 weekly; days 1-4 and 22-25; 1-4; 22-25, and 43-46; and similar type-regimens, wherein the CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure and a significant portion of the cells reenter the cell-cycle between chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-inhibitor can be administered so that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells are G1-arrested during daily chemotherapeutic agent exposure, for example a contiguous multi-day chemotherapeutic regimen, but a significant portion of CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells reenter the cell-cycle and replicate between daily treatment. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-inhibitors can be administered so that the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells are G1-arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure, for example a contiguous multi-day regimen, but a significant portion of healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle and replicate during the off periods before the next chemotherapeutic agent exposure. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered so that a subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells' G1-arrest is provided during a daily chemotherapeutic agent treatment regimen, for example, a contiguous multi-day treatment regimen, and the arrested cells are capable of reentering the cell-cycle shortly after the multi-day regimen ends. In one embodiment, the cancer is small cell lung cancer and the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered on days 1, 2, and 3 during a 21-day treatment cycle wherein the administered DNA damaging agent is selected from the group consisting of carboplatin, cisplatin, and etoposide, or a combination thereof.","The subject treated according to the present invention may be undergoing therapeutic chemotherapy for the treatment of a proliferative disorder or disease such as cancer. The cancer can be characterized by one or a combination of increased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), increased activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), loss, deficiency, or absence of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb)(Rb-null), high levels of MYC expression, increased cyclin E1, E2, and increased cyclin A. The cancer may be characterized by reduced expression of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein or a retinoblastoma family member protein or proteins (such as, but not limited to p107 and p130). In one embodiment, the subject is undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment for the treatment of an Rb-null or Rb-deficient cancer, including but not limited to small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, HPV-positive head and neck cancer, retinoblastoma, Rb-negative bladder cancer, Rb negative prostate cancer, osteosarcoma, or cervical cancer. In one embodiment, the cancer is a CDK4\/6-independent cancer. Administration of the inhibitor compound may allow for a higher dose of a chemotherapeutic agent to be used to treat the disease than the standard dose that would be safely used in the absence of administration of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor compound.","The host or subject, including a human, may be undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment of a non-malignant proliferative disorder, or other abnormal cellular proliferation, such as a tumor, multiple sclerosis, lupus, or arthritis.","The protected HSPCs include hematopoietic stem cells, such as long term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and short term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs), and hematopoietic progenitor cells, including multipotent progenitors (MPPs), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs). Administration of the inhibitor compound provides temporary, transient pharmacologic quiescence of hematopoietic stem and\/or hematopoietic progenitor cells in the subject.","Administration of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor as described herein can result in reduced anemia, reduced lymphopenia, reduced thrombocytopenia, or reduced neutropenia compared to that typically expected after, common after, or associated with treatment with chemotherapeutic agents in the absence of administration of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor. The use of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor as described herein results in a faster recovery from bone marrow suppression associated with long-term use of CDK4\/6 inhibitors, such as myelosuppression, anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, following the cessation of use of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor. In some embodiments, the use of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor as described herein results in reduced or limited bone marrow suppression associated with long-term use of CDK4\/6 inhibitors, such as myelosuppression, anemia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia.","In an alternative aspect, a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein can be used for its anti-cancer, anti-tumor, or anti-proliferative effect in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent to treat an Rb-negative cancer or other Rb-negative abnormal proliferation. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein provides an additive effect to or synergistic effect with the anti-cancer or anti-proliferative activity of the chemotherapeutic. Chemotherapeutics that can be combined with the CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein are any chemotherapeutics effective or useful to treat RB-null cancers or abnormal cellular proliferation. In one particular embodiment, the use of a compound described herein is combined in a therapeutic regime with at least one other chemotherapeutic agent, and can be one that does not rely on proliferation or advancement through the cell-cycle for anti-proliferative activity.

Long-term hematological toxicity can result in bone marrow disorders that can cause the ineffective production of blood cells (i.e., myelodysplasia) and\/or lymphocytes (i.e., lymphopenia, the reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes, such as B- and T-cells). Hematological toxicity can be observed, for example, as anemia, reduction in platelet count (i.e., thrombocytopenia) or reduction in white blood cell count (i.e., neutropenia). In some cases, myelodysplasia can result in the development of leukemia. Long-term toxicity related to chemotherapeutic agents can also damage other self-renewing cells in a subject, in addition to hematological cells. Thus, long-term toxicity can also lead to graying and frailty.","Active Compounds","In one embodiment, the invention is directed to compounds or the use of such compounds of Formula I, II, III, IV, or V:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0139","num":"0138"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"180.00mm","wi":"66.63mm","file":"US09487530-20161108-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;","wherein:","Z is \u2014(CH)\u2014 wherein x is 1, 2, 3 or 4 or \u2014O\u2014(CH)\u2014 wherein z is 2, 3 or 4;","each X is independently CH or N;","each X\u2032 is independently, CH or N;","X\u2033 is independently CH, S or NH, arranged such that the moiety is a stable 5-membered ring;","R, R, and Rare independently H, C-Calkyl or haloalkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkyl containing one or more heteroatoms selected from N, O or S;

the use of compounds with desired isotopic substitutions of atoms, at amounts above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, i.e., the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuterium (H) and tritium (H) may be used anywhere in described structures. Alternatively or in addition, isotopes of carbon, e.g., C and C, may be used. A preferred isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug. The deuterium can be bound in a location of bond breakage during metabolism (an \u03b1-deuterium kinetic isotope effect) or next to or near the site of bond breakage (a \u03b2-deuterium kinetic isotope effect).","Substitution with isotopes such as deuterium can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Substitution of deuterium for hydrogen at a site of metabolic break down can reduce the rate of or eliminate the metabolism at that bond. At any position of the compound that a hydrogen atom may be present, the hydrogen atom can be any isotope of hydrogen, including protium (H), deuterium (H) and tritium (H). Thus, reference herein to a compound encompasses all potential isotopic forms unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.","The term \u201cisotopically-labeled\u201d analog refers to an analog that is a \u201cdeuterated analog\u201d, a \u201cC-labeled analog,\u201d or a \u201cdeuterated\/C-labeled analog.\u201d The term \u201cdeuterated analog\u201d means a compound described herein, whereby a H-isotope, i.e., hydrogen\/protium (H), is substituted by a H-isotope, i.e., deuterium (H). Deuterium substitution can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted by at least one deuterium. In certain embodiments, the isotope is 90, 95 or 99% or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In some embodiments it is deuterium that is 90, 95 or 99% enriched at a desired location.","CDK-Replication Dependent Cells and Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitors","Tissue-specific stem cells and subsets of other resident proliferating cells are capable of self-renewal, meaning that they are capable of replacing themselves throughout the adult mammalian lifespan through regulated replication. Additionally, stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce \u201cprogeny\u201d or \u201cprogenitor\u201d cells that in turn produce various components of a given organ. For example, in the hematopoietic system, the hematopoietic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells which in turn give rise to all the differentiated components of blood (e.g., white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets). See .","Certain proliferating cells, such as HSPCs, require the enzymatic activity of the proliferative kinases cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and\/or cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) for cellular replication. In contrast, the majority of proliferating cells in adult mammals (e.g., the more differentiated blood-forming cells in the bone marrow) do not require the activity of CDK4 and\/or CDK6 (i.e., CDK4\/6). These differentiated cells can proliferate in the absence of CDK4\/6 activity by using other proliferative kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) or cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1).","The CDK4\/6 inhibitor administered is selected from the group consisting of a compound or composition comprising Formula I, Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1.","In certain embodiments, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is a CDK4\/6 inhibitor of Formula I, II, III, IV, or V or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof, wherein the protection afforded by the compound is short term and transient in nature, allowing a significant portion of the cells to synchronously renter the cell-cycle quickly following the cessation of the chemotherapeutic agent's effect, for example within less than about 24, 30, 36, or 40 hours. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from compounds T, Q, GG, U, or AAAA, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. Cells that are quiescent within the G1 phase of the cell cycle are more resistant to the damaging effect of chemotherapeutic agents than proliferating cells. CDK4\/6 inhibitory compounds for use in the described methods are highly selective, potent CDK4\/6 inhibitors, with minimal CDK2 inhibitory activity.

In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor for use in the methods described herein are selected from the group consisting of Formula I, Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, or prodrug, thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from compounds T, Q, GG, U, or AAAA, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof.","In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein are used in CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cell cycling strategies wherein a subject is exposed to regular, repeated chemotherapeutic treatments, wherein the healthy cells are G1-arrested when chemotherapeutic agent exposed and allowed to reenter the cell-cycle before the subject's next chemotherapeutic treatment. Such cycling allows CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells to regenerate damaged blood cell lineages between regular, repeated treatments, for example those associated with standard chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer, and reduces the risk associated with long term CDK4\/6 inhibition. This cycling between a state of G1-arrest and a state of replication is not feasible in limited time-spaced, repeated chemotherapeutic agent exposures using longer acting CDK4\/6 inhibitors such as PD0332991, as the lingering G1-arresting effects of the compound prohibit significant and meaningful reentry into the cell-cycle before the next chemotherapeutic agent exposure or delay the healthy cells from entering the cell cycle and reconstituting damaged tissues or cells following treatment cessation.","Proliferative disorders that are treated with chemotherapy include cancerous and non-cancer diseases. In a typical embodiment, the proliferative disorder is a CDK4\/6-replication independent disorder. The compounds are effective in protecting healthy CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells, for example HSPCs, during chemotherapeutic treatment of a broad range of tumor types, including but not limited to the following: breast, prostate, ovarian, skin, lung, colorectal, brain (i.e., glioma) and renal. Preferably, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor should not compromise the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent or arrest G1 arrest the cancer cells. Many cancers do not depend on the activities of CDK4\/6 for proliferation as they can use the proliferative kinases promiscuously (e.g., can use CDK 1\/2\/4\/or 6) or lack the function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), which is inactivated by the CDKs. The potential sensitivity of certain tumors to CDK4\/6 inhibition can be deduced based on tumor type and molecular genetics using standard techniques. Cancers that are not typically affected by the inhibition of CDK4\/6 are those that can be characterized by one or more of the group including, but not limited to, increased activity of CDK1 or CDK2, loss, deficiency, or absence of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), high levels of MYC expression, increased cyclin E (e.g., E1 or E2) and increased cyclin A, or expression of a Rb-inactivating protein (such as HPV-encoded E7). Such cancers can include, but are not limited to, small cell lung cancer, retinoblastoma, HPV positive malignancies like cervical cancer and certain head and neck cancers, MYC amplified tumors such as Burkitts' Lymphoma, and triple negative breast cancer; certain classes of sarcoma, certain classes of non-small cell lung carcinoma, certain classes of melanoma, certain classes of pancreatic cancer, certain classes of leukemia, certain classes of lymphoma, certain classes of brain cancer, certain classes of colon cancer, certain classes of prostate cancer, certain classes of ovarian cancer, certain classes of uterine cancer, certain classes of thyroid and other endocrine tissue cancers, certain classes of salivary cancers, certain classes of thymic carcinomas, certain classes of kidney cancers, certain classes of bladder cancers, and certain classes of testicular cancers.","The loss or absence of retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein (Rb-null) can be determined through any of the standard assays known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to Western Blot, ELISA (enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay), IHC (immunohistochemistry), and FACS (fluorescent activated cell sorting). The selection of the assay will depend upon the tissue, cell line or surrogate tissue sample that is utilized e.g., for example Western Blot and ELISA may be used with any or all types of tissues, cell lines or surrogate tissues, whereas the IHC method would be more appropriate wherein the tissue utilized in the methods of the present invention was a tumor biopsy. FACs analysis would be most applicable to samples that were single cell suspensions such as cell lines and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. See for example, US 20070212736 \u201cFunctional Immunohistochemical Cell Cycle Analysis as a Prognostic Indicator for Cancer\u201d.","Alternatively, molecular genetic testing may be used for determination of retinoblastoma gene status. Molecular genetic testing for retinoblastoma includes the following as described in Lohmann and Gallie \u201cRetinoblastoma. Gene Reviews\u201d (2010) http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/bookshelf\/br.fcgi?book=gene&part=retinoblastoma or Parsam et al. \u201cA comprehensive, sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the RB1 gene in retinoblastoma\u201d Journal of Genetics, 88(4), 517-527 (2009).","Increased activity of CDK1 or CDK2, high levels of MYC expression, increased cyclin E and increased cyclin A can be determined through any of the standard assays known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including but not limited to Western Blot, ELISA (enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay), IHC (immunohistochemistry), and FACS (fluorescent activated cell sorting). The selection of the assay will depend upon the tissue, cell line, or surrogate tissue sample that is utilized e.g., for example Western Blot and ELISA may be used with any or all types of tissues, cell lines, or surrogate tissues, whereas the IHC method would be more appropriate wherein the tissue utilized in the methods of the present invention was a tumor biopsy. FACs analysis would be most applicable to samples that were single cell suspensions such as cell lines and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from a small cell lung cancer, retinoblastoma, and triple negative (ER\/PR\/Her2 negative) or \u201cbasal-like\u201d breast cancer, which almost always inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb), and therefore do not require CDK4\/6 activity to proliferate. Triple negative (basal-like) breast cancer is also almost always genetically or functionally Rb-null. Also, certain virally induced cancers (e.g. cervical cancer and subsets of Head and Neck cancer) express a viral protein (E7) which inactivates Rb making these tumors functionally Rb-null. Some lung cancers are also believed to be caused by HPV. In one particular embodiment, the cancer is small cell lung cancer, and the patient is treated with a DNA-damaging agent selected from the group consisting of etoposide, carboplatin, and cisplatin, or a combination thereof.","The selected CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein can also be used in protecting healthy CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells during chemotherapeutic treatments of abnormal tissues in non-cancer proliferative diseases, including but not limited to: psoriasis, lupus, arthritis (notably rheumatoid arthritis), hemangiomatosis in infants, multiple sclerosis, myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis, ganglioneuromatosis, keloid formation, Paget's Disease of the bone, fibrocystic disease of the breast, Peyronie's and Duputren's fibrosis, restenosis, and cirrhosis. Further, selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors can be used to ameliorate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents in the event of accidental exposure or overdose (e.g., methotrexate overdose).","According to the present invention, the active compound can be administered to a subject on any chemotherapeutic treatment schedule and in any dose consistent with the prescribed course of treatment. The selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor compound is administered prior to, during, or following the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein can be administered to the subject during the time period ranging from 24 hours prior to chemotherapeutic treatment until 24 hours following exposure. This time period, however, can be extended to time earlier that 24 hour prior to exposure to the agent (e.g., based upon the time it takes the chemotherapeutic agent used to achieve suitable plasma concentrations and\/or the compound's plasma half-life). Further, the time period can be extended longer than 24 hours following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent so long as later administration of the CDK4\/6 inhibitor leads to at least some protective effect. Such post-exposure treatment can be especially useful in cases of accidental exposure or overdose.","In some embodiments, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor can be administered to the subject at a time period prior to the administration of the chemotherapeutic agent, so that plasma levels of the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor are peaking at the time of administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. If convenient, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor can be administered at the same time as the chemotherapeutic agent, in order to simplify the treatment regimen. In some embodiments, the chemoprotectant and chemotherapeutic can be provided in a single formulation.","In some embodiments, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor can be administered to the subject such that the chemotherapeutic agent can be administered either at higher doses (increased chemotherapeutic dose intensity) or more frequently (increased chemotherapeutic dose density). Dose-dense chemotherapy is a chemotherapy treatment plan in which drugs are given with less time between treatments than in a standard chemotherapy treatment plan. Chemotherapy dose intensity represents unit dose of chemotherapy administered per unit time. Dose intensity can be increased or decreased through altering dose administered, time interval of administration, or both. Myelosuppression continues to represent the major dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality along with frequent reductions in chemotherapy dose intensity, which may compromise disease control and survival. The compounds and their use as described herein represent a way of increasing chemotherapy dose density and\/or dose intensity while mitigating adverse events such as, but not limited to, myelosuppression.","If desired, multiple doses of the selected CDK4\/6 inhibitor compound can be administered to the subject. Alternatively, the subject can be given a single dose of the selected CDK4\/6 inhibitor. For example, the CDK4\/6-inhibitor can be administered so that CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure wherein, due to the rapid dissipation of the G1-arresting effect of the compounds, a significant number of healthy cells reenter the cell-cycle and are capable of replicating shortly after chemotherapeutic agent exposure, for example, within about 24-48 hours or less, and continue to replicate until administration of the CDK4\/6-inhibitor in anticipation of the next chemotherapeutic treatment. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6-inhibitor is administered to allow for the cycling of the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells between G1-arrest and reentry into the cell-cycle to accommodate a repeated-dosing chemotherapeutic treatment regimen, for example, including but not limited to a treatment regimen wherein the chemotherapeutic agent is administered: on day 1-3 every 21 days; on days 1-3 every 28 days; on day 1 every 3 weeks; on day 1, day 8, and day 15 every 28 days, on day 1 and day 8 every 28 days; on days 1 and 8 every 21 days; on days 1-5 every 21 days; 1 day a week for 6-8 weeks; on days 1, 22, and 43; days 1 and 2 weekly; days 1-4 and 22-25; 1-4; 22-25, and 43-46; and similar type-regimens, wherein the CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells are G1 arrested during chemotherapeutic agent exposure and a significant portion of the cells reenter the cell-cycle in between chemotherapeutic agent exposure.","In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein is used to provide chemoprotection to a subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells during a CDK4\/6-replication independent small cell lung cancer treatment protocol.

In one embodiment, the subject is undergoing 5 times a week chemotherapeutic treatment, wherein the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are G1 arrested during the chemotherapeutic agent exposure and allowed to reenter the cell-cycle during the 2 day break, for example, over the weekend.","In one embodiment, using a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein, the subject's CDK4\/6-replicaton dependent healthy cells are arrested during the entirety of the chemotherapeutic agent exposure time-period, for example, during a contiguous multi-day regimens, the cells are arrested over the time period that is required to complete the contiguous multi-day course, and then allowed to recycle at the end of the contiguous multi-day course. In one embodiment, using a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein, the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are arrested during the entirety of the chemotherapeutic regimen, for example, in a daily chemotherapeutic exposure for three weeks, and rapidly reenter the cell-cycle following the completion of the therapeutic regimen.","In one embodiment, the subject has been exposed to a chemotherapeutic agent, and, using a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein, the subject's CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells are placed in G1 arrest following exposure in order to mitigate, for example, DNA damage. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is administered at least \u00bd hour, at least 1 hour, at least 2 hours, at least 3 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 5 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 7 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 10 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 16 hours, at least 18 hours, at least 20 hours or more post chemotherapeutic agent exposure.","In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for protection of mammals, particularly humans, from the acute and chronic toxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents by forcing CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and\/or renal epithelial cells, into a quiescent state by transient (e.g., over a less than about 40, 36, 30, 24 hour or less period) treatment with a CDK4\/6 inhibitor selected from the group consisting of Formula I, Formula II, Formula III, Formula IV, or Formula V or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog, or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from the compounds described in Table 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. In one embodiment, the compound is selected from compounds T, Q, GG, U, or AAAA, or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, salt, isotopic analog or prodrug thereof. CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells recover from this period of transient quiescence, and then function normally after treatment with the inhibitor is stopped, and its intra-cellular effect dissipates. During the period of quiescence, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells are protected from the effects of chemotherapeutic agents.","In some embodiments, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells can be arrested for longer periods, for example, over a period of hours, days, and\/or weeks, through multiple, time separated administrations of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein. Because of the rapid and synchronous reentry into the cell cycle by CDK4\/6-replication dependent healthy cells, for example HSPCs, upon dissipation of the CDK4\/6 inhibitors intra-cellular effects, the cells are capable of reconstituting the cell lineages faster than CDK4\/6 inhibitors with longer G1 arresting profiles, for example PD0332991.","The reduction in chemotoxicity afforded by the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors can allow for dose intensification (e.g., more therapy can be given in a fixed period of time) in medically related chemotherapies, which will translate to better efficacy. Therefore, the presently disclosed methods can result in chemotherapy regimens that are less toxic and more effective. Also, in contrast to protective treatments with exogenous biological growth factors, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein are orally available small molecules, which can be formulated for administration via a number of different routes. When appropriate, the small molecules can be formulated for oral, topical, intranasal, inhalation, intravenous or any other desired form of administration.","A CDK4\/6 inhibitor useful in the methods described herein is a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor compound that selectively inhibit at least one of CDK4 and CDK6, or whose predominant mode of action is through inhibition of CDK4 and\/or CDK6. In one embodiment, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors have an ICfor CDK4 as measured in a CDK4\/CycD1 ICphosphorylation assay that is at least 1500, 2000, 5000 or even 10,000 times or greater lower than the compound's ICs for CDK2 as measured in a CDK2\/CycE ICphosphorylation assay. In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitors are at least about 10 times or greater more potent (i.e., have an ICin a CDK4\/CycD1 phosphorylation assay that is at least 10 times or more lower) than PD0332991.","The use of a selected CDK4\/6 inhibitor as described herein can induce selective G1 arrest in CDK4\/6-dependent cells (e.g., as measured in a cell-based in vitro assay). In one embodiment, the CDK4\/6 inhibitor is capable of increasing the percentage of CDK4\/6-dependent cells in the G1 phase, while decreasing the percentage of CDK4\/6-dependent cells in the G2\/M phase and S phase. In one embodiment, the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor induces substantially pure (i.e., \u201cclean\u201d) G1 cell cycle arrest in the CDK4\/6-dependent cells (e.g., wherein treatment with the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor induces cell cycle arrest such that the majority of cells are arrested in G1 as defined by standard methods (e.g. propidium iodide (PI) staining or others) with the population of cells in the G2\/M and S phases combined being less than about 30%, about 25%, about 20%, about 15%, about 10%, about 5%, about 3% or less of the total cell population. Methods of assessing the cell phase of a population of cells are known in the art (see, for example, in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0224522) and include cytometric analysis, microscopic analysis, gradient centrifugation, elutriation, fluorescence techniques including immunofluorescence, and combinations thereof. Cytometric techniques include exposing the cell to a labeling agent or stain, such as DNA-binding dyes, e.g., PI, and analyzing cellular DNA content by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence techniques include detection of specific cell cycle indicators such as, for example, thymidine analogs (e.g., 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) or an iododeoxyuridine), with fluorescent antibodies.","In some embodiments, the use of a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein result in reduced or substantially free of off-target effects, particularly related to inhibition of kinases other than CDK4 and or CDK6 such as CDK2, as the selective CDK4\/6 inhibitors described herein are poor inhibitors (e.g., >1 uM IC) of CDK2. Furthermore, because of the high selectivity for CDK4\/6, the use of the compounds described herein should not induce cell cycle arrest in CDK4\/6-independent cells. In addition, because of the short transient nature of the G1-arrest effect, the CDK4\/6-replication dependent cells more quickly reenter the cell-cycle than, comparatively, use of PD0332991 provides, resulting in the reduced risk of, in one embodiment, hematological toxicity development during long term treatment regimens due to the ability of HSPCs to replicate between chemotherapeutic treatments.","In some embodiments, the use of a selective CDK4\/6 inhibitor described herein reduces the risk of undesirable off-target effects including, but not limited to, long term toxicity, anti-oxidant effects, and estrogenic effects. Anti-oxidant effects can be determined by standard assays known in the art. For example, a compound with no significant anti-oxidant effects is a compound that does not significantly scavenge free-radicals, such as oxygen radicals. The anti-oxidant effects of a compound can be compared to a compound with known anti-oxidant activity, such as genistein. Thus, a compound with no significant anti-oxidant activity can be one that has less than about 2, 3, 5, 10, 30, or 100 fold anti-oxidant activity relative to genistein. Estrogenic activities can also be determined via known assays. For instance, a non-estrogenic compound is one that does not significantly bind and activate the estrogen receptor. A compound that is substantially free of estrogenic effects can be one that has less than about 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, or 100 fold estrogenic activity relative to a compound with estrogenic activity, e.g., genistein.","Synthesis of Select CDK4\/6 Inhibitors","CDK4\/6 Inhibitors of the present invention can be synthesized by any means known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including for example, according to the generalized Schemes of 1 through 9 below. Specific syntheses can be found in, for instance, WO2012\/061156 (5-(4-isopropylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridine-2-amine and 5-(4-morpholino-1-piperidyl)pyridine-2-amine respectively).

The Boc protected lactam is treated with carbon dioxide in the presence of a nickel catalyst to generate a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is reacted with thionyl chloride in the presence of an organic solvent such as toluene. The resulting acid chloride is treated with an amine to generate an amide that can be deprotected with a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to generate the final target inhibitor compound.","Alternatively, the lactam can be generated by reacting the carboxylic acid with a protected amine in the presence of a strong acid and a dehydrating agent, which can be together in one moiety as a strong acid anhydride.

The active compound can be administered to the subject through any suitable approach. The amount and timing of active compound administered can, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the dosage of chemotherapy to which the subject is anticipated of being exposed to, on the time course of the chemotherapeutic agent exposure, on the manner of administration, on the pharmacokinetic properties of the particular active compound, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. Thus, because of subject to subject variability, the dosages given below are a guideline and the physician can titrate doses of the compound to achieve the treatment that the physician considers appropriate for the subject. In considering the degree of treatment desired, the physician can balance a variety of factors such as age and weight of the subject, presence of preexisting disease, as well as presence of other diseases. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared for any desired route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, intravenous, or aerosol administration, as discussed in greater detail below.","The therapeutically effective dosage of any active compound described herein will be determined by the health care practitioner depending on the condition, size and age of the patient as well as the route of delivery. In one non-limited embodiment, a dosage from about 0.1 to about 200 mg\/kg has therapeutic efficacy, with all weights being calculated based upon the weight of the active compound, including the cases where a salt is employed. In some embodiments, the dosage can be the amount of compound needed to provide a serum concentration of the active compound of up to between about 1 and 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 \u03bcM. In some embodiments, a dosage from about 10 mg\/kg to about 50 mg\/kg can be employed for oral administration. Typically, a dosage from about 0.5 mg\/kg to 5 mg\/kg can be employed for intramuscular injection. In some embodiments, dosages can be from about 1 \u03bcmol\/kg to about 50 \u03bcmol\/kg, or, optionally, between about 22 \u03bcmol\/kg and about 33 \u03bcmol\/kg of the compound for intravenous or oral administration. An oral dosage form can include any appropriate amount of active material, including for example from 5 mg to, 50, 100, 200, or 500 mg per tablet or other solid dosage form.","In accordance with the presently disclosed methods, pharmaceutically active compounds as described herein can be administered orally as a solid or as a liquid, or can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, or by inhalation as a solution, suspension, or emulsion. In some embodiments, the compounds or salts also can be administered by inhalation, intravenously, or intramuscularly as a liposomal suspension. When administered through inhalation the active compound or salt can be in the form of a plurality of solid particles or droplets having any desired particle size, and for example, from about 0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 to about 5, 10, 20 or more microns, and optionally from about 1 to about 2 microns.

If a solution is desired, water may be the carrier of choice for water-soluble compounds or salts. With respect to the water-soluble compounds or salts, an organic vehicle, such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or mixtures thereof, can be suitable. In the latter instance, the organic vehicle can contain a substantial amount of water. The solution in either instance can then be sterilized in a suitable manner known to those in the art, and for illustration by filtration through a 0.22-micron filter. Subsequent to sterilization, the solution can be dispensed into appropriate receptacles, such as depyrogenated glass vials. The dispensing is optionally done by an aseptic method. Sterilized closures can then be placed on the vials and, if desired, the vial contents can be lyophilized.","In addition to the active compounds or their salts, the pharmaceutical formulations can contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the formulations can contain antimicrobial preservatives. Useful antimicrobial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. An antimicrobial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multi-dose use. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be lyophilized using techniques well known in the art.","For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch (e.g., potato or tapioca starch) and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc are often very useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules. Materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and\/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.","In yet another embodiment of the subject matter described herein, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile formulation comprising an active compound as described herein, or a salt thereof, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound or salt is provided in the form of a lyophilizate, which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid formulation suitable for injection thereof into a subject. When the compound or salt is substantially water-insoluble, a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent, which is physiologically acceptable, can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound or salt in an aqueous carrier. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin.","Additional embodiments provided herein include liposomal formulations of the active compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is an aqueous-soluble salt, using conventional liposome technology, the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the active compound, the active compound can be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol-free. When the active compound of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the salt can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer that forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes that are produced can be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. The liposomal formulations comprising the active compounds disclosed herein can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate, which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension.","Pharmaceutical formulations also are provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of a desired compound described herein or a salt thereof, or a plurality of solid particles of the compound or salt. The desired formulation can be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization can be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the compounds or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles may for example have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 10 microns, and optionally from about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid compound or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. Optionally, the size of the solid particles or droplets can be from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. The compounds can be administered via an aerosol suspension of respirable particles in a manner set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","When the pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol is in the form of a liquid, the formulation can comprise a water-soluble active compound in a carrier that comprises water. A surfactant can be present, which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salts\u201d as used herein refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with subjects (e.g., human subjects) without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit\/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter.","Thus, the term \u201csalts\u201d refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the presently disclosed subject matter. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be formed with metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, or of organic amines. Examples of metals used as cations, include, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and the like. Examples of suitable amines include, but are not limited to, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine.","Salts can be prepared from inorganic acids sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, phosphorus, and the like.

further characterize its kinase activity, Compound T was screened against 456 (395 non-mutant) kinases using DiscoveRx's KINOMEscan\u2122 profiling service. The compound was screened using a single concentration of 1000 nM (>1000 times the 1050 on Cdk4). Results from this screen confirmed the high potency against Cdk4 and high selectivity versus Cdk2. Additionally, the kinome profiling showed that Compound T was relatively selective for Cdk4 and Cdk6 compared to the other kinases tested. Specifically, when using an inhibitory threshold of 65%, 90%, or 99%, Compound T inhibited 92 (23.3%), 31 (7.8%) or 6 (1.5%) of 395 non-mutant kinases respectively.","In addition to CDK4 kinase activity, several compounds were also tested against CDK6 kinase activity.

Twenty-four hours after plating, each cell line was treated with Compound T in a dose dependent manner for 24 hours.

This complex phosphorylates the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb). To demonstrate the impact of Cdk4\/6 inhibition on Rb phosphorylation (pRb), Compound T was exposed to three cell lines, two Cdk4\/6 dependent (tHS68, WM2664; Rb-positive) and one Cdk4\/6 independent (A2058; Rb-negative). Twenty four hours after seeding, cells were treated with Compound T at 300 nM final concentration for 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours. Samples were lysed and protein was assayed by western blot analysis. Rb phosphorylation was measured at two sites targeted by the Cdk4\/6-cyclin D complex, Ser780 and Ser807\/811 using species specific antibodies. Results demonstrate that Compound T blocks Rb phosphorylation in Rb-dependent cell lines by 16 hours post exposure, while having no effect on Rb-independent cells ().","The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor is a major negative cell cycle regulator that is inactivated in approximately 11% of all human cancers. Functional loss of RB is an obligate event in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) development. In RB competent tumors, activated Cdk2\/4\/6 promote G1 to S phase traversal by phosphorylating and inactivating RB (and related family members). Conversely, cancers with RB deletion or inactivation do not require Cdk4\/6 activity for cell cycle progression. Since inactivation of RB is an obligate event in SCLC development, this tumor type is highly resistant to Cdk4\/6 inhibitors and co-administration of Cdk4\/6 inhibitors with DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents such as those used in SCLC should not antagonize the efficacy of such agents.","Several compounds (PD0332991, Compound GG, and Compound T) were tested for their ability to block cell proliferation in a panel of SCLC cell lines with known genetic loss of RB. SCLC cells were treated with DMSO or the indicated Cdk4\/6 inhibitor for 24 hours. The effect of Cdk4\/6 inhibition on proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation. An RB-intact, Cdk4\/6-dependent cell line (WM2664 or tHS68) and a panel of RB-negative SCLC cell lines (H69, H82, H209, H345, NCI417, or SHP-77) were analyzed for growth inhibition by the various CDK4\/6 inhibitors.","As shown in , Rb-negative SCLC cells are resistant to Cdk4\/6 inhibition. In , PD0332991 inhibits the Rb-positive cell line (WM2664), but does not affect the growth of the Rb-negative small cell lung cancer cell lines (H345, H69, H209, SHP-77, NCI417, and H82). In , Compound GG inhibits the Rb-positive cell line (tHS68), but does not affect the growth of the Rb-negative cell lines (H345, H69, SHP-77, and H82). In , Compound T inhibits the Rb-positive cell line (tHS68), but does not affect the growth of the Rb-negative cell lines (H69, SHP-77, and H209). This analysis demonstrated that RB-null SCLC cell lines were resistant to Cdk4\/6 inhibition, as no change in the percent of cells in S-phase were seen upon treatment with any of the Cdk4\/6 inhibitors tested, including Compound T and Compound GG, while the RB-proficient cell line in each experiment was highly sensitive to Cdk4\/6 inhibition with almost no cells remaining in S-phase after 24 hours of treatment.","Cellular proliferation assays were conducted using the following Rb-negative cancer cell lines: H69 (human small cell lung cancer\u2014Rb-negative) cells or A2058 (human metastatic melanoma cells\u2014Rb-negative). These cells were seeded in Costar (Tewksbury, Mass.) 3093 96 well tissue culture treated white walled\/clear bottom plates. Cells were treated with the compounds of Table 1 as nine point dose response dilution series from 10 uM to 1 nM. Cells were exposed to compounds and then cell viability was determined after either four (H69) or six (A2058) days as indicated using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay (CTG; Promega, Madison, Wis., United States of America) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Plates were read on BioTek (Winooski, Vt.) Syngergy2 multi-mode plate reader. The Relative Light Units (RLU) were plotted as a result of variable molar concentration and data was analyzed using Graphpad (LaJolla, Calif.) Prism 5 statistical software to determine the ECfor each compound.","Select compounds disclosed herein were evaluated against a small cell lung cancer cell line (H69) and a human metastatic melanoma cell line (A2058), two Rb-deficient (Rb-negative) cell lines. The results of these cellular inhibition assays are shown in Table 4. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of H69 small cell lung cancer cells was 2040 nM to >3000 nM. The range of the inhibitory ECvalues necessary for inhibition of A2058 malignant melanoma cell proliferation was 1313 nM to >3000 nM.

Results are shown in  as the ratio of EdU positive cells for treated animals at 12 or 24 hour time points compared to control. Compound T and GG demonstrated a reduction in EdU incorporation at 12 hours which was starting to return to normal at 24 hours. Compound Q also demonstrated some reduction at 12 hours and started to return to baseline at 24 hours despite the fact that oral bioavailability of Compound Q is low.","Further experiments were completed with Compound T examining dose response and longer periods of compound treatment. Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 50, 100 or 150 mg\/kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12 and 24 hours as described above. Alternatively, Compound T was dosed by oral gavage at 150 mg\/kg and EdU incorporation into bone marrow was determined at 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours. As can be seen in , and similar to the cellular washout experiments, bone marrow cells, and in particular HSPCs were returning to normal cell division as determined by EdU incorporation in 24 hours following oral gavage at a number of doses. The 150 mg\/kg oral dose of Compound T in  can be compared directly to the results of the same dose of PD0332991 shown in  where cells were still non-dividing (as determined by low EdU incorporation) at 24 and 36 hours, only returning to normal values at 48 hours.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0768","num":"0808"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"As seen in , a single oral dose of PD0332991 results in a sustained reduction in HSPCs for greater than 36 hours. In contrast, a single oral dose of Compound T results in an initial reduction of HSPC proliferation at 12 hours, but proliferation of HSPCs resumes by 24 hours after dosage of Compound T.","HS68 cells were seeded out at 40,000 cells\/well in 60 mm dish on day 1 in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U\/ml penicillin\/streptomycin and 1\u00d7 Glutamax (Invitrogen) as described (Brookes et al. EMBO J, 21(12)2936-2945 (2002) and Ruas et al.

On day 3, one set of treated cell samples were harvested in triplicate (0 Hour sample). Remaining cells were washed two times in PBS-CMF and returned to culture media lacking test compound.

In contrast, HS68 cells treated with compounds of the present invention returned to normal baseline cell division in as little as 24 hours or 40 hours, distinct from PD0332991 at these same time points. The results using human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells () also show that PD0332991-treated cells took significantly longer to return to baseline levels of cell division as compared to cells treated with compounds T, Q, GG, or U.","Compounds of the present invention demonstrate good pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

Human, mouse, and dog liver microsomes were purchased from Xenotech, and Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes were prepared by Absorption Systems. The reaction mixture comprising 0.5 mg\/mL of liver microsomes, 100 mM of potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 5 mM of magnesium chloride, and 1 uM of test compound was prepared. The test compound was added into the reaction mixture at a final concentration of 1 uM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (without cofactor) was incubated in shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. for 3 minutes. The control compound, testosterone, was run simultaneously with the test compound in a separate reaction. The reaction was initiated by the addition of cofactor (NADPH), and the mixture was then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37 deg. C. Aliquots (100 \u03bcL) were withdrawn at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes for the test compound and 0, 10, 30, and 60 minutes for testosterone. Test compound samples were immediately combined with 100 \u03bcL of ice-cold acetonitrile containing internal standard to terminate the reaction. Testosterone samples were immediately combined with 800 \u03bcL of ice cold 50\/50 acetonitrile\/dH2O containing 0.1% formic acid and internal standard to terminate the reaction. The samples were assayed using a validated LC-MS\/MS method. Test compound samples were analyzed using the Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometer to quantify the disappearance of parent test compound and detect the appearance of metabolites. The peak area response ration (PARR) to internal standard was compared to the PARR at time 0 to determine the percent of test compound or positive control remaining at time-point. Half-lives were calculated using GraphPad software, fitting to a single-phase exponential decay equation.","Half-life was calculated based on t1\/2=0.693 k, where k is the elimination rate constant based on the slope plot of natural logarithm percent remaining versus incubation time. When calculated half-life was longer than the duration of the experiment, the half-life was expressed as >the longest incubation time. The calculated half-life is also listed in parentheses. If the calculated half-life is >2\u00d7 the duration of the experiment, no half-life was reported. The timely resumption of cellular proliferation is necessary for tissue repair, and therefore an overly long period of arrest is undesirable in healthy cells such as HSPCs. The characteristics of a CDK4\/6 inhibitor that dictate its arresting duration are its pharmacokinetic (PK) and enzymatic half-lives. Once initiated, a G1-arrest in vivo will be maintained as long as circulating compound remains at an inhibitory level, and as long as the compound engages the enzyme. PD032991, for example, possesses an overall long PK half-life and a fairly slow enzymatic off-rate. In humans, PD0332991 exhibits a PK half-life of 27 hours (see Schwartz, G K et al. (2011) BJC, 104:1862-1868). In humans, a single administration of PD0332991 produces a cell cycle arrest of HSPC lasting approximately one week. This reflects the 6 days to clear the compound (5 half-lives\u00d727 hour half-life), as well as an additional 1.5 to 2 days of inhibition of enzymatic CDK4\/6 function. This calculation suggests that it takes a total of 7+ days for normal bone marrow function to return, during which time new blood production is reduced. These observations may explain the severe granulocytopenia seen with PD0332991 in the clinic.","Further experiments were completed with Compound T and PD0332991 to compare the metabolic stability (half-life) in human, dog, rat, monkey, and mouse liver microsomes. As shown in , when analyzing the stability of the compounds in liver microsomes across species, the determinable half-life of Compound T is shorter in each species compared to that reported for PD0332991. Furthermore, as previously described above and in , it appears that PD0332991 also has an extended enzymatic half-life, as evidenced by the production of a pronounced cell cycle arrest in human cells lasting more than forty hours even after compound is removed from the cell culture media (i.e., in an in vitro wash-out experiment). As further shown in , removal of the compounds described herein from the culture media leads to a rapid resumption of proliferation, consistent with a rapid enzymatic off rate. These differences in enzymatic off rates translate into a marked difference in pharmacodynamic (PD) effect, as shown in . As shown, a single oral dose of PD0332991 produces a 36+ hour growth arrest of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in murine bone marrow, which is greater than would be explained by the 6 hour PK half-life of PD0332991 in mice. In contrast, the effect of Compound T is much shorter, allowing a rapid re-entry into the cell cycle, providing exquisite in vivo control of HSPC proliferation.","In order to demonstrate that pharmacological quiescence induced by Compound T treatment affords resistance to chemotherapeutic agents with differing mechanisms of action, an in vitro model was developed using telomerized human diploid fibroblasts (tHDFs; a human foreskin fibroblast line immortalized with expression of human telomerase). These cells are highly Cdk4\/6-dependent for proliferation as demonstrated by their complete G1 arrest following treatment with Cdk4\/6 inhibitors (See Roberts P J, et al. Multiple Roles of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4\/6 Inhibitors in Cancer Therapy. J Natl Cancer Inst 2012; Mar. 21; 104(6): 476-87). Cell survival was determined by Cell TiterGlo assay per manufacturer's recommendations. For both \u03b3-H2AX and caspase 3\/7 assays, cells were plated and allowed to become adherent for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with Compound T (at indicated concentrations) or vehicle control for 16 hours, at which time the indicated chemotherapy was added to the pretreated cells. For \u03b3-H2AX, cells were harvested for analysis 8 hours after chemotherapy exposure. For the \u03b3-H2AX assay, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-\u03b3-H2AX as per the \u03b3-H2AX Flow Kit (Millipore) and quantitated by flow cytometry. Data was analyzed using FlowJo 2.2 software developed by TreeStar, Inc. For the in vitro caspase 3\/7 assay, cells were harvested 24 hours post chemotherapy treatment. Caspase 3\/7 activation was measured using the Caspase-Glo\u00ae 3\/7 Assay System (Promega) per manufacturer's recommendations.","As shown in , Compound T provides selective protection from carboplatin and etoposide-induced cell death. Treatment of tHS68 human fibroblasts with increasing concentrations of Compound T in the presence of etoposide (5 \u03bcM; ) or carboplatin (100 \u03bcM; ) selectively induces a dose dependent cell survival as determined by Cell TiterGlo.","Treatment with Compound T prior to treatment with several DNA damaging agents (e.g., carboplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, camptothecin) or an anti-mitotic (paclitaxel) attenuated DNA damage as measured by \u03b3-H2AX formation (). Additionally, treatment of tHDF cells with Compound T prior to carboplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, camptothecin, and paclitaxel exposure elicited a robust decrease in caspase 3\/7 activation in a dose-dependent manner (). These data show that a transient cell cycle arrest in G1, induced by Cdk4\/6 inhibition, decreases the toxicity of a variety of commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapy agents associated with myelosuppression in Cdk4\/6-sensitive cells.","To characterize the effects of Compound T treatment on proliferation of the different mouse hematopoietic cells, 8-week-old female C57B1\/6 mice were given a single dose of vehicle alone (20% Solutol) or Compound T (150 mg\/kg) by oral gavage. Ten-hours later, all mice were given a single i.p. injection of 100 mcg EdU (5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine) to label cells in S-phase of the cell cycle. All treated mice were euthanized 2 hours after EdU injection, bone marrow cells were harvested and processed for flow cytometric analysis of EdU-incorporation ().","In , representative contour plots show proliferation in WBM (whole bone marrow; top) and HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells; LSK; bottom), as measured by EdU incorporation for cells with no treatment, EdU treatment only, or EdU plus Compound T treatment. Compound T was found to reduce proliferation of whole bone marrow and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.","Compared to vehicle-treated mice, Compound T treated mice showed significantly less EdU-positive (EdU) cells in all hematopoietic lineages analyzed. The reduction in EdU cell frequency is most likely due to reduced S-phase entry, which is consistent with the fact that Compound T potently inhibits Cdk4\/6 activity. Overall, Compound T treatment caused \u02dc70% reduction of EdU cell frequency in unfractionated whole bone marrow cells (See  and ). In the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), Compound T treatment resulted in potent cell cycle arrest of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC, 74% inhibition), the most primitive cells in the entire hematopoietic lineage hierarchy, as well as multipotent progenitors (MPP, 90% inhibition), the immediate downstream progeny of HSCs ().","As shown in , further down the lineage differentiation hierarchy, proliferation of the lineage restricted myeloid (CMP, GMP and MEP) and lymphoid progenitors (CLP) were also significantly inhibited by Compound T, showing between a 76-92% reduction in EdU cell frequency.","Using the same experimental protocol as discussed in Example X above and shown in , the effects of Compound T on the proliferation of differentiated hematopoietic cells was investigated. The resulting effect of Compound T in differentiated hematopoietic cells was more variable than that seen in HSPCs. While T and B cell progenitors are highly sensitive to Compound T (>99% and >80% reduction in EdU cell frequencies respectively), proliferation of differentiated myeloerythroid cells are more resistant to Compound T, with Mac1G1 myeloid cells showing 46% reduction in EdU cell frequency, and Ter119 erythroid cells showing 58% reduction in EdU cell frequency (). Together, these data suggest that while all hematopoietic cells are sensitive to Compound T-induced cell cycle arrest, the degree of inhibition varies among different cell lineages, with myeloid cells showing a smaller effect of Compound T on cell proliferation than seen in the other cell lineages.","To assess the effect of transient CDK4\/6 inhibition by Compound GG on carboplatin-induced cytotoxicity in the bone marrow, FVB\/n mice (n=3 per group) were treated with vehicle control, 90 mg\/kg carboplatin by intraperitoneal injection, or 150 mg\/kg Compound GG by oral gavage plus 90 mg\/kg carboplatin by intraperitoneal injection. 24 hours after treatment bone marrow was harvested and the percent of cycling bone marrow progenitors was measured by EdU incorporation as explained earlier. As shown in , administration of Compound GG at the same time as carboplatin administration results in a significant protection of bone marrow progenitors. EdU incorporation in control animals was normalized to 100% and compared to EdU incorporation for bone marrow from carboplatin treated animals or carboplatin and Compound GG treated animals.","To determine the ability of Compound T to modulate chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, a well characterized single-dose 5-fluorouracil (5FU) regimen, known to be highly myelosuppressive in mice, was utilized. FVB\/n female mice were given single oral doses of vehicle or Compound T at 150 mg\/kg, followed 30 minutes later by a single intraperitoneal dose of 5FU at 150 mg\/kg. Complete blood cell counts were measured every two days starting on day six.","Co-administration of Compound T positively impacted recovery of all hematopoietic lineages from 5-FU induced myelosuppression.  demonstrates the time course of recovery of different blood cell types in mice treated with Compound T or vehicle control prior to 5FU administration. It was determined that in each hematopoietic cell lineage tested (whole blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, and red blood cells), Compound T provided a more rapid recovery of that cells treated only with 5FU.
