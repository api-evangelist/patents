{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"p":["The present application relates to novel alkylcarboxylic acids having an oxo-substituted azaheterocyclic partial structure, to processes for their preparation, to their use for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, and to their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prevention of diseases, especially for the treatment and\/or prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitric oxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyze the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family disclosed to date can be divided both according to structural features and according to the type of ligands into two groups: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one heme per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. The latter is of central importance for the mechanism of activation. NO is able to bind to the iron atom of heme and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Heme-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to attach to the central iron atom of heme, but the stimulation by CO is distinctly less than that by NO.","Through the production of cGMP and the regulation, resulting therefrom, of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays a crucial part in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and in disorders caused by an impairment of the aforementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system may be suppressed, which may lead for example to high blood pressure, platelet activation, increased cellular proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, thromboses, stroke and myocardial infarction.","A possible way of treating such disorders which is independent of NO and aims at influencing the cGMP signaling pathway in organisms is a promising approach because of the high efficiency and few side effects which are to be expected.","Compounds, such as organic nitrates, whose effect is based on NO have to date been exclusively used for the therapeutic stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase. NO is produced by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attaching to the central iron atom of heme. Besides the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment [O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755]. Substances which directly stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase, i.e. without previous release of NO, have been identified in recent years. The indazole derivative YC-1 was the first NO-independent but heme-dependent sGC stimulator described [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. Based on YC-1, further substances were discovered which are more potent than YC-1 and show no relevant inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE). This led to the identification of the pyrazolopyridine derivatives BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and BAY 63-2521. Together with the recently published structurally different substances CMF-1571 and A-350619, these compounds form the new class of the sGC stimulators [Evgenov et al., ibid.]. A common characteristic of this substance class is an NO\u2014independent and selective activation of the heme-containing sGC. In addition, the sGC stimulators in combination with NO have a synergistic effect on sGC activation based on a stabilization of the nitrosyl-heme complex. The exact binding site of the sGC stimulators at the sGC is still being debated. If the heme group is removed from the soluble guanylate cyclase, the enzyme still has a detectable catalytic basal activity, i.e. cGMP is still being formed. The remaining catalytic basal activity of the heme-free enzyme cannot be stimulated by any of the stimulators mentioned above [Evgenov et al., ibid.].","In addition, NO\u2014 and heme-independent sGC activators, with BAY 58-2667 as prototype of this class, have been identified. Common characteristics of these substances are that in combination with NO they only have an additive effect on enzyme activation, and that the activation of the oxidized or heme-free enzyme is markedly higher than that of the heme-containing enzyme [Evgenov et al., ibid.; J. P. Stasch et al., 136 (2002), 773; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552]. Spectroscopic studies show that BAY 58-2667 displaces the oxidized heme group which, as a result of the weakening of the iron-histidine bond, is attached only weakly to the sGC. It has also been shown that the characteristic sGC heme binding motif Tyr-x-Ser-x-Arg is absolutely essential both for the interaction of the negatively charged propionic acids of the heme group and for the action of BAY 58-2667. Against this background, it is assumed that the binding site of BAY 58-2667 at the sGC is identical to the binding site of the heme group [J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","The compounds described in the present invention are now likewise capable of activating the heme-free form of soluble guanylate cyclase. This is also confirmed by the fact that these novel activators firstly have no synergistic action with NO at the heme-containing enzyme and that secondly their action cannot be blocked by the heme-dependent inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-1,2,4-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), but is even potentiated by this inhibitor [cf. O. V. Evgenov et al., 5 (2006), 755; J. P. Stasch et al., 116 (2006), 2552].","It was thus an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act as activators of soluble guanylate cyclase in the manner described above and can be used as such in particular for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.","Structurally, the compounds of the present invention are distinguished by a terminal alkyl-carboxylic acid grouping which is attached, in the manner shown below, to an oxo-substituted azaheterocycle as head group.","EP 0 719 763-A1, EP 0 779 279-A1 and EP 0 802 192-A1 described various phenylacetamide derivatives having an azaheterocyclic partial structure as apolipoprotein B inhibitors for the treatment of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, and EP 0 608 709-A1 discloses 2-oxochinolinylmethyl-substituted phenylacetamides as angiotensin II antagonists for the treatment of arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis. EP 0 842 943-A2, EP 0 842 944-A2, EP 0 842 945-A2, EP 0 918 059-A1 and WO 99\/60015-A1 claim inter alia oxoheterocyclically substituted alkylcarboxylic acids as VLA-4 antagonists and inhibitors of leukocyte adhesion.

A guideline compressive force for the compression is 15 kN.","Suspension which can be administered orally:","Composition:","1000 mg of the compound according to the invention, 1000 mg of ethanol (96%), 400 mg of Rhodigel\u00ae (xanthan gum from FMC, Pennsylvania, USA) and 99 g of water.","10 ml of oral suspension correspond to a single dose of 100 mg of the compound according to the invention.","Production:","The Rhodigel is suspended in ethanol, and the compound according to the invention is added to the suspension. The water is added while stirring. The mixture is stirred for about 6 h until the swelling of the Rhodigel is complete.","Solution which can be Administered Orally:","Composition:","500 mg of the compound according to the invention, 2.5 g of polysorbate and 97 g of polyethylene glycol 400.20 g of oral solution correspond to a single dose of 100 mg of the compound according to the invention.","Production:","The compound according to the invention is suspended in the mixture of polyethylene glycol and polysorbate with stirring. The stirring process is continued until the compound according to the invention has completely dissolved.","i.v. Solution:","The compound according to the invention is dissolved in a concentration below the saturation solubility in a physiologically tolerated solvent (e.g. isotonic saline, 5% glucose solution and\/or 30% PEG 400 solution). The solution is sterilized by filtration and used to fill sterile and pyrogen-free injection containers."],"DETDESC":[{},{}],"heading":["A.
