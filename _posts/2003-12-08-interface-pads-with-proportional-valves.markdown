title: Interface pads with proportional valves
abstract: These interface pads with proportional valves have at least one inflatable member having a foam core with a cell structure that absorbs atmospheric air. The transmission of air into the foam core is controlled by a valve in said opening. Fasteners are used to affix this inflatable member in a location where it can serve as an interface pad between a living creature and another object. The valve used is a proportional valve adjustable to different pressure settings, where the different pressure settings allow air to escape from the valve until the set pressure is reached. In one preferred embodiment, there are two inflatable members adapted for placement adjacent the upper sides of a load-bearing animal. An important subcategory of this embodiment covers bareback riding pads, including bareback riding pads for use by handicapped persons. In other embodiments, at least one inflatable member is adapted to pad an interface between a human and an object. Where the object is a seat, the fasteners are adapted for affixing inflatable member(s) to a seat. Where the object is a prosthetic, the pad is adapted to pad the interface between human and prosthetic, and the fasteners are adapted for affixing inflatable member(s) in position with respect to the prosthetic.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/312,479, filed on 15 Aug. 2001, and is a CIP of U.S. Non-provisional application Ser. No. 10\/219,715, filed Aug. 15, 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,658,827, which applications and patent are incorporated by reference herein.","My invention pertains generally to the field of interface pads used to pad the interface between an animal or human and a saddle, seat, or other implement. More particularly, it is concerned with interface pads having (i) a foam core wholly surrounded by and bonded to a pair of thin skins or panels so as to form a fluid tight envelope with (ii) a valve that is preferably a proportional valve disposed between the chamber formed by the envelope and the ambient environment.","It is a recognized fact that most saddles do not fit most horses. Production saddles are made to fit a size and type of horse and rider in general. However, no horse is completely symmetrical. All have some unevenness of frame and proportion that can lead to an improper fit and interface between horse and saddle. This can, in turn, lead to discomfort and injury to the horse. Even custom saddles made to suit exacting measurements taken from a standing animal may not fit properly after the animal is cinched to secure the saddle, is mounted and adapts to the load, and then moves under the load. Further, the contour of the horse's back changes as it turns and moves about. Thus, even a saddle that fits properly when the horse is at rest may cause problems when the horse is in motion. In addition to this, the rider's weight may be unevenly distributed and may shift during riding. Finally, not all saddles are properly balanced and symmetrical. Some are produced with defects and some can become warped or crooked with use.","Given the foregoing facts, it is almost imperative to provide some type of saddle pad (or \u201cinterface\u201d) between saddle and horse in order to mediate the differences, and soften contact, between the horse's back and the lower surfaces of the saddle. In my patent issued Dec. 9, 2003, for \u201cInterface Pads\u201d (U.S. Pat. No. 6,658,827) I developed and described ideal animal\/saddle and rider interfaces that were durable and included, in various embodiments, the following features: (1) means for automatically alleviating and mediating mismatches between a saddle or saddle tree and a load-bearing animal so that the entire load is distributed evenly over the length of the tree on both sides; (2) means for automatically compensating for differences between the two sides of the animal so as to equal and level the animal's load; (3) means for automatically distributing and\/or otherwise compensating for uneven static or dynamic side-to-side and front-to-back loads such as those caused by unequal conformation or loading or movement of the rider; (4) means for automatically absorbing and distributing shock and vibration while traveling; (5) means for automatically adjusting each of the foregoing when necessary due to environmental changes (e.g.\u2014air pressure changes) or load changes; (6) means for reducing or eliminating slippage of the interface on the horse or saddle on the interface; (7) means for avoiding contact with the spinal area of the horse; (8) means for encouraging and allowing the free circulation of air in and through the gullet of the saddle; (9) means for expediting the evaporation of perspiration and moisture from the horse and interface including means for making the pad as thin as possible; and (10) means for automatically adapting to the movement of the animal in flexing and turning.","The interface pads of my invention, according to one preferred embodiment of the invention, are comprised of at least a first and a second discrete inflatable member directly or indirectly linked to one another. The volume of air in each of these inflatable members is capable of independent adjustment. For convenience, the first member is referred to as the left member and the second member is referred to as the right member. The right member is adapted to provide an interface between the right side of a load-bearing animal and the right portion of a load-supporting structure such as a saddle. The left member is adapted to provide an interface between the left side of the load-bearing animal and the left portion of the load-supporting structure. Connecting means are provided to span the spinal area of the animal so as to mechanically link the first and second members to one another.","In one embodiment, the connecting means is a separate component subsequently integrated into or onto the inflatable members such as by attaching one or more straps or clips to each inflatable member. In another embodiment, the connecting means is an integral component, such as the flexible panels used to create the inflatable members, which spans from one member to the other member. In still another embodiment, the connecting means is an auxiliary non-integrated component wherein the connection between inflatable members is by way of a receiving structure adapted to individually receive each inflatable member. These receiving structures can be shaped to fit under various types of saddles and\/or to serve as a bareback pad.","To overcome many of the drawbacks of the prior art, the inflatable members of my invention are constructed of a foam core wholly surrounded by and bonded to a pair of thin skins or panels, which form a fluid tight envelope. A valve is disposed between the chamber formed by the envelope and the ambient environment. This innovation is critical to the proper functioning of my invention. Prior air pads have featured air chambers that were empty or enclosed a loosely fitting core of foam or some other material. Bonding the core to the outer walls of the chamber means that air entering and leaving the chamber must filter slowly through the foam core rather than rushing around its periphery. This, in turn, allows the air pad to provide valuable quasi-orthotic benefits. Thus, for example, after allowing inflation of an air pad of this type and inserting the air pad between saddle and horse, the valve can be opened. In this situation, the air pad will conform to the contours and configuration of both saddle and horse until it reaches a point where the pressure exerted by foam and air remaining in the foam matches the exterior pressure placed on its various parts. The valve is then closed. When the air pad is removed and examined, it will be seen to have taken a shape and configuration conforming to the contours and configuration of horse and saddle. If the valve remains closed, the air pad will retain this orthotic configuration for an extended period of time. Yet, it is relatively flexible and remains capable of adjusting as necessary to the turning and active movements of the horse and the shifting movements of the load being carried.","Even given the innate benefits of my design as set forth above, I have also found that the inclusion of proportional valves is extremely advantageous for the purposes of my invention. The proportional valve of my invention is, generally speaking, a spring-loaded valve that can be adjusted to different degrees of tightness. At its tightest setting, only a heavy load (or rider) will be sufficient to displace the spring-biased plug for the valve and allow air to exit the pad. At its lightest setting, the moderate pressure exerted on the air pad by a light load (or rider) will accomplish this result. The inclusion of proportional valves allow my pads to function more efficiently with loads (or riders) of different weights. For example, with an ordinary valve, it is possible that a very heavy rider could compress the air pads almost completely over some critical pressure points. In this situation, the air pads would cease to function for their intended purpose in the most efficient manner. However, with proportional valves adjusted to a setting based on the rider's weight, this problem will not occur. The valves will not allow as much air to escape when a heavier load is placed on the air pads, preserving the cushioning function and quasi-orthotic benefits of my invention.","In addition to the advantages discussed above, the inclusion of proportional air valves has another important benefit: they are virtually automatic. Without such valves, it is necessary for the rider to initially open the air valves to allow air to escape from full air pads so that the air pads can assume the desired molded\/orthotic configuration. The non-proportional air valves are then closed to fix the air pads in this configuration. (Usually this procedure is followed after initially cinching the saddle into place, re-cinching the saddle for tightness, and mounting the horse.) However, with a proportional air valve, the adjustment process becomes almost fully automatic. After initially setting the air valves for the desired load, the rider need take no further action. The air pads will let the desired amount of air escape automatically when the rider cinches the saddle into place and mounts.","In addition to the changes and improvements set forth above, I have found it very advantageous to form the pads of my invention from breathable moisture wicking materials that allow perspiration to freely evaporate and aid in cooling. I have also found it advantageous to form the surfaces of these pads from a breathable non-slip material that has never been used in this type of application. A material formed from a polyester mesh with polyvinylchloride (PVC) coating bonded to felt is ideal for this purpose. This material, which was previously used for making weightlifter's gloves, provides excellent non-slip traction for the pads of my invention without inhibiting the free flow of air and other desirable characteristics of the moisture wicking materials I use in making my pads. This non-slip material is currently produced and sold under the brand name TOUGH TEK. It is, in addition, very useful in creating non-slip straps for use with my invention.","The types of tough durable inflatable members preferred for use as air pads in my invention are presently produced by Cascade Designs, Inc. of Seattle, Wash., under the trademark THERM-A-REST. The nature of the inflatable members can be varied depending upon the environment in which the invention will be exposed. For example, the inflatable member can use a homogenous core such as the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,624,877 and 4,025,974 or can use a composite core such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,286, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, other cores can be used as long as the core includes tensile elements therein that, when bonded to the pair of thin skins or panels, resist displacement of the skins when the pad is subject to compression. However, cores that slow the movement of air in, out, and through the pad are preferred.","Finally, in addition to the uses specified above, the inflatable members of my invention can be used and are claimed in my patent for use as seat pads (with the addition of means to hold inflatable member(s) in position on a seat). However, numerous other possibilities inherent in my invention for equine and human use remain.","My invention is comprised of at least one inflatable member having a foam core with a cell structure that absorbs atmospheric air, which foam core is wholly surrounded by and bonded to a thin skin which forms a fluid tight envelope around said foam, which thin skin has an opening for transmitting air between the foam core and the atmosphere, which transmission of air is controlled by a valve in said opening. Fasteners are used to affix this at least one inflatable member in a location where it can serve as an interface pad between a living creature and another object. Its objects and goals are further served by the use of a proportional valve, the proportional valve being adjustable to different pressure settings, which different pressure settings allow air to escape from the valve until the set pressure is reached.","In one preferred embodiment, there are two inflatable members, a left inflatable member adapted for placement between a left upper side of a load-bearing animal and a load resting on that side and a right inflatable member adapted for placement between a right upper side of the load-bearing animal opposite said left side and a load resting on that side. In this embodiment, a top connection can be provided linking said left inflatable member and said right inflatable member across an upper portion of the load-bearing animal such that said left inflatable member and said right inflatable member hang over said upper portion adjacent, respectively, the left and right upper sides of the load-bearing animal, said top connection being provided by portions of receiving structures holding said left inflatable member and said right inflatable member. And, areas covered by said receiving structures conform to a shape appropriate for a particular equine activity such as one of show riding, dressage riding, endurance riding, western riding, barrel racing, roping, racing, hunting, jumping, steeplechase, bareback riding, handicapped riding, pack horse, paraplegic riding, therapeutic riding, and English riding.","An important subcategory of this embodiment covers bareback riding pads, including bareback riding pads for use by handicapped persons. In bareback riding pads, a strap member must be provided for connecting said receiving structures underneath a load-bearing animal and holding the receiving structures in position on the load-bearing animal. Thus, such pads must have connection points for the strap member. They can also be advantageously provided with stirrups and\/or with a connector adapted to bridge the load-bearing animal's withers, which connector is provided with structural reinforcement and can be used as a hand hold. A handle can also be provided between the connector and the top connection. In another important subcategory, an expanded skirt is added. This expanded skirt holds side inflatable members adapted for placement adjacent lower sides of the load-bearing animal. This can be important in therapeutic riding endeavors with handicapped, spastic, or emotionally disturbed riders, who often kick the sides of the horse in an uncontrolled or random manner.","In other embodiments, at least one inflatable member is adapted to pad an interface between a human and an object. Where the object is a seat, the fasteners are adapted for affixing the at least one inflatable member to a seat. For seats with backs, two inflatable members can be used, a lower inflatable member adapted for placement between the seat and the human resting on that seat and a back inflatable member adapted for placement between a back of the human and a back of the seat. The back inflatable member can be adapted to serve as a lumbar support. In these embodiments as in those set forth above, a receiving structure can be provided that is adapted to hold the inflatable members in correct position with respect to said seat. Typically, the inflatable member(s) and\/or the receiving structures therefor will be shaped and adapted to cover areas appropriate to a particular type of seat such as one of a saddle, a vehicle seat, a wheelchair seat, a motorcycle seat and\/or some other type of seat. Other embodiments are adapted to pad the interface between a human and a prosthetic, and the fasteners are adapted for affixing said at least one inflatable member in position with respect to said prosthetic.","The following discussion is presented to enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the invention. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles herein can be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","Turning then to the several Figures, and more particularly to , a basic form of a preferred embodiment is shown. Each pad system comprises a pair of inflatable members  linked by a connection means forming a top connection. Each inflatable member  has a foam core wholly surrounded by and bonded to a pair of outer panels (or thin skins) to form a fluid tight envelope. Valve  is disposed between the chamber formed by the envelope and the ambient environment. Preferably, the construction of each member  is accomplished by coating one side of each outer panel with a thermoplastic material, placing respective cores between the coated panels, compressing the assembly under heat to cause portions of the cores to bond with portions of the panels, sealing the perimeters of the panels adjacent to the core to one another while including one valve  for each formed envelope. Further disclosure regarding this technology can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,624,877 and 4,025,974, which again are incorporated herein by reference.","Selection of the components that comprise each inflatable member  should be made in view of the environment in which the pad system will be used. If an inflatable member  is to be used without integration into an existing pad or blanket, then the outer should be durable and should be capable of collecting moisture (i.e.\u2014have water-wicking capabilities) and disbursing it by evaporation. This quality can be provided by adding a layer of water-wicking material to the outer surface(s) of the inflatable member . If inflatable member  will be subjected to non-uniform loads (particularly point loading), it may be beneficial to use a heterogeneous core having various Indentation Force Deflection value elements as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,286, which is again incorporated by reference herein.","Each inflatable member  is preferably a custom-formed THERM-A-REST style self-inflating pad. The custom formation is directed primarily to the intended interface of the system. Thus, if a western saddle is contemplated, then each member  will have perimeter contours for the saddletree of such a saddle. (See, e.g., .) If an English saddle is contemplated, then each member  will have perimeter contours for the saddletree of such a saddle, as is best shown in . Although preferred, adaptation of the invention to suit the intended saddletree is not required.","To form a saddle pad system  of the type illustrated in , inflatable members  are inserted into pockets in receiving structures . By establishing a saddle pad system , the benefits associated with each approach are realized as will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art. In particular, receiving structures  provide inflatable members  with increased protection from the elements, provide the animal with greater comfort, and positively locate inflatable members  on the animal so as to minimize unintentional dynamic changes that might otherwise occur during use. They can also be made to conform to a shape appropriate for a particular equine activity such as one of show riding, dressage riding, endurance riding, western riding, barrel racing, roping, racing, hunting, jumping, steeplechase, bareback riding, handicapped riding, pack horse, paraplegic riding, therapeutic riding, and English riding. In addition, inflatable members  are easily removable for cleaning, repair, or replacement. Finally, the presence of said pockets provides a location where magnets can be inserted if desired for their therapeutic effects.","Receiving structures  have durable strips  of leather for high wear areas; a horse-facing side  of felt A for cushioning, air passage, and sweat removal; a saddle-facing side  of felt A or other similar material for sweat absorption, heat passage, air passage, and evaporation; and straps  or an alternate top connection so as to form saddle pad system . Regardless of the composition of receiving structures , it is primarily necessary that they define a suitably sized and positioned pocket for receiving an inflatable member  when saddle pad system  is placed on a load-bearing animal. In order to ensure that system  maintains its proper position, I have found that it is very desirable to apply a breathable non-slip material  to the surfaces of receiving structures . This material can advantageously be formed from a polyester mesh with polyvinylchloride (PVC) coating bonded to felt and is ideal for this purpose when positioned with its mesh side facing outward. It provides excellent non-slip traction for the saddle pad system  of my invention without inhibiting the free flow of air and other desirable characteristics of the resilient moisture wicking material (wood-based felt) I use in making my pads. This non-slip material  is currently produced and sold under the brand name TOUGH TEK. It is, in addition, very useful in creating non-slip straps  for use with my invention as illustrated in .","An important subcategory covers bareback riding pads, including bareback riding pads for use by handicapped persons. As illustrated in  and , a bareback pad requires the addition of means-such as a strap  of the type shown in FIG. H\u2014to hold it in position on the horse. It can use a circingle with the circingle held in place by a reinforcing strip  as shown in . Optionally, it can be provided with some point of attachment such as an aperture  or a \u201cD\u201d ring  for use with an existing strap. It can also have a connector  adapted to bridge the animal's withers and serve as a hand-hold. Connector  can be advantageously provided with a handle  between the connector and the top connection and\/or and a reinforcement member  for further support. Bareback pads can also be advantageously provided with stirrups . In another important subcategory, an expanded skirt  with optional forward shape A is added. This expanded skirt  holds side inflatable members  adapted for placement adjacent lower sides of the load-bearing animal. This can be important in therapeutic riding endeavors with handicapped, spastic, or emotionally disturbed riders, who often kick the sides of the horse in an uncontrolled or random manner.","In other embodiments, at least one inflatable member  is adapted to pad an interface between a human and an object. Where the object is a seat, fasteners are provided for affixing the inflatable member  to the seat. A first example is illustrated in , where my invention is configured as a seat pad  for a rider with the addition of means to hold it in position on a saddle or seat. Such means can take the form of a strap or loop  that can fasten around the horn of a saddle and an elastic cantle attachment  for fastening at the rear of the saddle. (In this option, an inflatable member can be used to form a single butt pad for use with or without other such members.)","For seats with backs, as illustrated in , two inflatable members can be used: A lower inflatable member  adapted for placement between the seat  and the human resting on that seat ; and a back inflatable member  adapted for placement between a back of the human and a back  of seat . The back inflatable member  can be adapted to serve as a lumbar support. In these embodiments as in those set forth above, a receiving structure  can be provided that is adapted to hold the inflatable members in correct position with respect to said seat , with straps A, cords or straps with hooks and\/or loops A and\/or standard shock cords  for use in fastening the receiving structure to a seat. Typically, the inflatable member(s) and\/or the receiving structures therefor will be shaped and adapted to cover areas appropriate to a particular type of seat such as one of a saddle, a vehicle seat, a motorcycle seat and\/or some other type of seat. Thus, another example is provided in , F and G, illustrating embodiments for use with a motorcycle or other vehicle with tandem seating. In the particular embodiment illustrated, where the vehicle rider has an operator's seat  and a separate, elevated passenger seat , two different pads are provided, an operator's seat pad  and a passenger's seat pad . These can be provided with loops A, A for attachment by, e.g., a shock cord , and can also be advantageously constructed using the types of non-slip surface materials B and core material C taught elsewhere herein. As illustrated in , B and C, embodiments  adapted to pad the interface between a human limb  and a prosthetic  are also possible. In this case, the prosthetic pad  has fasteners  adapted for affixing its at least one inflatable member () in position with respect to said prosthetic  by, e.g, matching Velcro fasteners  on prosthetic . Prosthetic pad  also has interfacing means, such as Velcro fasteners ,  for wrapping back and fastening onto itself to form a cylindrical shape as illustrated in .","More details on construction design are provided in , an exploded view provides details regarding the preferred use of vinyl trim , binding , sections of \/ inch felt with polyester mesh coating  and , Velcro  and , \/ inch felt , and  inch reinforcement straps . However in whatever manner my invention is constructed, it is advantageous to use proportionate valves A for valves . A proportionate valve A can be a spring-loaded valve of the type illustrated in , C and D through J. An ordinary valve  as illustrated in  has a valve body  with a threaded portion A on which is mounted a rotating member, screw cap . The valve  is not adjustable; it can merely be opened or closed by turning screw cap . A proportionate valve A can, however, be adjusted to different degrees of tightness by rotation of modified screw cap \u2032. This is made possible by the inclusion of a biasing spring  in proportionate valve A and other modifications thereto as shown in , C and D through J. At its tightest setting, only a heavy load (or rider) will be sufficient to displace the spring-biased plug  and allow air to escape. At its lightest setting, the moderate pressure exerted on the air pad by a light load (or rider) will accomplish this result. Detailed perspective views illustrating a line-up indicator  arrangement and illustrating a window  scale in  show two manners in which settings for proportionate valve A can be made.  through J illustrate an embodiment having four snap members  that snap into two indents  when modified screw cap \u2032 is turned. Modified screw cap \u2032 has an upper part A and a lower part B attached by screw-threaded portion A to a valve body  with an O-ring B. The snap indent members  of this embodiment not only acts as an indicator of pressure setting, but help to stabilize and prevent undesired rotation of the rotating member\/screw cap \u2032 for this embodiment. They thereby stabilize and prevent unintended change in the pressure setting for the proportionate valve A."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 1A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 1F","FIGS. 1D and 1E"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 1G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1H"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 2G"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 3C","FIG. 3A"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 3E","FIG. 1H"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 3F","FIG. 1H"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 3G","FIG. 1H"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 3H","FIG. 3C"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3I","FIG. 3C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 4D","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4E","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 4F","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4G","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 4H","FIG. 4C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 4I","FIG. 4H"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIG. 4J","FIG. 4G"],"b":["4","4"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 5A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIG. 5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 5C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
