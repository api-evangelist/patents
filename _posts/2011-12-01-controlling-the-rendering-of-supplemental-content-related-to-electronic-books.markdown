title: Controlling the rendering of supplemental content related to electronic books
abstract: Architectures and techniques are provided to control the rendering of supplemental content associated with electronic books. For example, electronic books may be associated with content that is in addition to the content originally provided to an individual acquiring the electronic book, such as annotations, social networking site information, media outlet information, and the like. Individuals may control the supplemental electronic book content that is rendered via their client devices via actuation of a physical input device or a representation of an input device shown via a touch sensitive display. The amount of supplemental content that is rendered may correspond to information associated with a specified number of categories of supplemental electronic book content based on a supplemental content rendering level. In other implementations, the amount of supplemental electronic book content that is rendered may correspond to an amount of supplemental content to be rendered for each category of supplemental content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","CONCLUSION"],"p":["Increasingly, individuals are reading electronic versions of books, also referred to in some cases as \u201ceBooks\u201d or \u201celectronic books,\u201d via their client devices, such as electronic reader devices, smart phones, tablet computers, and the like. Supplemental content associated with electronic books is also becoming more prevalent. For example, individuals may post comments about electronic books they are reading to social networking sites and\/or micro-blogging sites. Further, individuals may provide annotations associated with electronic books as they are reading the electronic books. In some cases, the annotations may be collected by one or more service providers or publishers and made available to certain individuals reading an electronic book. In addition, information about electronic books and authors of electronic books may be available via a number of sites, such as media outlet sites, blogging sites, and so forth. However, it can be inefficient and time consuming to aggregate supplemental content associated with electronic books from a number of sources. Additionally, individuals may not even be aware of all of the supplemental content that is available for an electronic book. Further, client devices generally provide limited mechanisms for controlling the rendering of supplemental content while reading an electronic book.","This disclosure describes architectures and techniques to control the rendering of supplemental content associated with electronic books. In particular, electronic books may be provided to client devices of individuals via an electronic book distributor or another service provider. The electronic books may include one or more forms of content, such as text content, image content, video content, audio content, or combinations thereof. The content of electronic books may be provided by one or more authors of the electronic book, one or more editors of the electronic book, one or more publishers of the electronic book, or combinations thereof. When an individual acquires an electronic book, the content of the electronic book may be sent to the client device of the individual by the electronic book distributor.","In some cases, electronic books may be associated with content that is in addition to the content originally provided to an individual acquiring the electronic book. For example, individuals may provide annotations corresponding to electronic books. The individuals providing the annotations may include one or more authors of the electronic book, people that are reading or that have read the electronic book, professors, students, combinations thereof, and the like. In certain situations, the annotations may be collected by a service provider and provided to one or more individuals that acquired the electronic book.","In another example, social network activity may be generated about particular electronic books. To illustrate, individuals may post comments about electronic books that they are reading on a social networking site. Additionally, micro-blogging sites and\/or blogs may include comments about electronic books. Further, media outlet sites that provide news pieces, articles, commentaries, combinations thereof, and so forth, may distribute information that is related to electronic books.","In certain implementations, a service provider may aggregate supplemental content associated with electronic books and provide the supplemental content to individuals that have acquired the electronic books. For example, the service provider may aggregate annotations, social network activity, media outlet information, and the like, and provide the supplemental content to certain individuals. In some cases, the individuals may have requested to receive the supplemental content from the service provider. Further, the individuals may have provided some value to the service provider to receive the supplemental electronic book content.","In some scenarios, individuals may control the supplemental electronic book content that is rendered via their client devices. In particular instances, a client device may include a physical input device, such as a dial, wheel, slider, button, etc., that can be actuated to indicate a level of supplemental electronic book content rendering. In other instances, the client device may render a representation of an input device via a touch sensitive display that can be utilized to set a level of supplemental electronic book content rendering. The level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to an amount of supplemental content related to an electronic book that is rendered when an individual is viewing the electronic book via the client device.","In certain implementations, the amount of supplemental content that is rendered may correspond to rendering supplemental content from a specified number of categories of supplemental electronic book content at a given time. To illustrate, a particular level of supplemental electronic book content rendering may relate to rendering social network activity and annotations associated with an electronic book, while another level of supplemental content rendering may relate to merely rendering social network activity related to the electronic book. In other implementations, the amount of supplemental electronic book content that is rendered may correspond to an amount of each category of supplemental content that is rendered. In one example, a specified level of supplemental content rendering may be directed to providing social networking activity from direct contacts of an individual associated with a social networking site. Additionally, a different level of supplemental electronic book content rendering may correspond to rendering social networking activity from direct contacts of the individual and contacts of the individual's direct contacts (e.g. Friends of Friends). In another example, one level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to providing annotations having at least a specified level of popularity, while another level of supplemental content rendering relates to providing annotations with at least a different level of popularity.","Thus, by aggregating supplemental content associated with electronic books from a number of sources, a service provider may conveniently provide supplemental electronic book content to individuals in a manner that allows individuals to avoid spending a lot of time locating supplemental content related to an electronic book, where the supplemental content is provided by various sources. Further, enabling individuals with the opportunity to control an amount of supplemental content rendering provides individuals with the flexibility to render more or less supplemental electronic book content at a given time. For example, in some cases, when an individual wants to focus merely on reading an electronic book without any distractions, the individual may set one level of supplemental content rendering, while in other situations, when the individual wants to read about what others are saying about an electronic book, the individual may set another level of supplemental content rendering. Further, by providing an easy to use physical input device and\/or rendering a supplemental content rendering selector via a touch sensitive display of a client device, individuals may readily switch from one supplemental content rendering level to another.","Some implementations of the architectures and techniques described herein are described in the context of electronic books. The terms \u201celectronic book\u201d and\/or \u201ceBook,\u201d as used herein, may include electronic or digital representations of printed works, as well as digital content that may include text, multimedia, hypertext, and\/or hypermedia. Examples of printed and\/or digital works include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, periodicals, journals, reference materials, telephone books, textbooks, anthologies, instruction manuals, proceedings of meetings, forms, directories, maps, web pages, etc. However, certain concepts described herein are also applicable to other types of digital items, such as audio digital content (e.g. music, audio books, etc.), video digital content (e.g. movies, multimedia presentations, etc.), image digital content (e.g. photographs, illustrations, etc.), and other content items that people watch, listen to, or otherwise experience.","Example Architecture",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","102","102","102","104","104"]},"The client device  may also aggregate supplemental content associated with electronic books. For example, the client device  may obtain supplemental electronic book content from one or more sources, such as first information source  and second information source . In some situations, the first information source , the second information source , or both, may include a social networking site, a media outlet (e.g. a news site, a television station, a radio station, a news agency, a news service, etc.), a micro-blogging site, a blogging site, one or more individuals, combinations thereof, and the like. In certain instances, the information source  or the information source  may provide content to the client device  that is not related to an electronic book, such as email content from an email account of an individual, item acquisition information indicating items (e.g. goods, services, etc.) acquired by individuals, and so on.","In the illustrative implementation shown in , the information received by the client device  from the electronic book distributor , the first information source , and the second information source , may be referred to as client device data . The client device data  may include annotations . The annotations  may include notes, comments, etc., related to one or more portions of an electronic book. The annotations  may include text content, audio content, video content, image content, or combinations thereof. In addition, the annotations  may be provided by one or more individuals in relation to an electronic book obtained by the client device . The individuals providing the annotations  may be reading the electronic book or the individuals may have completed reading the electronic book. In some cases, the annotations  may be provided by an author of the electronic book, instructors teaching classes associated with the electronic book, and so forth. The annotations  may be provided to the client device  via the electronic book distributor , via another service provider, directly from the individuals contributing the annotations, or combinations thereof.","The client device data  may also include personal content . The personal content  may include email information, item acquisition history information, payment instrument information, information associated with an account with the electronic book distributor or other service provider, user preferences (e.g. electronic book likes and dislikes, content rendering preferences, etc.), electronic book ratings, calendar information, combinations thereof, and so forth. In addition, the client device data  may include social networking information , such as social networking site account information, social networking site posts, social networking site messages, etc. Further, the client device data  may include media outlet information . The media outlet information  may include text content, video content, audio content, image content, or combinations thereof, related to news pieces, blog posts, reviews, commentaries, and so on.","The client device  includes an electronic book content system  that performs operations related to obtaining and rendering electronic books and supplemental electronic book content. In a particular implementation, at , the electronic book content system  obtains electronic books  that are stored in computer-readable media of the client device . The electronic books  may include one or more particular electronic books, such as electronic book . In certain situations, the electronic books  may be acquired from the electronic book distributor  or another service provider when a user of the client device  provides value (e.g. currency, promotional points, etc.) in exchange for the electronic books .","In addition, at , the electronic book content system  may obtain supplemental electronic book content  that is stored in computer-readable media of the client device . The supplemental electronic book content  may be obtained from the electronic book distributor , the first information source , the second information source , or combinations thereof. In some situations, the electronic book content system  may receive supplemental content from a service provider that obtains and distributes supplemental content to client devices. In other scenarios, the electronic book content system  may filter content received from the electronic book distributor , the first information source , and\/or the second information source  to determine whether the content is supplemental electronic book content. For example, the electronic book content system  may determine that some portions of the social networking information  are associated with one or more of the electronic books , while other portions of the social networking information  are not associated with one or more of the electronic books . In instances when portions of the social networking information  are associated with one or more of the electronic books , the electronic book content system  may store those portions as supplemental electronic book content . In another example, the electronic book content system  may store the annotations  as supplemental electronic book content  and refrain from storing one or more portions of the personal content  as supplemental electronic book content .","In certain instances, the electronic book content system  may identify portions of the client device data  as supplemental electronic book content  based on tags or other metadata associated with the portions of the client device data . In other situations, the electronic book content system  may apply algorithms, such as machine learning algorithms, to identify portions of the client device data  that are supplemental electronic book content . To illustrate, the electronic book content system  may analyze words of portions of the client device data  to identify titles, authors, characters, etc. that are associated with the electronic books  and store certain client device data  as supplemental electronic book content  based on the analysis of the client device data .","At , the electronic book content system  may determine portions of the supplemental content to render with corresponding portions of an electronic book, such as the electronic book . In particular, the electronic book content system  may identify portions of the supplemental electronic book content  that are associated with the electronic book . In addition, the electronic book content system  may identify a particular portion of the electronic book  that is being viewed, such as a particular page, particular line numbers, a particular article, etc., and determine portions of the supplemental electronic book content  that correspond to the particular portion of the electronic book  being viewed. For example, the electronic book content system  may identify particular annotations  that are associated with a page being viewed via a display of the client device  and\/or particular social networking activity  that is related to the portion of the electronic book  being viewed via the client device .","Further, the electronic book content system  may determine portions of the supplemental electronic book content  to render based, at least in part, on a level of supplemental content rendering. The level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to an amount of the supplemental electronic book content  to render in association with one or more portions of electronic books, such as the electronic book . The level of supplemental content rendering may be set by a user of the client device , the electronic book distributor , a publisher of the electronic book , a manufacturer or distributor of the client device , or combinations thereof. In some cases, the level of supplemental content rendering may be associated with a particular electronic book or the level of supplemental content rendering may be set for all books rendered via the client device .","In some cases, the level of supplemental content rendering may be associated with a number of categories of supplemental content to render along with content of the electronic book . To illustrate, a particular level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to rendering content related to the annotations , the social networking information , and the media outlet information  associated with a particular portion of the electronic book . Another level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to rendering supplemental content related to the annotations  and the social networking information .","In other situations, the level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to an amount of supplemental content to render from each of a number of categories of the supplemental electronic book content . For example, a specified level of supplemental content rendering may correspond to rendering annotations having a first level of popularity, social networking site posts from individuals having a first category of relationship with a user of the client device , media outlets providing information associated with locations within a first distance of a location of the client device , and so forth. Additionally, when a second level of supplemental content rendering is set, annotations having a second level of popularity may be rendered, social networking information of individuals having a second relationship with a user of the client device  may be rendered, and information from media outlets associated with locations that are a second distance from the client device may be rendered in association with a particular portion of the electronic book .","In a particular illustration, the specified level of supplemental content rendering may indicate that annotations receiving a specified number of ratings above a predetermined level (e.g. 4 out of 5 stars) will be rendered along with associated content from the electronic book . In another illustration, the specified level of supplemental content rendering may indicate that social networking site posts from individuals that are contacts of contacts of a user of the client device  according to a particular social networking site will be rendered in conjunction with an associated portion of the electronic book . Further, the specified level of supplemental content rendering may indicate that information provided by media outlets that is related to locations within the same country as the client device  and that is associated with at least a particular portion of the electronic book  may be rendered in conjunction with the particular portion of the electronic book .","At , the electronic book content system  may render a portion of the electronic book  and any related supplemental electronic book content  based at least partly on a specified supplemental content rendering level. In an illustrative implementation, the electronic book content system  may provide a user interface  that includes an electronic book portion  and first supplemental electronic book content . The electronic book content system  renders the amount of first supplemental electronic book content  in accordance with a first level of supplemental content rendering . Additionally, the electronic book content system  may provide the user interface  having the electronic book portion  and second supplemental electronic book content . The amount of the second supplemental electronic book content  rendered by the electronic book content system  is specified by a second level of supplemental content rendering . In the illustrative example of , the amount of the supplemental electronic book content  that is included in the first supplemental electronic book content  and the second electronic book content  are different.","In certain situations, the level of supplemental content rendering may be modified from the first level of supplemental content rendering  to the second level of supplemental content rendering  in response to actuation of a physical input device of the client device . In other scenarios, the level of supplemental content rendering may be modified in response to input received in relation to a portion of a touch sensitive display of the client device  that includes a representation of a device to modify a supplemental content rendering level. In an illustrative example, the physical input device and\/or a virtual input device may be associated with indicia (e.g. numbers from 0 to 10), where each indicia corresponds to a level of supplemental content rendering. In this example, a particular indicia, such as the number zero, may correspond to providing no supplemental content with electronic book content, while another indicia, such as the number ten, may correspond to providing a maximum amount of supplemental content with the electronic book content. Additionally, in some cases, the level of supplemental content rendering may be modified while a user of the client device  is viewing a particular portion of an electronic book.","Example System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","200","204","200","206","206","202","204","206","206","202","204","206","208","208"]},"The client device  includes one or more processors indicated by the processor . The client device  also includes computer-readable media  that is accessible to the processor . In some examples, the computer-readable media  may include computer-readable storage media and may include volatile memory, nonvolatile memory, removable memory, non-removable memory, or a combination thereof.

The supplemental electronic book content  may include annotations of one or more users of the client device , annotations of other individuals, social networking site comments, micro-blogging site posts, media outlet information (e.g. news piece about author of one of the electronic books , article about a movie release related to one of the electronic books , etc.), combinations thereof, and so forth.","The computer-readable media  may store an electronic book module  that is executable by the processor  to obtain the electronic books  from one or more electronic book distributors and store the electronic books  in the data store . In some cases, the electronic book module  may obtain the electronic books  from the service provider server , a publisher of the electronic books , an author of the electronic books , another service provider, or combinations thereof. In certain implementations, a user of the client device  may acquire an electronic book via a site of an electronic book distributor. In these implementations, the electronic book module  may communicate with the electronic book distributor to obtain the electronic book via the network . Additionally, a user of the client device  may acquire a subscription to an electronic book (e.g. magazine subscription, journal subscription, etc.) and the electronic book module  may receive a number of versions and\/or issues of the electronic book from an electronic book distributor at one or more times. Further, the electronic book module  may receive updated content related to the electronic books  from an electronic book distributor.","The computer-readable media  also stores a client device data module  that is executable by the processor  to obtain and store the client device data . In some cases, the client device data module  may operate in conjunction with one or more application programming interfaces (APIs), one or more webservices, one or more plug-ins, RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Feed readers\/aggregators, and the like, to obtain the client device data  from the information sources , the service provider server , or both. Additionally, the client device data module  may include or operate in association with one or more specialized apps or plug-ins executing on the client device  to obtain the client device data .","In an illustrative implementation, the client device data module  may communicate with a social networking site via an API, an app, a webservice, or combinations thereof, to obtain information associated with the social networking site. In some cases, the social networking site information may be associated with an account of a user of the client device  with the social networking site. The social networking site information may also be related to accounts of other individuals with the social networking site in other instances. The client device data module  may also obtain portions of the client device data  via an RSS feed associated with a media outlet, a blog, and so forth. The client device data module  may also obtain annotations related to the electronic books  via the service provider server , via another service provider that aggregates annotations, via client devices of individuals, combinations thereof, and so on. Further, the client device data module  may operate in conjunction with applications and\/or programs of the client device  to obtain portions of the client device data . For example, the client device data module  may operate in association with a calendaring application, a word processor application, an email application, and so forth, to obtain information that is related to electronic books. The client device data module  may also receive indications from an electronic book reader application of the client device  specifying that annotations provided by a user of the client device  are stored as portions of the client device data .","In addition, the computer-readable media  includes a supplemental electronic book content setting module  that is executable by the processor  to determine a supplemental electronic book content rendering level for one or more of the electronic books . In some situations, the supplemental electronic book content settings module  may receive data indicating actuation of a physical input device (e.g. a button, a dial, a control knob, a scroll wheel, a slider, etc.) of the client device  that is associated with selection of a supplemental electronic book content rendering level. In certain instances, the physical input device may be dedicated to selection of a supplemental electronic book content rendering level, while in other scenarios the physical input device may be associated with various selection operations (e.g. volume level selection, on\/off button, etc.) in addition to selection of a supplemental electronic book content rendering level.","The supplemental electronic book content settings module  may also receive data indicating selection of a supplemental electronic book content rendering level via a touch sensitive area of the client device . In some implementations, the touch sensitive area may be a touch sensitive display of the client device . In an illustrative example, a representation of an input device may be rendered on a display of the client device  and the supplemental electronic book content settings module  may receive input specifying selection of a particular supplemental electronic book content rendering level in relation to the representation of the input device shown on the touch sensitive display. In particular instances, the input may be provided by a finger of a user of the client device , a stylus, or both. Further, the supplemental electronic book content settings module  may receive audio input, image input, video input, and the like, via the input\/output devices  indicating selection of a particular supplemental electronic book content rendering level.","In some cases, a supplemental electronic content rendering level may be set for one or more particular electronic books of the electronic books . For example, a first supplemental electronic book content rendering level may be set for a first electronic book, while a second supplemental electronic book content rendering level may be set for a second electronic book. In addition, a particular supplemental electronic content rendering level may be set that corresponds to each of the electronic books . Further, the supplemental electronic book content settings module  may modify a supplemental content rendering level for one or more of the electronic books  in response to receiving input indicating a change in a supplemental electronic book content rendering level. The supplemental electronic book content settings module  may modify a supplemental electronic book content rendering level at various times, such as while displaying a portion of an electronic book, before accessing an electronic book, before powering up the client device , and so forth.","The computer-readable media  stores a supplemental electronic book content filtering module  that is executable by the processor  to determine supplemental content to render in association with corresponding electronic books, such as the electronic books . In particular, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine a level of supplemental content rendering for a particular electronic book, such as the electronic book , according to information obtained from the supplemental electronic book content settings module . The supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may then identify supplemental content that corresponds to at least a portion of the electronic book  and also determine an amount of the supplemental content to render in association with portions of the electronic book  based at least partly on the supplemental electronic book content rendering level.","In an illustrative implementation, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may analyze at least portions of the client device data  to identify any portions of the client device data  that are associated with the electronic book , such as annotations, social networking site comments, news articles, etc. In certain situations, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may identify portions of the client device data  that are associated with the electronic book  based, at least in part, on metadata associated with the client device data . For example, portions of the client device data  may include tags indicating that the portions are related to the electronic book . In some cases, metadata indicating an association with the electronic book  may be provided by the entity providing the portions of the client device data  to the client device . To illustrate, the service provider server  may provide annotations related to the electronic book  to the client device  and also provide metadata along with the annotations indicating that the annotations are associated with the electronic book . The metadata may also indicate particular portions of the electronic book  (e.g. a particular page, particular line numbers, a particular offset, etc.) that correspond to each annotation. In another illustration, a media outlet may provide metadata indicating that a news article includes content associated with the electronic book .","Additionally, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may analyze portions of the client device data  to determine whether the portions of the client device data  include keywords, phrases, and\/or other indicators that may link the portions of the client device data  to the electronic book . For example, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may analyze content of social networking site posts to determine whether the social networking site posts include the title of the electronic book , an author of the electronic book , names of characters of the electronic book , names of places of the electronic book , portions of text of the electronic book , images and\/or illustrations of the electronic book , combinations thereof, and so forth. The supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may also analyze annotations, media outlet information, email information, calendar information, and so forth to identify content that indicates a link with the electronic book . The supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may utilize one or more machine learning algorithms to associate portions of the client device data  with the electronic book . In some situations, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may provide metadata with respect to particular portions of the client device data  that have been analyzed specifying that the particular portions of the client device data  are associated with the electronic book  and\/or that the particular portions of the client device data  are associated with a specified section of the electronic book .","The supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may also determine an amount of supplemental content to render in association with portions of the electronic book  based at least partly on a supplemental content rendering level for the electronic book . For example, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine that information associated with a specified number of categories of supplemental content is to be rendered in association with portions of the electronic book  based on the supplemental content rendering level of the electronic book. To illustrate, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine that a first supplemental content rendering level is associated with providing information from certain categories of supplemental content and a second supplemental content rendering level is associated with providing information from different categories of supplemental content.","In an illustrative implementation, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine that annotations and social networking site information corresponding to the electronic book  may be rendered in association with the first supplemental content rendering level, while annotations, social networking site information, and media outlet information may be rendering in association with the second supplemental content rendering level. In particular scenarios, the amount of information from each category of information may be the same for each supplemental content rendering level (e.g. the same four annotations may be displayed for different supplemental content rendering levels), but the number of categories from which information is rendered changes. In some scenarios, the information rendered for each category may be based at least partly on one or more criteria that may be specified by a publisher of the electronic book , a distributor of the electronic book , a user of the client device , a manufacturer and\/or distributor of the client device , one or more service providers, combinations thereof, and so forth. Further, the categories from which information is rendered for particular supplemental content rendering levels may depend on access of information from each category by one or more users of the client device . For example, when a user of the client device  accesses annotations about electronic books more frequently than social networking site posts about electronic books, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine that information related to social networking site posts may be removed from being rendered when the level of supplemental content rendering is modified from a level that is associated with a particular number of categories of information to a level associated with fewer categories of information, that is, a level corresponding to rendering less supplemental content about the electronic book .","Further, the amount of supplemental electronic book content rendering in association with the electronic book  may correspond to an amount of supplemental content rendered with respect to each of a number of categories of supplemental electronic book content. In particular, supplemental content associated with particular categories may be rendered in association with certain portions of the electronic book . For example, when the client device  renders a portion of the electronic book  (e.g. a particular page, a particular section, etc.), annotations, social networking information, and media outlet information associated with the electronic book  may also be rendered. The amount of content associated with the annotations, social networking information, and media outlet information is based at least partly on a supplemental content rendering level. To illustrate, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine that three items are to be rendered with respect to each particular category (e.g. three annotations, three social networking site posts, three news pieces) in association with a first supplemental content rendering level and that two items are to be rendered with respect to each particular category in association with a second supplemental content rendering level. The categories of supplemental content may be determined based on one or more criteria, such as preferences of a service provider providing the supplemental content, preferences of a manufacturer and\/or distributor of the client device, preferences of a publisher of the electronic book , preferences of one or more users of the client device , combinations thereof, and the like.","The supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine the items to be rendered in association with each particular category based on popularity of the item, ratings of the item, rankings of the item, time since the item was published, preferences of one or more users of the client device , preferences of an author of the item, preferences of a distributor of the item, combinations thereof, and the like. In an illustrative example, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may determine or access data indicating that certain annotations associated with a particular portion of the electronic book  have been viewed by a specified number of individuals. In this example, the supplemental electronic book content filtering module  may indicate that annotations for the particular portion of the electronic book  are to be rendered in descending order from the annotation having the highest number of views to the annotation having the fewest views depending on the particular supplemental content rendering level.
