The mobile communications network  can be any type of mobile communications network such as, without limitation, CDMA, GSM and satellite-based networks. The mobile device  can be any type of portable device capable of communicating with the mobile network such as, without limitation, cell phones, smart phones, PDAs, tablet PC's laptop PCs and PDAs. In various embodiments, the mobile communications network  provides voice and messaging capabilities and may provide access to other networks such as, for example, other mobile communications networks and\/or the Internet.","The mobile communications network  tracks the geospatial location of the user's mobile device  in real-time or near-time as the devices moves with the user  from point to point. In various embodiments, the location of the mobile devices is determined using any technique now known, or later to be developed, in the art. For example, in an embodiment, the mobile device  automatically determines its geospatial location via built in GPS capabilities and communicates its location to the mobile communications network  periodically or continuously. Additionally or alternatively, in an embodiment, the mobile communications network  determines the location of the user mobile device  using capabilities inherent in the network such as by triangulation or by determining the nearest transmission tower to the devices.","In the illustrated example, the user  is at a geospatial position within the coverage area of the mobile communications network . The mobile communications network  is aware of, and actively tracks, the geospatial position of the user's mobile device . The user  interacts with the mobile devices  in a variety of ways including, without limitation, sending and receiving voice and text messages, sending and receiving emails, searching for subject matter using Internet based search and\/or directory services and a variety of mobile apps hosted by the mobile device .","In so interacting with his or her mobile device, the user  broadcasts data relating to the user's location history and online activities over the mobile communications network . The user's location history and online activities reflects the user's interests and preferences. Additionally, the user  expressly defines, inter alia, his or her interests and preferences to various services that the user subscribes to, for example, a mobile advertising service (not shown). In an embodiment, the user defines such interests and preferences in a list of categories of interest.","In the illustrated example, the user  is currently in close geospatial proximity (e.g. within 0.5 miles) of a variety of businesses that are potentially of interest to the user, including retail stores , personal services  and restaurants . At a first point in time, the user accesses an online directory service (e.g. online YELLOW PAGES)  using a special purpose mobile app or a generic web browser. In the illustrated example, the user wants to buy a cup of coffee, and enters the search term \u201ccoffee shop\u201d into a query entry box  and clicks on the search button . In response, the user receives two directory listings  and  for coffee shops  that are in close proximity to the user's  mobile device .","The directory listings  and  are shown displayed as simple name and address listings with a distance to each respective location. Note however, the directory listings could take any format known in the art suitable for displaying advertisements on a mobile device such as, for example, a text abstract for a business, text and graphics describing the business and\/or multimedia files describing the business. In various embodiments, the directory listings could include any other type of information relating to the business such as, for example, sales, deals or promotions offered by the business. In an embodiment, the directory listings  and  could be displayed on a map of the geographical area surrounding the user .","In an embodiment, the directory listings  and  are directory listings for the two closest coffee shops  to the user. In an embodiment, the directory listings  and  are directory listings for the two coffee shops  that are in close proximity to the user and who have additionally paid for placement in search results for a category or a keyword (e.g. \u201csponsored search\u201d results for \u201ccoffee\u201d).","In the illustrated example, the top-ranked directory listing  displays a directory listing for \u201cABC Coffee\u201d, which is the user's favorite brand of coffee. In an embodiment, the user  explicitly defines his or her preference for \u201cABC Coffee\u201d to a mobile advertising service (not shown), for example, as one category in a list of categories. In an embodiment, a mobile advertising service determines that the user  prefers \u201cABC Coffee\u201d using data relating to the user's previous online activity (e.g. searches, purchases, and\/or websites visited). In the illustrated example, the directory listing  for \u201cABC Coffee\u201d is displayed in preference to closer coffee shops, for example, \u201cXYZ Coffee\u201d as reflected in the second-ranked directory listing .","In the illustrated example, the second-ranked directory listings  displays an advertisement for \u201cXYZ Coffee\u201d, which is unfamiliar to the user , but which is close by and relevant to the user's  query (e.g. by keyword or category). In the illustrated example, the location for \u201cXYZ Coffee\u201d is actually closer to the user  than the location for \u201cABC Coffee\u201d and the user  could impulsively visit the location for \u201cXYZ Coffee\u201d.","At a second point in time, the user  accesses a mobile app  on the user's mobile device. In an embodiment, the mobile app  could be any type of app, such as, for example, a mapping application, a communication application, a social networking application, a game, a news and information application or a web browser accessing a third-party website. In the illustrated example, the app  displays a title bar , a banner  displaying an advertisement and a window  directed to the function of the app .","Without any action on the part of the user , the banner  automatically displays an advertisement for a nearby location of \u201cABC Coffee Shop\u201d. In an embodiment, the banner  is displayed by a banner app (not shown) embedded in the mobile app . In an embodiment, the banner app automatically issues a search to a mobile advertising service (not shown) for advertisements relating to the user's  current geospatial position. In response, the mobile advertising service returns one or more advertisements relating to the user's  current geospatial position and which additionally relate to categories of interest to the user. The banner app embedded in the mobile app  then displays the advertisements in the banner  of the user interface of the mobile app .","In the illustrated example, an advertisement for \u201cABC Coffee\u201d is selected, at least in part, because the user  is interested in \u201cABC Coffee\u201d, and at least in part because a location of \u201cABC Coffee\u201d is close to the user's current geospatial position. In an embodiment, advertisements selected for mobile apps  utilizing a mobile advertising service are unrelated to the mobile app , and the same results are displayed regardless of the nature of the mobile app . In an embodiment, advertisements selected for mobile apps  utilizing a mobile advertising service are related to the nature of the mobile app . For example, advertisements selected for a mobile app  for a restaurant reservation service could relate to categories of interest to the user that generally relate to food. Such advertisements could relate, for example, to a category \u201crestaurants\u201d.","In the illustrated example, the advertisement displayed in the banner  is shown as a simple name and address listing. Note however, the advertisements could take any format known in the art suitable for displaying advertisements on a mobile device such as, for example, a text abstract for a business, text and graphics describing the business, multimedia files describing the business. In various embodiments, the directory listings could include any other type of information relating to the business such as, for example, sales, deals or promotions offered by the business.

Thus, it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.","Examples of computer-readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non-recordable type media such as volatile and non-volatile memory devices, read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), flash memory devices, floppy and other removable disks, magnetic disk storage media, optical storage media (e.g., Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD ROMS), Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), etc.), among others.","In general, a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides (e.g., stores) information in a form accessible by a machine (e.g., a computer, network device, personal digital assistant, manufacturing tool, any device with a set of one or more processors, etc.).","In various embodiments, hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus, the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.","Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order, operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned, others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover, it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware, firmware, software or any combination thereof.","In the foregoing specification, the disclosure has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The embodiments are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0005","num":"0004"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 5"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
