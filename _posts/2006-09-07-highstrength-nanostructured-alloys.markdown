title: High-strength nanostructured alloys
abstract: Biphasic alloys, formed through a spinodal decomposition process, are disclosed. The alloys have improved strength and hardness, over single phase alloys, due to coherency strain between the phases. They are prepared from readily available transition metals, and they can be used to make large, high-strength parts, for example, of types that cannot be made by extrusion, forging or cold working techniques.

No. 10\/796,675, filed Mar. 9, 2004 now abandoned, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.","The United States Government has rights in this invention under Contract Nos. NIST-60NANB2DD12D and NSF-DMR0314209 between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Dartmouth College.","1. Field of the Invention","This invention generally relates to novel alloys and methods of producing the alloys. More specifically, the alloys are high-strength nanostructured alloys.","2. Description of the Related Art","Basic research in the field of alloy materials seeks to find improved materials, such as those that are lighter, stronger, or less expensive to produce than conventional alloys. In other contexts, improved materials may have increased resistance to weather, chemicals, or friction, in an intended environment of use. Equipment that incorporates these new materials in component parts may have a longer service life, require less maintenance, or achieve an improved performance level. From a cost of manufacture standpoint, it is desirable for these new materials to be made from readily available and highly affordable natural resources.","One technique that may be used to produce an alloy with enhanced strength is spinodal decomposition. Spinodal decomposition processes are described, for example, in Ramanarayan and Abinandan, , Bltn. Matter. Sci. Vol. 26, No. 1, 189-192 (January 2003), and the transition phase kinetics of spinodal decomposition are described in Mainville et al., -, Phys. Review Lett. Vol. 78, No. 14, 2787-2790 (1977). The Toughmet\u2122 Cu\u2014Ni\u2014Sn alloys that are commercially available from Brush Wellman of Lorain, Ohio are one example of spinodal alloys used for structural applications.","Spinodal Fe\u2014Ni\u2014Al (Alnico) systems were studied by S. M. Hao; K. Ishida; T. Nishizawa, \u201cRole of Alloying Elements in Phase Decomposition in Alnico Magnet Alloys\u201d Metall. Trans. A, 16(2), Feb. 1985, 179-185. To a base Fe\u2014Ni\u2014Al system a small amount (less than 5 at. %) of Cu, Ti, Mn, V, Cr, Si, Mo, or Nb was added. The microstructure, miscibility gap characteristics and magnetic properties of the resulting materials were determined. The authors concluded that the elements Mn, Nb, Cr, Mo, Si, and V were \u201cestimated to be of little use in Alnico alloys\u201d (p. 183, col. 2).","U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002\/0124913 discloses another Alnico compound, Fe\u2014Cr\u2014Ni\u2014Al, that resists oxidation and exhibits high strength. The alloy consists essentially of, by mass, 0.003 to 0.08% C, 0.03 to 2.0% Si, not more than 2.0% Mn, from 1.0 to 8.0% Ni, from 10.0 to 19.0% Cr, 1.5 to 8.0% Al, 0.05 to 1.0% Zr and the balance Fe. Under certain conditions, an intermetallic composition, e.g., Ni\u2014Al, precipitates in the ferrite matrix as a non-spinodal second phase.","To date, very few spinodal Alnico systems are known, and the presence of Mn in those that are known is considered detrimental to the properties of the final product.","Alloys of the present disclosure address the problems outlined above and advance the art by providing alloys with exceptional strength or hardness over a wide temperature range.","In one embodiment, an intermetallic composition formed by spinodal decomposition in at least two distinct structural phases has an average composition comprising from 9% to 41% iron, 9% to 41% nickel, 9% to 41% manganese and 9% to 41% aluminum, wherein the composition is described in terms of atomic percentages.","In one embodiment, an intermetallic composition formed by spinodal decomposition in at least two distinct structural phases has an average composition according to the formula:\n\nFeNiMnAlM,\n\nwherein (in atomic percent) a ranges from 9 to 41; b ranges from 9 to 41; c ranges from 9 to 41; d ranges from 9 to 41; e ranges from 0 to 5; and M is selected (i) from the group consisting of V, Cr, Co, Mo, Ru and combinations thereof or (ii) from the group consisting of C, B, Ti and combinations thereof.\n","In one embodiment, a method of producing an intermetallic composition includes: heating a mixture of metals, to create a homogenous solution, according to the formula:\n\nFeNiMnAlM,\n\nwherein (in atomic percent) a ranges from 9 to 41; b ranges from 9 to 41; c ranges from 9 to 41; d ranges from 9 to 41; e ranges from 0 to 5; and M is selected (i) from the group consisting of V, Cr, Co, Mo, Ru and combinations thereof or (ii) from the group consisting of C, B, Ti and combinations thereof; cooling the homogenous solution to obtain a homogeneous solid; rapidly quenching the solid to room temperature; reheating the solid to within a spinodal temperature region; and holding the spinodal temperature for a period of time.\n","The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used frequently herein and are not meant to limit the scope of the present disclosure: The terms \u201calloy\u201d, \u201cintermetallic compound\u201d, and \u201cintermetallic compositions\u201d are interchangeable. They refer to compounds containing at least two elements selected from metals and\/or metalloids. \u201cOrdered\u201d refers to a uniform arrangement of atoms within a chemical structure.","The alloys disclosed herein may be incorporated into machine and industrial parts, and may be used to make large, high-strength parts that cannot be made by extrusion, forging or cold working techniques. Additionally, the alloys may be suitable for applications requiring high-strength, wear resistant parts including but not limited to: engines, bearings, bushings, stators, washers, seals, rotors, fasteners, stamping plates, dies, valves, punches, automobile parts, aircraft parts, and drilling and mining parts.","Materials described herein may demonstrate high impact strength, fatigue resistance, and toughness under harsh conditions. They may also have superior wear and corrosion resistance.","Alloy constituents may include a substantial amount of one or more elements selected from transitional metals and rare earth metals. In particular, the alloy contains iron, nickel, manganese, and aluminum to which may be added vanadium, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, and ruthenium. This concept is represented by a macroscopic average formula:\n\nFeNiMnAlM, \u2003\u2003Formula (1)\n\nwherein M is an alloying addition of any element or combination of elements;\n\n","In one aspect, M may be a metal or combination of metals. For example, M may be vanadium, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, ruthenium and combinations thereof. In another aspect, M may contain carbon, boron and other materials, such as where M is selected from carbon, boron, titanium and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the portion of the alloy that is allocated to M may also range from 0.1 to 4% or in other aspects from 1% to 3%.","A narrower formulation that is within the general scope of formula (1) is:\n\nFeNiMnAl, \u2003\u2003Formula (2)\n\n","Another aspect of the alloy may be a heat treatment process that results in spinodal decomposition leaving at least two intermetallic phases of different structure and stoichiometry. Thus, the macroscopic formula above pertains to the overall composition, but the macroscopic composition has nanostructure or microstructure of localized phase variances in composition and ordering. Generally, growth processes that result in lattice phase separations may derive from two mechanisms\u2014nucleation or spinodal. In nucleation, nuclei form and lattice growth occurs on the individual nuclei. An energy barrier must be met to drive the growth. The lattice phases are well defined, such that a lattice structure arises from a matrix which may be amorphous. Another mechanism, that of spinodal decomposition, is a spontaneous clustering reaction that may occur in a homogeneous supersaturated solution, which may be a solid or liquid solution. The solution is unstable against infinitesimal fluctuations in density or composition, and so thermodynamics favor separation into two phases of differing composition and interconnected morphology. Lattice phase boundaries are diffuse and gradually become sharp. Spinodal decomposition of an alloy is possible when different metal atoms are of similar size; thus avoiding large scale diffusion which results in precipitation. The presence of two phases gives rise to large composition variations which cause coherency strains that strengthen the alloy.","As is known in the art, spinodal decomposition is a continuous diffusion process in which there is no nucleation step. A plurality of chemically different phases result from a migration of atoms, without the formation of precipitates.  is a phase diagram  showing one spinodal decomposition process that varies as a function of temperature T and intermetallic composition X. A homogenous composition or phase \u03b1 exists at temperatures above T. An immiscibility dome  contains a spinodal decomposition region  that is flanked by nucleation zones , . At temperatures below T, phases \u03b1and \u03b1exist, each associated with an adjacent nucleation zone , , and these regions of  below Tare sometimes referred to as the \u201cmiscibility gap\u201d. The spinodal decomposition region  may be regarded as a stable or metastable region that contains both phases \u03b1and \u03b1, and where atom migration is enabled by a miscibility difference between the phases \u03b1and \u03b1. The structure of each phase \u03b1, \u03b1within spinodal decomposition region  is usually continuous throughout the grains and continues up to the grain boundaries. The presence of two phases \u03b1, \u03b1, with corresponding composition variations, increases coherency strain thereby strengthening the material.","The alloys disclosed herein may be used under extreme conditions, for example, elevated temperatures and pressures or highly resistive conditions. Further, the alloys disclosed herein can be used in any known application currently utilizing a high-strength alloy.","In one aspect, alloys disclosed herein may comprise a coating. For example, suitable coatings may be selected from polymeric coatings, silicon-based coatings, metal oxide coatings, gold, platinum, silver, carbon-based coatings, adhesives, and combinations thereof.","The following examples set forth preferred materials and methods for use in making the disclosed alloys. The examples teach by way of illustration, not by limitation, and so should not be interpreted as unduly narrow.","A quaternary alloy of FeNiMnAlcomposition was prepared by well known arc melting and casting techniques. A quantity of material including 24 g Fe, 17 g Ni, 22 g Mn, and 10 g Al was placed in a water-cooled copper mold and heated until molten using the arc melting technique. Ingots were flipped and melted a minimum of three times under argon to ensure mixing. Quenching was done by allowing the alloy to rapidly cool in the copper mold to a temperature of \u02dc30\u00b0 C. in approximately 10 minutes. In some embodiments, a 5% excess of Mn may be added to the starting materials because Mn accounts for the majority of weight loss during casting, which results from brittle sharding and evaporation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":["3","34","14","39","49","2","30","19"]},"The alloy was characterized using analytical techniques that are well known in the art.
