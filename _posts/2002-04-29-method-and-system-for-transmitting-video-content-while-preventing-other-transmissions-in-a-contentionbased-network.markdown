title: Method and system for transmitting video content while preventing other transmissions in a contention-based network
abstract: A plurality of wireless clients that can operate in a shared manner using a contention based protocol are placed into a contention free mode of operation that prevents the wireless clients from initiating a data transfer. Once the wireless clients are prevented from initiating access to the wireless network, a video gateway can transmit video content in a deterministic manner to one or more of the plurality of wireless clients.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to the transmission of video data and more particularly to the transmission of video data over a wireless environment.","As the bandwidth available to wireless devices has increased, it has become possible to deliver digital video of respectable quality to wireless display devices such as portable notebook computers. Accordingly, methods have been developed to deliver video content to a plurality of wireless display devices using a carrier sense multiple access protocol with collision avoidance medium sharing (CSMA\/CA). For example, the video content of a specific video channel can be provided to one or more wireless display devices in a manner that supports real-time, or near real-time, display. However, the ability of a video client to receive data in a manner consistent with real-time operation is indeterminate because it is not possible for a client to access data in a predetermined manner under CSMA\/CA operation, since CSMA\/CA operation requires clients to wait for current transmissions to finish before attempting to gain access to the channel. Once a current transmission is finished a specific client cannot be guaranteed access of the wireless network over a different client.","Given these limitations, as discussed, it is apparent that a device to improve the ability of a system to support real time display of video data over a wireless network would be advantageous.","In one embodiment of the present invention a gateway device notifies a plurality of wireless clients that normally access a wireless network in a shared manner using a carrier sense multiple access protocol with collision avoidance (CSMA\/CA) to operate in a contention free mode of operation that prevents the wireless clients from initiating a data transfer. Once the wireless clients are prevented from initiating access to the wireless network, the gateway can transmit video content in a deterministic manner to one or more of the plurality of wireless clients. Being able to provide video content to wireless clients in a deterministic manner is an advantage over previously known methods that transmit video using CSMA\/CA because a greater level of control over video quality can be achieved at one or more video clients.  illustrate specific embodiment of the present invention in greater detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","111","115","111","115","110","102","102","111","115","102","102"]},"The video gateway  acts as an access point that receives video content and data. The term video content is used herein to include information that is used to provide a video experience to a viewer. For example, the term video content will generally include audio information, image information, and control information. One example of a group of specific protocols that provide video content in a digital manner include MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) protocols, such as MPEG3.","Video content stored in an MPEG3 format, or any other format, can be provided to the video gateway  from a service provider or a local storage device (not illustrated). Non-video data can also be received at the video gateway . Examples of non-video data include files, applications, and graphics, such as would typically be associated with a data processing device such as a personal computer.","The clients - illustrated in  include three video clients -, and data clients -. The video clients - are capable of receiving and decoding video content in a real time manner. Typically, the video clients - will provide the decoded video content to a display device - for viewing, where the display devices - may be integrated components relative to the video clients -, or stand alone components, such as display monitors, with respect to their respective video clients -. In addition to receiving video content, individual video clients may also receive non-video data. For example, a video client can also operate to provide a user interface to the internet, wherein information associated with browsing the world wide web would be received at the video client for display. In addition, programs, files, and other data associated with personal computing devices can also be received.","Clients - represents data clients that are not being utilized, or not capable of being utilized, for the purpose of receiving and decoding video. For example, a personal computer being used to download information from the world wide web, or to transfer data files, would be considered a data client as opposed to a video client. Whether a specific client is a data client or a video client can vary depending upon the client's current use. For example, a client can be considered either a video client or a data client depending upon its current configuration and use.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","100","100","111","115","112","110","111","115"]},"At step , video content is transmitted to at least one of the plurality of clients. In one embodiment, the video content transmitted is intended for a specific client (e.g. client ). In an alternate embodiment a broadcast or multicast transmission can be used to send video content to multiple clients simultaneously.","At step , each of the video clients is returned to a contention mode of operation. With respect to system  operating according to the 802.11 standard, the system  can alternate between a contention free mode of operation and a contention mode of operation based on a contention-free repetition rate and a contention free period that are specified in the CF Parameter Set specified in the standard. In addition, the gateway can end a contention free period prior to its scheduled termination. Note that the gateway  can also transmit data, including video content, to the clients - during the contention mode of operation, however, not in a deterministic manner.","In an alternate embodiment of the method of , a contention free mode of operation can include placing the system  into a mixed mode of operation between contention free operation and contention operation. For example, under the 802.11 standard, a contention free mode of operation can be a mode of operation whereby the network operates in a contention free mode a predetermined amount of time (e.g. 50%), while a contention mode of operation is considered to be a mode of operation whereby there is no scheduled contention free mode. Such a mixed mode of operation continues to be advantageous over the prior art because it allows for deterministic minimum level of operation with respect to the contention free bandwidth allocated to the video server for providing video content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":"21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["22","24","10","12","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"],"b":["21","30","111","115","114","115"]},"Whether a specific client is to be included as receiving data can be based upon a present knowledge of data that is scheduled to be transferred to the specific client. For example, if the gateway  is currently in the process of providing a stream of video content to video client , it would be included as a wireless client to receive video. In another implementation, a specific wireless client can be included as a client to receive data based on past events or statistics. For example, a specific client can be included in the list of clients to receive data if it is known that the specific client receives data at a specific interval that is to occur during the next contention free interval.","Steps - of the method of  represent specific methods that can be used to determine the duration of the contention free mode of operation. The gateway  can use any one or combination of the steps - to determine a duration of the contention free mode.","At step , the duration of the contention free mode is based on the number of wireless clients that are to receive data. For example, a predetermined amount of time, or bandwidth, such as may be determined by a user or the gateway , can be allocated for each client that is determined to receive data. It will be appreciated that the amount of time or bandwidth to be allocated to a contention free mode of operation can be readily converted to, or determined from, an amount of data to be transmitted for a given a data rate.","At step  the duration of the contention free mode is based upon the total bandwidth requirements of the clients to receive data during the contention free mode of operation. For example, if wireless clients  and  are the only two clients to receive data during the contention free period, and wireless client  is to receive data at a rate of 1.5 Mb\/s and the wireless client  is to receive data at a rate of 0.5 Mb\/s, the total bandwidth of data that is to be transferred by the gateway  is 2 Mb\/s. This data rate can be readily converted to a duration by knowing the current data rate capability of the wireless network of system . Specifically, the duration of the contention free period can be calculated by the following formula: (Total contention free desired data rate)\/(total system data rate)*(period). Where the period is the interval during which a contention period and a contention free period will coexist.","In an embodiment where the total system data rate is less than the total contention free desired data rate, resulting a contention free mode of operation having a duration less than a desired duration, the gateway  will have to make a determination whether to not support certain clients, or to reduce bandwidth to one or more of the clients. In an embodiment where the total system data rate is greater than the total contention free desired data rate, the duration of the contention free mode of operation can be set greater than, or equal to, the desired rate. In an embodiment where the 802.11 protocol is being supported, the period can be set using the CFPRate field, and the duration of the contention free period can be set using the CFPMaxDuration field.","In one embodiment using the 802.11 protocol, the CFPMaxDuration field is set to a value greater than the calculated desired contention free interval and terminated early by the gateway. This technique compensates for the fact that under 802.11 it is possible for a first portion of a desired contention free period to not occur because of a pending completion of a transfer that was begun during a contention based mode of operation. Therefore, to better assure deterministic bandwidth capability, the gateway can allocate more of the total wireless bandwidth than is actual needed to a contention free mode of operation, and terminate the contention free mode once the desired amount of bandwidth has been used. This provides an advantage over prior known methods of providing video content over wireless networks because a deterministic amount of bandwidth over a period of time can be assured.","At step , the duration of the contention free mode is fixed, based upon a predefined value, such as a system\/user determined value. In this case, the amount of bandwidth to be allocated to each client can be allocated based upon the fixed bandwidth.","It will be appreciated that various combinations of steps - can be used for determining the duration of the contention free mode. For example, the duration can be a function of the bandwidth of each client up to a maximum bandwidth. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that the available data bandwidth of the wireless network can change over time. For example, with various 802.11 based standard, such as 802.11a and 802.11b, the bandwidth can vary between 54 Mb\/s to 1 Mb\/s depending upon the location of the individual clients.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["41","21","42","22","43"]},"At step , a second duration of a second contention free mode is determined by the gateway , where the second contention free mode has a different contention free duration. In operation, the gateway will periodically determine whether the data requirements of wireless clients -, have changed and modify the duration of the contention free period accordingly. For example, if more clients now are needing a greater data bandwidth, the bandwidth of the contention free period can be increased. Likewise the bandwidth can be decreased when necessary.","At step , the clients are placed in a the second contention free mode of operation for the second duration. As previously discussed, the actual duration specified to the client can be greater than the second duration, thereby allowing the gateway terminate the contention free mode early. In addition to allowing the gateway  to provide and terminate a longer duration time to meet the desired duration time, the gateway can also change the duration of the duration contention free period by merely ending the contention free period at a different time. In this embodiment of the invention, the gateway  can configure the wireless clients to be in contention free mode for a maximum amount of time, for example, 90% of the time, and obtain varying contention free duration periods by internally monitoring the elapsed time from the start of each contention free period and issuing a CFEnd indicator (802.11) to terminate the contention free period once the desired duration is realized.","At step , video content is transferred to at least one of the plurality of clients while in the second mode of contention free operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["51","10","52","12","53","111","113"]},"In accordance with the method of , a specific video client, such as video client , can receive data during both the contention free period and the contention period. In an alternate embodiment, one client can receive video content only during the contention mode of operation, while other clients can receive video content only during contention free modes of operation, or during either contention or contention free modes of operation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1"],"b":["61","10","62","12","63","111","115","111","115","110","110","110"]},"In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the gateway  can multicast, or broadcast data to multiple clients receiving the same data. This mode of operation is especially useful in video applications where more than one display device is to display to the same channel.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 1"],"b":["71","111","115"]},"At step , a duration of the contention free mode is determined. In addition to basing the duration of the contention free mode on the factors previous discussed, the duration of the contention free mode can be based on the number of clients that are pollable. By basing the duration on whether a client is pollable, accommodations can be made by the gateway to provide deterministic bandwidth support for the reception of data from the gateway .","At step , a subset of the clients - are placed in a contention free mode of operation. For example the video clients  and  can be placed in a contention free mode of operation.","At step , client  is be polled to request video control information during the contention free mode of operation. For example, the client  can be polled to provide specific operation or state information, such as current or changed video settings. A specific request to a client during contention free mode can be accomplished by appending a POLL message that is interpreted by the client to determine what information, if any, to provide to the polling device. In an alternate embodiment, one of the 802.11 reserved message types could be used to create a system specific POLL message. In another embodiment, each pollable client is polled periodically during the contention free mode of operation to determine any operating changes. Otherwise, it would be possible for a change in the clients operation to be missed or delayed during a the contention mode of operation.","At step , video content is provided to client  based on the video control information. Note that the video content of step  does not necessarily occur during the same contention free period that the video control information is received. For example, if the video client  indicates during step  that the channel to be displayed has changed, the gateway may not be able to obtain the new channel information fast enough to provide it during the current contention free period. However, in response to a request from a client for a different channel to be displayed the gateway  can modify, or cancel, the content scheduled to be transmitted during the current and or some subsequent contention free periods.","Step  indicates that a client that is not polled can also receive video content during the contention free mode of operation.","In the preceding detailed description of the figures, reference has been made to the accompanying drawings which form a part thereof, and to which show by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced.
