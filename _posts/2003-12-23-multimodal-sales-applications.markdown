title: Multi-modal sales applications
abstract: A sales system is described that enables fast, efficient shopping by customers, and thereby increases sales and encourages customer loyalty, while simultaneously improving store management. An electronic device, which may be mobile or stationary, and which may belong or be assigned to (or accessed by) each customer, is used to access shopping information that might not otherwise be available to the customer during shopping. For example, a personal digital assistant or information kiosk may be used to provide specific product information and complete a sale thereof, or to provide suggested purchase lists and best routes through the store during shopping. The sales system is multi-modal, so that a plurality of input modalities (such as voice or auto-id techniques) are simultaneously available to the customer. Additionally, because it is multi-modal, the system can communicate with other store items, such as shelves or shopping carts, to gain (and integrate) information about customers and the products the customers are purchasing.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Introduction to a Particular Implementation"],"p":["This application claims priority from (i) U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/454,762, filed Mar. 14, 2003, titled \u201cVoice Recognition for Warehouse Management Applications,\u201d (ii) U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/470,898, filed May 16, 2003, titled \u201cSales and Warehouse Applications,\u201d and (iii) U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/474,217, filed May, 30, 2003, titled \u201cSales and Warehouse Applications.\u201d","Particular implementations relate generally to multiple modes of communication, and more particularly to such multiple modes of communication as applied to warehouse and retail environments.","A user may interface with a machine in many different modes, such as, for example, a mechanical mode, an aural mode, and a visual mode. A mechanical mode may include, for example, using a keyboard for input. An aural mode may include, for example, using voice input or output. A visual mode may include, for example, using a display output. This interfacing may consequently be used to use and access information in various commercial and non-commercial applications.","In a warehouse environment, a worker often uses his hands to perform tasks. Therefore, it may be difficult for the worker to access an electronic device while working. Moreover, particularly in large or complex storage systems, the worker may perform inefficiently. For example, the worker may select an inefficient route through the warehouse when stocking the warehouse. Additionally, human error committed by the worker may result in inaccurate inventory data. Other factors exist in warehouse management that may result in reduced profitability in the management of the warehouse.","In a retail sales environment, customers who have difficulties during shopping may purchase fewer items and a store may experience reduced customer loyalty. For example, if a customer would like to buy an item but cannot find the item on the shelves, or cannot find an employee who has access to information about the item, the customer may be less likely to purchase the item. Similarly, if the customer experiences a long wait at a check-out line, or spends excessive time searching for a particular product(s) to buy, the customer may be less likely to return to the store. Additionally, retail stores often receive large quantities of goods, some of which may be stored until ready for sale, others of which may be directly placed on shelves for sale.","In one aspect, a database is operable to store retail data, wherein the retail data is accessible in a plurality of formats, each of the formats being compatible with one of a plurality of input modalities. Also, a server is operable to output a first page for display on an electronic device, the first page including a first field for receiving a customer request in a selected input modality from among the plurality of input modalities, wherein the server is operable to determine sales information in response to the customer request and based on the retail data. Additionally, a format determination system is operable to produce the sales information in each of the plurality of formats. The server is further operable to output a second page for display on the electronic device, the second page associated with the sales information in the plurality of formats and including a second field for responding to the sales information in any one of the input modalities.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, the retail data may include product information related to quantity, location, or description information associated with a product for sale. The customer request may include a request for the product information, and the sales information may include the product information.","The sales information also may include directions to a route for accessing products for sale. The retail data may include customer information related to a purchase history associated with an identified customer, and the sales information may include suggested purchases generated by the server based on the purchase history. The sales information may include pricing information, and the second field is operable to receive financial information for completing a purchase of the product for sale.","The selected input modality may be associated with an auto-identification signal. A mobile container equipped with a reader for reading the auto-identification signal and a transmitter for transmitting the auto-identification signal to the server may be additionally included. The server may be further operable to track a location of the mobile container, relative to other mobile containers, based on the auto-identification signal.","The selected input modality may be associated with voice input, and the first and second pages are associated with Voice Extensible Markup Language (VXML). The selected input modality may be associated with an auto-identification signal using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The selected input modality may include text-entry, and the first and second pages may be associated with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).","The electronic device may include a mobile device, a stationary device that is co-located with one of a plurality of products for sale, or an information kiosk.","In another aspect, a first page for display on an electronic device is outputted, where the first page includes a first field for receiving a first customer request. The first customer request in a selected input modality chosen from among a plurality of input modalities available for data entry into the first field is received. Sales information responsive to the customer request is determined. The sales information is associated with each of the plurality of input modalities. A second page for display on the electronic device is outputted, where the second page displays the sales information and includes a second field for receiving a second customer request in any one of the plurality of input modalities.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, receiving the first customer request may include receiving a request for product information associated with a product for sale, including price, location, or description information. Additionally, receiving the second customer request may include receiving a purchase request associated with financial transaction information, and completing a sale of the product, based on the financial transaction information.","An auto-identification signal from a mobile container may be received, where the auto-identification signal may identify a product for sale. The mobile container may be equipped with a reader for reading the auto-identification signal and a transmitter for transmitting the auto-identification signal. The electronic device may include a mobile device, a stationary device that is co-located with one of a plurality of products for sale, or an information kiosk.","Receiving the first customer request may include receiving a voice input, and wherein the first page is associated with Voice Extensible Markup Language (VXML). Receiving the first customer request may include receiving a text input, and wherein the first page is associated with Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).","Associating the sales information with each of the plurality of input modalities may include expressing the sales information in each of a plurality of formats, wherein each of the plurality of formats is associated with one of the plurality of input modalities.","In another aspect, providing product data includes receiving at an electronic device an identifying input in a first modality, the identifying input identifying a product. Providing product data also includes requesting automatically, after receiving the identifying input, product information, and providing, from the electronic device, the product information to a user. Providing product data also includes receiving at the electronic device additional input in a second modality, the additional input requesting additional product information, requesting automatically, after receiving the additional input, the additional product information, and providing, from the electronic device, the additional product information to the user.","Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example, receiving the identifying input in the first modality may include scanning a bar code associated with the product. Providing the product information to the user may include displaying the product information on a local display. Providing product data may further include providing the product data from a mobile device. Additionally, payment information for the user may be received and the product may be sold to the user.","The product information may include one or more of descriptive information, availability information, price information, warranty information, review information, promotional information, and competitor information.","Receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities may include receiving a search string. Receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities may further include accessing at least a first part of the search string, searching a first search space for a match for the first part of the search string, limiting a second search space based on a result of searching the first search space, accessing at least a second part of the search string, and searching the limited second search space for a match for the second part of the search string.","At least one of the first and second modalities may include a voice modality. Additionally, a voice input received in the voice modality may be accessed, the voice input including at least a first part and a second part, voice recognition may be performed on the first part of the voice input. Also, voice recognition may be performed on a combination of the first part and the second part using a search space, and the search space may be limited based on a result from performing voice recognition on the first part of the voice input, wherein limiting the search space allows enhanced voice recognition of the combination compared to performing voice recognition on the unlimited search space.","Receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities may include providing a first set of options to the user, the first set of options relating to a first parameter of a search string, and being provided to the user in a page, and accepting a first input from the user, the first input being selected from the first set of options. Receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities also may include limiting a second set of options based on the accepted first input, the second set of options relating to a second parameter of the search string, and providing the second set of options to the user in the page, such that the user is presented with a single page that provides the first set of options and the second set of options.","Receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities may include activating a first grammar from among a plurality of independent grammars, the first grammar being identified with a first input category. Additionally, receiving input in at least one of the first and second modalities may include deactivating at least a second grammar from among the plurality of independent grammars, inputting spoken data related to the first input category, and matching the spoken data to stored data within the first grammar.","The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features of particular implementations will be apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims.","The system  also includes a device  that includes a first gateway , a first interface , and a second interface . The first gateway  and the first interface  communicate over a connection . The system  also includes a second gateway  that communicates with the second interface  over a connection . Either or both of the first and second gateways  and  communicate with either the server system  and\/or the synchronization controller  over the connection . The first and second gateways  and  also communicate with the publish\/subscribe system  over connections  and , respectively.","An \u201cinterface\u201d refers to a component that either accepts input from a user or provides output to a user. Examples include a display, a printer, a speaker, a microphone, a touch screen, a mouse, a roller ball, a joystick, a keyboard, a temperature sensor, a light sensor, a light, a heater, an air quality sensor such as a smoke detector, and a pressure sensor. A component may be, for example, hardware, software, or a combination of the two.","A \u201cgateway\u201d refers to a component that translates between user input\/output and some other data format. For example, a browser is a gateway that translates the user's clicks and typing into hypertext transfer protocol (\u201cHTTP\u201d) messages, and translates received HTML messages into a format that the user can understand.","The system  optionally includes a third gateway  and a third interface . The third gateway optionally communicates directly with the unit  over the connection . The third gateway  represents the multiplicity of different modes that may be used in different implementations, and the fact that the gateways and interfaces for these modes may be remote from each other and from the other gateways and interfaces. Examples of various modes of input or output include manual, visual (for example, display or print), aural (for example, voice or alarms), haptic, pressure, temperature, and smell. Manual modes may include, for example, keyboard, stylus, keypad, button, mouse, touch (for example, touch screen), and other hand inputs.","A modality gateway or a modality interface refers to a gateway (or interface) that is particularly adapted for a specific mode, or modes, of input and\/or output. For example, a browser is a modality gateway in which the modality includes predominantly manual modes of input (keyboard, mouse, stylus), visual modes of output (display), and possibly aural modes of output (speaker). Thus, multiple modes may be represented in a given modality gateway. Because a system may include several different modality gateways and interfaces, such gateways and interfaces are referred to as, for example, a first-modality gateway, a first-modality interface, a second-modality gateway, and a second-modality interface.","More broadly, a first-modality entity refers to a component that is particularly adapted for a specific mode, or modes, of input and\/or output. A first-modality entity may include, for example, a first-modality gateway or a first-modality interface.","A first-modality data item refers to a data item that is used by a first-modality entity. The data item need not be provided in one of the modes supported by the first-modality entity, but rather, is used by the first-modality entity to interface with the user in one of the supported modes. For example, if a voice gateway is a first-modality gateway, then a first-modality data item may be, for example, a VXML page. The VXML page is not itself voice data, but can be used to provide a voice interface to a user.","Referring to , a system  is one example of an implementation of the system . The control unit  is implemented with a web server  that includes a built-in synchronization controller. The device  is implemented by a device  that may be, for example, a computer or a mobile device. The first gateway  and the first interface  are implemented by a browser  and a browser interface , respectively, of the device . The second gateway  and the second interface  are implemented by a voice gateway  and a voice interface , respectively. A publish\/subscribe system  is analogous to the publish\/subscribe system . Connections , , , , and  are analogous to the connections , , , , and .","The voice interface  may include, for example, a microphone and a speaker. The voice interface  may be used to send voice commands to, and receive voice prompts from, the voice gateway  over the connection . The commands and prompts may be transmitted over the connection  using, for example, voice telephony services over an Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) connection (referred to as voice over IP, or \u201cVoIP\u201d). The voice gateway  may perform the voice recognition function for incoming voice data. The voice gateway  also may receive from the web server  VXML pages that include dialogue entries for interacting with the user using voice. The voice gateway  may correlate recognized words received from the user with the dialogue entries to determine how to respond to the user's input. Possible responses may include prompting the user for additional input or executing a command based on the user's input.","The browser  operates in an analogous manner to the voice gateway . However, the browser  uses HTML pages rather than VXML pages. Also, the browser  and the user often communicate using manual and visual modes such as, for example, a keyboard, a mouse and a display, rather than using voice. Although the browser  may be capable of using an aural mode, that mode is generally restricted to output, such as, for example, providing music over a speaker. Although the system  shows an implementation tailored to the modes of manual and voice input, and display and voice output, alternative and additional modes may be supported.","The publish\/subscribe system  may function, for example, as a router for subscribed entities. For example, if the gateways  and  are subscribed, then the publish\/subscribe system  may route messages from the web server  to the gateways  and .","The operation of the system  is explained with reference to , which depict examples of processes that may be performed using the system . Four such processes are described, all dealing with synchronizing two gateways after a user has navigated to a new page using one of the two gateways. The four processes are server push, browser pull, voice-interrupt listener, and no-input tag.","Referring to , a process , referred to as server push, for use with the system  includes having the browser  subscribe to the publish\/subscribe system  (). Subscription may be facilitated by having the web server  insert a function call into a HTML page. When the browser  receives and loads the page, the function call is executed and posts a subscription to the publish\/subscribe system . The subscription includes a call-back pointer or reference that is inserted into the subscription so that, upon receiving a published message, the publish\/subscribe system  can provide the message to the browser . After subscribing, the browser  then listens to the publish\/subscribe system  for any messages. In one implementation, the browser  uses multiple frames including a content frame, a receive frame, and a send frame. The send frame is used to subscribe; the receive frame is used to listen; and the content frame is the only frame that displays content. Subscription () may be delayed in the process , but occurs before the browser  receives a message (see ).","The process  includes having the voice gateway  request a VXML page (), and having the web server  send the VXML page to the voice gateway  (). Note that the browser  and the voice gateway  are the gateways to be synchronized in the implementation of the process  being described. The operations  and  may be initiated, for example, in response to a user's provision of a voice command to the voice gateway  to tell the voice gateway  to navigate to a new web page. The web server  may delay sending the VXML page until later in the process . Such a delay might be useful to better time the arrival of the requested VXML page at the voice gateway  with the arrival of the corresponding HTML page at the browser .","A page may be, for example, a content page or a server page. A content page includes a web page, which is what a user commonly sees or hears when browsing the web. Web pages include, for example, HTML and VXML pages. A server page includes a programming page such as, for example, a Java Server Page (\u201cJSP\u201d). A server page also may include content.","The process  includes having the web server  send a message to the publish\/subscribe system  to indicate the HTML page that corresponds to the VXML page sent to the voice gateway  (). The web server  may recognize, or perhaps assume, that the voice gateway  and the browser  are out of synchronization, or that the two gateways  and  will become out of synchronization due to the VXML page being sent to the voice gateway . Accordingly, the web server  sends the message to the publish\/subscribe system , intended for the browser , to bring the two gateways  and  into synchronization. The web server  may send the message by using, for example, a HTTP post message with an embedded JavaScript command that indicates the corresponding HTML page. The web server  need not designate the particular browser  for which the message is intended (by, for example, specifying an IP address and a port number). Rather, the web server  sends a message configured for a specific \u201ctopic\u201d (usually a string parameter). All subscribers to that topic receive the message when the message is published by the web server  using the publish\/subscribe system .","The web server  may determine the corresponding HTML page in a variety of ways. For example, if the VXML page request was the voice equivalent of a click on a link, then the VXML data may contain the uniform resource locator (\u201cURL\u201d) for the corresponding HTML page. Alternatively, for example, the web server  may access a database containing URLs of corresponding VXML and HTML pages, or perform a URL translation if the corresponding pages are known to have analogous URLs.","\u201cSynchronizing,\u201d as used in this disclosure, refers to bringing two entities into synchronization or maintaining synchronization between two entities. Two gateways are said to be synchronized, for the purposes of this disclosure, when, at a given point in time, a user can use either of the two gateways to interface with the same specific information, the interfacing including either input or output.","Two items \u201ccorrespond,\u201d as used in this disclosure, if they both can be used by a different modality gateway to allow a user to interface with the same specific information. For example, an HTML page corresponds to a VXML page if the HTML page and the VXML page allow the user to interface with the same information. An item may correspond to itself if two gateways can use the item to allow a user to interface with information in the item using different modalities.","The process  includes having the publish\/subscribe system  receive the message from the web server  and send the message to the browser  (). The publish\/subscribe system  may use another HTTP post message to send the message to all subscribers of the specified topic. In such an implementation, the publish\/subscribe system  may use a call-back pointer or reference that may have been inserted into the subscription from the browser .","The process  includes having the browser  receive the message (). The browser  is assumed to be in a streaming HTTP mode, meaning that the HTTP connection is kept open between the browser  and the publish\/subscribe system . Because the browser  is subscribed, a HTTP connection is also kept open between the publish\/subscribe system  and the web server . The web server  repeatedly instructs the browser , through the publish\/subscribe system , to \u201ckeep alive\u201d and to continue to display the current HTML page. These \u201ckeep alive\u201d communications are received by the receive frame of the browser  in an interrupt fashion. When the web server message arrives and indicates the corresponding HTML page, the browser  receives the message in the browser receive frame and executes the embedded JavaScript command. Executing the command updates the content frame of the browser  by redirecting the content frame to another HTML page.","Referring to , a process  for use with the system , which may be referred to as browser pull, includes having the voice gateway  request a VXML page (), and having the web server  send the requested VXML page to the voice gateway  (). The web server  may delay sending the VXML page until later in the process  in order, for example, to better time the arrival of the requested VXML page at the voice gateway  with the arrival of the corresponding HTML page at the browser .","The process  includes having the web server  note that the state of the voice gateway  has changed and determine the corresponding page that the browser  needs in order to remain synchronized (). The web server  thus tracks the state of the gateways  and .","The process  includes having the browser  send a request to the web server  for any updates (). The requests are refresh requests or requests for updates, and the browser  sends the requests on a recurring basis from a send frame using a HTTP get message.","The process  includes having the web server  send a response to update the browser  (). Generally, the web server  responds to the refresh requests by sending a reply message to the browser receive frame to indicate \u201cno change.\u201d However, when the voice gateway  has requested a new VXML page, the web server  embeds a JavaScript command in the refresh reply to the browser  that, upon execution by the browser , results in the browser  coming to a synchronized state. The JavaScript command, for example, instructs the browser  to load a new HTML page.","The process  includes having the browser  receive the response and execute the embedded command (). Upon executing the embedded command, the browser  content frame is updated with the corresponding HTML page. The command provides the URL of the corresponding page. In another implementation, the web server  sends a standard response to indicate \u201cno changes\u201d and to instruct the browser  to reload the current HTML page from the web server . However, the web server  also embeds a command in the current HTML page on the web server , and the command indicates the corresponding HTML page. Thus, when the current HTML page is requested, received, and loaded, the browser  will execute the embedded command and update the HTML page.","Referring to , a process  for use with the system , which may be referred to as voice-interrupt listener, includes having the voice gateway  subscribe to the publish\/subscribe system  (). A function call may be embedded in a VXML page received from the web server , and the function call may be executed by the voice gateway  to subscribe to the publish\/subscribe system . The voice gateway  can subscribe at various points in time, such as, for example, when the voice gateway  is launched or upon receipt of a VXML page. In contrast to a browser, the voice gateway does not use frames. Subscription () may be delayed in the process , but occurs before the voice gateway  receives a message (see ).","The process  includes having the browser  request from the web server  a HTML page () and having the web server  send to the browser  the requested HTML page (). This may be initiated, for example, by a user selecting a new URL from a \u201cfavorites\u201d pull-down menu on the browser . The web server  may delay sending the requested HTML page () until later in the process  in order, for example, to better time the arrival of the requested HTML page at the browser  with the arrival of the corresponding VXML page at the voice gateway .","The process  includes having the web server  send a message to the publish\/subscribe system  to indicate a corresponding VXML page (). The web server  sends a HTTP post message to the publish\/subscribe system , and this message includes a topic to which the voice gateway  is subscribed. The web server  also embeds parameters, as opposed to embedding a JavaScript command, into the message. The embedded parameters indicate the corresponding VXML page.","The process  includes having the publish\/subscribe system  send the message to the voice gateway  (). The publish\/subscribe system  may simply reroute the message to the subscribed voice gateway  using another HTTP post message.","The process  also includes having the voice gateway  receive the message (). The voice gateway  is assumed to be in a streaming HTTP mode, listening for messages and receiving recurring \u201ckeep alive\u201d messages from the publish\/subscribe system . When the voice gateway  receives the new message from the web server , the voice gateway  analyzes the embedded parameters and executes a command based on the parameters. The command may be, for example, a request for the corresponding VXML page from the web server .","Referring to , a process  for use with the system , which may be referred to as no-input tag, includes having the web server  send to the voice gateway  a VXML page with a no-input tag embedded (). Every VXML page may have a no-input markup tag (<no input>) that specifies code on the voice gateway  to run if the voice gateway  does not receive any user input for a specified amount of time. The URL of a JSP (Java Server Page) is embedded in the code, and the code tells the voice gateway  to issue a HTTP get command to retrieve the JSP. The same no-input tag is embedded in every VXML page sent to the voice gateway  and, accordingly, the no-input tag specifies the same JSP each time.","The process  includes having the browser  request a HTML page (), having the web server  send the requested HTML page to the browser  (), and having the web server  note the state change and determine a corresponding VXML page (). The web server  updates the contents of the JSP, or the contents of a page pointed to by the JSP, with information about the corresponding VXML page. Such information may include, for example, a URL of the corresponding VXML page. The web server  may delay sending the requested HTML page () until later in the process  in order, for example, to better time the arrival of the requested HTML page at the browser  with the arrival of the corresponding VXML page at the voice gateway .","The process  includes having the voice gateway  wait the specified amount of time and send a request for an update (). After the specified amount of time, as determined by the code on the voice gateway , has elapsed, the voice gateway  issues a HTTP get command for the JSP. When no user input is received for the specified amount of time, the user may have entered input using a non-voice mode and, as a result, the voice gateway  may need to be synchronized.","The process  includes having the web server  receive the update request and send the corresponding VXML page to the voice gateway  (). The JSP contains an identifier of the corresponding VXML page, with the identifier being, for example, a URL or another type of pointer. The web server  issues a HTTP post message to the voice gateway  with the VXML page corresponding to the current HTML page.","The process  includes having the voice gateway  receive the corresponding VXML page (). When the voice gateway  receives and loads the corresponding VXML page, and the browser  receives and loads the HTML page (see ), the two gateways  and  are synchronized. It is possible, however, that the two gateways  and  were never unsynchronized because the user did not enter a browser input, in which case the voice gateway  simply reloads the current VXML page after no voice input was received during the specified amount of waiting time.","The process  has an inherent delay because the process waits for the voice gateway  to ask for an update. It is possible, therefore, that the voice gateway  will be out of synchronization for a period of time on the order of the predetermined delay. A voice input received while the voice gateway  is out of synchronization can be handled in several ways. Initially, if the context of the input indicates that the gateways  and  are out of synchronization, then the voice input may be ignored by the voice gateway . For example, if a user clicks on a link and then speaks a command for a dialogue that would correspond to the new page, the voice gateway  will not have the correct dialogue. Assuming a conflict, however, the web server  may determine that the gateways  and  are not in synchronization and may award priority to either gateway. Priority may be awarded, for example, on a first-input basis or priority may be given to one gateway as a default.","Fused Implementations","Referring to , a system  includes a web server  communicating with a synchronization controller  on a device . The device  also includes a browser  in communication with the browser interface , and a voice mode system  in communication with the voice interface .","The web server  may be, for example, a standard web server providing HTML and VXML pages over a HTTP connection. The device  may be, for example, a computer, a portable personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d), or other electronic device for communicating with the Internet. In one implementation, the device  is a portable device that allows a user to use either browser or voice input and output to communicate with the Internet. In such an implementation, the web server  does not need to be redesigned because all of the synchronization and communication is handled by the synchronization controller .","The voice mode system  stores VXML pages that are of interest to a user and allows a user to interface with these VXML pages using voice input and output. The VXML pages can be updated or changed as desired and in a variety of ways, such as, for example, by downloading the VXML pages from the WWW during off-peak hours. The voice mode system  is a voice gateway, but is referred to as a voice mode system to note that it is a modified voice gateway. The voice mode system  performs voice recognition of user voice input and renders output in a simulated voice using the voice interface .","The synchronization controller  also performs synchronization between the browser and voice modes. Referring to , two processes are described for synchronizing the browser  and the voice mode system , or alternatively, the browser interface  and the voice interface .","Referring to , a process  includes having the synchronization controller  receive a browser request for a new HTML page (). The browser  may be designed to send requests to the synchronization controller , or the browser  may send the requests to the web server  and the synchronization controller  may intercept the browser requests.","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  determine a VXML page that corresponds to the requested HTML page (). In particular implementations, when the user requests a new HTML page by clicking on a link with the browser , the HTML data also includes the URL for the corresponding VXML page. Further, the browser  sends both the URL for the requested HTML page and the URL for the corresponding VXML page to the synchronization controller . The synchronization controller  determines the corresponding VXML page simply by receiving from the browser  the URL for the corresponding VXML page. The synchronization controller  also may determine the corresponding page by, for example, performing a table look-up, accessing a database, applying a translation between HTML URLs and VXML URLs, or requesting information from the web server .","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  pass the identifier of the corresponding VXML page to the voice mode system  (). The identifier may be, for example, a URL. In particular implementations, the voice mode system  may intercept browser requests for new HTML pages, or the browser  may send the requests to the voice mode system . In both cases, the voice mode system  may determine the corresponding VXML page instead of having the synchronization controller  determine the corresponding page () and send an identifier ().","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  pass the browser's HTML page request on to the server  (). The synchronization controller  may, for example, use a HTTP request. In implementations in which the synchronization controller  intercepts the browser's request, passing of the request () is performed implicitly. The synchronization controller  may delay sending the browser request to the server () until later in the process  in order, for example, to better time the arrival of the requested HTML page at the browser  with the access of the corresponding VXML page at the voice mode system  (see ).","The process  includes having the browser receive the requested HTML page () and having the voice mode system  access the corresponding VXML page (). Once these two pages are loaded and available for facilitating interaction with a user, the two modes will be synchronized.","Referring to , a process  includes having the voice mode system  receive a user request for a new VXML page () and access the requested VXML page (). The voice mode system  accesses the VXML page from, for example, stored VXML pages. Accessing the requested VXML page () may be delayed to coincide with the browser's receipt of the corresponding HTML page in operation .","The process  includes having the voice mode system  pass the request for the VXML page on to the synchronization controller  (), and having the synchronization controller  determine the corresponding HTML page (). In particular implementations, the voice mode system  may determine the corresponding HTML page, or may pass the request for the VXML page directly to the browser  with the browser  determining the corresponding HTML page.","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  request the corresponding HTML page from the web server  () and having the browser receive the corresponding HTML page (). The synchronization controller  may use, for example, a HTTP get command.","Proxy Implementations","Referring to , a system  includes having a web server  communicate with both a synchronization controller  and a voice gateway . The synchronization controller  further communicates with both the voice gateway  and several components on a device . The device  includes the browser interface , a browser , and the voice interface . The browser  communicates with the browser interface  and the synchronization controller . The voice interface  communicates with the synchronization controller .","The web server  is capable of delivering HTML and VXML pages. The device  may be, for example, a computer or a portable PDA that is equipped for two modes of interfacing to the WWW. The system  allows the two modes to be synchronized, and the system  does not require the web server  to be enhanced or redesigned because the synchronization controller  is independent and separate from the web server .","Referring to , two processes are described for synchronizing the browser  and the voice gateway , or alternatively, the browser interface  and the voice interface . Both processes assume that the user input is a request for a new page, although other inputs may be used.","Referring to , a process  includes having the synchronization controller  receive a browser request for a new HTML page (). The process  also includes having the synchronization controller  pass the HTML request on to the web server  () and determine the corresponding VXML page (). These three operations - are substantially similar to the operations , , and , respectively, except for the location of the synchronization controller (compare  with ). The synchronization controller  may delay sending the browser request to the web server  () until later in the process  in order, for example, to better time the arrival of the requested HTML page at the browser  with the arrival of the corresponding VXML page at the synchronization controller  (see ).","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  request the corresponding VXML page through the voice gateway  (). The synchronization controller  may request the page in various ways. For example, the synchronization controller  may send a simulated voice request to the voice gateway , or may send a command to the voice gateway .","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  receive the corresponding VXML page (). The voice gateway  receives the requested VXML page and sends the VXML page to the synchronization controller . In another implementation, the synchronization controller  does not receive the VXML page, and the voice gateway  does the voice recognition and interfacing with the user with the synchronization controller  acting as a conduit.","Referring to , a process  includes having the synchronization controller  receive a voice input from the voice interface  requesting a new VXML page (). The process  includes having the synchronization controller (i) parse the voice input and pass the request for a new VXML page along to the voice gateway  (), and (ii) determine the corresponding HTML page (). In this implementation, the synchronization controller  has access to and stores the current VXML page, which allows the synchronization controller  to parse the voice input. As explained above, having the current VXML page also may allow the synchronization controller  to determine the corresponding HTML page for \u201cvoice click\u201d events. If the user's input is not the voice equivalent of clicking on a link, but is, for example, a spoken URL, then by having the capability to do the voice recognition, the synchronization controller may be able to parse the URL and request that the server provide the URL for the corresponding HTML page.","The process  includes having the synchronization controller  request the corresponding HTML page from the server (), and having the browser receive the requested HTML page (). In another implementation, the synchronization controller  does not determine the corresponding page, but requests that the web server  determine the corresponding page and send the corresponding page.","In yet another implementation, the synchronization controller  does not parse the voice input, but merely passes the VoIP request along to the voice gateway . If the voice input is a request for a VXML page, the voice gateway  determines the corresponding HTML page and provides the synchronization controller  with a URL for the HTML page.","Referring to , a device  includes a synchronization controller interface , a browser , the browser interface , and the voice interface . The browser  communicates with the browser interface  and the synchronization controller interface . The synchronization controller interface  further communicates with the voice interface . The device  is similar to the device  except that the functionality allowing the browser  and the voice interface  to communicate with the synchronization controller  is separated as the synchronization controller interface . In one implementation, the device  is a mobile device. Such a mobile device is smaller and lighter than if a synchronization controller was also implemented on the mobile device. Further, because such a mobile device does not contain the functionality of a synchronization controller, but only includes an interface, the mobile device may be able to take advantage of improvements in a synchronization controller without having to be redesigned.","Additional Variations","Each of the above implementations may be used with more than two different modes. For example, inventory, shipping, or other data may be accessed in a warehouse using three different modes, and one or more machines accessing the warehouse data may need to be synchronized. The first mode may include keyboard input; the second mode may include voice input; and the third mode may include input from scanning a bar code on a pallet, for example, to request a particular record. Output for any of the modes may include, for example, display output, voice output, or printer output.","The processes described have been principally explained in terms of a particular system. However, each of the processes may be used with a variety of other implementations of a centralized, fused, proxy, or other type of system.","Referring again to , the server system  includes one or more devices for storing, at least temporarily, information that can be accessed by one or more gateways. For example, a web server has a storage device for storing web pages. The server system  may include multiple storage devices that are located locally or remotely with respect to each other. The server system  may include one or more storage devices that are located locally to another component, such as, for example, the device  or the second gateway . In various implementations, the server system  or the synchronization controller  are not contained in the unit .","The synchronization controller  maintains or establishes synchronization between two or more devices, such as, for example, gateways and\/or interfaces. The components of the synchronization controller  may be remote or local with respect to each other and may be local to one or more of the other components in the system  such as, for example, the device , the second gateway , or the publish\/subscribe system .","The publish\/subscribe system  refers to a system that receives and sends messages. In particular implementations, the publish\/subscribe system  can only receive messages from, or send messages to, subscribed entities\u2014with the exception of receiving a subscribe request.","The device  may be an electronic device, an optical device, a magnetic device, or some other type of device capable of communicating with a user and with other systems. Examples include a computer, a PDA, a server, or a set-top box.","The connections , , , , and , and other connections throughout the disclosure, may be direct or indirect connections, possibly with one or more intervening devices. A connection may use one or more media such as, for example, a wired, a wireless, a cable, or a satellite connection. A connection may use a variety of technologies or standards such as, for example, analog or digital technologies, packet switching, code division multiple access (\u201cCDMA\u201d), time division multiple access (\u201cTDMA\u201d), and global system for mobiles (\u201cGSM\u201d) with general packet radio service (\u201cGPRS\u201d). A connection may use a variety of established networks such as, for example, the Internet, the WWW, a wide-area network (\u201cWAN\u201d), a local-area network (\u201cLAN\u201d), a telephone network, a radio network, a television network, a cable network, and a satellite network.","The processes - are amenable to numerous variations, several examples of which follow, and may be applied to architectures different than that of the system . Separate devices, each including one gateway, can be synchronized by keeping track of the IP addresses and port numbers of the separate devices, or by having the devices subscribe to the same topic at a publish\/subscribe system. For example, a user may be operating a first-modality interface on a first machine, and operating a second-modality interface on a second machine. As another example, two or more users may be remotely located and may want to be synchronized. The remotely located users may be operating the same modality interface, or different modality interfaces.","The voice commands discussed as initiating operation  or , and the browser commands discussed as initiating operation  or , may be navigation commands or non-navigation commands. Navigation commands include, for example, specifying a URL, and entering a home, back, or forward command. Non-navigation commands include, for example, a text entry, a preference change, or a focus command.","Any input received by a gateway, including command and data, may be provided to the server by the voice gateway or the browser. For example, the voice gateway may provide the server with text entries and other inputs, even when the voice gateway does not need a VXML page, so that the server can supply the input to the browser to keep the browser synchronized with respect to text entries, and not just with respect to new pages.","In various implementations, the server's message to a gateway in operation , , or  may include, for example, (i) the actual corresponding HTML\/VXML page, (ii) the URL of the corresponding page with a command to retrieve the corresponding page, (iii) the URL of a JSP that identifies the corresponding page, (iv) a command relating to the corresponding page or to a JSP that identifies the corresponding page, and (v) an indication to reload the current page (into which the server has embedded a command that will retrieve the corresponding page).","A first item is said to relate to first data when the first item includes information relating to the first data. Such information may include, for example, the first data itself, an address of the first data or some other pointer to the first data, an encoding of the first data, and parameters identifying particular information from the first data. The first data may include any of the many examples described in this disclosure as well as, for example, an address of some other data, data entered by a user, and a command entered by a user.","In sending the corresponding input, or an indication of the corresponding input, to a gateway (-, , -, or ), a server may send, for example, a command or parameters. A command may include, for example, a JavaScript command that requests the corresponding page. Parameters may include, for example, a URL of the corresponding page. The parameters are parsed, a command is determined, and the command is executed. For example, in operation , instead of sending the corresponding VXML page, the server may send a message with parameters including a URL (for the corresponding VXML page) and an indication that the voice gateway should request the page identified by the URL.","In the processes -, the web server  is described as performing a variety of actions. As described earlier, the web server  includes a synchronization controller and many of the actions performed by the web server  can be characterized as being performed by the synchronization controller.","Referring to , operations  and  may be generalized to allow the synchronization controller  to receive other browser inputs, and the voice mode system  to receive other voice inputs. The inputs may include, for example, a command, a request for a new page, a data input, and a focus request. In one implementation of operation , the voice mode system  receives a user's city selection for a field in a VXML page that solicits the user's address. Receipt of the city selection causes the VXML to move to the dialogue entry for selecting a state. The voice mode system  may pass this selection to the browser  so that the user's screen display can be updated.","Further, the voice mode system  may be a voice gateway. In such an implementation, the voice gateway would not have any VXML pages stored locally and would request them from the web server . The synchronization controller  may intercept or control the voice gateway requests in a manner analogous to the manner in which the synchronization controller  may intercept or control the browser requests.","One or more of the functions of the synchronization controller  may be performed by either the browser  or the voice mode system . For example, the browser  may send HTML page requests to the voice mode system , and the voice mode system  may determine the corresponding VXML page.","As indicated by the breadth of implementations disclosed, the synchronization controller can be placed at various locations within a system. Further, the component functions of a synchronization controller can be separated and placed at different locations within a system. This flexibility allows the complexity of a system to be targeted to one or more particular devices. By keeping the synchronization controller functions off of a mobile device, for example, mobile devices may be more lightweight, less expensive, and more robust to technology enhancements in the synchronization controller. By using a proxy model, a mobile device is still free of the synchronization controller and enjoys the noted benefits. Further, by using a proxy model, the multitude of existing web servers may not need to be redesigned, and the synchronization controller may allow multiple types of mobile devices to communicate with the same server infrastructure. Using a publish\/subscribe system, operating as in the implementations described or according to other principles, also may facilitate an architecture with minimal install time for client devices, such that client devices are changed only minimally.","A synchronization controller may consist of one or more components adapted to perform, for example, the functions described for a synchronization controller in one or more of the implementations in this disclosure. The components may be, for example, hardware, software, firmware, or some combination of these. Hardware components include, for example, controller chips and chip sets, communications chips, digital logic, and other digital or analog circuitry.","The implementations disclosed can be characterized as providing synchronizing mechanisms. Such synchronizing mechanisms may include, for example, (i) sending a message to a publish\/subscribe system, (ii) sending a message to a browser, possibly with a URL for a new page or a JSP, (iii) updating state information by, for example, updating a JSP, (iv) sending a corresponding page directly to a gateway, (v) requesting a corresponding page from an intermediary or from a storage location having the page, (vi) determining a corresponding page, and (vii) requesting a determination of a corresponding page and, possibly, requesting receipt of that determination. Various of the listed mechanisms may be performed by a synchronization controller, a web server, a gateway, or another component adapted to provide such functionality.","Many of the disclosed implementations have focused on WWW and Internet applications. However, the features described can be applied to a variety of communication environments, networks, and systems. The use of the term \u201cpage\u201d is not meant to be restrictive and refers to data in a form usable by a particular gateway, interface, or other component.","Throughout this disclosure various actions are described. These terms, which include, for example, receiving, accessing, providing, sending, requesting, determining, passing, and routing, and others like them, are intended to be broadly construed. Accordingly, such terms are not restricted to acting directly but may act through one or more intermediaries. For example, a page may be sent to a gateway, provided to a gateway, or received from a gateway, even though the page may first go through a controller or a publish\/subscribe system. As another example, a corresponding page may be determined by requesting another component to provide the corresponding URL.","Additional details about particular implementations, focusing largely on various mechanisms for associating two or more modalities with each other, will now be provided. The implementations described above may use a variety of mechanisms to associate modalities, many of which are within the skill of one of ordinary skill without requiring undue experimentation. Such mechanisms may include various tabular approaches and naming conventions to associate modalities and\/or devices. Further, for fused implementations as described above, a device may be programmed to associate the multiple modes supported on the device. Implementations described above also may query a user for information that identifies the modes and\/or devices that the user desires to have associated.","Accordingly, the implementations described above have sufficient detail to allow one of ordinary skill to make and use the implementations without undue experimentation, and the disclosure of the mechanisms below is not necessary to enable or describe the implementations discussed above. However, the following discussion does provide additional disclosure supporting, for example, specific dependent claims to the disclosed mechanisms and implementations.","A user interface may allow a user to gain access to data, such as, for example, products in a catalog database, or to enter data into a system, such as, for example, entering customer information into a customer database. User interfaces are used for applications residing on relatively stationary computing devices, such as desktop computers, as well as for applications residing on mobile computing devices, such as laptops, palmtops, and portable electronic organizers. A voice-activated user interface can be created to provide data access and entry to a system, and voice input may be particularly appealing for mobile devices.","In various implementations, a grammar for speech recognition for a given voice-driven application, mobile or otherwise, can be written to enable accurate and efficient recognition. Particular implementations described below provide a user interface that allows a user to input data in one or more of a variety of different modes, including, for example, stylus and voice input. Output also may be in one or more of a variety of modes, such as, for example, display or voice. Particular implementations may be used with mobile devices, such as, for example, palmtops, and the combination of voice and stylus input with voice and display output may allow such mobile devices to be more useful to a user. Implementations also may be used with the multi-modal synchronization system described in the incorporated provisional application.","Implementations allow enhanced voice recognition accuracy and\/or speed due in part to the use of a structured grammar that allows a grammar to be narrowed to a relevant part for a particular voice recognition operation. For example, narrowing of the grammar for a voice recognition operation on a full search string may be achieved by using the results of an earlier, or parallel, voice recognition operation on a component of the full search string. Other implementations may narrow the grammar by accepting parameters of a search string in a particular order from a user, and, optionally, using the initial parameter(s) to narrow the grammar for subsequent parameters. Examples include (i) reversing the standard order of receiving street address information so that, for example, the country is received before the state and the grammar used to recognize the state is narrowed to the states in the selected country, (ii) segmenting an electronic mail address or web site address so that a user supplies a domain identifier, such as, for example \u201ccom,\u201d separately, or (iii) automatically inserting the \u201cat sign\u201d and the \u201cdot\u201d into an electronic mail address and only prompting the user for the remaining terms, thus obviating the often complex process of recognizing these spoken characters.","Implementations also may increase recognition accuracy and speed by augmenting a grammar with possible search strings, or utterances, thus decreasing the likelihood that a voice recognition system will need to identify an entry by its spelling. In such situations, the voice recognition system also obviates the need to ask the user to spell out a term that is not recognized when spoken. For example, after a user enters \u201ccom\u201d as a domain identifier in an electronic mail address, the voice recognition system may include, for example, the names of all \u201cFortune 100\u201d companies and a variety of popular commercial sites in the grammar for the server identifier of the electronic mail address. Thus, if the user then enters \u201camazon\u201d as the server identifier, and if \u201camazon\u201d has been included in the grammar, the system will recognize the entry without having to ask the user to spell it out.","Implementations also allow enhanced database searching. This may be achieved, for example, by using a structured grammar and associating grammar entries with specific database entries. In this manner, when the structured grammar is used to recognize the search string, then particular database entries or relevant portions of the database may be identified at the same time.","According to one general aspect, automatically searching for one or more matches to a search string includes accessing a first part and a second part of a search string. A first search space is searched for a match for the first part of the search string, and a second search space is limited based on a result of searching the first search space. The limited second search space is searched for a match for the second part of the search string.","Searching the first search space may include searching a database. Searching the limited second search space may include searching at least part of the database. Limiting the second search space may include limiting the part of the database that is searched to database entries that include a match for the first part of the search string, thus allowing a quicker search compared to searching the full database. The second part of the search string may include a voice input or a manual input. Searching the first search space and searching the limited second search space may be performed at least partially in parallel. The search string may include an address.","Accessing the first part of the search string may include accessing a voice input. Searching the first search space for the match may include performing voice recognition on the first part of the search string. Accessing at least the second part of the search string may include accessing the voice input. Limiting the second search space may include limiting the second search space to grammar entries associated with the first part of the search string. Searching the limited second search space may include performing voice recognition on at least the second part of the search string using the limited second search space, thereby allowing enhanced voice recognition of the second part of the search string compared to performing voice recognition using the unlimited second search space.","The grammar entries associated with the first part of the search string may include grammar entries for full search strings, each full search string including the first part of the search string. The grammar entries associated with the first part of the search string may include grammar entries for components of a full search string, each component being part of a full search string that includes the first part. Performing voice recognition on the first part may produce a recognized string, and the recognized string may be associated with a set of recognizable search strings from the search space. Limiting the second search space may include limiting the second search space to the set of recognizable search strings or components thereof. Performing voice recognition on the second part of the voice input may include comparing the second part to a set of high-occurrence patterns in the limited second search space, followed by comparing the second part to a set of low-occurrence patterns in the limited second search space. Voice recognition may be performed on the entire voice input using a third search space. The third search space may be limited based on the result from performing voice recognition on the first part of the voice input and based on a result from performing voice recognition on at least the second part of the voice input.","The first part of the search string may be associated with a set of searchable entries, and each entry in the limited second search space may be associated with one or more entries in the set of searchable entries. A first set of options may be provided to a user, the first set of options relating to the first part of the search string, and being provided to the user in a page. Accessing at least the first part of the search string may include accepting a first input from the user, the first input being selected from the first set of options. Limiting the second search space may include limiting a second set of options based on the accepted first input, the second set of options relating to the second part of the search string. The second set of options may be provided to the user in the page, such that the user is presented with a single page that provides the first set of options and the second set of options. Accessing at least the second part of the search string may include accepting a second input from the user, the second input being selected from the second set of options.","Accepting the first input may include accepting a first voice input and performing voice recognition on the first input, wherein performing voice recognition on the first input in isolation allows enhanced voice recognition compared to performing voice recognition on the search string. The first set of options may include manufacturer designations and the second set of options may include product designations from a manufacturer designated by the first input. The search string may include an address.","Accepting the first input may include receiving the first input auditorily from the user. Voice recognition may be performed on the first input in isolation, wherein performing voice recognition on the first input in isolation allows enhanced voice recognition compared to performing voice recognition on the search string. Providing the second set of options may include searching a set of data items for the first input and including in the second set of options references only to those data items, from the set of data items, that include the first input.

These user interfaces may be designed to accept various modes of input and to deliver various modes of output. Examples of input and output modes include manual, visual (for example, display or print), auditory (for example, voice or alarms), haptic, pressure, temperature, and smell. Manual modes may include, for example, keyboard, stylus, keypad, button, mouse, touch (for example, touch screen), and other hand inputs. Certain implementations are particularly suited for mobile applications, for which stylus or voice input is preferred, and for which output is presented visually on the screen and\/or auditorily with text-to-speech or recorded human speech.","Various implementations also make use of structured grammars for voice recognition. The structured grammars may allow for quicker recognition, for quicker searching for an item in a corresponding database, and\/or for enhanced voice recognition due to the decreased likelihood of misrecognizing a voice input.","Referring to , a process  for recognizing a search string using a multi-cluster approach includes entering a search string using a voice input (). The search string may represent, for example, an item in a database that a user wants to find. For example, the user may enter \u201cSony laptop superslim 505Z\u201d into a voice recognition engine of a computer database to pull up information on that (hypothetical) computer model. As explained, the grammar is structured around the database entries, including the actual database entries, or keywords, etc., and possibly also including additional category descriptions and other vocabulary entries.","The process  includes parsing the entered search string into at least one component in addition to the full search string (). The full search string is also referred to as a component. A component may be a word or other recognized symbol, or group of words or symbols. The search string may be parsed into all of its components, or a single component may be parsed out. Parsing may be performed by recognizing silence between words, symbols, or other components, and the voice entry system may require such silence. Parsing also may be performed on voice inputs entered in a more natural delivery, without obvious pauses between components.","The process  includes performing voice recognition on at least two components (). The parsing () may be performed simultaneously while performing the voice recognition (). For example, as the search string is processed from left to right, for example, a component may be recognized () and, upon recognition, may be parsed (). One of the two components may be the full search string.","The process  includes determining a resulting solution space in the grammar for at least one of the voice recognition operations (). The solution space represents possible matches for the full search string. For example, the first component may be the first word of the search string, for example, \u201cSony,\u201d and may correspond to a cluster in the speech recognition grammar. This cluster defined by \u201cSony\u201d may contain, perhaps, only one hundred entries out of tens of thousands of entries in the grammar (and the corresponding database). Those one hundred entries would form the solution space for the component \u201cSony.\u201d","The process  includes modifying the search space for the voice recognition operation () of at least one of the components using the solution space determined in operation  (). Continuing with the example from above, if the full search string is \u201cSony laptop superslim 505Z,\u201d then the search space being used to perform the voice recognition on the full string can be narrowed to include only the one hundred grammar entries that include the component \u201cSony.\u201d","By narrowing the search space, one or more advantages may be realized in particular implementations. For example, by narrowing the search space, the complexity of the searched-grammar, and the size of the searched vocabulary may be reduced, which may enhance recognition accuracy. Further, the speed of the recognition process may be increased.","In one implementation, both recognition processes () are performed at least partially in parallel and recognizing the smaller component, such as \u201cSony,\u201d is faster than recognizing the entire search string. As a result, the recognition process for the full search string is started on the entire search space of grammar entries and is narrowed after the resulting solution space for the smaller component is determined in operation . Other implementations perform the voice recognition processes serially. For example, one implementation performs voice recognition on a smaller component, and afterwards performs voice recognition for a larger component using the smaller component's solution space as the search space for the larger component.","The process  includes determining a list of one or more matches for the full search string (). Voice recognition algorithms often return confidence scores associated with the results. These confidence scores can be used, for example, to rank order the results and a selected number of the highest scoring results can be returned to the user.","The list of matches might not necessarily be good matches. Various implementations may use a threshold confidence score to determine if a good match has been found. If a good match has not been found, then a variety of options are available. For example, (i) the user may be prompted for more information, (ii) the search string may be modified automatically, if it has not already been, by, for example, using synonyms of recognized components, transposing components, etc., or (iii) the user may be presented with information on the size of the solution space for each component, and the confidence scores, which may reveal a component that the system had a difficult time recognizing.","Referring to , a diagrammatic flow chart  depicting the process  includes a search string . The search string  includes a first component  and a second component . The search string  may be, for example, a voice segment. The search string  is parsed using a parse process  into the first and second components , . A voice recognition process  is performed on each component , , , in parallel, using a search space . The parse process  and the voice recognition process  may be implemented using, for example, a processor or other computing device or combination of devices.","Voice recognition of the first component  results in a first solution space . Assuming that voice recognition of the first component  finishes before voice recognition of the second component  and of the full string , then each of the latter voice recognition operations can be restricted to the first solution space .","Voice recognition of the second component  results in a second solution space . Assuming that voice recognition of the second component  finishes before voice recognition of the full string , then voice recognition of the full string  can be restricted to an overlap  of the first solution space  and the second solution space . Voice recognition of the full string  results in a third solution space .","The time required for performing voice recognition on a small component can be decreased by structuring the grammar so that common components of the database entries (which are included in the grammar) are compared with the components of the search string before other components of the database entries (which are also included in the grammar). Further, common components may be entered as separate vocabulary entries in a grammar, even though those components do not constitute complete database entries. For example, the word \u201cSony\u201d may be entered into the vocabulary even though it does not refer to an individual product (database entry). The component \u201cSony\u201d can then be associated with all of the grammar entries that include the word \u201cSony\u201d and that correspond to complete database entries. The same can be done for the individual word \u201claptop,\u201d as well as the two-word component \u201cSony laptop,\u201d for example. Such a structure may allow for relatively quick recognition of the component \u201cSony laptop\u201d and a corresponding narrowing of the search space for the recognition of the full search string \u201cSony laptop superslim 505Z.\u201d","Note that the list of matches determined in the process  () may return matches that correspond to actual database entries that match the entered search string. Accordingly, in such implementations, the voice recognition process may effectively perform the database search simultaneously. For example, each of the listed matches may serve as an index into the database for easy retrieval of the corresponding database entry.","Other implementations may allow search strings to include components that are not part of the database, however. For example, a user may be allowed to enter a price range for a computer. In such an example, the grammar could include, and be able to recognize, price ranges entered in a determined format. The grammar may be structured in a variety of ways to support recognizing such search strings. For example, if a user enters only a price range, the voice recognition engine may recognize the search string and associate it with a set of database entries satisfying the price range. Alternatively, the voice recognition engine may query the user for more data by, for example, returning a list of manufacturers having computers (computers being the assumed content of the database ultimately being searched) in that price range. If the user enters additional information, such as, for example, a manufacturer, the voice recognition system may use that additional information to narrow the solution space. If the user enters sufficient information, the grammar may be structured to allow the voice recognition system to determine, for the various price ranges that are recognizable, the grammar entries for all actual products (corresponding to actual database entries) that satisfy the entered price range and the other components of the search string. These entries may then be presented to the user.","The process  can also be applied to systems that do not use voice input. For example, other modes of input may require a recognition process that could be performed in an analogous manner to that already described.","Referring to , a process  for performing a search for a search string using a multi-level, multi-parameter cascade approach includes providing a first set of options for a first parameter (). For example, a user interface to a database of computers may provide a list of manufacturers as the first set of options, with the first parameter being the manufacturer. The first set of options may be provided, for example, on a display, or through a voice response system.","The process  includes entering a first parameter selected from the first set of options (). Continuing the example from above, a user may select, and enter, a manufacturer from a list provided in operation . The user may enter the first parameter by using, for example, a stylus, keyboard, touch screen, or voice input.","The process  includes providing a second set of options for a second parameter based on the first parameter (). Continuing the example from above, a user interface may provide a list of product types, including, for example, desktops, laptops, and palmtops, that are available from the manufacturer entered in operation .","The process  includes entering a second parameter selected from the second set of options (). Continuing the example from above, a user may select, and enter, a product type from the list provided in operation .","The process  includes providing a list of matches, based on the first and second parameters (). Continuing the example from above, the list of matches may include all computers in the database that are manufactured by the entered manufacturer and that are of the entered product type. For example, the list of matches may include all Sony laptops.","The process  may be used, for example, instead of having a user enter a one-time, full search phrase. The process  presents a set of structured searches or selections from, for example, drop-down lists. The first and second parameters can be considered to be parts of a search string, with the cumulative search string producing the list of matches provided in operation . The database may be structured to allow for efficient searches based on the parameters provided in operations  and . Additionally, in voice input applications, by structuring the data entry, the grammar and vocabulary for each parameter may be simplified, thus potentially increasing recognition accuracy and speed.","Implementations may present multiple parameters and sets of options, and these may be organized into levels. In the process , one parameter was used at each of two levels. However, for example, multiple parameters may be presented at a first level, with both entries determining the list of options presented for additional multiple parameters at a second level, and with all entries determining a list of matches. Such parameters may include, for example, manufacturer, brand, product type, price range, and a variety of features of the products in the product type. Examples of features for computers include processor speed, amount of random access memory, storage capacity of a hard disk, video card speed and memory, and service contract options.","Referring to , a picture of a page  for implementing the process  includes a first level  and a second level . The first level  provides a first parameter  for the product, with a corresponding pull-down menu  that includes a set of options. The set of options in pull-down menu  may include, for example, desktop, laptop, and palmtop. The second level  provides a second parameter  for the brand, with a corresponding pull-down menu  that includes a set of options. The set of options in pull-down menu  are all assumed to satisfy the product parameter entered by the user in pull-down menu  and may include, for example, Sony, HP\/Compaq, Dell, and IBM. Assuming that \u201claptop\u201d was selected in the pull-down menu , then the pull-down menu  would only include brands (manufacturers) that sell laptops.","The page  also includes a category  for models that match the parameters entered in the first and second levels  and . The matching models are viewable using a pull-down menu . As the page  indicates, all of the search string information as well as the results may be presented in a single page. The page  is also presentable in a single screen shot, but other single-page implementations may use, for example, a web page that spans multiple screen lengths and requires scrolling to view all of the information.","Referring to , a process  for recognizing an address includes determining a list of options for a first part of an address (). The address may be, for example, a street address or an Internet address, where Internet addresses include, for example, electronic mail addresses and web site addresses. If the address is a street address, the first part may be, for example, a state identifier.","The process  includes prompting a user for the first part of the address (). The prompt may, for example, simply include a request to enter information, or it may include a list of options. The process  includes receiving the first part of the address (). If the first part is received auditorily, the process  includes performing voice recognition of the first part of the address ().","The process  includes determining a list of options for a second part of the address based on the received first part (). Continuing the example from above, the second part may be, for example, a city identifier, and the list of options may include, for example, only those cities that are in the state identified by the received state identifier. By inverting the usual order of state and city in entering street addresses, a voice recognition system can simplify the relevant grammar and vocabulary for the city identifier, thus facilitating enhanced voice recognition accuracy and speed.","The process  includes prompting the user for the second part of the address (). Again, the prompt need not include the list of options. The process  includes receiving the second part of the address (). If the second part is received auditorily, the process  includes performing voice recognition of the second part of the address ().","The process  could continue with subsequent determinations of lists of options for further parts of the address. Continuing the example from above, a list of options for a zip code could be determined based on the city identified by the received city identifier. Such a list could be determined from the available zip codes in the identified city. City streets in the city or the zip code could also be determined. Further, country information could be obtained before obtaining state information.","As the above example and the process  indicate, the range of possibilities for each subsequent piece of address information can be narrowed by entering the data in an order that is reverse from the ordinary practice, that is, by entering data for geographically broad categories to geographically narrow categories. If multiple countries are concerned, the impact of using the reverse order may be even greater because standard designations for streets varies for different languages.","The process  may prompt the user in a number of ways. For example, the user may be prompted to enter address information in a particular order, allowing a system to process the address information as it is entered and to prepare the lists of options. Entry fields for country, state or province, city, zip or postal code, street, etc., for example, may be presented top-down on a screen or sequentially presented in speech output.","Referring to , there is shown another way to prompt the user in the process . A system may use a pop-up wizard  on the screen of a device to ask the user to enter specific address information. Further, a system may preserve the normative order of address information, but use visual cues, for example, to prompt the user to enter the information in a particular order. Visual cues may include, for example, highlighting or coloring the border or the title of an entry field.","The process  may be applied to data entered using a voice mode or another mode. After the data is entered at each prompt, and after it is recognized if voice input is used, a database of addresses may be searched to determine the list of options for the next address field. Such systems allow database searching on an ongoing basis instead of waiting until all address information is entered. Such systems also allow for guided entry using pull-down menus and, with or without guided entry, alerting a user at the time of entry if an invalid entry is made for a particular part of an address.","The process  also may be applied to other addresses, in addition to street addresses or parts thereof. For example, the process  may be applied to Internet addresses, including, for example, electronic mail addresses and web site addresses.","Referring to , a format  for entering an electronic mail address includes using a user identifier , a server identifier , and a domain identifier . The \u201cat sign\u201d separating the user identifier  and the server identifier , and the \u201cdot\u201d separating the server identifier  and the domain identifier  may be implicit and inserted automatically, that is, without human intervention.","In one implementation, the domain identifier  is entered first due to the small number of options available for this field. A list of options for the server identifier  can be generated based on the entered domain. For example, if \u201ccom\u201d is entered for the domain, then a list of options for the server identifier  may include, for example, all \u201cFortune 100\u201d companies and the twenty-five most frequently visited commercial web sites. Similar lists may be generated for \u201cgov,\u201d \u201cnet,\u201d and other domain identifiers . A list of options for the user identifier  may include, for example, common last names and first names and other conventions, such as, for example, a first initial followed by a last name.","Referring to , a format  for entering a web site address includes using a network identifier , a server identifier , and a domain identifier . The two \u201cdots\u201d separating the three identifiers , ,  may be implicit and inserted automatically. The network identifier may be selected from, for example, \u201cwww,\u201d \u201cwww1\u201d, \u201cwww2,\u201d etc.","Referring to , a process  for searching for one or matches to a search string includes accessing at least a first part of a search string (). Such accessing may include, for example, receiving a voice input, a stylus input, or a menu selection, and the first part may include the entire search string.","The process  includes searching a first search space for a match for the first part of the search string (). The first search space may include, for example, a search space in a grammar of a voice recognition engine, a search space in a database, or a search space in a list of options presented to a user in a pull-down menu. Searching may include, for example, comparing text entries, voice waveforms, or codes representing entries in a codebook of vector-quantized waveforms.","The process  includes limiting a second search space based on a result of searching the first search space (). The second search space may, for example, be similar to or the same as the first search space. Limiting may include, for example, paring down the possible grammar or vocabulary entries that could be examined, paring down the possible database entries that could be examined, or paring down the number of options that could be displayed or made available for a parameter of the search string. And paring down the possibilities or options may be done, for example, so as to exclude possibilities or options that do not satisfy the first part of the search string.","The process  includes accessing at least a second part of the search string () and searching the limited second search space for a match for the second part of the search string (). Accessing the second part of the search string may include, for example, receiving a voice input, a stylus input, or a menu selection, and the second part may include the entire search string. Searching the limited second search space may be performed, for example, in the same way or in a similar way as searching the first search space is performed. As suggested by the discussion of this paragraph and the preceding paragraphs, the process  is intended to cover all of the disclosed processes.","Referring to , a system  for implementing one or more of the above processes includes a computing device , a first memory  located internal to the computing device , a second memory  located external to the computing device , and a recognition engine  located external to the computing device . The computing device may be, for example, a desktop, laptop, palmtop, or other type of electronic device capable of performing one or more of the processes described. The first and second memories ,  may be, for example, permanent or temporary memory capable of storing data or instructions at least temporarily. The recognition engine  may be a voice recognition engine or a recognition engine for another mode of input. The second memory  and the recognition engine  are shown as being external to, and optionally connected to, the computing device . However, the second memory  and the recognition engine  also may be integrated into the computing device  or be omitted from the system .","Various modifications of the above implementations may be made. For example, the operations of the disclosed processes need not necessarily be performed in the order(s) indicated.","In the above description, numerous examples have been given which allow a first-modality gateway and a second-modality gateway to be synchronized, so that a user may access a server system using either or both of the gateways at a given point in time to obtain a given piece of information or perform a specific action. , , and  depict several examples, and other examples have been described.","One action which a user might perform when utilizing the gateway synchronization capabilities of such systems is the selection of a web page that is linked to a currently-viewed web page, where this selection can be performed, for example, either by voice input using a VXML page, or by clicking on an HTML link embedded in an HTML page, using, for example, a stylus or mouse.","Another action which a user might perform is to enter text into, for example, multiple fields within a form on a single web page. For example, as discussed above, variations of processes - in  include techniques for implementing commands relating to a particular page. More specifically, in , variations of operations  and  allow the synchronization controller  of  to receive inputs such as browser inputs and voice inputs, where the inputs may include a data input and\/or a focus request for moving to a new field. In an example given above with respect to operation , the voice mode system  receives a user's city selection for a field in a VXML page, and then subsequently moves a focus to a field for state selection.","Text can be entered using either manual entry by, for example, keyboard, or via a voice-recognition system associated with a corresponding and synchronized VXML page. The discussion of  describe examples of such text entry; more specifically, these figures and related text and examples describe techniques whereby, for example, a grammar is selectively narrowed when performing voice-recognition on a search string, or where a grammar is progressively narrowed as a plurality of related entries are input. By these and other techniques, text entry using voice recognition may be improved in terms of speed and accuracy.","Another technique, allowed for in the discussion above, for entering text or other information into multiple fields within a form is to have a two-level, hierarchical dynamic grammar. In this technique, there are multiple levels and instances of independent, discrete grammars, rather than multiple subsets of a larger and\/or interdependent grammar(s).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0248","num":"0247"},"figref":["FIG. 24","FIG. 24"],"b":["2410","2410"]},"In , a second level includes a plurality of specific grammars. For example, the second level might include a first grammar  for recognizing voice commands inputting a city name, a second grammar  for recognizing voice commands for inputting a state name, and a third grammar  for recognizing voice commands for inputting a street address.","In , it should be understood that grammars - are separate, discrete, independent grammars. One consequence of having independent grammars is that a given word may be replicated in multiple grammars, thereby increasing total storage requirements. For example, grammar  might include the word \u201cWashington\u201d for identifying a name of the city, Washington, D.C. Grammar  might also include the word \u201cWashington,\u201d here to identify the state of Washington. Finally, grammar  might include the word \u201cWashington\u201d in case a user lives on \u201cWashington Street.\u201d","In contrast, other voice recognition systems may have a single, large grammar (or a plurality of dependent grammars), in which the word \u201cWashington\u201d is stored once and entered into whatever field is currently active upon detection of the word \u201cWashington.\u201d Moreover, such systems may be relatively poor in recognizing voice input when there are multiple fields for voice recognition that are active at the same time. For example, the fields of last name and first name may both exist in a form on a software application and may be concurrently active to display a result of recognizing a voice input such as \u201cDavis\u201d (which may be, for example, a valid selection within both a \u201cfirst name\u201d and a \u201csecond name\u201d field). Such fields with similar data in the recognition grammar may compete for the results of voice recognition, and therefore increase the probability of inaccuracy.","The multi-level grammar of  may thus provide increased speed and\/or accuracy of voice recognition. This speed and\/or accuracy improvement results, for example, from the fact that only one from among the second level of grammars is active a particular time. Therefore, the size of the vocabulary that must be searched by a voice-recognition system may be severely reduced. With a smaller vocabulary, recognition accuracy generally increases, and processing time generally decreases.","Moreover, the voice recognition system is constantly aware of which grammar (field) is active, and so does not need to disambiguate a recognized word with respect to a given field. For example, in other systems in which the word Washington is recognized, the systems may have to determine the field into which the recognized word should be inserted, for example, city, state, or address. In using the multi-level, dynamic grammar of , such additional step(s) may be avoided.","Together, the various grammars , , , and  may be stored within a storage area . The storage area  may represent a single database or medium, or multiple databases (media). The grammars may be stored in, for example, a single file or in a plurality of files.","A grammar activation and deactivation system  is available to turn on one of the second-level grammars , , or , as needed, and to concurrently ensure that the other two are deactivated. A voice recognition system  interacts with a user to input voice or spoken data and match the voice or spoken data with words or other portions of the currently-active grammar. Also, an input indication system  demonstrates to the user which grammar is active, as well as a result of the matching operation performed by the voice recognition system .","It should be understood that the storage area , grammar activation and deactivation system , the voice recognition system , and the input indication system  may be implemented on a single device, or on a plurality of devices. For example, one or more of the elements of  may be located on a server system, and\/or on a local system such as a mobile computing device. For example, the input indication system  may be a field(s) within a form on a graphical user interface such as a web page, as discussed above, so that voice data input by the user and recognized by the voice recognition system  can be displayed to the user. The input indication system  also may be a recorded or computer-generated voice repeating a recognized word to the user, such as might be used in a telephone entry system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0257","num":"0256"},"figref":["FIG. 25","FIG. 25"],"b":["2500","2500","2510","2520","2530","2540","2550","2560","2500","2570"]},"Thus, according to the description above, a user may activate the first name field  using a variety of techniques. For example, field  could be selected by a voice command recognized by the first level grammar that includes global grammar . Alternatively, if page  is synchronized with an HTML (and\/or JSP) page as described above, the field could be selected using a stylus, mouse, or other mechanical input. As another example, the field could be automatically highlighted, due to being the first field in the form.","In any case, once the field  is highlighted, a second-level grammar corresponding to that field is activated, and only words from that grammar will be recognized for entry into field . In this way, a voice-recognition system  will have a significantly restricted vocabulary from which to choose a first name, so that the speed and\/or accuracy with which the first name is selected may be greatly improved.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0260","num":"0259"},"figref":"FIG. 26","b":["2600","2600","2500","2600","2610"]},"In one implementation, field  is automatically highlighted as the first field on the page . Upon filling in a first name into field , the visual cue may automatically move to the field , and so on through the page . As shown, an entry into the various fields may be aided by pull-down menu(s), such as in fields  and , or may be filled without the aid of pull-down menus(s), such as in fields  (), , , and .","Due to the presence of first level grammars such as global grammar , which remains active even when a particular one of the second level grammars is activated, the user may alternatively choose fields individually, simply by providing an activation signal for a selected one of the (currently) deactivated grammars. For example, the activation signal may involve simply saying the name of the desired field associated with the grammar to be activated. Moreover, as already noted, multi-modal synchronization of pages \/ allows the user to utilize an activation signal involving a physical selection of a field (for example, using a physical tool such as a stylus or a mouse), even when the pages include, or are associated with, VXML pages\/data.","Alternatively, the global grammar  may be included within each of the independent grammars , , and , particularly in the case where the global grammar  is relatively small in size. In this example, total memory requirements will likely be increased; however, the need to have two processes running simultaneously (that is, two grammars) would be eliminated.","It should be understood that the implementations of  are particularly advantageous with respect to mobile computing devices, in which computing\/processing resources are at a relative premium. Moreover, often in small mobile computing devices, text entry is awkward, difficult, or non-existent, so that speedy, accurate voice entry, particularly into forms such as web pages, would be very useful and advantageous.","Although the above implementations of a dynamic grammar have been discussed with respect to a web page such as HTML, VXML, or JSP, they are in fact compatible with many or all of the various implementations discussed above in Sections I and II. Moreover, the implementations may be compatible with non-web or non-Internet related implementations. For example, the multi-level, dynamic grammar of  could be used in almost any software application in which discrete data should be entered.","In fact, any application in which data is to be entered and vocal entry is possible could benefit from the above-described implementations. For example, as referred to above, telephone-based information entry could be facilitated in which a recorded or computerized voice speaks a field as a prompt for data entry, such as first name, and then selects from an independent, discrete grammar associated with the field, as described above.","Moreover, although a two-level grammar has been described above, implementations also may include a three (or more) level grammar. For example, a web page having two frames may have a set of independent grammars for each frame, a global grammar for each frame, and a global grammar for the web browser or other application(s) (such as an operating system for the device running the web browser).","Synchronizing Using IP Addresses","Referring to , a system  includes a first mobile device  including a first \u201cvoice over Internet Protocol\u201d (\u201cVoIP\u201d) client  and a first browser , with the first browser  including a first browser adaptor . First VoIP client  is coupled to a first voice gateway  that includes a voice gateway adaptor .","System  includes a second mobile device  including a second VoIP client  and a second browser , with the second browser  including a second browser adaptor .

System  includes a second web server  including a second web server adaptor . First web server  and second web server  are each coupled to the first browser , the first voice gateway , the second browser , and the second voice gateway . System  further includes a messaging handler  coupled to the first web server adaptor , the second web server adaptor , the first browser adaptor , the first voice gateway adaptor , the second browser adaptor , and the second voice gateway adaptor . Web server adaptors  and  each can be implemented as part of a multi-modal application running on web server  or , respectively.","Referring to , a system  is a smaller implementation of the general system of . System  includes first mobile device  (referred to as mobile device ), first voice gateway  (referred to as voice gateway ), first web server  (referred to as web server ), and messaging handler , as well as their constituent components described above in the description of .","Referring to , a process  can be used with system  and generally describes one implementation for establishing communication between various components and associating two modalities. The association described in process  may be used by, for example, one or more of the various synchronization processes described above.","Process  includes having VoIP client  connect to voice gateway  (). This connection () may be established in response to a user requesting a voice connection at mobile device  by, for example, using a stylus to select a \u201cconnect\u201d icon. A standard protocol, such as, for example, International Telecommunications Union\u2014T Recommendation H.323 (\u201cH.323\u201d) or Session Initiation Protocol (\u201cSIP\u201d), may be used between VoIP client  and voice gateway  in specific implementations.","Process  also includes having voice gateway adaptor  acquire the Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address of mobile device  (). The IP address may be part of the VoIP protocol being used, in which case the voice gateway adaptor  may acquire the IP address by, for example, pulling the IP address out of the connection header. The IP address also may be acquired, for example, by querying the user or mobile device .","The various adaptors in system  generally handle the messaging interface for the gateway\/server and may be implemented, for example, as a software plug-in. In various implementations, adaptors function as listener processes and browser adaptors comprise software embedded in each HTML page, with the software calling routines stored on the browser machine. As each HTML page is received, and the embedded software is executed, the execution of the software may give rise to an adaptor for that HTML page being instantiated on the browser machine. These implementations also may embed similar calls in VXML pages in implementations that support such calls at a voice gateway. For systems having voice gateways that do not support such calls, the voice gateway may include a single listener process (adaptor) that interfaces with the messaging handler. Analogously, one browser adaptor may support multiple HTML pages in implementations that support such calls at the display browser.","Process  includes having voice gateway adaptor  subscribe to a unique channel based on the IP address of the mobile device  (). Voice gateway adaptor  may use, for example, HTTP to communicate with messaging handler . Messaging handler  creates the channel and uses the IP address as a name or other reference for the channel, and voice gateway adaptor  subscribes to the unique channel. The channel is unique because it is described by the unique IP address of mobile device .","Process  includes having voice gateway  request a response from web server  (). Voice gateway  may send a HTTP request to web server  to request a response. Because no specific web page has been requested at this point by VoIP client , the request may be for a default page that need not contain any content (that is, a dummy page). Specific implementations may perform this operation as part of a start-up procedure that allows time for browser  to connect to web server  before requesting or sending web pages with content. Web server  may perform this functionality using a standard web server application that is enhanced to support synchronizing multiple modalities.","Process  includes having web server  return a dummy voice page to voice gateway  (). Process  also includes having browser  connect to web server  and establish a new browser session (). Browser  may connect in response, for example, to a user entering the URL of a desired web page, or in response to a connect command.","Process  includes having web server  detect the IP address of mobile device  and associate the unique messaging channel with the new session that was established between browser  and web server  (). In particular implementations, the IP address is embedded in the HTTP communication between browser  and web server , and web server  detects the IP address by extracting the IP address from the communication. In one implementation, web server  assumes that a unique messaging channel referenced by the IP address exists and associates the session with the unique messaging channel using a table or data structure.","Process  includes having web server  send a web page to browser  in response to first web browser  connecting to web server  (). The web page sent to a browser is typically a HTML page. If the browser-server connection was established () in response to a user entering the URL of a desired web page, then web server  may send the requested web page.","Process  includes having web server  publish the URL of the web page sent to browser  to voice gateway adaptor  through messaging handler  (). Web server  publishes the URL to the unique messaging channel identified or referenced by the IP address of mobile device . First web server adaptor  (referred to as web server adaptor ) is used to publish to messaging handler . Initially, only voice gateway adaptor  is subscribed to the unique messaging channel, so there is no ambiguity as to what entity is the intended recipient of the message.","In typical implementations, the URLs of corresponding VXML and HTML web pages are the same. Thus, in the typical implementations, a server need only publish the URL to allow the other modality to identify a corresponding web page. In implementations in which corresponding pages (or other data) do not have the same URL or other identifier, a server (or other component) may determine the identifier for the corresponding page.","Process  includes having browser adaptor  subscribe to the unique messaging channel (). Both voice gateway adaptor  and browser adaptor  are now subscribed to the unique messaging channel and can receive messages published to that channel.","Operation  is performed earlier in certain implementations. In an implementation in which browser adaptor  subscribes in operation , because both voice gateway adaptor  and browser adaptor  are subscribed to the unique messaging channel, each will receive the URL published in operation , as well as subsequently published URLs. In operation , voice gateway adaptor  may then recognize itself as the intended recipient of the message by, for example, (i) having web server  embed information in the message indicating which one or more adaptors are to act on the message, or (ii) having web server  use a sub-channel of the unique messaging channel. Alternatively, both adaptors  and  may act on the message, as explained below, and the respective gateway  and  may determine whether a page needs to be requested.","Process  includes having voice gateway adaptor  instruct voice gateway  to request the web page corresponding to the published URL (). After recognizing itself as an intended recipient of the published message, voice gateway adaptor  instructs voice gateway  to request the web page corresponding to the URL embedded in the message. In response, voice gateway  requests the web page from web server . The requested page corresponds to a VXML version of the HTML page that was sent to browser . In implementations in which browser adaptor  also acts on the published message, browser  may determine that the web page to be requested has already been received by browser  and that the message is intended only for voice gateway adaptor .","Process  includes having web server  detect the IP address of mobile device  and associate the session between voice gateway  and web server  with the unique messaging channel (). The IP address may be detected as in operation  for browser . Implementations may detect another parameter indicative of the IP address in lieu of the IP address itself. This operation may be performed earlier in process , such as, for example, in operation .","After process  is complete, both adaptors  and  are subscribed to the unique messaging channel at message handler  (, ), with the channel being described or referenced by the IP address of mobile device . Further, both sessions are associated at web server  with the unique messaging channel (, ). Accordingly, when a user requests a web page using either modality, the requesting session is already associated with the messaging channel (for example, ) and a message can be sent (for example, ) that allows a synchronizing web page to be requested (for example, ) and delivered.","In other implementations, browser  may connect to web server  before voice gateway  connects to web server . In such implementations, the roles of the two gateways  and  are generally reversed from that described in process .","Synchronizing Using User\/Device IDs","Referring to , a system  includes the same components as system  and also includes a firewall  that interfaces between mobile device  and both voice gateway  and web server . More specifically, firewall  is disposed between VoIP client  and voice gateway , and between browser  and web server . Thus, firewall  is shown in system  as having four connections.","In typical implementations, firewall  embeds the IP address of firewall  into communications transmitted through firewall  from mobile device . Firewall  thus shields the IP address of mobile device  from transmissions to voice gateway  and web server . Accordingly, if process  is used with system , then the IP address of firewall  will be detected by voice gateway adaptor  in operation  and by web server  in operation . This would cause voice gateway adaptor  to subscribe to a messaging channel identified by the IP address of firewall . Continuing with this example, in operation  browser adaptor  would not be able to subscribe to the same messaging channel unless browser adaptor  knew the IP address of firewall . A more general problem exists, however, for many implementations.","Typical implementations will have multiple mobile devices coupled to firewall . In those implementations, the IP address of firewall  does not provide a unique messaging channel. Consequently, messages published for modalities on a single device will be received by other devices as well.","In one solution, (i) VoIP client  provides a unique identifier to voice gateway  in operation , and (ii) browser  provides the unique identifier to web server  in operation . In that way, (i) voice gateway adaptor  can be configured to detect the unique identifier in operation , and (ii) web server  can be configured to detect the unique identifier in operation . Further, browser adaptor  can be configured to subscribe to the messaging channel identified by the unique identifier and created in operation .","A unique identifier may be, for example, a user ID, a device ID, the combination of an IP address for a device and an IP address of an associated firewall, or a unique hardware identifier. The unique identifier may be provided, for example, by embedding the unique identifier within the communication format in such a way that firewall  does not remove the unique identifier.","Referring to , a process  may be used to send a synchronization message. Process  may be used by various implementations including, for example, the implementations associated with system  and system .","Process  includes receiving a request for first-modality data (). The first modality data includes first content, with the first-modality data being configured to be presented using a first modality, and the request coming from a requestor and being received at a first device. First-modality data includes data that may be presented to a user using a first modality, or that may be responded to by the user using the first modality. Other modality data, such as second-modality data and third-modality data, may be defined similarly.","First-modality data may include, for example, a web page or other data structure, and such a data structure typically includes content. Content generally refers to information that is presented to a user or that a user may be seeking. A data structure also may include, for example, a header having header information, and other formatting information. As an example, a web page may include content that is displayed to a display device by a browser application, and the HTML of the web page may include header and formatting information that control aspects of the display and routing of the web page.","Process  includes sending a message allowing request of second modality data (). The message is sent from the first device for receipt by a second device, with the message being sent in response to receiving the request and including information that allows the second device to request second-modality data that includes second content that overlaps the first content, with the second-modality data being configured to be presented using a second modality. The content of the second-modality data may overlap the content of the first-modality data by having common content. For example, a HTML page (first-modality data) and a corresponding VXML page (second-modality data) have common content.","The information allowing a request of the second-modality data may be of various types. For example, the information may include (i) a pointer to the second-modality data (for example, a URL), (ii) a point to a pointer to the second-modality data (for example, a URL of a JSP, with the JSP including the URL of the second-modality data), or (iii) data allowing the address of the second-modality data to be determined (for example, the URL of a HTML page may be provided, from which the URL of the corresponding VXML page can be determined).","Further, the first-modality data and the corresponding second-modality data may be synchronized by presenting the first-modality data and the corresponding second-modality data to a user in such a manner that the user may respond to the overlapping content using either the first modality or the second modality.","Process  includes determining the information that is included in the sent message (). For example, if the URL of the first-modality data and the corresponding second-modality data are different, and the information includes the URL of the first-modality data, then the URL of the corresponding second-modality data may be determined by, for example, using a table look-up or an algorithm, or requesting the information from another component or a user.","Process  includes sending the first-modality data to the requestor (). One or more additional components may be involved in sending the first-modality data to the requestor, either upstream or downstream.","Process  includes receiving a request for the second-modality data from the second device (). The request may be, for example, (i) a request for second-modality data at a URL identified by the information included in the sent message, (ii) a request for second-modality data at a URL determined from the information included in the sent message, or (iii) a request for second-modality data at an address pointed to by a web page at a URL identified by or determined from the information included in the sent message.","Process  includes sending the second-modality data to the second device (). One or more additional components may be involved in sending the second-modality data to the second device, and may be involved either upstream or downstream of the sending. For example, a server may send data through a firewall to a gateway.","Process  includes sending a second message (). The second message is sent from the first device in response to receiving the request and for receipt by a third device. The second message includes second information allowing the third device to request third-modality data that includes third content that overlaps both the first content and the second content, with the third-modality data being configured to be presented using a third modality. The second information allows a third modality to synchronize with the first two modalities. For example, the first-modality data, the corresponding second-modality data, and the corresponding third-modality data may be synchronized by presenting each to the user in such a manner that the user may respond to the overlapping content using either the first modality, the second modality, or the third modality.","Process  includes receiving another request at the first device (). The other request comes from a second requestor and requests second first-modality data that includes fourth content. The second first-modality data is configured to be presented using the first modality. The other request may be from, for example, another user using a different device.","Process  includes sending another message from the first device (). The other message is sent in response to receiving the other request, and is sent for receipt by another device. The other message includes third information that allows the other device to request second second-modality data that includes fifth content that overlaps the fourth content, with the second second-modality data being configured to be presented using the second modality. Thus, for example, two users may each be using separate mobile communication devices to navigate a network such as the WWW, and each user's modalities may be synchronized. That is, the first user may have his\/her two modalities synchronized and the second user may have his\/her two modalities synchronized, but there need not be any synchronization between the two users. The second first-modality data and the second corresponding second-modality data may be synchronized by presenting the second first-modality data and the second corresponding second-modality data to a second user in such a manner that the second user may respond to the overlapping content using either the first modality or the second modality.","Process  may be illustrated by various implementations including, for example, implementations of system  or system .

Either user can respond to the information presented at the user's one or more respective devices, and thereby modify the information that is subsequently presented at both users' devices. In another implementation, one of the users does not have the capability or authorization to respond to the presented data, but can observe or monitor the data. Such an implementation may be useful where the observing user is a supervisor and the other user is an employee, or where the observing user is a trainee and the other user is a trainer (or vice versa). In another implementation, each user has a different modality, allowing, for example, a supervisor or trainer to respond to data using only voice and the employee or trainee to respond using only a browser interface.","The mobile devices  and , or other devices, need not use a VoIP client  and  to communicate with a voice gateway. In one implementation, a device performs feature extraction on the device and communicates the resulting data to a voice gateway. The feature extraction may be performed by one or more components constituting a feature extraction unit. The communicated data may be communicated over an IP connection, an HTTP connection, or otherwise, and the voice gateway may perform a recognition process using an appropriate grammar. By performing the feature extraction, rather than transmitting the voice directly, the device reduces the required bandwidth between the device and the voice gateway, and accordingly this implementation can be used effectively with lower-bandwidth communication links.","Referring again to system  of , in various implementations the function of firewall  may be performed by, for example, a proxy, a gateway, or another intermediary. Implementations may use multiple intermediaries in various configurations.","An implementation may include any number of modalities, and the number of modalities may be, for example, fixed, variable but determined, or variable and unknown. The number of modalities may be fixed beforehand in a system, for example, that is specifically designed to support mobile devices communicating with a browser and voice and using two modalities. The number of modalities also may be variable but determined during an initial connection or power-up by a mobile device by, for example, having the system query a user for the number of modalities to be used.","The number of modalities also may be variable and unknown. For example, each modality gateway that is connected or powered-up may detect the IP address or user ID and subscribe to the unique messaging channel on the appropriate messaging handler. After subscribing, each modality gateway may receive all messages published, with each message (i) indicating, for example, that one of the modalities has been provided with new data, and (ii) providing information allowing the other modalities to synchronize. In an implementation in which a server publishes the messages, as each modality gateway synchronizes, the new session may be associated with the unique messaging channel.","In implementations that include multiple servers, a first server may provide information to a second server, for example, to facilitate association of sessions. A server may be enabled to provide multi-modal synchronization service as well as standard single-modal service.","In implementations that include multiple messaging handlers, the components that publish the synchronizing messages may publish on all messaging handlers. Alternatively, the components that publish may communicate with each other to ensure that messages are published on all of the messaging handlers to which active modality gateways are subscribed.","The implementations and features described may be used to synchronize data that includes navigation commands and\/or non-navigation commands. Providing corresponding data for non-navigation commands may include, for example, having a component enter text, change a preference, or provide a focus in another modality.","Examples of various modalities include voice, stylus, keyboard\/keypad, buttons, mouse, and touch for input, and visual, auditory, haptic (including vibration), pressure, temperature, and smell for output. A first modality may be defined as including voice input and auditory output, and a second modality may be defined as including manual input and visual and auditory output. A modality also may be restricted to either input or output.","Interfaces for various modalities may include, for example, components that interact with a user directly or indirectly. Directly interacting components may include, for example and as previously described, a speaker. Indirectly interacting components may include, for example, a VoIP client that communicates with the speaker.","Various implementations perform one or more operations, functions, or features automatically. Automatic refers to being performed substantially without human intervention, that is, in a substantially non-interactive manner. Examples of automatic processes include a process that is started by a human user and then runs by itself, or perhaps requires periodic input from the user. Automatic implementations may use electronic, optic, mechanical, or other technologies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0344","num":"0343"},"figref":["FIG. 35","FIG. 35"],"b":["3500","3502","3504","3506","3508","3510","3512","3502","3502","3502","3502","3504","3506","3508","3502","3500"]},"In , an enterprise system, including a server system , is in communication with a mobile computing device  via a network . The server system  includes an inventory management system that stores and processes information related to items in inventory. The server system  may be, for example, a standalone system or part of a larger business support system, and may access (via the network ) both internal databases  storing inventory information and external databases  which may store financial information (e.g. credit card information). Although not illustrated for the sake of clarity, access to the internal databases  and the external databases  may be mediated by various components, such as, for example, a database management system and\/or a database server.","Locations , , and  and\/or associated storage containers may be associated with different item types. The storage location of an item may be associated with a location and\/or storage container by the server system . As a result, the server system  may provide the worker  or the manager  with, for example, suggestions on best routes to take to perform warehousing tasks.","For example, the server system  may provide the mobile computing device  with information regarding items that need to be selected from a storage area. This information may include one or more entries in a list of items that need to be selected. The entries may include a type of item to select (for example, \u00bc\u2033 phillips head screwdriver), a quantity of the item (for example, 25), a location of the item (that is, stocking location), and an item identifier code. Other information, such as specific item handling instructions, also may be included.","Warehouses such as the warehouse  often are very large, so as to store large numbers of products in a cost-efficient manner. However, such large warehouses often provide difficulties to the worker  attempting to find and access a particular item or type of item in a fast and cost-effective manner, for example, for shipment of the item(s) to a customer. As a result, the worker  may spend unproductive time navigating long aisles while searching for an item type.","Additionally, the size and complexity of the warehouse  may make it difficult for the manager  to accurately maintain proper count of inventory. In particular, it may be the case that the worker  fails to accurately note the effects of his or her actions; for example, failing to correctly note the number of items selected from (or added to) a shelf. Even if the worker  correctly notes his or her activities, this information may not be properly or promptly reflected in the inventory database .","These difficulties are exacerbated by the need for the worker  to use his or her hands when selecting, adding, or counting items, i.e., it is difficult for the worker  to simultaneously access items on a shelf and implement some type of item notation\/tracking system. Although some type of voice-recognition system may be helpful in this regard, such a system would need to be fast and accurate, and, even so, may be limited to the extent that typical warehouse noises may render such a system (temporarily) impracticable.","In consideration of the above, the warehouse system  allows the worker  multimodal access to warehouse and\/or inventory data, and automates warehouse functionality when possible and practical. Examples of these multimodal techniques and capabilities, as well as associated automated functionalities, are discussed in detail below with reference to the locations , , and  of the warehouse .","At the first location , for example, the worker  may use a tote  to collect, or \u201cpick,\u201d a first item  from a shelf . The mobile computing device  may be a portable device, such as a personal digital assistant (\u201cPDA\u201d) , that may be small enough to be carried by a user without occupying either of the hands of the user (e.g., may be attached to the user's belt). The PDA  may receive item entries from the enterprise system . In one implementation, all of the item entries may be downloaded at one time and stored as a \u201cpick list\u201d (that is, a list of items to select or pick) in the memory of the PDA . The pick list may list the item entries in a predetermined order associated with the location of the items in the storage area. For example, the order of the item entries may correspond to an item selection order that optimizes the efficiency of the path taken by the user as he or she picks items in the storage area.","Alternatively, the pick list may be stored in the server system , and item entries may be downloaded to the PDA  one at a time from the server system . In this case, the next item entry is not accessed until the current item entry has been processed (that is, the items corresponding to the entry have been picked). The item entries also may be provided to the PDA  a single entry at a time in a predetermined order associated with the location of the items in the storage area.","Inventory information also may be accessed by reading an RFID tag  on the first item . More specifically, the worker  may access information about first item  by interacting with a \u201csmart\u201d shelf  enabled with an RFID tag , RFID reader , and a bar code . For example, the smart shelf  may detect the absence of the item  using the RFID reader . The detection of the absence of an item  may be useful in situations related to high value items. For example, the worker  may query the server system  for the location of a possibly misplaced item. The smart shelf may be used to implement an automated inventory maintenance system. In addition, instead of (or along with) using RFID, the smart shelf  may be implemented using other sensors, such as, for example, a weight-based sensor or an image detection system.","Using the above techniques, along with those discussed in more detail below, the worker  may efficiently move throughout the warehouse  while collecting, counting, or distributing items. Results of these actions may be promptly and accurately reported to the server system , so that inventory information is accurate and up to date.","In another example, at the second location , the worker  may place a second item  into a bin  (or some other storage location, such as a shelf), in a process referred to herein as \u201cstocking.\u201d The worker may use a mounted screen  to receive information from the server system  about the item being stocked, where this information may include, for example, location and quantity information about the item. The location information may be displayed in the form of visual location information, such as, for example, a map. Again, the worker  also may use the PDA  to access or input information while performing the stocking functionality. Thus, items may be distributed throughout the warehouse in an efficient manner.","In a third example, at the third location  the manager  may take a count, or \u201cinventory,\u201d of items . The manager  may use the PDA  or the mounted screen  to update the internal warehouse databases  via the server system . The manager  also may receive directions from the server system  about how to conduct the inventory. For example, the server system  may instruct the manager  on which items to count, and\/or in what order.","The techniques described above for enabling multimodal capabilities may be implemented in the picking, stocking, or counting techniques just described. For example, the server system  may include a server  and a format determination system , which may generally represent, for example, the server system  and synchronization controller  of . Similarly, the format determination system may be implemented in the PDA , as shown, for example, in . Thus, and as described in more detail below, the worker  and\/or manager  may have simultaneous access to various different modes of input\/output, so as to increase the ease and efficiency of their duties.","For example, in the picking scenario, the worker  may use a voice-recognition functionality to notify the server system  of the worker's current location or job status. This ability allows the hands of the worker  to remain free for selecting items for placement into the tote . If voice input becomes non-preferred (for example, if the worker  enters a noisy area of the warehouse ), then other modalities will be available to the worker , such as the bar code  or stylus input into the PDA . Additionally, the worker  may print an order from the PDA  before entering a noisy warehouse area. As discussed below, similar advantages exist in, for example, stocking and counting scenarios. Additionally, the techniques described above for enabling multimodal capabilities may be implemented in various scenarios associated with a warehouse environment. For example, the techniques may be implemented in moving, shipping, and receiving scenarios.","Although  is a block diagram of a multimodal warehousing system, other implementations may include fewer, additional, and\/or different arrangements of components. For example, a mulitmodal warehousing system may include any apparatus that operates as an integration and communication platform to communicate between technologies including, for example, RFID, bar code recognition, voice recognition, mobile devices, mobile operating systems, pick-to-light systems, and automatic speech recognition (ASR).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0361","num":"0360"},"figref":["FIG. 36","FIG. 36"],"b":["3600","3514","3604","3514","3514","3606"]},"The user requests a job type in a chosen mode, e.g., using voice input (). The job type may include, for example, selection of item(s) for stocking, picking, or counting (taking inventory). The server system  then corresponds the information received from the user () to the information in the internal warehouse databases . For example, as described above with respect to  in the context of HTML and VXML, it may be necessary to correlate a response to a job type request received in HTML by way of a stylus input with response data formatted in VXML, so as to continuously provide the user with the option of using both stylus and voice inputs as the user communicates over time with the server system .","The server system  subsequently provides a location at which the user will perform functions related to the user-chosen job type (). The server system  provides this location information via multimodal interfaces () using the format determination system  in the server system , seen in .","For example, having received an HTML request for a picking job to obtain item  , the server  may output information related to the first location  in HTML and VXML. The worker  may indicate arrival at the first location  by stylus or voice input to the PDA , or by scanning the bar code , and placement of the item  into the tote  may be recognized by way of the RFID tag . Thus, more generally, the server system  accepts the result of the user's task in a user chosen one of a plurality of available modes (). The server system  updates related systems, for example, in the internal warehouse databases  and the external databases  (). The server system  then outputs the update to the user in multimodal interfaces (). For example, the server system  may update the database  to reflect that the item  has been removed.","If additional locations are needed (), the next location may be output to the worker . It should be understood, of course, that all locations may be provided to the worker  in the first instance, rather than iteratively.","More generally, multiple applications in warehouse environments may be built upon a multi-modal architecture. Such an architecture may include multiple gateways as described earlier. The modalities may be synchronized using the format determination system , and\/or other components performing various of its functions, may be located in one or more of the portable device, the server, or an intermediary, as described earlier. The enterprise system (described above) may correspond to a server, and data may be formatted in a mark-up language as is common in Internet applications, such as, for example Speech Application Language Tags (SALT) or XHTML+Voice (X+V), or in another format.","The multi-modal architecture and the ability to synchronize various modes of input and output provide a framework which is easily extendable to various application environments. In the warehouse environment, for example, a \u201cpage\u201d such as a pick list can be output to a user in various modes (for example, display and voice) and input relating to an item on the page can be input from various modes (for example, stylus, voice, bar code, RFID tag). Synchronization of the different modes may occur at, for example, one or more of a mobile device, an enterprise system, or an intermediary device.","In one example of the picking implementation, a web application on the server  is designed to provide the worker  with a pick list and associated instructions, and to receive feedback from the worker . The information of the pick list is provided in an HTML (hyper-text mark-up language) format to a browser on the PDA  for input\/output using the browser. The information of the pick list is also provided in a VXML (voice extensible markup language) format to a voice gateway that communicates with the mobile device for input\/output using a microphone and a speaker on the mobile device. The implementation also provides communication between the enterprise system and an RFID gateway. The RFID gateway receives input from an RFID reader on a cart, for example, indicating items that have been placed into the tote  on the cart. The web application queries the RFID gateway periodically to determine what items have been placed in the tote and updates the pick list information accordingly. The web application then provides the browser and the voice gateway with the updated pick list, and the browser and voice gateway update their output to the user accordingly.","In other implementations, the RFID gateway may send the information to the web application rather than being queried. The RFID gateway may receive the information of the pick list from the server and process the input from the RFID reader accordingly to update the pick list, and then send the updated pick list back to the server. The RFID gateway may, alternatively, simply send the input from the RFID reader to the web application (or some intermediary) and rely on the web application to integrate the input from the RFID reader with the pick list.","The RFID gateway may receive input from multiple RFID readers. The RFID gateway, or the web application, can maintain responsibility for associating a given RFID reader with a given tote or cart, for example. Such associations may be made, for example, during a setup procedure when a user is first given a pick list and a tote.","Communication between various of the gateways and the server may be facilitated or enabled by a message handler, such as the message handler  of . The modalities used for input and output in various environments and applications may be interchanged. Unless otherwise indicated, modalities available for one environment and application are also available for other environments and applications.","It should be understood from the above description that the multi-modal capabilities of the warehousing system  enable fast, convenient, and efficient implementation of the duties of the worker . Moreover, the system  enables real-time, accurate updating of inventory data.

Alternate implementations may incorporate many of the functions of server  into PDA , as discussed herein.","In the system , the warehouse picking process, or the process of placing\/counting inventory in a warehouse (such as in restocking returned items or replenishing the inventory of items), may begin with an instruction to the picker (i.e., worker ) via voice prompts to go to a certain aisle\/bin, and pick (or select or count) a certain quantity of items. The picker may be operating hands-free using, for example, a headset, ear bud, or other device. The picker may confirm a current location by reading out the numbers \/ on the bin, or by scanning the bar-coded label \/ on the bin. The picker may read instructions on the PDA  or an overhanging display associated with a particular bin or group of bins (i.e., it should be understood that the above-described multi-modal architecture(s) may split modalities for the same user across multiple devices).","The PDA  or display also may provide the picker with updated display information that acknowledges the picker's voice confirmation. For example, the display may show the pick-list with a checkmark next to the item on the pick-list that the picker just picked, and the checkmark may be placed on the display automatically in response to the picker's voice confirmation that that item was picked. Displaying a portion of the pick-list that includes more than the current item may be useful in determining which items have been picked and how many remain to be picked, and may reduce picking errors or the incidence of needing to repeat instructions. The picker may confirm using, for example, stylus\/keypad and\/or voice.","Various features, such as allowing the picker to operate hands-free or providing the picker with an updated display of the entire pick list, may allow the picker to operate more quickly, with fewer errors, and with fewer commands needing to be repeated.","In one implementation(s), voice confirm may be performed with phonetically \u2018distant\u2019 words. That is, instead of reading out the bin numbers, the picker may read out words (associated with and displayed on the bins, for example) that are phonetically distinctive to improve recognition thereof by the associated voice-recognition system.","An implementation of a particular pick list is depicted in . In , the worker  may hear: \u201cEnter your User ID\u201d when they see a first screen . If a resulting spoken ID is correct, a second screen  shown in  may result (there also may be other requirements, such as a password, entered using the stylus\/keypad). As the screen  comes up, the worker  may hear: \u201cPlease scan or enter the tote number.\u201d The worker  may then scan the barcode label  on the tote  by using the barcode scanner in the mobile device . The worker  also may enter the tote number  into a field  using the stylus or the keypad, and then say or click a first \u201cDone\u201d button . At a third screen  shown in , the worker  may hear: \u201cplease go to Aisle 01, Section 01, Bin 10,\u201d and may reply \u201cready\u201d or \u201cI am ready\u201d when in front of the right bin.","The device  may output the verbal command to \u201cPick 5 each.\u201d The worker  then picks the right quantity of the item and says \u201cdone.\u201d To confirm picking of the correct item, the worker  may read out check-digits or a check-word from under the relevant bin. These digits\/words may be phonetically as distinct from each other as possible for closely placed bins, and\/or may be random. They also may be changed regularly. The worker  may then continue line by line down the transfer order. The line item being worked may be highlighted (e.g., by color) with item description attached. The worker  also may click on a checkbox  in a left column of each line  item to indicate completion of the corresponding task(s).","Referring to , the worker  then sees a fourth screen  if the bin is expected to be empty after the worker  has picked, the worker  may be asked to confirm the same. The worker  may hear: \u201cIs the bin empty?\u201d and may then reply \u201cyes\u201d if it is, or \u201cno\u201d if it is not, in which case the worker  may then be asked: \u201cWhat's the observed quantity?\u201d The worker  may subsequently say or enter with stylus the number of items left in the bin into a field , and then say or click a second \u201cDone\u201d button  to continue. After completion of picking the items in a transfer order, a final screen , shown in , shows each picked item with a check mark  as a visual confirmation. The worker  may then say \u201cFinish\u201d or click a \u201cFinish\u201d button  to proceed to the next transfer order.","The items or cases being picked may be tagged using RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). The tote or cart into which the items are being placed may have an RFID reader built into it, as described above. In this case, the worker  may not need to confirm by saying \u201cDone\u201d at all. Instead, as soon as the items are placed into the tote, the tote reader reports the tags found. The application verifies that the correct items were picked and confirms the line item automatically when this condition is met.","A summary of such an automated implementation is described below. Specifically, the worker  picks items that are tagged with AutoID chips, such as, for example, RFID tags. The tote\/box into which the picked items are placed have at least one reader for these chips. The tote also may have a barcode or RFID tag to be used to identify the tote. As soon as the item is placed in the tote\/box, the reader confirms the item to the server and the worker  receives the next set of instructions.","In this implementation, the interaction, described above, relating to the screen of  may be as follows. The worker  hears: \u201cPlease go to Aisle 01, Section 01, Bin 10. (Pause) Pick 5 each.\u201d The worker  then picks the right quantity of the item and places them in the tote. After the automatic confirmation, the worker  may be instructed to the next line item. This process is repeated by continuing line by line down the transfer order. The line item being worked on may be highlighted, for example, in yellow on the PDA  with item description attached. As explained earlier, the display of the line item and, optionally, additional line items in the order (pick list), may help the worker  to remain oriented in the pick list and to remember the current instruction.","Generally, an RFID tag provides a mode of input that can speed the picking process and increase the accuracy of the picking process. One implementation includes the modes of voice, stylus\/display, bar code scanning (of bins or totes, for example), RFID tag reading (of products, bins, totes, for example). Other modes are possible, and each of the modes may interact with the system and update the system. The worker  may, for example, be allowed to use voice commands to update the pick list if an RFID tag is missing from a product.","Communication between the RFID tag  and the device  may follow a variety of protocols, several of which are described in the following implementations. Features of these implementations may be combined and augmented in various ways to achieve specific system requirements. In one implementation, RFID tag  is continually transmitting (as is RFID tag ), and device  responds to the strongest signal, making an implicit assumption that the strongest signal belongs to the RFID tag that is physically closest to device . In another implementation, device  requires a minimum received power before responding, the minimum received power indicating that the RFID tag is within a certain distance.","In another implementation, the RFID tag  does not transmit until queried by device . In this case, one such RFID tag is charged by the query and emits a response. Device  may query the RFID tag  using a variety of protocols. For example, device  may continuously send out a query signal that is directional, that has low-power, and\/or that has short range, such that RFID tag  will not have a high probability of receiving the query signal unless RFID tag  is within a minimum distance or is being placed into the tote . RFID tag  may be designed to wake-up in response to receiving the query signal, and also may have additional processing capability. The information that an RFID tag includes may vary with implementation or item, including, for example, an ID number alone, an item description, a manufacturing date or other manufacturing information, and\/or storage information. For example, an RFID tag on an item of food may include an ID number, an item description, a manufacturing date or a shelf-life, and a storage temperature.","As illustrated, the PDA  is in communication with a central system (server ) from which pick-lists are received. The PDA  may use a wireless network to upload information when a pick-list has been fully selected, and to download a new pick list. PDA  may use a wired network to achieve the same effect and may download\/upload information in batch mode for purposes of efficiency.","The bar codes illustrated in  may be used to achieve a variety of design objectives. For example, the PDA  may include a bar code reader to scan bar code  before first item  is placed into tote . The PDA  may then verify, for example, that the picker has gone to the correct bin. As another example, bar codes may be scanned during an inventory-verification process to indicate which bin is being inventoried. As another example, bar codes may be scanned during a restocking process to indicate the bin into which an item is being restocked.","Additional error-catching procedures may be built into the process of selecting an item. For example, a picker may be instructed to pick a certain item, and if device  detects a different item being placed into tote , then the PDA  may alert the picker, using, for example, a display message or audible instruction.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0395","num":"0394"},"figref":"FIG. 39","b":["3960","3760","3960","3962","3960","3964","3965","3960","3966","3960","3967","3960","3968","3756","3734","3968","3960","3969","3960"]},"The various communication modalities illustrated in the PDA  can be integrated so that as each is used to interact with information, such as, for example, a pick-list, the information is updated in the various output modalities and accessible in the various input modalities. As referred to above, this allows varied presentations of the information, and also allows for increased efficiency and reduced workflow errors.","For example, an individual may receive instructions over speaker  indicating the next item on the pick-list, and display  may simultaneously display several items including the current item. As the individual selects the required number of the current item, display  and\/or speaker  can provide an update on the remaining quantity to select for that item. The dual-presentation of the information can allow for increased efficiency and reduce errors.","As another example, the individual may have the option of responding in the mode that is simplest and\/or easiest in a given situation. For example, the individual may speak \u201cnext item\u201d into microphone  to advance the pick-list to the next item, or may use a stylus on display  to select the next item. Thus, hands-free operation is provided but not required, which may allow the individual to continue working while the individual is on the phone. As another example, an individual may scan a bar code using bar code scanner  or, if the bar code is hard to reach, for example, the individual can type in a bar code number using keyboard  or perhaps use a stylus with display . Thus, the individual will not be held up in those situations when the bar code is inaccessible.","Although RFID tags are used in the implementation just described, other implementations may use other types of Auto ID devices, such as, for example, bar codes. It should be clear that Auto ID tags need not be based on RF technology. For example, a tag can be implemented to be read by optical, magnetic, opto-magnetic, or other technology, either with or without physical contact between the tag and a reader. Moreover, the tag can be passive (containing no internal power source for communications and data transmission) or active; and it can have processing capacity or not. A tag will generally be a digitally identifiable tag, meaning that the tag has the property that a unique digital identity can be read directly from the tag using some kind of reader. Some digitally identifiable tags, such as, for example, a bar code or an optical character recognition (OCR) tag, also may be written or written to, and may offer extra advantages in cases where information needs to be made available without dependence on a communication network.","Items can be tagged with a unique identifier by any available item-level tagging technology, for example, active and passive Radio Frequency Identification (\u201cRFID\u201d) tags, barcodes, and tags that can be applied on a molecular basis. Tags can include various pieces of information, such as, for example, owner, price, lot number, and storage temperature. Tags also may include data acquired from sensors, such as, for example, the current temperature. Tags also may include rules or other information, such as, for example, a rule specifying that if the temperature of the corresponding item reaches a given temperature, perhaps for a specified amount of time, then the item is to be discarded.","Tags also may include a unique identification code for an associated item. In one implementation, the unique identification code is partitioned into several fields including an organization field, a product category field, and a serial number field. Thus, identical items residing in a common bin in a warehouse might have the same information in the organization field and the product category field, but have different serial numbers. In this way, a tag includes substantial information not unique to that tag (or its associated item) but also includes information that uniquely identifies the item.","Tag readers also may be varied, including, for example, RFID readers, barcode scanners, polymer tag readers, and sensors. The data on a tag may be automatically read by a tag reader. Such reading may be, for example, continuous, a periodic scan, or a scan that is triggered by, for example, a proximity sensor. Readers may be positioned, for example, on a manufacturing line, in storage locations, in shipping and receiving areas, at loading docks, within trucks or other moving vehicles, and also may be hand-held wireless-connected devices. Some examples of tag readers, in particular RFID readers, in particular contexts include RFID readers that are: (i) fixed to a shelf in a warehouse or store, (ii) fixed to a cart, (iii) hand-held and separate from a PDA, (iv) integrated into a PDA. RFID readers might be periodic, as mentioned above, by, for example, only being turned on at periodic intervals to collect data, and being turned off at other times. Several of these examples are described further in examples that follow.","Referring to , tote  includes an identification number  that uniquely identifies tote . First item  includes a bar code  and an identification number . Bar code  and identification number  each identify first item , but need not uniquely identify first item .

Voice gateway  communicates with PDA  in providing voice communications. Messaging handler  communicates with RFID gateway , voice gateway , PDA , and server  in synchronizing communications between the various gateways. The operations of messaging handler  and various gateways in several implementations should be understood based on the various multimodal architecture(s) described above.","As explained earlier, PDA  includes communications device  that communicates with server  and, through server , to reader , for example. In other implementations, PDA  may communicate directly with reader . Communications device  may be communicatively coupled to a variety of components in PDA , such as, for example, a browser, a browser adaptor, and a voice-over-IP (\u201cVoIP\u201d) client, as described above. Communications device  may, accordingly, include a variety of communications interfaces, hardware, and software, as appropriate to communicate with the various components to which communications device  is coupled.","Referring to , a process  is shown for stocking an item using, for example, the system of . As indicated below, implementations of process  use multiple modalities in performing the input and output operations, (although process  may be adapted in other implementations to use only a single modality). The description of process  below generally assumes that PDA  is used, but another device or system may be used in addition to, or in lieu of, PDA .","Process  includes putting an item into tote , or into, for example, a cart or other delivery vehicle (). The item may be put into tote  by, for example, an individual or a machine.","Process  includes inputting item information into PDA  or, for example, some other device or system (). The item information may include, for example, (i) a name or description of the item, such as, for example, label , (ii) a SKU, product number, or other identifying number, such as, for example, identification number , or (iii) the information conveyed by a bar code, such as, for example, bar code . Inputting the item information may include, for example, a user speaking the item information into microphone , scanning the item information with bar code scanner , and entering the item information using keyboard  or a stylus operating with display . In another implementation, an RFID reader receives the item information from an RFID tag on the item, with the RFID reader being located on tote , for example.","The modality used to input the item information into PDA  is one of multiple modalities used in process  (). As indicated throughout the discussion of process , various modalities may be used in several of the operations. Process  is characterized by the use of at least two different modalities, although as stated above, process  may be adapted to use only a single modality.","Process  optionally includes outputting the item information from PDA  after the item information is input (). For example, after a user scans bar code  on first item  (see ) using bar code scanner , PDA  may output the item information on display  or speaker  so that the user can receive the item information. The item information may be displayed throughout process  so that the user can refer back to the item information as needed.","Process  includes outputting a storage location for the item from PDA  (). For example, the storage location may be maintained on PDA  in a database, or the storage location may be received by PDA  from server  in response to PDA  sending the item information to server . PDA  may output the storage location to the user using, for example, display , speaker , or a printer (not shown).","Process  includes the user going to the storage location () and, optionally, inputting the storage location into PDA  when the user has arrived at the storage location and is ready to put the item into the storage location (). The user may input the storage location by, for example, speaking into microphone , using a stylus on display , using keyboard , and using bar code scanner . The user may input the storage location by inputting, for example, label , bar code , or identification number . Inputting the storage location may serve, for example, to verify that the user is at the correct storage location.","Process  includes the user placing the item from the cart into the storage location () and inputting to the system that the item has been placed into the storage location (). The user may provide the input () to the system by, for example, speaking into microphone  the phrase \u201cdone,\u201d using a stylus on display  to select a box labeled \u201cplaced,\u201d using keyboard  to enter the number of items placed, and using bar code scanner  to scan bar code . In implementations in which the user needs to place more than one of the particular item into the storage location, the user may provide a single input indicating the quantity placed or provide a separate input after each instantiation of the item is placed. An example of the latter includes a system in which first bin  includes a bin RFID reader that receives a transmission from each item placed into the bin. The bin RFID reader may be designed so that it only receives transmissions from items that are placed into first bin . In such an implementation, the bin RFID reader may transmit the received information through RFID gateway  to server , and server  may communicate all or part of the information to PDA  through messaging handler .","Other implementations of process  may omit or modify certain of the operations described above to accommodate, for example, different design goals or system architectures. As indicated at the beginning of the description of process , and suggested throughout by the various examples provided, PDA  may be replaced or supplemented by another device or system. Such another device or system may include, for example, an RFID reader, a detached bar code scanner, a voice input-output system, and a server.","In one implementation, the system includes a tote RFID reader, a shelf RFID reader, a voice input-output system, and a server, and the user receives voice instructions to go to a particular bin and to put certain items in the bin. In such an implementation, the user need not provide confirming input because the RFID readers may be able to determine the items that have been removed from the cart and to determine the bins into which the removed items have been placed. Further, in such an implementation, the system may detect placement errors in real-time and instruct the user with a voice command to correct the error.","As indicated earlier, process  can be used to stock an item on a shelf in a store as well as to stock an item in a bin in a warehouse. Various differences may exist between the environments, such as, for example, the shelves in a store may not have bar codes, and the exact implementation of process  may need to be altered to accommodate these differences.","In one implementation of stocking a shelf in a store, a store worker uses a headset communicating with server  through voice gateway , without the use of PDA . The store worker picks up various items to be restocked (), speaks the SKU of an item into the headset (), receives a voice command over the headset indicating the shelf where the item is to be stocked (), walks to the indicated shelf (), places the item on the shelf (), and speaks \u201cdone\u201d into the headset to inform server  that the item has been placed on the indicated shelf (). The store worker then repeats the process for each item that needs to be stocked.","In another implementation that does not use PDA , the store worker uses a bar code scanner along with the headset. The bar code scanner is detached from the headset and communicates with server  using a wireless connection. The store worker performs the stocking process in the same way as described above, except that the store worker scans a bar code on each item instead of speaking the SKU.","Referring to , a process  is shown for taking an inventory of an item using, for example, the system of . Process  may be used to put an item in a bin in a warehouse, on a shelf in a store, or in some other environment as well. As indicated below, implementations of process  use multiple modalities in performing the input and output operations, however process  may be adapted in other implementations to use only a single modality.

The indication may include, for example, (i) a name or description of the item, such as, for example, label , and (ii) a SKU, product number, or other identifying number, such as, for example, identification number . In a scenario in which the storage location contains multiple different items (for example, products), PDA  may step the user through each item serially, prompting the user to determine the inventory of each item in turn. Implementations also may allow the user to indicate that the storage location contains an additional type of item that was not output by PDA . PDA  may output the indication using, for example, any of the techniques described with respect to operations  or  above.","Process  includes the user counting the inventory of the item in the storage location () and inputting the inventory of the item into PDA  (). The user may input the inventory () by, for example, speaking a quantity into microphone , using a stylus on display  to select or otherwise enter a quantity, and using keyboard  to enter a quantity.","In certain implementations, inputting the inventory of the item also serves to verify that the user has counted the correct item. For example, the user may input the inventory by entering a quantity next to a particular item name or description in an inventory list displayed on display . As another example, the user may have a PDA with an integrated RFID reader that can be used to scan an entire shelf and to provide a description of the item(s) on that shelf as well as a count of the item(s) on that shelf. Hand-held RFID readers (whether or not integrated into a PDA) may be used to perform various data entry or input operations described throughout this disclosure.","In other implementations, a separate operation may be used to verify that the user is counting the correct item. Such a separate operation may include, for example, any of the techniques described with respect to operation  above. As another example, such a separate operation also may include, for an item with an RFID tag, selecting one of the item from the storage location and placing the item within receiving range of an RFID reader.","Process  may include further operations, such as, for example, PDA  (i) processing the inventory data that was input in operation  or providing the inventory data to a server or remote computer system, (ii) providing an indication of whether the inventory data agrees with a computer record, and (iii) providing an instruction to proceed to the next item in the storage location or to the next storage location.","Certain warehouse environments may include shelf RFID readers, in which case the inventory of items having RFID tags may be continually updated with real-time data. Process  may be used in these environments to verify the inventory indicated for one or more items.","Various inventory adjustments may be performed, including, for example, placing an order for items that have a low inventory. Inventory adjustments may be performed independently of an inventory process and may be based on, for example, a computer record of inventory and of the volume and timing of sales. Process  may be used to ensure that the computer record of inventory is accurate and, thus, that the reordering process is based on accurate information.","As indicated earlier, process  can be used to inventory an item on a shelf in a store as well as to inventory an item in a bin in a warehouse. Various differences may exist between the environments, such as, for example, the shelves in a store may not have bar codes, and the exact implementation of process  may need to be altered to accommodate these differences.","In one implementation, a store owner may receive a voice command over a headset indicating a shelf for which items are to be inventoried (). The store worker may proceed to the indicated shelf (), scan a bar code on the shelf (), receive a voice command over the headset indicating the item to be inventoried (), count the indicated item (), and speak into the headset the inventory on hand of that item (). The store worker may then receive another command indicating the next item to be inventoried on that shelf, or indicating the next shelf for which items are to be inventoried.","Process  describes a process for inventorying an item. As indicated earlier, if process  is repeated, the inventory may be taken, for example, for a shelf that contains multiple items, for an area that contains multiple shelves, and for a warehouse or store that contains multiple areas. Accordingly, process  may be used, for example, to perform an annual physical inventory of an entire warehouse, or to perform some form of cycle counting. Cycle counting can be defined as any regularly recurring inventory (counting) program that counts less than the entire physical inventory each time. Many variations of cycle counting can be used or created, such as, for example, counting each item once per year or counting certain items more frequently than others.","Yet another inventory process that can be used with the systems and configurations described herein is referred to as a \u201cshoot the hole\u201d process. In the \u201cshoot the hole\u201d process, an individual identifies empty bins\/shelves and informs the system. The individual may be, for example, a picker, a stocker, an inventory-taker, or another person that is working in the facility. The individual may use a bar code scanner or other modality to tell the system that a bin is empty, and a user interface may be adapted to receive this information or to prompt the individual for this information. After the individual identifies an empty bin, the system may respond with an indication that, for example, a restocking order needs to be placed, a restocking order has already been placed, or inventory for restocking has been received and is waiting to be put in the bin. The \u201cshoot the hole\u201d inventory process is also referred to as \u201cad hoc\u201d cycle counting because less than the entire physical inventory is inventoried in each count, but the items are not necessarily counted in a regularly recurring manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0435","num":"0434"},"figref":["FIG. 43","FIG. 43","FIG. 35","FIG. 35"],"b":["4300","3500","4300","3514","3514","3517","3516","3517","4300","3514","3530","4300"]},"Operators of retail environments such as the one represented by the store  generally seek to facilitate the ease with which customers may find, access, and purchase products for sale. Difficulties and inconveniences experienced by the customers may result in fewer or no sales being completed by the customers. In contrast, providing customers with a fast and convenient shopping experience, as well as providing sufficient product information to the customers, may result in greater sales, as well as customer loyalty.","For example, customers who cannot find a desired product, or cannot access information about the product, may leave the store without making a purchase. Similarly, customers who spend inordinate amounts of time searching for products, or waiting to complete a transaction for the products, may not return to the store for future purchases. Often, product information may be available to the store operators, but may be inaccessible to the customer while in the store. Moreover, even when accessed by store operators, the product information should be accurate and up-to-date, so that the operator may ensure that products are ordered, priced, and stocked in a timely manner.","Implementations described below facilitate a customers' shopping experience by providing information to and about the customer.
