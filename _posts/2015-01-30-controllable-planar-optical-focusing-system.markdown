title: Controllable planar optical focusing system
abstract: An optical device has a first metasurface disposed over a substrate. A high-contrast pattern of the first metasurface is operable for modifying, over a first phase profile, a phase front of an incident light beam. A second metasurface, is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface with a second high-contrast pattern and operable for shaping, over a second phase profile, the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer, in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts, is disposed in a controllably changeable separation between the first and second metasurfaces. Controllably changing the separation between the first and the second metasurfaces by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance significantly greater than the first distance.

More particularly, an example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light.","Example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light. The optical systems focus incident beams of light at typical optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) wavelengths and electromagnetic radiation spanning other wavelength ranges (radio, microwave, x-ray).","In an example embodiment, the optical system comprises at least a pair of high contrast layers, each disposed over a planar surface opposing that of the other across a separation. The high contrast layers are referred to herein by the term \u201cmetasurfaces.\u201d As used herein, the term \u201chigh contrast\u201d refers to a contrast between the refractive index of materials from which the metasurfaces are made and the refractive index of materials surrounding (or otherwise disposed in close proximity to the metasurfaces). The optical system is operable for adjusting a location of its focal plane. The location of the focal plane is adjustable by varying dimensions of the separation between the parallel metasurfaces by small amounts.","Example embodiments relate to implementation of optical systems at low cost using mass production and standard microfabrication techniques, e.g., as used in manufacture of silicon chips and related electronics. Light weight optical systems may thus be implemented with very low profiles, relative to typical optics using conventional focus components. Example embodiments relate to implementation of miniaturized and implantable microscopes and endoscopes, and to 3D laser lithography and stereolithography, which comprise the disclosed optical system operable for adjusting its focal plane.","An example embodiment relates to an optical device comprising a substrate and a first metasurface disposed upon the substrate. The first metasurface comprises a first high-contrast pattern operable for modifying, over a first phase profile, a phase front of a narrow-band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface.","A second metasurface is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high-contrast pattern operable for shaping, over a second phase profile, the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer, in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface.","The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface, relative to the first metasurface, in as direction of propagation of the incident light beam. Providing a change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point.","Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance, wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.","The separation may comprise an adjustable distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface. The adjustable distance may be adjustable tunably. For example, the adjustable distance may be adjustable by tuning a modulation signal directed to the optical device, to which the device is responsive. The significant change in the focus point may comprise a multiple of up to three orders of magnitude (1000:1) relative to the change in the separation.","In an example embodiment, changing the separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may be implemented tunably using piezoelectric and\/or electrostatic actuation and\/or modulation. The separation distance between the first metasurface and the second metasurface may also be implemented using MEMS related actuation and\/or modulation approaches.","The substrate may comprise silicon. The optical device may also comprise at least a first membrane disposed over the substrate wherein the first metasurface is disposed over the first membrane. Optionally, the optical device may also comprise a second membrane. One (or more) of the metasurfaces may be disposed on a substrate, which comprises an optically transparent material. The second metasurface is disposed over the second membrane.","The first membrane and\/or the second membrane may comprise a free standing thin film material such as silicon nitride. The first membrane and\/or the second membrane may also comprise silicon oxide.","The narrow band (and\/or the monochromatic light) may comprise a portion of an infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region over which the optical device is operable. The narrow band and\/or monochromatic light may also comprise a portion of an electromagnetic radiation spectrum over which the device may be operable at a radio, microwave, x-ray or other frequency region.","The first metasurface and\/or the second metasurface may comprise a periodic or quasi-periodic array of elements, each of which comprises a sub-wavelength dimension, which is smaller than a shortest wavelength of the narrow band.","A refractive property of the first metasurface and\/or the second metasurface may relate to a parameter associated with the periodic or quasi-periodic arrays of each. For example, the parameter associated with the periodic or quasi-periodic array may comprise a size and\/or a shape of a lattice feature of the periodic or quasi-periodic array. The parameter associated with the periodic or quasi-periodic array may also comprise a size and\/or a shape of one or more of a plurality of unit elements, which comprise the lattice.","An example embodiment is also described in relation to a process for fabricating an optical device. The process may relate to silicon based micro-fabrication technologies.","Further, an example embodiment is described in relation to an optical system. The optical system may be disposed in various apparatus, such as miniaturized microscopes, endoscopes, and telescopes. These apparatus may be implantable in a body of a medical patient or a physiological subject. The optical apparatus may also relate to stereolithography and 3D laser lithography.","Example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical systems operable for controllably focusing light. The optical systems focus incident beams of light at typical optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) wavelengths and may also be operable with electromagnetic radiation spanning other wavelength ranges.","An example embodiment is described in relation to an optical system comprising at least a pair of high contrast layers, each disposed over a planar surface opposing that of the other across a separation. The high contrast layers are referred to herein by the term \u201cmetasurfaces.\u201d Example embodiments relate to optical systems operable for adjusting a location of their focal planes. The location of the focal plane is adjustable by varying dimensions of the separation between the parallel metasurfaces by small amounts.","Devices with rapidly tunable focal length include microlenses with adjustable focus. Such microlenses function typically tune their foci by changing their geometrical characteristics or refractive index profiles. Conventional approaches to tuning the foci of microlenses have included changing the contact angle of a liquid droplet and a solid surface using a process related to electro-wetting [Ref.1], and modifying profiles of a liquid droplet [Ref.2] or a polymer droplet [Ref.3] by introducing variation into their volumes.","Variation has typically been introduced into the volumes of liquid and polymeric droplets by increasing or decreasing the volume of liquid pumped into the droplet, or by expanding droplets and\/or contracting droplets by adding or removing thermal energy therefrom. For example, heating the droplets adds thermal energy thereto and thus expands their volumes. Alternatively or additionally, cooling the liquid or polymer material of the droplets removes thermal energy therefrom, and thus reduces the droplet volumes by contraction.","Another conventional approach creates a graded index profile in a liquid crystal layer using a non-uniform electrostatic field [Ref.4] to which the layer is exposed. Although using these conventional approaches allow microlenses with tunable focal lengths, the lenses thus produced remain too large, and the tuning process remains too slow, for practical use with some significant modern optical and electro-optical applications.","In contrast, an example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to optical systems having low profiles and fast focal length tuning, at speeds sufficient to support modern optical and electro-optical applications. An example embodiment relates to an optical device comprising a substrate and a first metasurface disposed upon the substrate. The first metasurface comprises a first high-contrast pattern operable for modifying, over a first phase profile, a phase front of a narrow-band or monochromatic collimated light beam incident to the first metasurface.","A second metasurface is disposed over a plane parallel to the first metasurface. The second metasurface comprises a second high-contrast pattern operable for shaping, over a second phase profile, the phase front of the modified phase front of the incident light beam into a converging spherical phase front. A spacer layer, in which the modified phase front of the incident light beam diffracts is disposed in a separation between the first metasurface and the second surface.","The separation relates to a focus point of the converging spherical phase front beyond the second metasurface, relative to the first metasurface, in as direction of propagation of the incident light beam. Providing a change in the separation causes a corresponding significant change in the focus point.","Controllably changing the controllable separation between the first metasurface and the second metasurface by a first distance correspondingly changes the position of the focus point of the converging spherical phase front by a second distance, wherein the second distance exceeds the first distance to a significant degree.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","11","12","17","18","10","11","12"]},"The input beam comprises a collimated beam of monochromatic or narrow-band light.

Embodiments are not limited to such optical wavelengths however. On the contrary, example embodiments may be implemented in which the incident beam comprises electromagnetic radiation spanning any other wavelength range (radio, microwave, x-ray).","The first metasurface functions as a phase mask and modifies the phase front of the input beam. The beam with the modified phase front travels the distance between the two metasurfaces and undergoes diffraction as it propagates. The second metasurface also functions as a phase mask, but it has a different phase profile from the first metasurface. The purpose of the second metasurface is to focus the light incident on it, so it modifies the phase front of the beam and shapes it in the form of a converging spherical phase front. The phase mask of the first metasurface is chosen such that the light passed through it diffracts in such a way that when the separation between the two metasurfaces is changed by a small amount, the phase front of the light at the second metasurface plane is modified significantly and in a such a way that the location of the focus is moved by a large amount.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B"],"b":["21","22"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["23","21","22","23","21","22","23"],"sub":"0"},"The example input beam has a wavelength 2=930 nm and comprises a Gaussian input with a waist radius of 30 \u03bcm, propagating along the z axis.
