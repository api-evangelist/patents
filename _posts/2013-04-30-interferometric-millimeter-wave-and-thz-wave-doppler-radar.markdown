title: Interferometric millimeter wave and THz wave doppler radar
abstract: A mixerless high frequency interferometric Doppler radar system and methods has been invented, numerically validated and experimentally tested. A continuous wave source, phase modulator (e.g., a continuously oscillating reference mirror) and intensity detector are utilized. The intensity detector measures the intensity of the combined reflected Doppler signal and the modulated reference beam. Rigorous mathematics formulas have been developed to extract bot amplitude and phase from the measured intensity signal. Software in Matlab has been developed and used to extract such amplitude and phase information from the experimental data. Both amplitude and phase are calculated and the Doppler frequency signature of the object is determined.

At microwave frequencies, Doppler sensors are usually realized through the use of quadrature mixers. Microwave based sensors have inherently lower sensitivity (greater than micrometer displacements) than their optical counterparts. High frequency optical Doppler sensor has high sensitivity and lower interference with common consumer electronics. Further, high frequency optical Doppler sensor is more directional and provides for more compact structures. However, high-frequency optical sensors have several drawbacks, such as difficulty with alignment and diffraction loss due to surface roughness. Therefore, optical Doppler sensors are not desirable for applications involving the detection of complex objects. Furthermore, optical wavelengths cannot penetrate through many common materials such as fabrics, plastics and insulation.","As both low frequency microwaves and high frequency optics have advantages and disadvantages, certain systems have attempted to use the intermediate frequency spectrum between the low-frequency microwaves and the high-frequency optics. For example, quadrature mixer based mmW Doppler radar has been recently studied for remote monitoring of vital signs by the authors' group.","One embodiment relates to a Doppler system for detecting an object. The system comprises a continuous wave source. Further, a beam splitter is provided. The system also includes a phase modulator and an intensity detector.","In another embodiment, a method of detecting an object is provided. A continuous wave beam is emitted. The continuous wave beam is split into an object beam and a reference beam. The object beam is directed to the object. The reference beam is directed to a phase modulator. The phase of the reference beam is modulated to generate a modulated reference beam. An intensity detector receives the modulated reference beam and a reflected Doppler signal from the object.","In another embodiment, a method of processing Doppler information is provided. A Doppler signal is received from an object. A reference signal is modulated. The combined intensity of the Doppler signal and the modulated reference beam is measured. The measured combined intensity is separated into Low-Frequency-Band and High-Frequency-Band signals. The amplitude and phase of the reflected signal from the object are determined. The Doppler frequency signature of the object based upon the determined amplitude and phase is determined.","Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the present disclosure may be set forth from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary of the present disclosure and the following detailed description are exemplary and intended to provide further explanation without further limiting the scope of the present disclosure claimed.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and made part of this disclosure.","In one implementation, a universal, mixerless high frequency interferometric Doppler radar is provided. The implementation employs the optical interferometry technique that requires no quadrature mixer. It also differs from other conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometry in that it adopts a continuously oscillating reference mirror to modulate the Doppler signal. By doing this, both amplitude and phase can be extracted from only one intensity measurement In a particular implementation, millimeter wavelengths and THz wavelengths are utilized with optical interferometry technique by using a CW (Continuous Wave) source and an intensity detector. A beam splitter is further utilized and a phase modulator. The detected intensity is the coherent addition of the reference beam and the reflected signal, which, in one implementation, features a fast reference modulation on a slow modulation induced by the object. As further set forth below, rigorous mathematical formulations are provided to solve for both the amplitude and the phase simultaneously. Once the phase is known, Fourier transform is then used to study the Doppler frequency signature of a moving object. Examples are also set forth below a 94 GHz prototype and a 0.15 THz prototype utilized in experimental tests using a ball pendulum target with full-swing distance much smaller than a wavelength to study the performance of the proposed interferometric Doppler radar.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["101","140","102","110","111","160","120","150","130","140","160"]},"For broadband Doppler signature, the reference arm frequency needs to oscillate at a frequency that is higher than twice the Doppler frequency of the object to avoid overlapping of the LFB and HFB signals; while for narrowband Doppler signature (e.g., moving cars and aircrafts etc.), the reference arm frequency only needs to >2\u00d7 the bandwidth of the Doppler signature interferometric Doppler radar relies upon the effect of a phase modulator, operating at 2Fto modulate the Doppler spectrum to its HFB and its LFB spectrum. The unknown amplitude and phase are derived from the measured HFB and LFB.","One implementation of the Doppler radar provides a system without the need for mixer based homodyne or heterodyne radar. For implementations utilizing mmW, a mmW Gunn Oscillator may be used. Implementations can also be provided at the THz gap. For example, as THz source either a Backward Wave Oscillator (BWO) or a THz Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) could replace the mmW Gunn Oscillator and as intensity detector either a pyroelectric detector or a Hot Electron Bolometer (HEB) can be used. The mmW\/THz interferometric Doppler radar has many applications, including vibration\/displacement measurement (down to few \u03bcm), coating\/thin film thickness measurement, dielectric constant characterization, phase-sensitive chemicals spectroscopy and phase-contrast Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) of dielectric materials.","In one implementation, the phase modulator  is a mechanically vibrating mirror, which is different from the stationary steeping Mach-Zehnder type interferometry such as FTIR. In another implementation, the phase modulator is an electronically controllable dielectric material. Examples of such phase modulators  include, but are not limited to, Pockel cells, liquid crystal modulators, and the like. Further, it is possible to utilize thermally induced refractive index changes or length changes, such as of an optical fiber or induced length changes by stretching.","Mathematically, the intensity detector detects the combined reflected signal from the object E(t) and the reference beam E(t), plus the background E,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["E","obj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"msub":{"mi":["E","ref"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":["+","+"],"msub":{"mi":["E","b"]}},{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["a","obj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["j\u03d5","obj"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}}},{"msub":{"mi":["a","ref"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["j\u03d5","ref"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}}},{"msub":{"mi":["a","b"]},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","msub":{"mi":["j\u03d5","b"]}}}],"mo":["+","+"]}],"mo":"="}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{}],"sub":["obj","ref","b ","obj","ref","b ","obj","ref","b","obj","b ","obj","b","ref","b ","ref","b","ref","obj","ref","obj"],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["I","t","E","t","=a","t","a","+a","a","t","a","t","a","a","t","a","a","t","t","t"],"sup":["2","2","2","2"]},"The intensity signal given in Eq.
