As a result, it is critical for mobile operators to invest strategically in their network assets allowing them to launch new services and go beyond flat-rate data plans. In current networks, various pieces of information (such as the location of a subscriber, the reachability of a subscriber, etc.) are distributed in various network elements throughout the network.

NMS  may further collect device statistics and may maintain an archive of previous network statistics including problems and solutions that were successful in the past. If faults recur, NMS  may search the archive for the possible solutions. Analytics module  analyzes network traffic received by server  in real-time and provides for a view of network use within communication system . Analytics module  may include analysis, profiling, modeling, and database functions.","In accordance with one or more embodiments, network, service, and subscriber abstraction module  is configured to collect information or data from various network elements within communication system  and abstract the data by examining one or more correlating factors between collected data such as an Internet Protocol (IP) address or mobile subscriber identifier, combine the correlating data together based upon the correlating factors into a consistent store of data which can be later accessed and utilized.

Operator OSS infrastructure  supports processes such as maintaining network inventory, provisioning services, configuring network components, managing faults, taking orders, processing bills, and collecting payments. In a particular embodiment operator OSS infrastructure  may include billing, customer care, service fulfillment, and service assurance components. The billing component may include retail billing which enables operators to generate a customer bill based on service plan, usage, promotions, and other OSS interactions, and enabling third parties to leverage operator billing systems for charging a subscriber such as for an in-app purchase that appears on the customer's bill, allowing third party Wi-Fi providers to bill the subscriber, or service delivery platform interaction (e.g., ringtone download). The billing component may also enable an analytical based approach to understanding subscriber billing trends as a means of providing information to an operator that might facilitate service creation, campaign creation, pricing, etc. This may be for a prepaid user, in which case the billing system also manages quota\/balance in real-time, converged (across multiple access types), and postpaid.","The customer care component may include customer interaction systems to provide channels for customer self-service and direct machine-to-customer information, customer relationship management to provide sophisticated marketing, sales and operational support to the service provider agents who interact with the customer, and subscriber management software to support care agents and direct customer interaction.

There is no single entity in the network that can aggregate the information present in the different network elements, correlate the information, and feed that information to various external entities.","The current challenges for creating new services include: Long time to availability\u201412-18 months to enable services; service silos\u2014building one service doesn't always help build the second service; personalization\u2014each service has unique requirements; No killer application\u2014market conditions vary between operators and regions; lag in response times\u2014can't quickly create or modify services in response to market trends. While operators have significant challenges, they also have significant market advantages and unique value. For example, application developers are clamoring to leverage information only available in the network. Application provider challenges include: Restricted or no access to the network; no real time access; do not want to understand the operator topology; difficult to correlate multiple sources\/vendors; and no standard interface to carrier applications\/services.","Mobile operators have the opportunity to leverage the key asset in their networks\u2014real-time subscriber, application, and network intelligence\u2014and build an architecture that harvests this intelligence to monetize the network. Various embodiments described herein provide a monetization architecture that increases service velocity, quickly enabling multiple use cases, while providing a platform for application developers to leverage the network. This may provide increased revenue for both the operator and application developers, while enhancing the subscriber experience.","At least one embodiment solves the problem of abstracting out data from different sources and organizing the data into a coherent format that can be translated into one or more external protocols such as HTTP, XMPP, diameter, etc. Existing systems are not capable of correlating data from multiple sources, perform analytics and present the information in a coherent format in a network wide scalable way. In addition, existing systems require more than one entity to perform similar functions, but still lack scalability to provide network scale solutions.","In various embodiments, network, service, and subscriber abstraction module  may further function as a data flow engine that incrementally correlates the data from various sources to extract useful network-wide information. This along with high horizontal scalability allows network, service, and subscriber abstraction module  to provide network level abstraction. In various embodiments, network, service, and subscriber abstraction module  collects network wide data, performs a set of transformations on the data and correlates the data to make it presentable in a coherent format that can be used by entities outside network, service, and subscriber abstraction module .","In one or more embodiments, network, service, and subscriber abstraction module  is built as a cluster of physical processing nodes in which each node in the cluster holds several logical processing entities. A cluster is made up a logical grouping of one or more nodes. A node is a physical processing element within a cluster with processor resources, memory resources, and storage resources. The logical entities on each node in the system are termed data control tasks (DCT's) and data processor tasks (DPT's). Accordingly, each node has a DCT process and multiple DPT's based upon availability of computational resources. The DCT is a logical entity in each node responsible for routing of the data to appropriate data processing elements that are the DPT's. The DCT, in addition to routing of the data, may also perform any protocol normalization by converting protocol transactions (HTTP, Diameter, XMPP, Netflow, IPFix, etc.) into internal logical operations understood by the DPT's. The DPT's act as repositories of data as well as the processing elements that perform distributed operations on the data. The DPT's support a number of primitive operations that can be combined together via configuration information to performs complex operations. In one or more embodiments, the configuration itself can be performed via a command line interface or a web interface.","In particular embodiments, communication system  provides for a flexible mobile architecture\/framework that enables operators to quickly create and modify use cases for monetization by harvesting, abstracting, and monetizing intelligence from the network.
