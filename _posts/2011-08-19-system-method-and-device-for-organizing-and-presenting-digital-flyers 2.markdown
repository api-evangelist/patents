The details and particulars of these aspects of the technology will now be described below, by way of example, with reference to the attached drawings.","Flyer Stack\u2014Overview","In the present disclosure, digital flyers from multiple merchants are organized into what is referred to as a flyer stack. There may be one or more flyer stacks with each flyer stack having a particular stack definition that defines the relatedness of the contained flyers. For example, one flyer stack may be for groceries while another flyer stack may be for electronics. Viewed another way, the flyer stack can be analogized with a bundle of paper flyers that arrives in the mailbox. However, unlike these junk mails, the flyer stack in the present disclosure contains highly relevant and dynamic digital flyers that allows for easy inter-flyer and intra-flyer navigation and search.","Turning to , a method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure is disclosed. The method includes creating at least one flyer stack having at least one stack definition (i.e.  in ). The stack definition assigned to the flyer stack gives context to the flyer stack which is used by the system to assign the available digital flyers to one or more of the at least one flyer stack. For example, in one embodiment as shown in , three types of flyer stacks may be created. The first type of flyer stacks may be \u201cfeatured\u201d stacks that showcase digital flyers that deserve special attention. Within the first type of flyer stack, there may be a stack for \u201cpopular\u201d flyers, \u201crecommended\u201d flyers, or \u201cnew\u201d flyers. In other words, the \u201cpopular\u201d stack would have a stack definition of \u201cfeatured\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d; the \u201crecommended\u201d stack would have a stack definition of \u201cfeatured\u201d and \u201crecommended\u201d; and, so on.","Similarly, a second type of flyer stacks may be created.  illustrates the second type of flyer stack being a number of category-based stacks such as groceries, electronics and sports. As with the \u201cfeatured\u201d stacks, the stacks in the \u201ccategory\u201d type would have a stack definition of \u201ccategory\u201d and \u201cgroceries\u201d, \u201ccategory\u201d and \u201celectronics\u201d, and \u201ccategory\u201d and \u201csports\u201d, respectively.  further illustrates a third type of flyer stack that includes a \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d stack for flyers that do not belong to any other stack. The flyer stack arrangement shown in  is for illustrative purposes only and it will be understood that any number of stacks may be created depending on the need.","Using the stack definition, digital flyers are assigned to one or more of the flyer stacks based on the contextual relevancy of the digital flyer (i.e.  in ). In one embodiment, each digital flyer may be assigned a relevancy score for each flyer stack based on the content of the digital flyer. Using the relevancy score, the digital flyer would be assigned to the appropriate flyer stack.","With the digital flyers assigned to the flyer stacks, the availability of each digital flyer within each flyer stack is determined based on location and timing relevancy of the digital flyer (i.e.  in ). For example, a digital flyer that is too remote from the viewer's location would be made unavailable. In another example, a digital flyer that has expired would be made unavailable.","The system then ranks the digital flyers in the flyer stack based on a flyer score (i.e.  in ). Thus, the digital flyers are organized (i.e. assigned, availability assessed, and ranked\/ordered) into at least one flyer stack. The organized information may be hereinafter referred to as flyer stack information. The details of the above method will now be described.","Flyer Stack\u2014Contextual Relevancy","Assigning the digital flyer to one or more flyer stacks involves determining the contextual relevancy of the digital flyer (i.e.  in ). In one embodiment, where there are category-based flyer stacks, a relevancy score may be determined for each flyer stack based on the content of the digital flyer. The relevancy score may be determined in a variety of ways. For example, the publisher or the merchant may explicitly assign a relevancy score to the digital flyer using a user interface. In another example, the relevancy score may be determined by evaluating the space occupied by each section on the digital flyer, number of items in each section and\/or viewer behaviour on search terms.","To further elaborate on the last example, suppose a digital flyer has sections \u201cmeats\u201d, \u201cproduce\u201d and \u201cfruits\u201d. For example, the sections may be defined using polygon mapping information as described in the above referenced commonly owned patent applications. Based on these sections, it may be determined that the relevancy score for \u201cgroceries\u201d stack is 100 while 0 for other flyer stacks. However, some digital flyers may include diverse sections, especially for merchants that carry a variety of items. In such a case, it may be beneficial to consider the number of items in each section to assess in which flyer stack the digital flyer should belong. In this scenario, it may be determined that the relevancy score for \u201cgroceries\u201d stack is 70 while the \u201celectronics\u201d stack is 20. Furthermore, in another embodiment, the relevancy score may be adjusted based on viewer behaviour to a search term. For example, if a viewer searches for \u201celectronics\u201d and selects the aforementioned digital flyer, then the relevancy score may be adjusted to reflect this preference. It will be understood that the relevancy score may be a percentage or an absolute number or any other value from a reasonable scale. It will also be understood that the digital flyer may belong to none or one or more than one flyer stacks based on the determined relevancy score.","In an embodiment that includes \u201cfeatured\u201d stacks, a different mechanism may be used to determine the contextual relevancy of the digital flyer. For example, if the embodiment includes a \u201crecommended\u201d stack, the following exemplary implementations may be used. An implementation may include incorporating one or more top ranking digital flyers from each category stack. In another implementation, a round robin style selection may be used to ensure that the \u201crecommended\u201d stack contains a mixture of digital flyers. In a further implementation, a threshold may be assigned to each category of digital flyers. Each time a digital flyer is selected from the category, the threshold for that category may be increased to ensure diversity in the \u201crecommended\u201d stack.","In a further embodiment, digital flyers not assigned to any flyer stack may be considered for inclusion into a remainder or \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d stack as shown in .","Flyer Stack\u2014Availability","A digital flyer may be assigned to none or one or more flyer stacks based on the content of the digital flyer. However, the digital flyer assigned to a flyer stack does not necessarily mean that it is available to a particular viewer. In this embodiment, the availability of the digital flyer is determined based on the location and timing relevancy of the digital flyer (i.e.  in ).","Flyers are often localized in nature as promotion availability and pricing varies. For example, a particular store location may be having an inventory clear-out while the same chain store at a different location may not be participating in this clear-out sale. In this particular embodiment, the availability of the digital flyer is determined based on the location of the viewer. Location of the viewer may be determined using a variety of ways, for example, through explicit entry, device specific API functions, IP geo-location and account profiles.","In one implementation, availability may be determined based on the viewer's location in relation to a pre-defined distribution zone. If the digital flyer is associated with a particular distribution zone, the digital flyer will be made available if the viewer is in that particular distribution zone. Other variations are possible. For example, there may be different versions of the same digital flyer for each distribution zone. Based on the location of the viewer, the specific version of the digital flyer associated with the distribution zone of the viewer may be made available. While the distribution zones may be defined in a number of ways, one implementation may leverage the paper flyer delivery distribution zones.","In another implementation, availability may be determined based on the distance between the store location and the viewer's location. For example, the distance may be based on the nearest physical store location of the merchant associated with the digital flyer. The determined distance is compared against a threshold distance to determine availability of the digital flyer to the viewer. This threshold distance may be fixed or configured for each merchant based on at least one criterion. For example, the threshold distance may be varied depending on the influence of the store. If the store is well recognized and popular, the threshold distance may be greater than a less popular or less recognized store. Level of recognition or popularity of a store may be determined based on page views, number of physical locations, viewers' requests and other factors. In another example, the threshold distance may be varied depending on the density of similar stores in the vicinity of the store. If the store is unique, the threshold distance may be greater than if there were many similar stores in the vicinity or neighbourhood or distribution zone. Other factors may be considered when determining the threshold distance. It will also be understood that the threshold distance may be different for each flyer stack.","However, to reduce computational resources, the viewer's location may be aggregated at a less granular level to pre-defined availability zones (e.g. Forward Sortation Area (FSA), neighbourhoods, or cities) and digital flyers may be pre-computed and cached for that area. Thus, instead of determining the availability of the digital flyer based on the viewer's exact location, availability may be determined based on the viewer's zone with respect to the nearest physical store location of the merchant. For example, a look-up table may be provided that indicates the availability of a digital flyer with respect to the pre-defined availability zones. When determining the availability of the digital flyer, a simple query of the look-up table would be sufficient to determine the availability of the digital flyer for the viewer.","In addition to determining availability based on location relevancy, availability may also be determined based on timing relevancy. Since flyers are often time sensitive, availability may be based on an availability period or a validity period or both. The availability period refers to the period of time when the digital flyer will be publicly available. The validity period refers to the period of time when the content and pricing in the digital flyer will be active. In this embodiment, the digital flyer will be made available if the current time is within the availability or validity period or both.","Flyer Stack\u2014Flyer Score","Ranking of the digital flyers assigned and available in the flyer stack may be determined based on a flyer score. The digital flyer may have one flyer score applicable to all scenarios. In other implementations, the digital flyer may have multiple flyer scores depending on various factors such as geography, demographics, language, viewer's preference or any other factors.","The determination of the flyer score may also be based on a number of factors that may be weighted accordingly. Some factors include flyer quality, flyer or merchant popularity, budget and revenue, timing and newness, personalization and location. Each factor may produce a score that may be weighted accordingly to determine the overall flyer score. These factors are examples only and other factors may be included in the flyer score calculation. Details of these exemplary factors will now be described.","Flyer Quality","The quality of the digital flyer may be assessed in various ways. In one implementation, quality of the digital flyer may be assessed by taking into consideration the size of the flyer, quality and resolution of the flyer image making up the digital flyer, number of items, quality and quantity of sales and general visual appeal of the digital flyer. These considerations may be automatically assessed by the flyer stack system or assessed by a user of the flyer stack system and inputted using a user interface. For example, the general visual appeal of the digital flyer may be assessed by the community (i.e. crowd-sourcing).","Additionally, or alternatively, a feedback system may be incorporated to evaluate the quality and popularity of the digital flyer. For example, the feedback system may build on the feedback system discussed in the above referenced commonly owned patent applications. With the available statistics from the feedback system, the flyer score may be dynamically updated. Exemplary statistics may include engaged visitor rate, time spent and interactions. The engaged visitor rate measures the percentage of viewers that satisfy a minimum engagement criteria, such as engagement actions (e.g. click, pan, zoom) or time spent on the digital flyer. The time spent statistic may also be used on its own to infer quality. For example, the longer a viewer stays on the digital flyer, the better the inferred quality of the digital flyer. The engagement actions (i.e. interactions) may also be used separately to infer quality. For example, the more interactions a digital flyer receives, the better the inferred quality.","To ensure that the feedback statistics represent a sufficient base to adequately determine a quality score, a qualifying event may be required before the feedback statistics would be considered. For example, the qualifying event may be a day's worth of viewers before the feedback statistics could be considered for evaluating the quality of the digital flyer.","Popularity","Popularity may be measured in relation to the merchant or the digital flyer itself or both. Many different metrics may be used for assessing popularity of a merchant or flyer, which may be provided by the feedback system. One or a combination of these metrics can be used to calculate a popularity score. In one implementation, popularity may be determined based on the number of times a merchant's digital flyer is selected from a search result. The frequency in which the merchant's digital flyer is selected may be an indication of popularity. As with assessing the quality of the digital flyer, a qualifying event may be required. In this implementation, the qualifying event may be a measure of the number of searches conducted on the flyer stack system. For example, the qualifying event may be a week's worth of searches before the feedback statistics could be used in assessing popularity.","In another implementation, popularity may be determined using feedback data from a feedback system, such as the feedback system described in the above referenced commonly owned patent applications. For example, a user interface element may be provided that accepts direct input from the user of the system. The user interface element may be a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d interface element that can be used to measure popularity of a digital flyer or a merchant or both. The \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d element may be aggregated to determine an absolute popularity, or, alternatively, may be used to determine a relative popularity when compared to other digital flyers or merchants of both. Furthermore, the rate at which the digital flyer or merchant receives a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d may be used to assess the popularity trend. As with other popularity or quality metrics, a qualifying event may be imposed. In this implementation, the qualifying event may be a week's worth of visit before the feedback statistics could be considered when assessing popularity.","Revenue Optimization","The ranking of the digital flyer may also be altered to optimize revenue derived from the digital flyers. In one implementation, the ranking of the digital flyers within a flyer stack may be altered to prioritize digital flyers with higher revenue potential. This may be achieved by determining a revenue optimization score, which may be based on price per conversion, conversion rate per view and display revenue per view. In other words, \u201crevenue optimization score\u201d\u221d(\u201cprice per conversion\u201d*\u201cconversion rate per view\u201d)+\u201cdisplay revenue per view\u201d. In this implementation, price per conversion refers to the price that a merchant agreed to pay per conversion event. The conversion event may be as simple as a selection of the digital flyer or more complex events such as a unique engaged visitor. Price per conversion may vary depending on the conversion event. The conversion rate per view measures the percentage of conversion events from the total number of viewing events. This information may be periodically computed by using information from the viewer's device. There may be one or more conversion rates per view associated with the digital flyer. The revenue optimization score may also take into consideration other revenues that may be earned as a direct result of a flyer view but not subject to any other preconditions (i.e. display revenue per view). Depending on the business goal of the flyer stack system, the revenue optimization score may be weighted when computing the flyer score. The implementation above is described as an example only.","In other implementations, the top one or more ranks of the flyer stack may be made available for bid or purchase.","Budget Optimization","Given that many merchants have marketing budgets, the flyer stack system may consider the merchant's specified budget when ranking the digital flyers. A merchant's budget may be classified as a hard budget or a soft budget or a combination of the two. A hard budget refers to a budget ceiling that cannot be changed and a soft budget refers to a budget ceiling that can be changed with sufficient notice.","When optimizing a merchant's soft budget, the system may spend the budget normally until a notice threshold, at which point the spending of the budget may be slowed to allow for the merchant to increase the budget. The budget spending can be slowed, for example, by artificially lowering the rank of the digital flyer.","With a hard budget, a similar notice threshold may be implemented but instead of slowing the budget spending to allow time for the merchant to increase the budget, the remaining budget may be rationed during the remainder of the budget period. The system may adjust the ranking of the digital flyer for the remainder of the budget period such that the budget is not exceeded.","Timing and Newness","As discussed in the context of determining the availability of the digital flyer assigned to a flyer stack, timing relevancy may also be taken into account when ranking the digital flyers in the flyer stack. For example, the flyer score may be varied depending on where in the availability period the digital flyer lies. In one implementation, if the digital flyer is at the beginning of the availability period (i.e. the digital flyer is new), it may be given a higher flyer score in this category. As another example, the flyer score may be varied depending on where in the validity period the digital flyer lies. In one implementation, if the digital flyer is near the end of the validity period, it may receive a higher flyer score in this category to bring attention to the expiring deals to the viewers.","Personalization","The flyer stack system may also provide a user interface to receive viewer's preferences. In one implementation, a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d interface element may be provided to receive direct feedback from the viewer. This feedback may be stored and taken into consideration when ranking the digital flyers. In another implementation, the viewer may be presented with a user interface to select the desired category of digital flyers. Depending on the preference of the viewer, the rank of the digital flyers may be altered to suit the preference of the viewer. The viewer's personalization may be determined in other ways, including indirect methods that infer from the viewer's behaviour.","Location","As discussed in the context of determining the availability of the digital flyer assigned to a flyer stack, location relevancy may also be taken into account when ranking the digital flyers in the flyer stack.","Presentation\u2014Overview","The flyer stack system organizes the digital flyers into at least one flyer stack. The information that includes how the digital flyers are organized into the at least one flyer stack (i.e. flyer stack information) is then communicated to a communication device on which the viewer views the digital flyers. The communication device includes a flyer navigation interface, which enables the viewer to navigate between digital flyers within each flyer stack and also between digital flyers belonging to different flyer stacks. For example, the viewer may browse through digital flyers in the \u201cgroceries\u201d stack and also jump between digital flyers in the \u201cgroceries\u201d stack and the \u201celectronics\u201d stack. Thus, the communication device receives the flyer stack information from the flyer stack system, the flyer stack information including a plurality of digital flyers organized into at least one flyer stack (i.e.  in ). It will be understood that while the flyer stack information includes information about the plurality of digital flyers organized into at least one flyer stack, to minimize bandwidth usage, all the plurality of digital flyers may not be received by the communication device until required. Rather, for example, an index of the plurality of digital flyers organized into the at least one flyer stack may be received, which the communication device may use to download the necessary digital flyers subsequently. Thus, when referring to a plurality of digital flyers in the context of flyer stack information, it may be in reference to the actual digital flyer received from the flyer stack system, or it may only be an index or pointer to the digital flyer that is stored in the flyer stack system but not yet received by the communication system. Once received, the plurality of digital flyers received may be stored in the memory of the communication device. Also, all or some the digital flyers may be downloaded and stored in a memory of the communication device. In this situation, browsing of the digital flyers may be possible in a disconnected environment.","With the received flyer stack information, the device displays the at least one flyer stack in the flyer navigation interface (i.e.  in ), selects a flyer stack from the at least one flyer stack (i.e.  in ), and displays a digital flyer from the selected flyer stack in the flyer navigation interface including displaying an indication of the next digital flyer in the selected flyer stack, the next digital flyer being accessible by navigating to the indication (i.e.  in ). The details will now be described.","Presentation\u2014Displaying the Flyer Stack","The received flyer stack information contains a plurality of digital flyers organized into at least one flyer stack. This information is then displayed in the flyer navigation interface such that a viewer can efficiently navigate through the plurality of digital flyers. Since the plurality of digital flyers are assigned to the at least one flyer stack and ranked within the flyer stack, the viewer is able to efficiently browse through the most relevant digital flyers.","Within the flyer stack information, there is at least one flyer stack. For example, there may be a \u201cPopular\u201d stack, \u201cRecommended\u201d stack and \u201cFavourite\u201d stack. These flyer stacks are displayed in the flyer navigation interface (i.e.  in ; see also  and  in ). In one implementation, the flyer stacks may be displayed as a drop-down menu. This allows the viewer to easily switch between the at least one flyer stack. The drop-down menus may be enhanced with information about the flyers such as thumbnails, validity period, and highlights of the flyers. Other implementations are possible to convey to the viewer that different flyer stacks exist.","Within each of the at least one flyer stack, there contains none or one or more digital flyers. In one implementation, there may be a minimum display threshold that can be used to show or hide flyer stacks that do not contain the minimum number of digital flyers. Digital flyers contained in the hidden flyer stack may be displayed as part of a \u201cremainder\u201d stack that contains digital flyers not belonging to any flyer stack.","Presentation\u2014Navigation","The communication device also selects one of the flyer stacks displayed in the flyer navigation interface (i.e.  in ). The selection may be done in a variety of ways. For example, if the flyer stack information includes a \u201crecommended\u201d stack, this stack may be selected by default. In another example, the flyer stack may be chosen based on the preference of the viewer. This preference may have been previously set through a user interface and the appropriate flyer stack may be chosen based on the preference and the stack definition associated with the flyer stack.","With the flyer stack selected, a flyer from the selected flyer stack is displayed in the flyer navigation interface (i.e.  in ). In one embodiment, the flyer selected from the flyer stack is the top ranking flyer within the flyer stack. In addition to displaying the digital flyer, the interface displays an indication of the next digital flyer in the selected flyer stack, the next digital flyer being accessible by navigating to the indication. In one implementation, the indication is a user interface element which when selected displays the next digital flyer in the flyer navigation interface. The user interface element may be, for example, an arrow overlaid the flyer navigation interface. In another implementation, the indication may be a portion of the next digital flyer, the next digital flyer being accessible by navigating to the portion. To navigate to the next digital flyer, the viewer may select the portion or pan to the portion of the next digital flyer. In addition to navigating to the next digital flyer in the flyer stack, the flyer interface may also allow the viewer to navigate to the previous digital flyer in the flyer stack.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0137"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6C","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","102","104","106","600"]},"Referring to , the flyer navigation interface  may include a menu  that facilitates some of the features enabled by this technology. For example, the menu  may provide the viewer with a searching functionality. As it will be described below, the searching functionality may allow inter-flyer and intra-flyer searching that allows the content to be searched not only within a digital flyer but also across different digital flyers within the same flyer stack and across other flyer stacks. The menu  may also include filters that can be used to quickly filter through the digital flyer. Filtering may be enabled by utilizing polygon mapping technology as disclosed in the above referenced commonly owned patent applications. Because of the organization of the digital flyers into flyer stacks, the viewer is able to filter through not only the current digital flyer but also through different digital flyers within the same flyer stack and across other flyer stacks. For example, the filter may be used to highlight specific items or items that have particular discount. Additionally, the menu  may provide for menu elements (e.g.  in ) for the viewer to switch between different flyer stacks.","The flyer navigation interface  also includes a viewport area  where the digital flyers are displayed. While in this implementation the viewport  occupies a subset of the display on which the flyer navigation interface  is displayed, it will be understood that the viewport  may occupy the entire display. In the viewport , there is shown a current digital flyer . In , the current digital flyer  is a multi-page digital flyer with flyer page B being the active page while portions of the previous page A and next page C are shown in the viewport  as the non-active pages. While the current digital flyer  is shown as a multi-page digital flyer, it will be understood that the current digital flyer  may be a single-page digital flyer.","The current digital flyer  starts with the digital flyer that was initially selected from the selected flyer stack (i.e.  in ). In one embodiment, the initially selected digital flyer is the top ranking digital flyer from the selected flyer stack. As the viewer navigates through the digital flyers using the flyer navigation interface , the flyer page shown as the active page would change. If the current digital flyer  is a multi-page digital flyer, the viewer is able to browse through the other pages of the same flyer by navigating to the previous flyer page A or the next flyer page C (i.e. intra-flyer navigation). Navigation may be effected by panning or selecting the portion A, C or by selecting a user interface element such as arrows (as shown as A-D in ). In the implementation shown in , a portion of the previous and next page is shown (i.e. A and C in , respectively), to which the viewer can pan by using, for example, a gesture on a touchscreen or inputs through a keyboard or mouse. Alternatively, or additionally, the viewer may select the displayed portion (A or C in ). It will be understood that depending on the number of pages and the page of the digital flyer currently displayed in the flyer navigation interface, the next page C or previous page A may or may not be present.","In addition to intra-flyer navigation, the flyer navigation interface  allows for inter-flyer navigation. As shown in , the flyer navigation interface  allows the viewer to navigate to other flyers (e.g. flyers  and  in ) within the same flyer stack. It will be understood that the flyers  and  may be one page from a multi-page or single-page digital flyer within the same flyer stack or it may simply be a representative page that indicates the identity of the previous flyer  or next flyer . In the flyer navigation interface  shown in , the flyer  illustrates a flyer in a position above the current flyer  (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cprevious flyer\u201d) and the flyer  illustrates a flyer in a position below the current flyer  (hereinafter also referred to as \u201cnext flyer\u201d) in the same flyer stack. For example, referring to  to better visualize the positional aspect of the flyer stack, if the current flyer  is flyer  in flyer stack , the flyer  would be flyer  in flyer stack  and the flyer  would be flyer  in flyer stack . In , the next and previous digital flyers are accessible by navigating up or down, relative to the viewport , . This mimics the act of looking through a stack of flyers as shown in . However, it will be understood that navigating to the next or previous digital flyer is not limited to vertical navigation. In some embodiments, the next and previous digital flyers in the same stack may be indicated as A and C in , while the next and previous pages of the digital flyer may be shown as  and  in . It will be further understood, and also described using  below, that the next digital flyer in the flyer stack may be accessible after the last page of the current digital flyer.","Depending on the flyer stack implementation, the ranking of the flyer above and below the current flyer may change. In one implementation, the flyer stack may be a non-circular stack. Referring to , the flyer  in the first position of the flyer stack  is not linked to the flyer  in the last position of the flyer stack . Thus, in this implementation, flyer  would be the highest or top ranking flyer and the flyer  would be the lowest ranking flyer in the flyer stack . So, referring to , the flyer navigation interface  may display the top ranking flyer  (i.e.  in ) as the current flyer  and allow the viewer to navigate to the next digital flyer in the flyer stack (i.e.  in ), which would be displayed as the flyer  depicted as the flyer below the current flyer . In this implementation, the flyer  would depict the next flyer and the flyer  would depict the previous flyer. However, since the flyer stack is a non-circular stack, when flyer  is the current flyer , previous flyer  would not be shown. After navigating to the next flyer, the current flyer  would become the next flyer (i.e.  in ), while the previous flyer  would be the top ranking flyer previously displayed as the current flyer (i.e.  in ) and the next flyer  would be the flyer subsequent to current flyer  previously displayed as the next flyer (i.e.  in ). This process continues until the last rank flyer  in  is reached.","In another implementation, the flyer stack may be a circular stack. In this implementation, the flyer  in the first position of the flyer stack  is linked to the flyer  in the last position of the flyer stack . Thus, unlike the flyer stack , when the viewer reaches the flyer  in the flyer stack , the viewer is able to go directly to flyer  and vice versa. Referring to , the flyer navigation interface  may display the flyer  in the first position in the flyer stack  (i.e.  in ) as the current flyer  and allow the viewer to navigate through the flyer stack as discussed above. Similarly, the flyer  depicts the flyer in the position above the current flyer  in the flyer stack  (i.e.  in ) and the flyer  depicts the flyer in the position below the current flyer  in the flyer stack  (i.e.  in ). However, unlike the non-circular flyer stack implementation, the flyer  at the last position of the flyer stack  is not necessarily the lowest rank flyer in the flyer stack . This is due to the fact that the first position flyer  is linked to the last position flyer . In other words, if the current flyer  is the flyer  of the flyer stack , the flyers  and  in  would correspond to flyers  and  of flyer stack  in . If flyer  was the last rank flyer, it would receive equal prominence to flyer  in the flyer stack . Thus, in this implementation, the ranking of the flyers may be dynamic depending on the navigation characteristics of the viewer.","Now referring to , which is a simplified view of the viewport  of , navigating through the digital flyers will now be further explained. As shown, the viewport  displays the current page B from the current digital flyer  along with a portion of the previous page A and next page C. The viewport  also displays a portion of the next flyer  and previous flyer  in the same flyer stack. Thus, intra-flyer navigation may be achieved by navigating to the displayed portions A and C and inter-flyer navigation may be achieved by navigating to the portions of the previous and next digital flyer  and  displayed in the viewport . Navigation may be effected by panning (for example through gesturing), selecting or any other input methods detectable by a communication device. In the embodiment where panning is used, a flyer lock boundary ,  may be present requiring a minimum engagement by the viewer before switching to the next or previous flyer in the flyer stack. In one implementation, a minimum pan velocity crossing the flyer lock boundary ,  may be required before switching to the next or previous flyer in the flyer stack. In another implementation, a minimum distance beyond the flyer lock boundary ,  may be required before switching to the next or previous flyer in the flyer stack. The presence of the flyer lock boundary ,  ensures that viewers do not accidentally switch into the next or previous flyer in the stack.","In another embodiment, as shown in , the flyer stack may be an inter-linked flyer stack. An inter-linked flyer stack is a flyer stack where each flyer in the flyer stack is linked to the next and previous digital flyers. As shown in , the flyer stack  has a plurality of digital flyers with each digital flyer being linked to one another. To illustrate the linked aspect of the inter-linked flyer stack, arrows  are shown. For example, the digital flyer  in the flyer stack  may have multiple pages. In an inter-linked flyer stack, the first page of the digital flyer  may be linked to last page of the digital flyer  and the last page of the digital flyer  may be linked to the first page of the digital flyer . In addition, the first page of the digital flyer  may be linked to the last page of the digital flyer . Thus, in this optional implementation, the flyer stack would be a combination of circular and inter-linked flyer stack. Referring back to , an implementation of the inter-linked flyer stack is shown in the flyer navigation interface showing the viewport . As in previous embodiments, the viewport  shows a page from the current digital flyer . In this example, page G is shown from the current digital flyer . Moreover, in viewport , the previous and next digital flyer ,  in the stack and the previous and next page F, H of the current digital flyer  are shown. However, in this implementation, the next digital flyer  is linked to the current digital flyer  so when the viewer reaches the last page (e.g. Z) of the current digital flyer , the next digital flyer  can be accessed as if it is the page after the last page in the current digital flyer . The same applies to the previous digital flyer  in the flyer stack. This allows for a fluid navigation experience between digital flyers in the flyer stack.","Other implementations of flyer navigation interface  are possible, one of which is shown in . In this implementation, instead of the indication of the next or previous flyer (or next or previous page of the flyer) being a portion of the flyer or flyer page, a user interface element is provided, which when selected provides for inter-flyer and intra-flyer navigation. In , the user interface elements are shown as arrows A-D. The viewer is able to navigate within the same flyer stack (e.g. flyer stacks  ) using arrows A and C and navigate within the pages of the current flyer  in the flyer stack using arrows B and D.","In the implementations shown in , the viewer is able to switch between flyer stacks through a user interface element in the flyer navigation interface. In , the viewer is able to switch between different category stacks through menu elements . Alternatively, or additionally, the flyer navigation interface  may also provide a menu element  in the viewport  that allows the user to switch between flyer stacks easily. In , three flyer stacks \u201cPopular\u201d, \u201cRecommended\u201d and \u201cFavourites\u201d are shown, with the current flyer stack being the \u201cPopular\u201d stack. By selecting the \u201cRecommended\u201d stack, the flyer navigation interface  would switch to the \u201cRecommended\u201d stack and display the top ranking flyer from that stack as the current digital flyer . The flyer stacks shown in the menu element  may also allow the viewer to switch to a specific flyer within the flyer stack. For example, the menu element  may be in the form of a drop-down, which when selected displays the digital flyers in each flyer stack. Thus, by selecting the \u201cRecommended\u201d stack, the digital flyers within the \u201cRecommended\u201d stack may be displayed in the menu element , which may allow the viewer to select the specific digital flyer within the \u201cRecommend\u201d stack.","Another implementation of the flyer navigation interface is shown in , which is being shown through viewport . In this implementation, in addition to the current digital flyer  (in , flyer page B from the current digital flyer  is shown as in other embodiments), the flyer navigation interface includes contextually injected digital flyers ,  and . These digital flyers may be injected in a number of different areas. For example in , the digital flyers ,  and  are injected around the perimeter of the current flyer page B. As the viewer pans, the viewport  displays the contextually injected digital flyers ,  and . In this implementation, the viewer may be able to navigate through multiple-pages of the digital flyer - by panning or selecting the next or previous page of the digital flyer. In addition, the viewer may be able to zoom-in and zoom-out of the contextually injected digital flyers, separate from the current digital flyer  shown in the flyer navigation interface.","It will also be understood that the digital flyers may be injected within the current flyer page B as links depending on the content of the current flyer page B. For example, if the current digital flyer  contains a section on \u201cElectronics\u201d, a link to a popular or high ranking \u201cElectronics\u201d digital flyer may be injected within the pages of the current digital flyer .","Selection of the digital flyers that are available for injection may be done in a number of ways. In one implementation, selection may be based on manual curation. For example, a user interface may be provided that allows the selection of potentially injectable digital flyers. These digital flyers may be \u201cfeatured\u201d digital flyers from a particular merchant who has purchased this space. In another implementation, the selection may be based on the flyer stack. For example, the top rank flyers from the at least one flyer stack may be injected. In a further implementation, the selection may be based on collaborative filtering. This type of filtering considers the usage patterns of different flyer viewers. The usage pattern may be determined in a variety of ways as described in this disclosure. For example, a feedback system may be used to determine the usage pattern of viewers of digital flyer. In another example, viewers' preferences may be directly measured by providing a user interface element such as \u201clike\u201d or \u201cdislike\u201d button. Any one or more of these and other selection may be possible to contextually inject digital flyers into the flyer navigation interface. In the different implementations, the availability of the injectable digital flyers may be further subject to the availability of the digital flyers as discussed above with respect to availability within an assigned flyer stack.","Inter-Flyer Searching","The organization of the one or more digital flyers into at least one flyer stack allows viewers to not only search within the current digital flyer but also across multiple digital flyers in an efficient way. Moreover, the search results may be presented and navigated in an efficient way by utilizing the organized information.","As described in the present disclosure, the plurality of digital flyers are organized into at least one flyer stack. This organized information is also referred to as flyer stack information. After creation, the information is stored in a structured manner for easy retrieval. For example, the flyer stack information may be stored in a database so that information can be easily accessed and cross-referenced. In one implementation, the flyer stack information may store the information in a hierarchical structure. For example, the information may be organized as follows: (i) at least one flyer stack and the flyer stack definition of each flyer stack, (ii) the digital flyers contained in each flyer stack, availability of each digital flyer and the order in which the digital flyers are to appear; and (iii) individualized information about each digital flyer in the flyer stack, for example, the contained items, items to highlight, and other information pertaining to the particular digital flyer. More granular information may be included depending on the information required. For example, there may be multiple information entries for the same digital flyers depending on the localization, availability and other factors. In addition, to speed up searching through the flyer stack information, an index of the flyer stack information may be created.","Thus, inter-flyer searching is provided by receiving a search request (i.e.  in ). The search request includes information about the viewer who is making the search request to search through the plurality of digital flyers. The viewer information includes information about the viewer viewing the plurality of digital flyers on the communication device. For example, the location of the viewer may be included in the viewer information. Furthermore, the viewer information comprises the current digital flyer that the viewer is currently viewing. In one embodiment, the viewer information may further include the flyer stack information. In other embodiments, the flyer stack information may be retrieved from memory on the server receiving the search request. In a further embodiment, the flyer stack information may be reconstructed using the viewer information that was sent with the search request. In response to the search request received, a search result is retrieved by searching the flyer stack information (i.e.  in ). In one embodiment, to speed up searching, the flyer stack information may be indexed and the search may be performed using the index. The search result is then filtered based on the availability of each digital flyer, information about the availability of each digital flyer being contained in the flyer stack information (i.e.  in ). For example, if a particular digital flyer included in the search result is relevant to the search but not available to the viewer, this particular digital flyer is removed from the search result. The filtered search result is then ranked according to which flyer stack each digital flyer belongs (i.e.  in ). In one implementation, first priority may be given to items in the search result belonging to the current digital flyer, second priority may be given to the items in the search result belonging to digital flyers in the current flyer stack and third priority may be given to the items in the search result belonging digital flyers in other flyer stacks. While first, second and third priority do not necessarily represent the ranking order, in some embodiments, first priority may be higher in ranking order than the second priority and the second priority may be higher in ranking order than the third priority.","The communication device on which the search was requested then receives the search result, the search result containing relevant items as contained in the digital flyers in the at least one flyer stack and organized and filtered using the flyer stack information (i.e.  and  in ). The device then displays the search result in a display of the communication device (i.e.  in ). For example, the search result may be displayed in a flyer navigation interface as discussed in the present disclosure. Also, a user interface is provided that allows the viewer to review the relevant items in the search result as it was organized (i.e.  in ).","An exemplary flyer navigation interface for displaying the search result will now be discussed using , which has been simplified to only show the viewport . It will also be understood that some or all of the features discussed in this present disclosure may be incorporated along with the interface showing the search result. In the viewport , a flyer page  of a digital flyer is shown. The flyer page  is from a digital flyer associated with the search result received from a server. The flyer page  may be one of a multi-page digital flyer or may be the only page in a single-page digital flyer. On the flyer page , items included in the search result are displayed, for example, as  and . In this implementation, the relevant items in the search result (e.g.  and ) are highlighted by using polygons  and . This may leverage the polygon mapping technology discussed in the above referenced commonly owned patent applications. Furthermore, a user interface  is provided for reviewing the search result as it was organized. For example, if the search result contains fifty relevant items after the search result was filtered and ranked using the flyer stack information, the user interface  allows the viewer to view the fifty relevant items in the ranked order. In the user interface , the switching between the relevant items can be achieved by selecting the arrows as shown on the user interface . Since the search result includes relevant items in the current digital flyer and digital flyers in the same flyer stack and other flyer stacks, the viewer is able to search through multiple digital flyers and review the search result in an organized way.","While the patent disclosure is described in conjunction with the specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the patent disclosure to the described embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the scope of the patent disclosure as defined by the appended claims. In the description below, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present patent disclosure. The present patent disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well-known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present patent disclosure.","It is further understood that the use of relational terms such as first and second, and the like, if any, are used solely to distinguish one from another entity, item, or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities, items or actions.","The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","Some portions of the detailed description in the above are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits or binary digital signals within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations may be the techniques used by those skilled in the data processing arts to convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art.","An algorithm is generally, considered to be a self-consistent sequence of acts or operations leading to a desired result. These include physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like. It should be understood, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities.","Unless specifically stated otherwise, as apparent from the above discussions, it is appreciated that throughout the specification discussions utilizing terms such as \u201cprocessing,\u201d \u201ccomputing,\u201d \u201ccalculating,\u201d \u201cdetermining,\u201d or the like, refer to the action and\/or processes of a computer or computing system, or similar electronic computing media player device, that manipulate and\/or transform data represented as physical, such as electronic, quantities within the computing system's registers and\/or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computing system's memories, registers or other such information storage, transmit session or display devices.","Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations thereof. Apparatus within the scope of the present disclosure can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in a machine-readable storage medium for execution by a programmable processor; and method actions within the scope of the present disclosure can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the present disclosure by operating on input data and generating output. Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure may be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device. Each computer program can be implemented in a high-level procedural or object oriented programming language, or in assembly or machine language if desired; and in any case, the language can be a compiled or interpreted language. Suitable processors include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory and\/or a random access memory. Generally, a computer will include one or more mass storage devices for storing data files. Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions, computer-readable instructions, or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media may be any available media, which is accessible by a general-purpose or special-purpose computer system. Examples of computer-readable media may include physical storage media such as RAM, ROM, EPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other media which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions, computer-readable instructions, or data structures and which may be accessed by a general-purpose or special-purpose computer system. Any of the foregoing can be supplemented by, or incorporated in, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). It should be understood that embodiments of the present disclosure may be used in a variety of applications. Although the present disclosure is not limited in this respect, the methods disclosed herein may be used in many apparatuses such as in the transmitters, receivers and transceivers of a radio system.
