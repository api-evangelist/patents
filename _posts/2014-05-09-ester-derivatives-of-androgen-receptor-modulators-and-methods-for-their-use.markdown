The United States Government has certain rights in this disclosure.","1. Technical Field","This disclosure generally relates to ester derivatives of bisphenol-related compounds and their use for treatment of various indications. In particular the disclosure relates to ester derivatives of bisphenol-related compounds and their use for treatment of various cancers, for example, all stages of prostate cancer, including androgen dependent, androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancers.","2. Description of the Art","Androgens mediate their effects through the androgen receptor (AR). Androgens play a role in a wide range of developmental and physiological responses and are involved in male sexual differentiation, maintenance of spermatogenesis, and male gonadotropin regulation (R. K. Ross, G. A. Coetzee, C. L. Pearce, J. K. Reichardt, P. Bretsky, L. N. Kolonel, B. E. Henderson, E. Lander, D. Altshuler & G. Daley, 35, 355-361 (1999); A. A. Thomson, 121, 187-195 (2001); N. Tanji, K. Aoki & M. Yokoyama, 47, 1-7 (2001)). Several lines of evidence show that androgens are associated with the development of prostate carcinogenesis. Firstly, androgens induce prostatic carcinogenesis in rodent models (R. L. Noble, 37, 1929-1933 (1977); R. L. Noble, 34, 138-141 (1977)) and men receiving androgens in the form of anabolic steroids have a higher incidence of prostate cancer (J. T. Roberts & D. M. Essenhigh, 2, 742 (1986); J. A. Jackson, J. Waxman & A. M. Spiekerman, 149, 2365-2366 (1989); P. D. Guinan, W. Sadoughi, H. Alsheik, R. J. Ablin, D. Alrenga & I. M. Bush, 131, 599-600 (1976)). Secondly, prostate cancer does not develop if humans or dogs are castrated before puberty (J. D. Wilson & C. Roehrborn, 84, 4324-4331 (1999); G. Wilding, 14, 113-130 (1992)). Castration of adult males causes involution of the prostate and apoptosis of prostatic epithelium while eliciting no effect on other male external genitalia (E. M. Bruckheimer & N. Kyprianou, 301, 153-162 (2000); J. T. Isaacs, Prostate 5, 545-557 (1984)). This dependency on androgens provides the underlying rationale for treating prostate cancer with chemical or surgical castration (androgen ablation).","Androgens also play a role in female cancers. One example is ovarian cancer where elevated levels of androgens are associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer (K. J. Helzlsouer, A. J. Alberg, G. B. Gordon, C. Longcope, T. L. Bush, S. C. Hoffman & G. W. Comstock, 274, 1926-1930 (1995); R. J. Edmondson, J. M. Monaghan & B. R. Davies, 86, 879-885 (2002)). The androgen receptor has been detected in a majority of ovarian cancers (H. A. Risch, 90, 1774-1786 (1998); B. R. Rao & B. J. Slotman, 12, 14-26 (1991); G. M. Clinton & W. Hua, 25, 1-9 (1997)), whereas estrogen receptor-alpha (ERa) and the progesterone receptor are detected in less than 50% of ovarian tumors.","An effective treatment available for advanced prostate cancer is the withdrawal of androgens which are essential for the survival of prostate epithelial cells. Androgen ablation therapy causes a temporary reduction in tumor burden concomitant with a decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Unfortunately prostate cancer can eventually grow again in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant disease) (Huber et al 1987 104, 33-39). Castration-resistant prostate cancer is biochemically characterized before the onset of symptoms by a rising titre of serum PSA (Miller et al 1992 147, 956-961). Once the disease becomes castration-resistant most patients succumb to their disease within two years.","The androgen receptor has distinct functional domains that include the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD), a DNA-binding domain (DBD) comprising two zinc finger motifs, and an N-terminus domain (NTD) that contains one or more transcriptional activation domains. Binding of androgen (ligand) to the LBD of the androgen receptor results in its activation such that the receptor can effectively bind to its specific DNA consensus site, termed the androgen response element (ARE), on the promoter and enhancer regions of \u201cnormally\u201d androgen regulated genes, such as PSA, to initiate transcription. The androgen receptor can be activated in the absence of androgen by stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and by various growth factors (Culig et al 1994 54, 5474-5478; Nazareth et al 1996 271, 19900-19907; Sadar 1999 274, 7777-7783; Ueda et al 2002 A 277, 7076-7085; and Ueda et al 2002 B 277, 38087-38094). The mechanism of ligand-independent transformation of the androgen receptor AR has been shown to involve: 1) increased nuclear androgen receptor protein suggesting nuclear translocation; 2) increased androgen receptor\/ARE complex formation; and 3) the AR-NTD (Sadar 1999 274, 7777-7783; Ueda et al 2002 A 277, 7076-7085; and Ueda et al 2002 B 277, 38087-38094). The androgen receptor may be activated in the absence of testicular androgens by alternative signal transduction pathways in castration-resistant disease, which is consistent with the finding that nuclear androgen receptor protein is present in secondary prostate cancer tumors (Kim et al 2002 160, 219-226; and van der Kwast et al 1991 48, 189-193).","Available inhibitors of the androgen receptor include nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide, enzalutamide, and investigational drug ARN-509, and the steroidal antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate. These antiandrogens target the LBD of the androgen receptor and predominantly fail presumably due to poor affinity and mutations that lead to activation of the androgen receptor by these same antiandrogens (Taplin, M. E., Bubley, G. J., Kom Y. J., Small E. J., Uptonm M., Rajeshkumarm B., Balkm S. P., 59, 2511-2515 (1999)). These antiandrogens would also have no effect on the recently discovered androgen receptor splice variants that lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD) to result in a constitutively active receptor which promotes progression of androgen-independent prostate cancer (Dehm S M, Schmidt L J, Heemers H V, Vessella R L, Tindall D J., 68, 5469-77, 2008; Guo Z, Yang X, Sun F, Jiang R, Linn D E, Chen H, Chen H, Kong X, Melamed J, Tepper C G, Kung H J, Brodie A M, Edwards J, Qiu Y., 69, 2305-13, 2009; Hu et al 2009 Cancer Res. 69, 16-22; Sun et al 2010 J Clin Invest. 2010 120, 2715-30).","Conventional therapy has concentrated on androgen-dependent activation of the androgen receptor through its C-terminal domain. Recent studies developing antagonists to the androgen receptor have concentrated on the C-terminus and specifically: 1) the allosteric pocket and AF-2 activity (Estebanez-Perpi{umlaut over (n)}\u00e1 et al 2007104, 16074-16079); 2) in silico \u201cdrug repurposing\u201d procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists (Bisson et al 2007104, 11927-11932); and coactivator or corepressor interactions (Chang et al 200519, 2478-2490; Hur et al 20042, E274; Estebanez-Perpi{umlaut over (n)}\u00e1 et al 2005280, 8060-8068; He et al 200416, 425-438).","The AR-NTD is also a target for drug development (e.g. WO 2000\/001813), since the NTD contains Activation-Function-1 (AF-1) which is the essential region required for androgen receptor transcriptional activity (Jenster et al 1991. Mol. Endocrinol. 5, 1396-404). The AR-NTD importantly plays a role in activation of the androgen receptor in the absence of androgens (Sadar, M. D. 1999 274, 7777-7783; Sadar M D et al 1999 6, 487-502; Ueda et al 2002 277, 7076-7085; Ueda 2002 277, 38087-38094; Blaszczyk et al 2004 10, 1860-9; Dehm et al 2006 28, 27882-93; Gregory et al 2004 279, 7119-30). The AR-NTD is important in hormonal progression of prostate cancer as shown by application of decoy molecules (Quayle et al 2007104, 1331-1336).","While the crystal structure has been resolved for the androgen receptor C-terminus LBD, this has not been the case for the NTD due to its high flexibility and intrinisic disorder in solution (Reid et al 2002 277, 20079-20086) thereby hampering virtual docking drug discovery approaches.","Although progress has been made, there remains a need in the art for additional and\/or improved compounds that modulate the androgen receptor. The present disclosure provides these and related advantages.","This disclosure is based in part on the unexpected discovery that certain esters of bisphenol-related compounds have desirable properties for use as modulators of androgen receptor.

Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of the disclosure that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be active or inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active (or more active) compound. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound, for example, by hydrolysis in blood. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam)). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. The present disclosure is meant to ecompass all compounds of structure I, whether acting as a prodrug or the active compound itself, or both.","The disclosure disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of Structure (I) being isotopically-labelled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as H, H, C, C, C, N, N, O, O, O, P, P, S, F, Cl, I, and I, respectively. These radiolabelled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the effectiveness of the compounds, by characterizing, for example, the site or mode of action, or binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Structure (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and\/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. H, and carbon-14, i.e. C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.","Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.","Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as C, F, O, Iand N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds of Structure (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples as set out below using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.","The disclosure disclosed herein is also meant to encompass the in vivo metabolic products of the disclosed compounds. Such products may result from, for example, the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the disclosure includes compounds produced by a process comprising administering a compound of this disclosure to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products are typically identified by administering a radiolabelled compound of the disclosure in a detectable dose to an animal, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to human, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur, and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples.","\u201cStable compound\u201d and \u201cstable structure\u201d are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.","\u201cMammal\u201d includes humans and both domestic animals such as laboratory animals and household pets (e.g., cats, dogs, swine, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits), and non-domestic animals such as wildlife and the like.","\u201cOptional\u201d or \u201coptionally\u201d means that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, \u201coptionally substituted aryl\u201d means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient\u201d includes without limitation any adjuvant, carrier, excipient, glidant, sweetening agent, diluent, preservative, dye\/colorant, flavor enhancer, surfactant, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, stabilizer, isotonic agent, solvent, or emulsifier which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as being acceptable for use in humans or domestic animals.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d includes both acid and base addition salts.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt\u201d refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as, but not limited to, acetic acid, 2,2-dichloroacetic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4-acetamidobenzoic acid, camphoric acid, camphor-10-sulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, carbonic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, 2-oxo-glutaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycolic acid, hippuric acid, isobutyric acid, lactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, mucic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid, propionic acid, pyroglutamic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, undecylenic acid, and the like.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt\u201d refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid.

As used herein, the term \u201csolvate\u201d refers to an aggregate that comprises one or more molecules of a compound of the disclosure with one or more molecules of solvent. The solvent may be water, in which case the solvate may be a hydrate. Alternatively, the solvent may be an organic solvent. Thus, the compounds of the present disclosure may exist as a hydrate, including a monohydrate, dihydrate, hemihydrate, sesquihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like, as well as the corresponding solvated forms. The compound of the disclosure may be true solvates, while in other cases, the compound of the disclosure may merely retain adventitious water or be a mixture of water plus some adventitious solvent.","A \u201cpharmaceutical composition\u201d refers to a formulation of a compound of the disclosure and a medium generally accepted in the art for the delivery of the biologically active compound to mammals, e.g., humans. Such a medium includes all pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients therefor.","An \u201ceffective amount\u201d refers to a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A \u201ctherapeutically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as reduced tumor size, increased life span or increased life expectancy. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.","A \u201cprophylactically effective amount\u201d refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as smaller tumors, increased life span, increased life expectancy or prevention of the progression of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent form. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount may be less than a therapeutically effective amount.","\u201cTreating\u201d or \u201ctreatment\u201d as used herein covers the treatment of the disease or condition of interest in a mammal, preferably a human, having the disease or condition of interest, and includes:\n\n","The compounds of the disclosure, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids.

Compounds of structure A, can be purchased from commercial sources or prepared according to methods known in the art. Reaction of A with an appropriately substituted 1,3-dioxolane yields compounds of structure B. Optically pure or racemic dioxolanes may be employed to yield the desired stereochemistry. Epoxidation of B with an appropriate reagent, for example an appropriately substituted glycidyl tosylate, results in compounds of structure C. Various epoxidation reagents may be employed, including optically pure reagents which yield optically pure epoxides (e.g., + or \u2212 glycidyl tosylate). Treatment of C with an appropriate ring-opening reagent, for example CeClx7HO, yields D.","Compounds of structure D, can be used as intermediates for the preparation of various compounds of Structure I. For example, compound D can be modified to include an ester at the primary alcohol by treatment with the appropriate acid chloride (e.g., acetyl chloride and the like). Alternatively, the 1,2-dihydroxyl moiety can be protected as a ketal by reaction with 2,2-dimethoxypropane, followed by conversion of the free secondary alcohol to an ester by treatment with the appropriate anhydride (e.g. acetic anhydride and the like) and deprotection of the ketal. Triester compounds of structure I can be prepared by treatment of compound D with an appropriate anhydride. Finally, the 1,2-dihydroxyls can both be converted to a desired ester group using a modification of the above scheme as demonstrated in Examples 9-11. Other compounds of structure I are easily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the above description.","Compounds of structure I, wherein Ris halo can be easily prepared by modifications to the above scheme. For example, treatment of D with an appropriate halogenating reagent, followed by esterification as described above, yields compounds of structure I wherein Ris halo (e.g., fluoro).

For example in some embodiments, modulating androgen receptor (AR) activity is in a mammalian cell.","In other embodiments, modulating androgen receptor (AR) activity is for treatment of at least one indication selected from the group consisting of: prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, hair loss, acne, hirsutism, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and age-related macular degeneration. For example in some embodiments, the indication is prostate cancer. For example, in some embodiments, the prostate cancer is castration resistant prostate cancer, and in other embodiments the prostate cancer is androgen-dependent prostate cancer.","In yet another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of modulating androgen receptor (AR) activity, the method comprising administering any one of the foregoing pharmaceutical compositions (including compositions comprising a compound of Structure I and an additional therapeutic agent) to a subject in need thereof. For example in some embodiments, modulating androgen receptor (AR) activity is for the treatment of one or more of the following: prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, hair loss, acne, hirsutism, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, and age-related macular degeneration. In still other embodiments, the indication is prostate cancer. For example, in some embodiments, the prostate cancer is castration resistant prostate cancer, while in other embodiments, the prostate cancer is androgen-dependent prostate cancer.","In general, compounds of the disclosure should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds of the disclosure can be determined using standard techniques, for example, by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index, i.e., the ratio between the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the LD100 (the dose lethal to 100% of the population). In some circumstances however, such as in severe disease conditions, it may be necessary to administer substantial excesses of the compositions. Some compounds of this disclosure may be toxic at some concentrations. Titration studies may be used to determine toxic and non-toxic concentrations. Toxicity may be evaluated by examining a particular compound's or composition's specificity across cell lines using PC3 cells as a negative control that do not express functional AR. Animal studies may be used to provide an indication if the compound has any effects on other tissues. Systemic therapy that targets the AR will not likely cause major problems to other tissues since antiandrogens and androgen insensitivity syndrome are not fatal.","Compounds as described herein may be administered to a subject. As used herein, a \u201csubject\u201d may be a human, non-human primate, mammal, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat and the like. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, or suspected of having or at risk for having acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration. Diagnostic methods for various cancers, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, and diagnostic methods for acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration and the clinical delineation of cancer, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, salivary gland carcinoma, or endometrial cancer, diagnoses and the clinical delineation of acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, ovarian cysts, polycystic ovary disease, precocious puberty, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or age-related macular degeneration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.","Compounds described herein may also be used in assays and for research purposes. Definitions used include ligand-dependent activation of the androgen receptor (AR) by androgens such as dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or the synthetic androgen (R1881) used for research purposes. Ligand-independent activation of the AR refers to transactivation of the AR in the absence of androgen (ligand) by, for example, stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway with forskolin (FSK). Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit both FSK and androgen (e.g. R1881, a synthetic androgen) induction of ARE-luciferase (ARE-luc). Constitutive activity of the AR refers to splice variants lacking the AR ligand-binding domain. Such compounds may block a mechanism that is common to both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of the AR, as well as constitutively active splice variants of the AR that lack ligand-binding domain. This could involve any step in activation of the AR including dissociation of heatshock proteins, essential posttranslational modifications (e.g., acetylation, phosphorylation), nuclear translocation, protein-protein interactions, formation of the transcriptional complex, release of co-repressors, and\/or increased degradation. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit ligand-only activity and may interfere with a mechanism specific to ligand-dependent activation (e.g., accessibility of the ligand binding domain (LBD) to androgen). Numerous disorders in addition to prostate cancer involve the androgen axis (e.g., acne, hirsutism, alopecia, benign prostatic hyperplasia) and compounds interfering with this mechanism may be used to treat such conditions. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may only inhibit FSK induction and may be specific inhibitors to ligand-independent activation of the AR. These compounds and compositions may interfere with the cascade of events that normally occur with FSK and\/or PKA activity or any downstream effects that may play a role on the AR (e.g. FSK increases MAPK activity which has a potent effect on AR activity). Examples may include an inhibitor of cAMP and or PKA or other kinases. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may induce basal levels of activity of the AR (no androgen or stimulation of the PKA pathway). Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may increase induction by R1881 or FSK. Such compounds and compositions may stimulate transcription or transactivation of the AR.","Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit activity of the androgen receptor. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) also causes ligand-independent activation of the AR in LNCaP cells and can be used in addition to FSK.","Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this disclosure or for use in this disclosure may be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, stent, etc. Also, implants may be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time.","It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected by medical practitioners. The amount of active compound(s) in the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.","The compounds described herein may be used for in vivo or in vitro research uses (i.e. non-clinical) to investigate the mechanisms of orphan and nuclear receptors (including steroid receptors such as the androgen receptor). Furthermore, these compounds may be used individually or as part of a kit for in vivo or in vitro research to investigate signal transduction pathways and\/or the activation of orphan and nuclear receptors using recombinant proteins, cells maintained in culture, and\/or animal models.","Various alternative embodiments and examples of the disclosure are described herein. These embodiments and examples are illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure. The following examples are provided for purposes of illustration, not limitation.","All non-aqueous reactions were performed in flame-dried round bottomed flasks. The flaks were fitted with rubber septa and reactions were conducted under a positive pressure of argon unless otherwise specified. Stainless steel syringes were used to transfer air- and moisture-sensitive liquids. Flash column chromatography was performed as described by Still et al. (Still, W. C.; Kahn, M.; Mitra, A. 1978, 43, 2923) using 230-400 mesh silica gel. Thin-layer chromatography was performed using aluminium plates pre-coated with 0.25 mm 230-400 mesh silica gel impregnated with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm). Thin-layer chromatography plates were visualized by exposure to ultraviolet light and a \u201cSeebach\u201d staining solution (700 mL water, 10.5 g Cerium (IV) sulphate tetrahydrate, 15.0 g molybdato phosphoric acid, 17.5 g sulphuric acid) followed by heating (\u02dc1 min) with a heating gun (\u02dc250\u00b0 C.). Organic solutions were concentrated on B\u00fcchi R-114 rotatory evaporators at reduced pressure (15-30 torr, house vacuum) at 25-40\u00b0 C.","Commercial regents and solvents were used as received. All solvents used for extraction and chromatography were HPLC grade. Normal-phase Si gel Sep Paks\u2122 were purchased from waters, Inc. Thin-layer chromatography plates were Kieselgel 60F. All synthetic reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and Fisher Scientific Canada.","Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H NMR) spectra were recorded at 25\u00b0 C. using a Bruker 400 with inverse probe and Bruker 400 spectrometers, are reported in parts per million on the \u03b4 scale, and are referenced from the residual protium in the NMR solvent (CDCl: \u03b4 7.24 (CHCl)). Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C NMR) spectra were recorded with a Bruker 400 spectrometer, are reported in parts per million on the \u03b4 scale, and are referenced from the carbon resonances of the solvent (CDCl: \u03b4 77.23). Spectral features are tabulated in the following order: chemical shift (\u03b4, ppm); multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, m=multiplet, br=broad); coupling constant (J, Hz, number of protons).","LNCaP cells were employed for experiments because they are well-differentiated human prostate cancer cells in which ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation of AR by FSK has been characterized (Nazareth et al 1996 271, 19900-19907; and Sadar 1999 274, 7777-7783). LNCaP cells express endogenous AR and secrete prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (Horoszewicz et al 1983 43, 1809-1818). LNCaP cells can be grown either as monolayers in cell culture or as tumors in the well-characterized xenograft model that progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in castrated hosts (Sato et al 1996 58, 139-146; Gleave et al 1991 51, 3753-3761; Sato et al 1997 57, 1584-1589; and Sadar et al 2002 1(8), 629-637). R1881 (a synthetic androgen) is employed since it is stable and avoids problems associated with the labile physiological ligand dihydrotestosterone (DHT).","One well characterized ARE-driven reporter gene construct that has been used extensively is the PSA (6.1 kb) enhance\/promoter which contains several AREs and is highly inducible by androgens as well as by FSK (Ueda et al 2002 A 277, 7076-7085).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0233","num":"0235"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00101","num":"00101"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00101","he":"77.72mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US09173939-20151103-C00101.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in mineral oil, 1750 mg, 43.80 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added slowly to a stirred solution of Bisphenol A (10000 mg, 43.80 mmol, 1 equiv) in anhydrous dimethyl formamide (30 mL), at room temperature, and the contents were stirred under an atmosphere of argon for 20 min.
