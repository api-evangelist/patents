U.S. Provisional Patent application No. 61\/161,188 is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The invention described herein may be manufactured, used, and licensed by or for the United States Government.","1. Technical Field","The embodiments herein generally relate to computerized image systems and, more particularly, to detection systems for comparing changes in imagery.","2. Description of the Related Art","The highly variable nature of radar measurements has plagued automatic target detection algorithm developers for decades. In particular, the variability introduced (in certain circumstances) by system noise and synthetic aperture processing compound the problem for small targets. While a change detection mode of operation may allow the detector to combat these effects, the false alarm rate can still remain unacceptably high. This is even true when the highly popular ratio-based tests are applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems.","One method of addressing this problem is to exploit spatial or temporal averaging to reduce the variance of the underlying random phenomena. If only a single pass, or look, is available for this purpose, then multiple looks for averaging must be synthesized, either through spatial averaging or sub-aperture processing. This implies that the resulting multi-look averaged SAR image will likely have lower resolution than the non-averaged one. Such a trade-off, however, is often reasonable, especially if the targets of intent comprise several image pixels. Even with spatial or temporal averaging, however, the false alarm rate often remains too high.","One can also address the false alarm problem by setting various thresholds to eliminate (in some way) clearly unsuitable samples from consideration. These thresholds can be incorporated either as floors for the denominator and numerator values used to form the ratio, or as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d for considering pixel locations as possible change locations. If a pixel location fails to pass the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d, it is eliminated from consideration. Unfortunately, such an algorithmic modification adds complexity, and while it should effectively eliminate certain false alarms, it also creates new parameters\u2014the threshold\u2014that must be determined. For a radar system operating at an extremely low grazing angle, however, the benefits of false alarm reduction may well outweigh any drawbacks due to increased algorithmic complexity. Under these operating conditions, the SAR images produced by the system would most likely contain long shadows and other regions of low intensity due to heavy forward scattering. Hence, the denominator of the ratio test would often contain small values, and the resulting ratio would be artificially large.","A change detection system compares imagery (i.e. a two-dimensional representation of a scene) collected at different times to determine if any changes have occurred. Typically, the image pixels indicate the amount of energy reflected or emitted from a particular location (e.g. a photograph or a synthetic aperture radar image). One commonly implemented change detection system utilizes a ratio test, calculating the ratio of pixel values from the same location and comparing this ratio to a pre-determined threshold. In fact, ratio-based change detection has been shown to be optimal under certain operating conditions. The system designates locations with pixel ratios exceeding the threshold as being change locations. Unfortunately, such a system is unable to operate effectively in the presence of noisy, imperfect image data. Some attempts to modify the system have been made, but these approaches generally are ad hoc and fail to provide a systematic approach to the problem.","In view of the foregoing, the embodiments herein provide a system and method for self-calibrating an automatic, surveillance-based change detection system operating on noisy imagery comprising a first sensor that detects a first image co-registered with a second image, wherein the first image and the second image each comprise pixels of a noisy image of a scene; a second sensor that detects the second image co-registered with the first image, wherein co-registration of the first image with the second image comprises pixels from different images corresponding to a same location within the scene; a calibration factor module that receives co-registered imagery data of the first image and the second image and produces a calibration factor based on the co-registered images; a metric calculator that directly or indirectly receives the co-registered imagery data and directly or indirectly receives the calibration factor and produces a modified ratio of pixel values corresponding to the first image and the second image from the same location within the scene; and a modified ratio test module that compares the modified ratio to a pre-determined threshold ratio value.","The noisy image comprises synthetic aperture radar imagery, grainy photography, and low signal-to-noise ratio video frames. The metric calculator sorts pixel values in the first image. The metric calculator groups the sorted pixels according to value such that all pixels within an interval of a particular length are combined to form at least one pixel set, makes a list of pixel locations within each of the at least one pixel set, and calculates a mean pixel value for each of the at least one pixel set. The metric calculator selects a set of pixel locations from one of the at least one pixel set, extracts spatially corresponding pixel values from the second image, and calculates a mean value of the pixel values from the second image. The metric calculator plots the calculated mean values for the at least one pixel set from the first image, and plots the calculated mean values for pixel sets from the second image, wherein the plot corresponding to the second image is plotted over the plot corresponding to the first image.","The metric calculator records a corresponding value where a slope of the plots corresponding to the first image and the second image begin to correspond with one another. The metric calculator adjusts the plot corresponding to the second image so that the plot corresponding to the second image overlays the plot corresponding to the first image when the interval of the particular length is greater than the corresponding value, and wherein the amount of vertical offset between the plots comprises the calibration factor. The metric calculator applies the calibration factor to the second image.","Another embodiment provides a method for self-calibrating an automatic, surveillance-based change detection system operating on noisy imagery, wherein the method comprises receiving a first image that has been co-registered with a second image, wherein the first image and the second image each comprise pixels of a noisy image of a scene; receiving the second image that has been co-registered with the first image, wherein co-registration of the first image with the second image comprises pixels from different images corresponding to a same location within the scene; producing a calibration factor based on the co-registered images; and producing a modified ratio of pixel values corresponding to the first image and the second image from the same location within the scene, wherein the modified ratio equals pixel values corresponding to the first image divided by the maximum of (1) the pixel values corresponding to the second image and (2) the value where the slope of graphical plots corresponding to the first image and the second image begin to correspond with one another, for example the selected \u201cfloor\u201d xwhere the first image line and second image line intersect and begin to correspond to one another as illustrated in .","The method further comprises sorting pixel values in the first image; grouping the sorted pixels according to value such that all pixels within an interval of a particular length are combined to form at least one pixel set, making a list of pixel locations within each of the at least one pixel set, and calculating a mean pixel value for each of the at least one pixel set; selecting a set of pixel locations from one of the at least one pixel set, extracting spatially corresponding pixel values from the second image, and calculating a mean value of the pixel values from the second image; plotting the calculated mean values for the at least one pixel set from the first image, and plotting the calculated mean values for pixel sets from the second image, wherein the plot corresponding to the second image is plotted over the plot corresponding to the first image; recording the value where the slope of the plots corresponding to the first image and the second image begin to correspond with one another; adjusting the plot corresponding to the second image so that the plot corresponding to the second image overlays the plot corresponding to the first image when the interval of the particular length is greater than the corresponding value, and wherein the amount of vertical offset between the plots comprises the calibration factor; and applying the calibration factor to the second image.","These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood, however, that the following descriptions, while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof, are given by way of illustration and not of limitation.

The embodiments herein enhance the performance of the resulting, modified ratio-based change detection system. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to , where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures, there are shown preferred embodiments.","Generally, the embodiments herein enhance a ratio-based change detection system  based on a SAR system's current noise and clutter background characteristics. The approach hinges on the assumption that SAR magnitude images of the same terrain should remain essentially the same for two runs that are collected only minutes apart using the same platform trajectory.

In particular, the embodiments provide a similarity metric that quantifies both spatial and magnitude image correlation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","104","106","104","106","100","106","107"]},"The embodiments herein may be configured for use on a surveillance-based change detection system that re-visits an area under surveillance within several hours or days (as opposed to months). The imaging sensors ,  are assumed to produce noisy imagery; and examples of such data include synthetic aperture radar imagery, grainy photography, or frames from low-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) video. The inputted images ,  are co-registered so that the same pixels from different images correspond to the same location within a scene. A block diagram outlining the metric block  is illustrated in greater detail in , which further illustrates how the method provided by the embodiments herein could be implemented into an existing legacy system. The various blocks in  not surrounded by dashed lines correspond to the metric block  of .","As depicted in , image  is co-registered with image  as provided in block ; and image  is co-registered with image  as indicated in block . Then, the pixel values in image  are sorted as shown in block . Then, as indicated in block , the sorted pixels are first grouped according to value, whereby all pixels within an interval of length x (expressed in dB), which are specified by the user, are combined to form a set (and typically a plurality of sets). Second, a list of the pixel locations with each set is made, and third, the mean pixel value for each pixel set is calculated.","At this point the process branches to block  and block . In block , a set of pixel locations is selected from one of the newly created lists from block .

When included as a subsystem in an existing ratio-based change detection system, the subsystem  reduces false alarms for a given probability of detection.","The embodiments herein provide a technique to determine realistic threshold values for incorporation into a modified ratio test ; e.g., excluding small values from the denominator of the ratio. The technique is based on a preliminary pair of \u201cno change\u201d or \u201ccalibration\u201d runs together with the assumption that SAR data from the same terrain (i.e., image) collected minutes or possibly even hours or days apart will produce similar SAR images. After a small amount of post-processing the major differences between the images should be due to system noise and subtle image misalignment.","Heuristically stated, a metric, as used in accordance with the embodiments herein, is defined as part of the algorithm modifications that should indicate which pixel locations within a scene correspond to actual physical \u201creflectors\u201d. That is, one should be able to use the metric to distinguish pixels within a shadowed, noise-like region from those due to a reasonably-sized target or clutter discretes. The resulting definition involves the correlation between two images in both spatial location and a pixel magnitude. If the images are spatially co-registered, one would expect to see pixel values from a geographical region in one image similar to those from the corresponding geographical region in the second image. Similarly, if the values are not similar (as determined by the metric), then either a change has occurred from one data collection to the next or the region under consideration is noise-like. In fact, if the reference pixels from one of the images were all extremely close to some low value, then one might expect the average from the spatially corresponding pixels in the second image to approach the average calculated for noise alone. This would especially be true even if the reference \u201cnoise\u201d pixels\u2014all independent, identically distributed random samples\u2014were all selected to be very much below the noise average.","This observation suggests an approach for defining a useful metric as follows: one image is selected as a reference image and all of the image pixels are sorted according to magnitude. Then, a bin size (in a log-scale) is selected, and a specified interval (also a log scale, between a specified minimum value and a specified maximum value) is divided into a collection of contiguous bins. Next, each of the reference pixels are placed into the bin that includes its log scale magnitude. Thereafter, one of the bins is selected, and all of the coordinates for pixels within that bin are tabulated. Then, the spatially corresponding pixels are located in the second image, and the root mean square (RMS) average for all of the pixel values from each of the images are separately calculated. As noted above, if the samples were from a \u201cnoise\u201d region, one would expect the average from the second image to approach the average value of noise. If the samples were due to target or clutter, however, one would expect them to be correlated and their averages to be close to one another.","Let \u03b8={I(x)} represent the set of indices in the reference image corresponding to pixel intensity, x. That is, {I(x)} includes the indices of all reference image pixels with intensities falling within the same bin as x. Let F(n) and F(n) represent M\u00d7N images indexed by the unique integer n corresponding to the two-dimensional pixel coordinate (x,y). This value of n is calculated according to the formula:\n\n\u2003\u2003(1)\n","Hence, one can define the value of the metric at pixel intensity x as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"m","mo":"=","mrow":{"mfrac":[{"msqrt":[{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"\u2208","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","ref"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"z"}}}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"msup":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["F","test"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mn":"2"}}},{"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"\u2208","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["I","ref"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"z"}}}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["F","ref"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"i"}},"mn":"2"}}}]},{"mi":["\u03b1","\u03b2"]}],"mo":"="}},{"mi":"z","mo":"\u2208","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["z","min"]},{"mi":["z","max"]}],"mo":","}}}],"mo":[",",","]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":["min ","max "]},"From equation (2) one can immediately identify an intuitive, graphical method of evaluating the metric.

This value of x is denoted as x and it is incorporated into the modified ratio test  as further described below.","With respect to ratio test modifications, the threshold, x is intended to discriminate pixels that exceed a noise floor from those that do not; so, values in the denominator that are less than the threshold are set equal to the threshold.

Since the data are to represent samples from a coherent SAR system, one may create both real and imaginary samples. The real and imaginary noise samples are assumed to be white and follow a Gaussian distribution with means, \u03bc=0 and variance \u03c3=\u00bd. That is, they are N(0,\u00bd) random variables (RVs). The \u201csignal+noise\u201d samples are also complex and comprise a constant magnitude signal with a random phase plus Gaussian, N(0,\u00bd) noise. This formulation allows one to systematically vary the SNR across a wide range of values. A particular pixel value may be expressed mathematically using the expression:\n\n(,\u03a6)+Noise(),\u2003\u2003(4)\n\nwhere srepresents the signal magnitude from region i (zero in the case of noise alone), \u03a6 represents the random phase (i.e. arctan (imaginary (s(n,\u03a6))\/real (s(n, \u03a6))), and n denotes the index corresponding to a particular image pixel.\n","The simulated scene comprises a \u201cnoise-only\u201d region and several \u201ctarget plus noise\u201d regions, as illustrated in the bottom image of . The relative shading indicates the dynamic range of the pixel intensities, where black dots in the top image of  indicate the location of low-intensity samples (between \u221260 dB and \u221215 dB relative to the average noise intensity (power)). The average noise power is scaled within the scene of unity, and also the signal (target) level is scaled in increments of 0.5 dB relative to this ambient noise level. This systematic increase in the target level begins at 1 dB; however, target levels of 0 dB, \u22123 dB and \u22126 dB are also included for purposes of comparison. While the phase of an underlying target data sample is random, its magnitude is fixed; this simplifies the process of re-scaling targets samples to different intensities. Also, two of these simulated scenes are created\u2014one that serves as the reference image and another that serves as the test image. In addition, spatially averaged versions of the reference and test images are created to determine the effects of spatial average on the effectiveness of the metric.","Based on the bottom image of , it is expected that the smallest pixel values are spatially localized to either the \u201cnoise only\u201d region or one of the lowest \u201ctarget+noise\u201d regions (e.g. target level of \u22126 dB, \u22123 dB, or 0 dB). This is exactly what is observed as depicted by the imagery in the top image of . Again, here, black dots indicate locations of samples that are between \u221260 dB and \u221215 dB relative to the average noise power. It is qualitatively clear from the imagery that the samples are indeed located within the regions that are predicted.","Because the corresponding test image samples are independent of those from the reference image, one might initially expect the average power of these test samples to approach the average power of noise without exception. A closer examination of the simulation hypotheses, however, indicates that this assumption is not valid when spatial averaging is absent (i.e., for non-average data). As illustrated in , one should actually expect the non-averaged \u201cnoise data\u201d to be biased slightly high, due to the percentage of samples coming from higher-intensity \u201ctarget+noise\u201d regions. These samples approach a higher \u201ctarget+noise\u201d average instead of the \u201cnoise\u201d average, resulting in the observed bias. Since spatial averaging reduces the variance of pixel values within a particular region, it ensures that a larger percentage of the lowest pixel values are located within the expected \u201cnoise only\u201d spatial region. Hence, the incorporation of spatial averaging should drive the test curves closer to the underlying \u201cnoise only\u201d value for extremely low reference values, as evident in the plots of , wherein metric values are shown as calculated for original and spatially averaged versions of the data. The bin size used is 0.125 dB. The bias has been eliminated even after averaging with a 3\u00d73 spatial window. A detailed discussion of this phenomenon is included in the Appendix below.","With respect to an analysis of the metric provided by the embodiments herein using actual measured SAR data, we developed a synthetic impulse reconstruction (SIRE) radar system and employed it to collect data sets suitable for analysis for the proposed metric. Since the SIRE radar's implemented cross-range resolution is coarse by modern SAR standards, the approximation described above should be somewhat more accurate. In addition, of particular interest is the magnitude statistics for the same pixel in different images\u2014not in the magnitude statistics of multiple pixels from a given region in the same image.","During testing, three runs are selected from the SIRE data set for use in determining the suitably of the metric for change detection (CD) algorithm enhancement. First, a ratio-based CD algorithm is applied to the original data to establish a qualitative baseline. Next, the metric is implemented and is used to determine parameters incorporated into the enchanced CD algorithm. Finally, the potential benefits realized through implementation of the enhanced change detector are analyzed. The metric evaluations utilize the graphical techniques illustrate in , while the CD algorithm evaluation utilizes direct comparisons of output statistics calculated for each pixel value within the imagery.","First, the implementation of an un-modified version of the ratio-based CD algorithm applied to the original (non-averaged) data occurs. The images used for this experiment have incorporated changes that are relatively small. For example, one of the \u201cchanges\u201d comprises the insertion of a metal object into a box and another \u201cchange\u201d includes the disturbance of tin cans inside a plastic bag. All of the images have a 40 dB dynamic range (i.e., 40 dB down from a common, artificially introduced peak value).","A change detection image is created for two different scenarios. The change detection image is formed by evaluating the ratio at each pixel location and assigning the result to that pixel location in a new image array. A nominal (extremely low) threshold is also included in order to slightly reduce the number of small denominator values encountered by the test. The first of the two scenarios operates in a true CD mode. The second scenario, however, operates in a pseudo-CD mode. The resulting imagery comprises one detection image for each scenario. Several target pixels are between approximately the 19 dB to 25 dB levels, indicating that they are only 10 to 15 dB above the prevalent false alarm levels, which are between approximately the 8 dB to 11 dB levels. The results of the experiment demonstrate that, under realistic operating conditions, enhancements to the ratio-based test are needed to reduce the number of potential false alarms.","Next, detection images are taken for an enhanced ratio test. There is an increase in the number of target pixel values falling between 15 and 25 dB (i.e., near the peak value). Additionally, there is an increase in the number of background pixel values equal to 0 dB. Finally, the process is repeated for spatially averaged data formed by convolving each run with a 15\u00d715 rectangular window. The averaged data is then used to create detection imagery for the enhanced and un-enhanced versions of the CD test as described above. Thus, four additional images are created\u2014two for the enhanced ratio test and two for the un-enhanced ratio test. These resulting images indicate that the enhanced version of the CD test removes a large number of potential false alarms through the incorporation of a suitably selected \u201cfloor\u201d.","The techniques provided by the embodiments herein may be implemented on an integrated circuit chip (not shown). The chip design is created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer transmits the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer.
