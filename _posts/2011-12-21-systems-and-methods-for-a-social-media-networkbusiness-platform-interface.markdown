{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Some embodiments relate to social media networks and business platforms. More specifically, some embodiments relate to systems and methods that may facilitate an interface between a social media network and business platform.","Many people exchange information using social media networks, such as by posting text messages, pictures, and\/or videos on Facebook, twitter, and the like. In some cases, people use social media networks to share information relevant to a business enterprise. For example, a person might provide feedback or comments about a product or server he or she has used, suggest ideas for a new product, or complain about some aspect of a business enterprise.","A business enterprise may therefore be interested in making use of this type of information For example, company might want to monitor and leverage the unstructured information available on social media networks by converting the information to structured business data, consolidating it in one or more backend business platforms, and executing business actions according to a defined task. Similarly, a business might want to automatically distribute information using social media networks (e.g., based on data stored at a business platform). Note, however, that there are many different types of social media networks and business platforms. In addition, these systems are usually disconnected and represent different types of data (e.g., structured versus unstructured).","Accordingly, an efficient mechanism for providing an interface between social media networks and business platforms may be addressed by some embodiments herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","100","120","150","110","120","120","100"]},"According to some embodiments, an efficient mechanism for exchanging information and\/or actions between the business platform gateway  and social media networks  may be provided. Consider, for example,  which illustrates a method  that might be performed, for example, by some or all of the elements of the system  described with respect to  according to some embodiments. The flow charts described herein do not imply a fixed order to the steps, and embodiments of the present invention may be practiced in any order that is practicable. Note that any of the methods described herein may be performed by hardware, software, or any combination of these approaches. For example, a computer-readable storage medium may store thereon instructions that when executed by a machine result in performance according to any of the embodiments described herein.","At S, information associated with a task may be received, and the received information may include a trigger entity and a related action entity. The trigger entity may be, for example, associated with a social media network. By ways of examples, the trigger entity might be associated with: (i) a post, (ii) a link, (iii) a like indication, (iv) a group join, (v) a social media event, (vi) a comment, (vii) a rating, (viii) a review, (ix) a status, (x) a picture, (xi) audio information, and\/or (xii) video information. According to some embodiments, the trigger entity might be associated with a text search, including a keyword search, natural language processing, and\/or a speech-to-text conversion process. The information may be received, for example, from a designer at design time or from a database at run time.","At S, a social media network\/business platform interface may monitor a trigger condition associated with the trigger entity. For example, the social media network\/business platform interface might monitor Facebook looking for posts that mention a particular company or product. At S, the social media network\/business platform interface may \u201cautomatically\u201d detect that the trigger condition is satisfied. As used herein, the term \u201cautomated\u201d may refer to an action that may be performed with little or no human intervention. For example, the social media network\/business platform interface might automatically detect that a person has entered a message on twitter that includes a particular keyword or phrase. According to some embodiments, a social media network\/business platform interface may provide the ability to have an operator manually control execution of an action through a user interface (e.g., he or she might be asked for approval before an automatically suggested action is taken by the platform).","At S, one or more actions defined by the action entity related to the trigger entity may be automatically performed responsive to the detection that occurred at S. According to some embodiments, the action entity may be associated with a business platform. For example, the action entity might be associated with the business platform sending an email, creating a contact entity, creating a business object, updating an existing entity, and\/or a business work item. Consider, for example, a social media network\/business platform interface that detects a person \u201cliking\u201d a particular product on his or her Facebook page. In this case, the social media network\/business platform interface might automatically arrange for a new contact or lead entity to be created within the business platform based on that persons email address, name, etc.","Thus, activities on social media networks may automatically result in actions be executed in connection with a business platform. Note, however, that the reverse flow of events may also be performed in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example, a trigger entity may be associated with a business platform while the associated action entity is associated with a social media network. Consider, for example, a social media network\/business platform interface that detects that a new product is being introduced or a new milestone has been reached based on information available within a business platform. As a result of this trigger, the social media network\/business platform interface might arrange to automatically update a social media network page or post.","According to some embodiments, task triggers and actions may be configured by a user via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) at design time. The GUI may provide, for example, a relatively quick and easy way for a business to define a particular integration between social media networks and the business's own platform or gateway. According to some embodiments, a GUI design tool may be used define the gateway\/social media network tasks and a run time component may execute the tasks defined in the design tool.","For example,  illustrates a task data editor display  in accordance with some embodiments. The display  includes a social network area  that can be used to select one or more networks (e.g., Facebook and twitter) as well as one or more elements associated with each network (e.g., Facebook public posts and links). The display  also includes a gateway area  that can be used to select one or more business platforms and elements associated with each platform (e.g., a lead service contact). According to some embodiments, a search function may be provided in the social network area  and\/or gateway area  to help a designer find appropriate elements.","An \u201cadd new task\u201d icon  may be selected by a design to create a new task which will then appear as displayed task . The displayed task  may include a social entity (e.g., Facebook post), an associated gateway entity, and an arrow indicating which way the displayed task  is to operate (e.g., either a social network trigger may result in a gateway action or a gateway trigger may result in a social network trigger). Moreover, one icon within the displayed task  may be selected to define filtering information and another icon may be selected to define mapping information for the displayed task .","For example, selecting the filtering icon within the displayed task  of the task data editor display  of  may result in the appearance of a filter options pop-up display  as illustrated in  according to some embodiments. The filter options display  may be used by a designer to define one or more filtering criteria for a task. For example, selection of a simple text icon  may cause the task to look for the appearance of a keyword (e.g., \u201clike\u201d or \u201clove\u201d) on a social media network. Selection of an advanced icon  might be used to define more complicated filters, such as those associated with natural language processing, speech-to-text conversion, and\/or an optical character recognition process. Similarly, selection of a custom icon  might let a designer define a customized filter.","Selecting the mapping icon within the displayed task  of the task data editor display  of  may result in the appearance of a mapping options pop-up display  as illustrated in  according to some embodiments. The mapping options display  may be used by a designer to define property mappings between a social media entity and a gateway entity. For example, elements of a trigger entity  might be mapped to associated elements of an action entity  (e.g., a social media network \u201cuser name\u201d might be used to populate a \u201ccreator\u201d field in a gateway lead application). Moreover, the mapping options display  may include icons that may be selected by a designer to create a mapping, update an existing mapping, delete a mapping, create and automatically link a mapping, and\/or define customized mapping for a task.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIGS. 3 through 5","FIG. 6","FIG. 1"],"b":["600","600","610","600","620","650","610","620","620"]},"The social media network\/business platform interface  may include a run time job scheduler component that takes tasks data defined using a task data editor (design time)  and executes the task in a configurable time frame (e.g., every 15 minutes). The social media network\/business platform interface  may also include third party extension points such as points associated with hooks or filters for the tasks. According to some embodiments, a gateway connection within the social media network\/business platform interface  may access authentication tokens (e.g., an account name and password) to facilitate communication with the business platform gateways . Similarly, a social network connector may access authentication tokens to facilitate communication with the social media networks . Note that an administrator user interface  may provide reporting data to an administrator associated with the performance of the system  and\/or for configuration of the system .","In this way, the system  may extend a task, such as by sending an email and creating a complaint within a business platform gateway  in response to a comment on the Facebook wall. Moreover, embodiments described herein may facilitate a relatively quick and straightforward way for businesses to define social media integration with respect to existing enterprise systems. Note that a business may want to monitor social media networks  and execute business actions based on newly published information. For example, a new negative post or comment published on a Facebook page might trigger creation of new complaint object in an enterprise system. Moreover, embodiments may allow for an update of social media based on events that occur within enterprise systems. For example, a new advertising campaign object created in a Client Relation Management (\u201cCRM\u201d) system might automatically create a new post on a company's Facebook page.","The system  of  may support an analysis of a substantial amount of social media data and filtering of that data before it is stored within enterprise systems (this may help prevent storing irrelevant data and prevent unnecessary business transaction executions). Moreover, the analysis of social media data may be intelligent and support sentimental analysis to help understand if a social media event is positive or negative. According to some embodiments, the system  may detect a major occurrence according to a configurable threshold (e.g., an action might automatically be taken if a product is mentioned 5,000 times on twitter in a single day).","According to some embodiments, the system may supports extensibility points in three major areas: (i) multiple filtering and analytical mechanisms, (ii) implementation of additional social media channels (Google+, LinkedIn, etc.), and (iii) programmatically extending a task by having an Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) for developers to hook into the task process before (or after) an action is executed. Moreover, gateway services created for other needs (e.g., mobile application) or out-of-the-box services can be leveraged in associated with social media. Further, new tasks may be added through the designer in a relatively quick and easy fashion and may be done by a business user with little or no developer knowledge. According to some embodiments, the system  may access pre-defined tasks which are common to multiple businesses (using gateway out-of-the-box services). According to some embodiments, the social media entities may not be an exact mirror of the social media API but instead may be \u201csmart\u201d entities hiding business knowledge. For example, a single entity may represent both non-administrative posts on a page and include the author details (thus hiding multiple calls to a Facebook API). Moreover, a gateway push\/event mechanism may be used to update social networks based on events that occurred within business platform systems.","The processes described herein may be performed by any suitable device or apparatus.  is one example of a platform  according to some embodiments. The platform  may be, for example, associated with some or all of the elements described in connection with system  of  and system  of . The platform  comprises a processor , such as one or more commercially available Central Processing Units (CPUs) in the form of one-chip microprocessors, coupled to a communication device  configured to communicate via a communication network (not shown in ). The communication device  may be used to communicate, for example, with one or more remote social media networks and\/or business platforms. The platform  further includes an input device  (e.g., a mouse and\/or keyboard to enter task triggers, actions and associated parameters) and an output device  (e.g., a computer monitor to display reports and\/or tables to an administrator).","The processor  also communicates with a storage device . The storage device  may comprise any appropriate information storage device, including combinations of magnetic storage devices (e.g., a hard disk drive), optical storage devices, and\/or semiconductor memory devices. The storage device  stores a program  and\/or social integration server  for controlling the processor . The processor  performs instructions of the programs , , and thereby operates in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein. For example, the processor  may receive information associated with a task, including a trigger entity and a related action entity. The processor  may then monitor a trigger condition associated with the trigger entity and automatically detect when the trigger condition is satisfied. Moreover, responsive to that detection, the processor  may perform an action defined by the action entity related to the trigger entity.","The programs ,  may be stored in a compressed, uncompiled and\/or encrypted format. The programs ,  may furthermore include other program elements, such as an operating system, a database management system, and\/or device drivers used by the processor  to interface with peripheral devices. As used herein, information may be \u201creceived\u201d by or \u201ctransmitted\u201d to, for example: (i) the platform  from another device; or (ii) a software application or module within the platform  from another software application, module, or any other source.","In some embodiments (such as shown in ), the storage device  stores a task database . The task database  may, for example, comprise a database that contains task triggers and\/or actions associated with social media networks and\/or business platforms. Note that the databases mentioned herein are only examples, and additional and\/or different information may be stored therein. Moreover, various databases might be split or combined in accordance with any of the embodiments described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","802","804","806","808","810","802","804","806","808","810","802","804","806","808","810","800"]},"The task identifier  may be, for example, a unique alphanumeric code identifying a task that is to be or has been executed. The trigger entity  may be associated with a condition or rule associated with the task identifier . For example, the trigger entity  might cause the system to monitor Facebook posts for a keyword, social media network \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfriend\u201d indications, and\/or data stored within a business platform. The action entity  might define what action should be automatically performed when the condition of the trigger entity  is satisfied. For example, the action entity  might be associated with creation of a business object, sending an email, and\/or generating a Facebook post. The status  may indicate whether the task is currently being monitored and\/or whether the task had previously been performed (along with the date and time the task was performed). The task result  might record what action as taken and\/or what data values resulted from execution of the task. Note that entries in the task database  might represent a history log and\/or a current state of a system. Moreover, note that a triggered task may occur many times (e.g., the status  of task identifier  \u201cT\u201d may transition from \u201cmonitoring\u201d to \u201ctriggered\u201d and then a list of all trigger dates and time may be stored in the task database .","It is not clear whether a monitoring status will eventually become Triggered.","Thus, the task database  may facilitate a transfer of unstructured social media data into enterprise systems. Moreover, an intelligent and automatic business transaction may be executed based on a social media event. According to some embodiments, the data in the task database  may be defined by a user via a relatively quick and easy definition of tasks that include filtering and\/or mapping without the need for complex coding. As a result, a generic solution may be provided for a business customer to help him or her define social media integration according to appropriate needs. The customer may modify and\/or add additional tasks as required (instead of developing a specific solution for every scenario that arises).","The following illustrates various additional embodiments of the invention. These do not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments, and those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is applicable to many other embodiments. Further, although the following embodiments are briefly described for clarity, those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes, if necessary, to the above-described apparatus and methods to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications.","Although specific hardware and user interface configurations have been described herein, not that any number of other configurations may be provided in accordance with embodiments of the present invention (e.g., a social media network\/business platform interface and the business platform itself may be remote from each other or co-located). Applicants have discovered that embodiments described herein may be particularly useful in connection with certain types of business information. Note, however, that other types of information may also benefit from the invention.","The present invention has been described in terms of several embodiments solely for the purpose of illustration. Persons skilled in the art will recognize from this description that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described, but may be practiced with modifications and alterations limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
