If the products selected for merchandising are not carefully selected, the merchandising effort may not be successful.","In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of some example embodiments. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.","As described further below, according to various example embodiments of the disclosed subject matter described and claimed herein, systems and methods to merchandise a product based on compatibility are described. Various embodiments are described below in connection with the figures provided herein.","The example embodiments described herein seek to optimize an opportunity to merchandise by selecting products (e.g., items) to display based on compatibility. Items may be parts or components that have an assembly (e.g., parts that fit an application). While many of the example embodiments are discussed in the context of determining compatibility of automotive parts with particular vehicles, it will be appreciated that the methods and systems described herein may be applied to a broad range of compatibility use scenarios (e.g., parts for computers, printers, photo cameras, washing machines, lawn mowers, scooters, buildings, doors, tractors, solar panels, bikes, airplanes, aircrafts, motorcycles, boats, or any other application that may be assembled with parts). Further, it will be appreciated that the methods and systems described herein may be applied to a broad range of technical problems, some of which are described as follows.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":"6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 1B","b":"8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["10","12","14","16","18","10","10","12","14","16","18","12","14","16","18","12","14","16","18","10","12","12","14","12","14"]},"According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, systems and methods to merchandise a product based on compatibility are described. In one embodiment a system may receive a request from a user and associate the request with a user profile. The user profile may include one or more applications that were previously associated with the user. For example, an application may include a vehicle, a computer, a photo camera, an appliance or any other device that may be assembled from compatible parts (e.g., components). In some embodiments the notion of compatibility may extend beyond assembly to include tools for assembly of the application (e.g., wrench, specialized screw driver, etc.), products for maintenance of the application (e.g., printer cartridges, cleaners, lubricants, etc.), manuals pertaining to the application or some other category that may include parts that are in some way compatible with the application. The application may have been previously associated with the user and stored in the user profile based on activities performed by the user. Further, the activity may have explicitly or implicitly identified the application. For example, a purchase activity may explicitly identify a strong association of the application with the user because the purchase implies the user has taken possession of the application. Examples of other activities may include a query activity, a view activity and a watch activity that are respectively related to a particular application. Next, the system may associate the application with items (e.g., parts) that are compatible with the application based on item cluster information to generate a set of candidate items. For example, an item cluster service may receive a product identifier identifying the application, and based on the item cluster information, return product identifiers for items (e.g., parts) that are compatible with the application. The item cluster information may be generated based on content data information that is received from a third party server (e.g., content data provider). For example, the content data provider may communicate catalogue information (e.g., catalogue) or instructional information (e.g., instructional video) that may be utilized to identify items (e.g., parts) that are compatible with the application. Next, the system may select one or more items (e.g., parts) from the candidate items to generate merchandising information that is communicated over a network to the user that entered the request. Accordingly, systems and methods to merchandise a product based on compatibility with an application that is associated with a user are described more fully below.","According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, systems and methods to merchandise a product based on a likelihood of associating an application with a user are discussed. In one embodiment the system may receive a request from a user and associate the request with a user profile. The user profile may include one or more applications with corresponding probabilities. The application and probabilities may have been previously identified and stored in the user profile based on activities performed by the user. Each activity may be associated with a single item (e.g., part) that is compatible with multiple applications. Accordingly, the applications may be assigned probabilities that measure a likelihood of association of the respective applications with the user. For example, a user may purchase tires (e.g., standardized product) that are known to be compatible with two applications, namely, an Audi A1 and a Volkswagen Golf Accordingly, product identifiers for the Audi A1 and the Volkswagen Golf applications may be stored in the user profile along with respective probabilities of 50% and 50% because the applications are, by inference of the purchase, equally associated with the user. Returning to the request, the system may respond to the request by retrieving a predetermined number of applications from the user profile. The applications may be identified for retrieval based on the probabilities mentioned above. For example, the system may retrieve applications with the highest probability of association up to a predetermined maximum number of applications. Next, the system may associate the respective applications with sets of items (e.g., parts) and select one item (e.g., parts) for each of the retrieved applications to generate merchandising information. Finally, the merchandising information may be communicated over a network to the user that entered the request. In some embodiments the probabilities may be updated based on subsequent activities performed by the user. For example, the user may purchase another item that is solely compatible with the Audi A1 application and not the Volkswagen Golf application. In this instance the probability for the Audi A1 may be updated from 50% to 100% and the probability for the Volkswagen Golf may be updated from 50% to 0%. Accordingly, systems and methods to merchandise a product based on a likelihood of association with a user are described more fully below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","76","74","206","208","210","212"]},"An application program interface (API) server  and a web server  are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers . The application servers  host one or more marketplace modules  and payment modules . The application servers  are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers  that facilitate access to one or more databases .","The marketplace modules  may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users that access the network-based marketplace . The payment modules  may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment modules  may allow users to accumulate value in accounts and then to later redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or services) that are made available via the marketplace modules . Value may be accumulated in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as \u201cpoints.\u201d While the marketplace modules  and payment modules  are shown in  to both form part of the network-based marketplace , it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the payment modules  may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the network-based marketplace .","Further, while the networked system  shown in  employs a client-server architecture, embodiments of the present invention are of course not limited to such an architecture and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to-peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace modules  and payment modules  could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities.","The web client  and programmatic client  access the various marketplace modules  and payment modules  via the web interface supported by the web server . Similarly, the programmatic client  accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace modules  and payment modules  via the programmatic interface provided by the API server . The programmatic client  may, for example, be a seller module (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the network-based marketplace  in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client  and the network-based marketplace .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["226","228","200","214","226","200"]},"Marketplace and Payment Modules",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["218","220","200","218","220","224","222"]},"The network-based marketplace  may provide a number of publishing, listing and price-setting mechanisms whereby a seller may list (or publish information concerning) goods or services for sale; a buyer can express interest in or indicate a desire to purchase such goods or services; and a price can be set for a transaction pertaining to the goods or services. To this end, the marketplace and payment modules  and  are shown to include at least one publication module  and one or more auction module(s)  which support auction-format listing and price setting mechanisms (e.g., English, Dutch, Vickrey, Chinese, Double, Reverse auctions, etc.). The various auction modules  may also provide a number of features in support of such auction-format listings, such as a reserve price feature whereby a seller may specify a reserve price in connection with a listing, and a proxy-bidding feature whereby a bidder may invoke automated proxy bidding.","A number of fixed-price modules  may support fixed-price listing formats (e.g., the traditional classified advertisement-type listing or a catalogue listing) and buyout-type listings. Specifically, buyout-type listings (e.g., including the Buy-It-Now (BIN) technology developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, Calif.) may be offered in conjunction with auction-format listings and may allow a buyer to purchase goods or services, which are also being offered for sale via an auction, for a fixed-price that is typically higher than the starting price of the auction.","Store modules(s)  may allow a seller to group listings within a \u201cvirtual\u201d store, which may be branded and otherwise personalized by and for the seller. Such a virtual store may also offer promotions, incentives and features that are specific and personalized to a relevant seller.","Reputation module(s)  may allow users that transact, utilizing the network-based marketplace , to establish, build and maintain reputations, which may be made available and published to potential trading partners. Consider, for example, that where the network-based marketplace  supports person-to-person trading, users may otherwise have no history or other reference information whereby the trustworthiness and credibility of potential trading partners may be assessed. The reputation module(s)  allow a user to establish a reputation within the network-based marketplace  over time, for example, through feedback provided by other transaction partners. Other potential trading partners may then reference such a reputation for the purposes of assessing credibility and trustworthiness.","Personalization modules  may allow users of the network-based marketplace  to personalize various aspects of their interactions with the network-based marketplace . For example a user may, utilizing appropriate personalization modules , create a personalized reference page at which information regarding transactions to which the user is (or has been) a party may be viewed. Further, the personalization modules  may enable a user to personalize listings and other aspects of their interactions with the networked system  and other parties.","The networked system  may support a number of marketplaces that are customized, for example, for specific geographic regions. A version of the networked system  may be customized for the United Kingdom, whereas another version of the networked system  may be customized for the United States. Some of these versions may operate as an independent marketplace, or may be customized (or internationalized) presentations of a common underlying marketplace. The networked system  may accordingly include a number of internationalization modules  that customize information (and\/or the presentation of information) by the networked system  according to predetermined criteria (e.g., geographic, demographic or marketplace criteria). For example, the internationalization modules  may be used to support the customization of information for a number of regional websites that are operated by the networked system .","Navigation of the network-based marketplace  may be facilitated by one or more navigation modules . For example, browse modules may allow users to browse various category, catalogue, or inventory data structures according to which listings may be classified within the networked system . Various other navigation modules  may be provided to supplement the search and browsing modules.","In order to make listings available via the networked system  as visually informing and attractive as possible, the marketplace and payment modules  and  may include one or more imaging modules  with which users may upload images for inclusion within listings. The imaging modules  may also operate to incorporate images within viewed listings. The imaging modules  may also support one or more promotional features, such as image galleries that are presented to potential buyers. For example, sellers may pay an additional fee to have an image included within a gallery of images for promoted items.","Listing creation modules  may allow sellers to conveniently author listings of items (e.g., parts, applications, etc.) pertaining to goods or services that they wish to transact via the network-based marketplace . For example, the listing creation modules  may enable sellers to identify their items as products. The listing management modules  may allow sellers to manage such listings. Specifically, where a particular seller has authored and\/or published a large number of listings, the management of such listings may present a challenge. The listing management modules  may provide a number of features (e.g., auto-relisting, inventory level monitors, etc.) to assist the seller in managing such listings.","One or more post-listing management modules  may also assist sellers with a number of activities that may typically occur post-listing. For example, upon completion of an auction facilitated by one or more auction module(s) , a seller may wish to leave feedback regarding a particular buyer. To this end, the post-listing management modules  may provide an interface to one or more reputation module(s) , so as to allow the seller conveniently to provide feedback regarding multiple buyers to the reputation module(s) .","Dispute resolution module(s)  may provide mechanisms whereby disputes arising between transacting parties may be resolved. For example, the dispute resolution module(s)  may provide guided procedures whereby the parties are guided through a number of steps in an attempt to settle a dispute. In the event that the dispute cannot be settled via the guided procedures, the dispute may be escalated to a third party mediator or arbitrator.","A number of fraud prevention modules  may implement fraud detection and prevention mechanisms to reduce the occurrence of fraud within the network-based marketplace .","Messaging modules  may be responsible for the generation and delivery of messages to users of the network-based marketplace , with such messages, for example, advising users regarding the status of listings at the network-based marketplace  (e.g., providing \u201coutbid\u201d notices to bidders during an auction process or providing promotional and merchandising information to users). Respective messaging modules  may utilize any one of a number of message delivery networks and platforms to deliver messages to users. For example, messaging modules  may deliver electronic mail (e-mail), instant message (IM), Short Message Service (SMS), text, facsimile, or voice (e.g., Voice over IP (VoIP)) messages via the wired network (e.g., the Internet), Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), or wireless (e.g., mobile, cellular, WiFi (e.g., IEEE 802.11 technologies including 802.11n, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a)), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (e.g., WiMAX\u2014IEEE 802.16) networks.","Retrieval modules  may support various searching functions that are made available to buyers to enable buyers to find listings. The network-based marketplace  itself, or one or more parties that transact via the network-based marketplace , may operate loyalty programs that are supported by one or more loyalty promotions module(s) . For example, a buyer may earn loyalty or promotions points for transactions established and\/or concluded with a particular seller, and then be offered a reward for which accumulated loyalty points can be redeemed.","The network-based marketplace  may further include merchandising modules  that may enable merchandising items based on a user profile and cluster item information.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["326","326","328","330","332","328","330","332","332"]},"Data Structures",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 6A","b":["301","224","218","220","305","76","76","76"]},"The tables  also include an items table  in which item records are maintained for goods (e.g., parts) and services that are available to be, or have been, transacted via the network-based marketplace . Item records within the items table  may furthermore be linked to one or more user records within the user table , so as to associate a seller and one or more actual or potential buyers with an item record.","A transaction table  contains a record for each transaction (e.g., a purchase or sale transaction) pertaining to items for which records exist within the items table .","An order table  may be populated with order records, with each order record being associated with an order. Each order, in turn, may be associated with one or more transactions for which records exist within the transaction table .","Bid records within a bids table  may relate to a bid received at the network-based marketplace  in connection with an auction-format listing supported by one or more auction modules , as shown in . A feedback table  may be utilized by one or more reputation modules , in one example embodiment, to construct and maintain reputation information concerning users. A merchandising table  may be used to store information that is utilized to merchandise products. One or more attributes tables  record attribute information pertaining to items for which records exist within the items table . Considering only a single example of such an attribute, the attributes tables  may indicate a currency attribute associated with a particular item, with the currency attribute identifying the currency of a price for the relevant item as specified by a seller. A search table  may store search information that has been entered by a user (e.g., buyer) who is looking for a specific type of listing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0069"},"figref":"FIG. 6B","b":["305","305","400","76","76"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIG. 7A","b":["400","400","412","414","412"]},"The user application information  may include multiple application listings  (e.g., rows) that correspond to different applications (e.g., products) associated with the user. In some embodiments the user application information  may be further organized according to domains. For example, the user application information  may include sections of application listings  dedicated to a particular domain (e.g., trucks, cars, printers, toys, books, etc.). Each application listing  may include a product identifier , a product history , and a probability . For example, the product identifier  may identify a Ford Tacoma Truck as associated with the user because the network-based marketplace  identified the user as purchasing parts for a Ford Tacoma Truck. Accordingly, the product identifier  may indicate that the user is associated with the product by detecting an activity that is related to the product. The product history  may describe the product and events related to the product, as described further below. The probability  may indicate likelihood that the corresponding product is associated with the user. For example, the probability may be high (e.g., 100%) signifying a strong association with the user, or low, signifying a weak association with the user. For example, a probability of 100% may be assigned to a product (e.g., application) for which compatible parts are purchased by the user. Also for example, probabilities of 50% may be assigned to two products for which a user purchases a single part that is identified as compatible with both products (e.g., applications). The probability  may be utilized to provide a basis for ranking the merchandising of items that may be compatible with the user application information .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"figref":"FIG. 7B","b":["417","417","420","422","420","422"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 7C","b":["422","422","422","423","416","424","416","424","424","422","418"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 7D","b":["317","317","430","432","434","436","438"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":"FIG. 8A","b":["430","430","430","1","2","3","4","1","2","3","4","2","4","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 8B","FIG. 8B","FIG. 8A"],"b":["430","430","430","454","456","416","460","460","454","416","456","416","458","458","1","1","1","1","4","1","2","3","4","1","2","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0078","num":"0077"},"figref":"FIG. 9A","b":["432","432","470","472","432","470","416","472","416"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0079","num":"0078"},"figref":"FIG. 9B","b":["434","434","434","416","480","480"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0079"},"figref":["FIG. 10A","FIG. 9A"],"b":["436","436","432","76","436","436","490","492"]},"The commercial content data information  may be purchased from a commercial content provider that operates a third-party server  and utilizes a third-party module  to communicate the commercial content data information  to the network-based marketplace .

For example, the third-party server  may communicate instructional information  in the form of a video. The network-based marketplace  may receive and store the content data information  in a database . Next, the network-based marketplace  may analyze the content data information  to generate item cluster information  that is stored in the database . For example, the network-based marketplace  may generate application information  (e.g., automobile applications) and part information  (automobile parts) (shown in ).","At operation , the client machine  may communicate a request to the network-based marketplace . At operation , at the network-based marketplace , the receiving module  may receive the request, and at operation  the processing module  (shown in ) may associate the request with a user profile . For example, the processing module  may identify the request as originating with a user that has logged onto the network based marketplace  and is communicating from a particular client machine  that may be identified based on the contents of the request. At operation , the processing module  may retrieve a first item listing in that describes an item the form of an application from the user profile . For example, the processing module  may retrieve a product identifier  () that identifies the application. At operation  the processing module  may associate the application with candidate items based on item cluster information . For example, the processing module  may utilize a cluster service that receives a product identifier  for the application, accesses the item cluster information  based on the product identifier  and returns candidate items that are compatible with the application. For example, the cluster service may utilize the product identifier  of the application to access the item cluster information  and retrieve a plurality of candidate items in the form of part information  () (e.g., product identifiers ). At operation , the processing module  may select a second item in the form of an item from the plurality of candidate items based on buying trend information  (). For example, the processing module  may access the product rank  () in the buying trend product information  for each of the candidate items and select the candidate item with the lowest product rank . Accordingly, the processing module  may select the item with the strongest buying trend product information  from the candidate items. At operation , the communication module  may generate a user interface including merchandising information featuring the selected item (e.g., tires) and communicate the user interface to the client machine .","At operation , the client machine  receives the user interface and displays the user interface to the user. For example,  shows a user interface  that includes merchandising information featuring the selected items that are compatible with the same application.","In another embodiment, the processing module  may utilize replacement information  () rather than buying trend information  to select the item from the candidate items at operation . To this end, the processing module  may select an item from the candidate items at operation  based on product replacement information  (). For example, the processing module  may identify the application as a Toyota Tacoma Truck, and one of the candidate items as a tire associated with product replacement information  that indicates the tires need to be replaced. In one embodiment the product replacement information  may include a period of time (e.g., 4 years) that may be compared with the product history  () that is associated with the truck (e.g., application) in the user profile . For example, the product history  may indicate the truck was manufactured five years ago and does not include any purchases of tires. In another embodiment the product replacement information  may include a quantity of miles (e.g., 40,000 miles) that may be compared with the product history  that is associated with the truck (e.g., application). For example, the product history  for the truck may indicate that the odometer on the truck reads 50,000 miles and does not include any purchases of tires.","In another embodiment the communication module  may generate a message rather than a user interface. For example, the communication module  may generate a message including merchandising information that features the selected item (e.g., tires) and communicate the message to an application programming interface at another machine (e.g., server).","In another embodiment the network-based marketplace  may receive the content data information  from an internal data source rather than an external data source. For example, the network-based marketplace  may receive the content data information  from the feedback table  () that is local to the network-based marketplace . Merely for example, the feedback table  may include user comments that describe tires for a Toyota Tacoma Truck. Also for example, the network-based marketplace  may receive the content data information  from the transaction table  that includes records of transactions enabling the identification of purchasing patterns.","In another embodiment, the processing module  may select multiple items from the candidate items and the communication module  may generate merchandising information featuring the multiple items for inclusion in a user interface or a message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0092"},"figref":"FIG. 12A","b":["650","208","76","650","652","208","76"]},"At operation , the receiving module , at the network-based marketplace , may receive the query, and at operation  the processing module  may associate the request with a user profile  for a user, as previously described.

Some embodiments may include a first tier as an interface (e.g., an interface tier) that is relatively free of application processing. Further, a second tier may be a logic tier that performs application processing in the form of logical\/mathematical manipulations of data inputted through the interface level and communicates the results of these logical\/mathematical manipulations to the interface tier and\/or to a backend, or storage, tier. These logical\/mathematical manipulations may relate to certain business rules or processes that govern the software application as a whole. A third, storage, tier may be a persistent storage medium or non-persistent storage medium. In some cases, one or more of these tiers may be collapsed into another, resulting in a two-tier architecture, or even a one-tier architecture. For example, the interface and logic tiers may be consolidated, or the logic and storage tiers may be consolidated, as in the case of a software application with an embedded database. This three-tier architecture may be implemented using one technology, or, as will be discussed below, a variety of technologies. This three-tier architecture, and the technologies through which it is implemented, may be executed on two or more computer systems organized in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. Further, these three tiers may be distributed between multiple computer systems as various software components.","Some example embodiments may include the above illustrated tiers, and processes or operations that make them up, as being written as one or more software components. Common to many of these components is the ability to generate, use, and manipulate data. These components, and the functionality associated with each, may be used by client, server, or peer computer systems. These various components may be implemented by a computer system on an as-needed basis. These components may be written in an object-oriented computer language such that a component-oriented, or object-oriented programming technique can be implemented using a Visual Component Library (VCL), Component Library for Cross Platform (CLX), Java Beans (JB), Java Enterprise Beans (EJB), Component Object Model (COM), Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), or other suitable technique. These components may be linked to other components via various APIs, and then compiled into one complete server, client, and\/or peer software application. Further, these APIs may be able to communicate through various distributed programming protocols as distributed computing components.","Some example embodiments may include remote procedure calls being used to implement one or more of the above illustrated components across a distributed programming environment as distributed computing components. For example, an interface component (e.g., an interface tier) may reside on a first computer system that is remotely located from a second computer system containing a logic component (e.g., a logic tier). These first and second computer systems may be configured in a server-client, peer-to-peer, or some other suitable configuration. These various components may be written using the above illustrated object-oriented programming techniques, and can be written in the same programming language, or a different programming language. Various protocols may be implemented to enable these various components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to write these components. For example, a component written in C++ may be able to communicate with another component written in the Java programming language by using a distributed computing protocol such as a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), or some other suitable protocol. Some embodiments may include the use of one or more of these protocols with the various protocols outlined in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or Transport Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (TCP\/IP) protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data.","Some embodiments may utilize the OSI model or TCP\/IP protocol stack model for defining the protocols used by a network to transmit data. In applying these models, a system of data transmission between a server and client, or between peer computer systems, is illustrated as a series of roughly five layers comprising: an application layer, a transport layer, a network layer, a data link layer, and a physical layer. In the case of software having a three-tier architecture, the various tiers (e.g., the interface, logic, and storage tiers) reside on the application layer of the TCP\/IP protocol stack. In an example implementation using the TCP\/IP protocol stack model, data from an application residing at the application layer is loaded into the data load field of a TCP segment residing at the transport layer. This TCP segment also contains port information for a recipient software application residing remotely. This TCP segment is loaded into the data load field of an IP datagram residing at the network layer. Next, this IP datagram is loaded into a frame residing at the data link layer. This frame is then encoded at the physical layer, and the data transmitted over a network such as an internet, Local Area Network (LAN), WAN, or some other suitable network. In some cases, \u201cinternet\u201d refers to a network of networks. These networks may use a variety of protocols for the exchange of data, including the aforementioned TCP\/IP, and additionally asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), system network architecture (SNA), SDI, or some other suitable protocol. These networks may be organized within a variety of topologies (e.g., a star topology) or structures.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0120","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 19","b":"900"},"The example computer system  includes one or more processors  (e.g., a central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), or both), a main memory  and a static memory , which communicate with each other via a bus .
