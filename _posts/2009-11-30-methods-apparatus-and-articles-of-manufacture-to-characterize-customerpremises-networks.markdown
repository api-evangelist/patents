For example, a communication company and\/or service provider may utilize a plurality of modems (e.g., a plurality of DSL, coaxial and\/or wireless modems) implemented at a central location (e.g., a central office, a vault, a coaxial cable head-end, a wireless access point, etc.) to provide communication services to a plurality of residential gateways (RGs) located at respective customer premises. In general, a central-site modem receives broadband service content from, for example, a backbone server and forms downstream signals to be transmitted to respective customer-premises RGs. Each RG may subsequently deliver all or any portion(s) of a received downstream signal to respective customer-premises devices associated with the RG. Likewise, the central-site modem receives an upstream signal from each of the RGs and\/or customer-premises devices associated with the RGs and provides the data transported in the upstream signal to the backbone server.","Methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture to characterize customer-premises networks are disclosed. A disclosed example method includes retrieving a first plurality of performance parameters for a first time interval for respective ones of a first plurality of customer-premises devices, wherein the first plurality of customer-premises devices form a first customer-premises communication network and each of the first plurality of customer-premises devices is communicatively coupled to a first residential gateway, retrieving a second plurality of performance parameters for a second time interval for the respective ones of the first plurality of customer-premises devices, computing a first metric from the first and second plurality of performance parameters, the first metric representative of a performance variability of the first customer-premises communication network, and comparing the first metric to a second metric representative of a second performance variability of a second customer-premises communication network communicatively coupled to a second residential gateway to determine whether the first customer-premises communication network is operating in accordance with a normal operating condition.","A disclosed example article of manufacture store machine readable instructions which, when executed, cause a machine to retrieve a first plurality of performance parameters for a first time interval for respective ones of a first plurality of customer-premises devices, wherein the first plurality of customer-premises devices form a first customer-premises communication network and each of the first plurality of customer-premises devices is communicatively coupled to a first residential gateway; retrieve a second plurality of performance parameters for a second time interval for the respective ones of the first plurality of customer-premises devices; retrieve a third plurality of performance parameters for the first time interval for respective ones of a second plurality of customer-premises devices, wherein the second plurality of customer-premises devices form a second customer-premises communication network and each of the second plurality of customer-premises devices are communicatively coupled to a second residential gateway; retrieve a fourth plurality of performance parameters for the second time interval for respective ones of the second plurality of customer-premises devices; compute a first metric from the first and third plurality of performance parameters, the first metric representative of a first performance variability of the first and second customer-premises communication networks during the first time interval; compute a second metric from the second and fourth plurality of performance parameters, the second metric representative of a second performance variability of the first and second customer-premises communication networks during the second time interval; and compare the first and second metrics to determine whether the first and second customer-premises communication networks are operating in accordance with a normal operating condition during the second time interval.","A disclosed example apparatus includes a data collector to retrieve a first plurality of performance parameters for a first time interval for respective ones of a first plurality of customer-premises devices, wherein the first plurality of customer-premises devices form a first customer-premises communication network and each of the first plurality of customer-premises devices is communicatively coupled to a first residential gateway, and retrieve a second plurality of performance parameters for a second time interval for the respective ones of the first plurality of customer-premises devices, a variability analyzer to compute a first metric from the first and second plurality of performance parameters, the first metric representative of a performance variability of the first customer-premises communication network, and a network characterizer to compare the first metric to a second metric representative of a second performance variability of a second customer-premises communication network communicatively coupled to a second residential gateway to determine whether the first customer-premises communication network is operating in accordance with a normal operating condition.","For clarity of illustration and explanation, example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture are described herein with reference to communication systems implemented using digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies to transport data to and\/or from customer premises. However, the examples disclosed herein may, additionally or alternatively, be used to characterize customer-premises networks for any number and\/or type(s) of other communication technology(-ies) and\/or protocol(s).

Such segments of twisted-pair telephone wire may be spliced and\/or connected end-to-end, and\/or may be connected at only one end, thereby creating one or more bridged-taps. Regardless of the number, type(s), gauge(s) and\/or topology of twisted-pair telephone wires used to construct the example subscriber lines -, these lines will be referred to herein in the singular form, but it will be understood that the term \u201csubscriber line\u201d may refer to one or more twisted-pair telephone wire segments and may include one or more bridged taps.","Within each of the example customer premises - of  one or more additional customer-premises communication devices, two or which are designated at reference numerals  and , may be communicatively coupled to the RG - and\/or to each other to form a customer-premises communication network, one of which is designated at reference numeral . Example customer-premises networks  include, but are not limited to, a local area network (LAN), an Ethernet over power line network, an Ethernet over telephone line network, and\/or a wireless LAN (WLAN). Example customer-premises devices  and  include, but are not limited to, a set-top box (STB), a network-interface card (NIC), a wireless adapter, a television, a personal computer (PC), and\/or an appliance. As shown in , the customer-premises devices  and  may be directly and\/or indirectly communicatively coupled to their associated RG - and\/or other customer-premises devices  and .","In the illustrated example of , the customer-premises devices  and , the RGs - and\/or, more generally, the example customer-premises networks  may be communicatively coupled to any number and\/or type(s) of private network(s) and\/or public network(s) such as the Internet  via the example access servers -. In some examples, the access servers - may be communicatively coupled to the Internet  via a service-provider network .","The customer-premises devices  and  and the RGs - of  may be customer owned, may be leased and\/or rented by a customer from a service provider, and\/or may be owned by the service provider. Some or all of the example customer-premises devices  and  and the RGs - are configured by a configuration management system (CMS)  owned, operated and\/or implemented by the service provider associated with the example communication system . The example CMS  of , among other things, configures the customer-premises devices  and  and\/or the RGs - with one or more parameters and\/or settings that enable the customer-premises devices  and  and\/or the RGs - to access the Internet  and\/or other communication services offered by the service provider (e.g., telephone services, data services, messaging services, instant messaging services, email services, chat services, video services, television services, audio services, gaming services, etc.).","The example customer-premises networks  of  may be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of communication technologies, communication media and\/or communication protocols. Some example customer-premises communication networks  are heterogeneous and simultaneously implement different wired and\/or wireless communication technologies. Additionally or alternatively, some example customer-premises communication networks  implement different communication protocols. Within such customer-premises networks , communication network performance (e.g., data rate, noise, error rate, etc.) may vary with time in response to any number and\/or type(s) of factors and\/or events such as radio frequency interference, storms, software updates, installation of new devices , , temperature changes, replacement of devices , , technician repairs, cabling changes, etc.","Customer-premises networks  are conventionally evaluated using current performance information such as the current communication data rate. However, reliable determination of speed and\/or quality-of-service using only current performance information may be difficult. Moreover, communication network troubleshooting is often concerned with detecting, diagnosing and\/or resolving intermittent problems, which are generally not accurately reflected and\/or captured by current performance information. Further still, such current performance information does not readily enable a determination of whether a customer-premises network  is operating and\/or performing differently than during a previous time interval, and\/or does not enable comparisons between different customer-premises networks  to determine whether any particular customer-premises network  is operating and\/or performing differently than in accordance with a normal operating condition (e.g., differently than intended, differently than normal, differently than expected, differently than predicted) and\/or differently from other customer-premises networks .","To overcome at least these deficiencies, the example methods, apparatus and articles of manufacture described herein collect performance information from the RGs - and\/or the customer-premises devices  and , and process the collected performance information to characterize the customer-premises communication networks . The collected performance information is used to compute metrics that represent how the performance of the customer-premises networks  change over time and\/or how the performance of the customer-premises networks  differ from other customer-premises networks .","To collect performance information, the example communication system  of  includes a data collector . Periodically and\/or aperiodically, the example data collector  of  collects performance information, data and\/or variables from the RGs - and\/or the example customer-premises devices  and  and stores the collected performance information in a performance database . Example performance information that may be collected and\/or retrieved from the RGs - and\/or the example customer-premises devices  and  includes, but is not limited to, average data rate, current data rate, maximum data rate, minimum data rate, average error rate, current error rate, maximum error rate, minimum error rate, maximum noise, average noise, current noise and\/or minimum noise. However, any number and\/or type(s) of additional and\/or alternative performance information, data and\/or variables may be collected.","Performance information may be stored in the example performance database  of  using any number and\/or type(s) of data structures. The example performance database  may be implemented using any number and\/or type(s) of tangible memory(-ies), memory device(s), and\/or storage device(s).","In some examples, the data collector  collects performance data via an application programming interface (API) implemented by the example CMS server . The data collector  requests performance data for one or more RGs - and\/or customer-premises devices  and  via the API, and the CMS server  collects the requested performance data and returns the retrieved performance data to the data collector . Additionally or alternatively, the example data collector  may collect and\/or retrieve the performance information directly from the RGs - and\/or the customer-premises devices  and  via the network  and the access servers -, thereby bypassing the CMS server . By retrieving performance information directly, the example data collector  can avoid loading the CMS server , which may not have been designed to retrieve performance information from large numbers of RGs - and\/or customer-premises devices  and . To identify and gain secure access to the RGs - and the customer-premises devices  and , the example data collector  may utilize information from any number and\/or type(s) of databases such as a customer-premises equipment (CPE) identifier (ID) database  and\/or a CPE access certificate database .","The example CMS server  and\/or the example data collector  of  may retrieve data from the RGs - and\/or the customer-premises devices  and  using any number and\/or type(s) of method(s) and\/or protocol(s). For example, the CMS server  and\/or the data collector  may configure firewall port forwarding or pinholes (one of which is designated at reference numeral ) on the RGs - and\/or on the customer-premises devices  and  to enable retrieval directly from the customer-premises devices  and . Additionally or alternatively, the CMS server  and\/or the data collector  may interact with an API implemented by the RG - (one of which is designated at reference numeral ), which retrieves performance information from its associated customer-premises devices  and  and provides the collected performance information to the requesting CMS server  and\/or the data collector . The CMS server  and\/or the data collector  can also query the APIs  to obtain a list of customer-premises devices  and  associated with the RG -. Each of the example customer-premises devices  and  of  implement an API (one of which is designated at reference numeral ) that enables the CMS server , the data collector  and\/or its associated RG - to retrieve performance information from the customer-premises device , .","The example data collector  of  may periodically (e.g., every few hours) or aperiodically (e.g., when directed by a technician and\/or service personnel) retrieve performance information for all monitored RGs - and\/or customer-premises devices  and . Additionally or alternatively, the data collector  may collect performance information for some of the RGs - and\/or customer-premises devices  and  on a more frequent basis. For example, as described below, based on previously collected performance information a customer-premises network analyzer  may select one or more collection configuration parameter(s) and\/or setting(s) to configure the data collector  to collect performance information more frequently for some customer-premises networks  that may not be operating as intended and\/or as well as other customer-premises networks .","To analyze and\/or characterize customer-premises networks , the example communication system  of  includes the example customer-premises network analyzer . Based on and\/or from the performance information collected by the example data collector , the example customer-premises network analyzer  of  computes one or more performance distributions that represent the statistical and\/or probabilistic occurrence of performance variables. An example data rate distribution represents the percentage of time that one or more customer-premises networks  were operating at particular data rates. The performance distribution may be quantified using percentiles, where each percentile represents the percentage of time spent at or below a corresponding data rate. An example performance distribution has a 1percentile data rate of 20 million bits per second (Mbps) and a 99percentile data rate of 80 Mbps. The 99of 80 Mbps percentile represents that the customer-premises network(s)  operated at a data rate of 80 Mbps or less 99% of the time.","The example customer-premises network analyzer  of  may, for example, compute performance distributions across different customer-premises networks , across different types of customer-premises devices  and  and\/or RGs -, and\/or across different time intervals for particular customer-premises network(s) , customer-premises devices  and  and\/or RGs -. For example, by computing a performance distribution across multiple customer-premises networks  the example customer-premises network analyzer  can compare the variability of a particular customer-premises network(s)  to the variability of other customer-premises networks . Such performance distributions represent structural variability across customer-premises networks . Additionally or alternatively, by computing a performance distribution across time for a particular customer-premises network  the customer-premises network analyzer  can characterize the over time performance variability of that customer-premises network . Such performance distributions represent conditional variability within that customer-premises network . The customer-premises network analyzer  can compute performance distributions for any number and\/or type(s) of performance variables including, but not limited to, data rate, error rate, noise levels, etc.","In some examples, a technician and\/or customer-service personnel may be interested in fairly rare events, that is, events that occur only 5% or 1% of the time. However, standard deviations computed based on and\/or from collected performance information may not be the best method to represent, detect and\/or diagnose such infrequent events and\/or conditions. The example customer-premises network analyzer  of  characterizes the performance variability of one or more customer-premises networks  by computing one or more variability metrics from computed performance distributions. An example variability metric comprises a ratio of the performance value associated with a particular performance distribution percentile to the performance value associated with another performance distribution percentile. Using a data rate distribution, an example variability metric can be computed using the following mathematical expression:\n\n=(percentile data rate)\/((100)percentile data rate)\u2003\u2003EQN (1)\n\nwhere Vis the variability metric for the npercentile, and npercentile data rate is the data rate associated with the npercentile of the data rate distribution. As defined in EQN (1), for non-negative underlying metrics, the values of Vare between zero and one. For a given percentile n, the smaller the metric Vthe more variable the performance of the customer-premises network(s) . If the variability metric Vfor a particular customer-premises network  is compared with the variability metric Vcomputed for a group of customer-premises networks , the customer-premises network analyzer  can determine whether that particular customer-premises network  performs more variably. Variability metrics Vcan also be compared and\/or tracked over time to determine how customer-premises network(s)  change over time in response to, for example, storms, software updates, configuration changes, installation of new customer-premises devices  and , temperature changes, replacement of devices , , technician repairs, cabling changes, etc.\n","In some examples, the customer-premises network analyzer  of  configures the data collector  to periodically collect and\/or retrieve performance information for the customer-premises networks . As the data is collected, the example customer-premises network analyzer  computes and\/or updates one or more performance distributions and\/or variability metrics V. By comparing variability metrics Vto each other and\/or to one or more thresholds, the customer-premises network analyzer  can identify customer-premises networks  that may warrant additional or more frequent monitoring. As additional performance information is collected and correlated with field troubleshooting information and\/or customer reported performance issues, the threshold(s) used to identify customer-premises networks  for additional proactive monitor can be adjusted and\/or tuned. If a customer-premises network  is identified and\/or flagged as possibly not operating as intended, the example customer-premises network analyzer  of  may submit a trouble ticket to a trouble ticket system .","To manage repair and\/or maintenance reports, the example CO  of  includes the example trouble ticket system . The example trouble ticket system  of  implements an API via which the example customer-premises network analyzer  can submit a trouble ticket. The example trouble ticket system  can also route a submitted trouble ticket to a suitable repair, customer support and\/or technical support person for resolution, and tracks the resolution of trouble tickets. In some examples, the trouble ticket system  can query the customer-premises network analyzer  for performance information and\/or variability metrics Vfor identified customer-premises networks . For example, when a trouble ticket is submitted by a customer, the trouble ticket system  may automatically query the customer-premises network analyzer  for performance information and\/or variability metrics Vand add such information to the submitted trouble ticket. Performance distributions and\/or variability metrics Vcomputed by the example customer-premises network analyzer  may be stored in the example performance database  for subsequent retrieval by the customer-premises network analyzer  and\/or via a graphical user interface (GUI) .","To allow technicians and\/or service personnel to interact with the example trouble ticket system , the example data collector  and\/or the example customer-premises network analyzer , the example communication system  of  includes any number and\/or type(s) of GUIs, one of which is designated at reference numeral . The example GUI  of  enables a person (e.g., a technician, customer service representative, etc.) to interact with the trouble ticket system  to view and\/or update trouble tickets, to query the customer-premises network analyzer  for variability metrics V, to locate and\/or view performance information, performance distributions and\/or variability metrics Vstored in the performance database , and\/or to schedule the collection of performance information for one or more customer-premises networks .","While in the illustrated example of , the example access servers -, the example CMS server , the example data collector , the example databases -, the example customer-premises network analyzer , the example trouble ticket system  and the example GUI  are illustrated in connection with an example central office (CO) , one or more of the example access servers -, the example CMS server , the example data collector , the example databases -, the example customer-premises network analyzer , the example trouble ticket system  and the example GUI  may be located and\/or implemented separately from the CO . For example, the example data collector , the example databases -, the example customer-premises network analyzer , the example trouble ticket system  and the example GUI  may be located and\/or implemented at a customer service location (not shown), which is communicatively coupled to the service-provider network , the CMS server  and\/or the access servers - at the CO .
