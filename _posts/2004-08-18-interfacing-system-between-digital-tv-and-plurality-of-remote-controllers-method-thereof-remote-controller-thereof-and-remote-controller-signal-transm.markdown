Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to an interfacing system, and more particularly, to a system and method for interfacing between a digital TV receiver and a plurality of remote controllers, remote controller thereof, and remote controller signal transmitting method thereof.","2. Discussion of the Related Art","Recently, as broadcasting environments rapidly change into digital broadcasting from analog broadcasting, set-top boxes enabling the conventional analog TV to receive digital broadcasting or digital broadcasting receivers spread worldwide in a geometrical progression. Digital broadcasting stands in the spotlight because of its plenty of attractions such as image and sound qualities superior to those of the conventional analog broadcasting and various multimedia functions including home shopping, home banking, internet search, home office, VOD, etc.","In order to view digital broadcast via digital TV or to request necessary information to the digital TV, a remote controller is generally used as an input means. In a data broadcasting system based on Java, Java API (application programming interface) and Java application connected to the Java API to execute a predetermined control operation are needed to control a signal inputted from the remote controller. In this case, the API and application are established on Java foundation.","In case that Java application is an application used for a specific STB\/DTV only, each receiver manufacturer may define a separate Java API of its own to use. Yet, in case that Java API standard is already defined, a contents provider (CP) producing Java application provides the Java application according to the defined Java API standard and the receiver manufacturer manufactures a product supporting the Java API standard.","Generally, the Java API standard associated with a remote controller is disclosed in the HAVi (home audio\/video interoperability) Level 2 User Interface specification. The HAVi Level 2 User Interface specification is a universal remote controller associated interface adopted by both American data broadcasting standard and European data broadcasting standard.","Yet, in the current HAVi Level 2 User Interface specification, API enabling to support one remote controller is defined only.","This is because there exists no difficulty in controlling a predetermined system using one remote controller only.","Yet, if data broadcasting becomes generalized later, a multitude of viewers will enjoy a game with individual remote controllers, respectively. Furthermore, if a multitude of viewers view several broadcasts on one screen, they will be able to select their favorite broadcasts using a plurality of individual remote controllers, respectively.","However, the conventional broadcast receivers fail to support a plurality of remote controllers using the HAVi Level 2 User Interface specification, whereby users are unable to control a corresponding broadcast receiver using a plurality of remote controllers, respectively.","Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a system and method for interfacing between a digital TV receiver and a plurality of remote controllers, remote controller thereof, and remote controller signal transmitting method thereof that substantially obviate one or more problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.","An object of the present invention is to provide a system and method for interfacing between a digital TV and a plurality of remote controllers, remote controller thereof, and remote controller signal transmitting method thereof, by which Java API enabling to support a plurality of remote controllers is defined to enable interfacing between the digital TV and a plurality of the remote controllers.","Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will become apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art upon examination of the following or may be learned from practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended

plurality of the remote controllers, respectively and identifying a plurality of the remote controllers using the event class including the remote controller identifiers, respectively and controlling the digital TV according to a signal received from the identified remote controller.","Preferably, in the step of defining the event class, signal informations for keys supported by each of a plurality of the remote controllers are further defined.","Preferably, in the step of defining the event class, a function enabling to identify one remote controller set to a default is further defined.","In another aspect of the present invention, in interfacing between a digital TV and a plurality of remote controllers, an interfacing method includes the steps of defining an event class including remote controller identifiers enabling to identify a plurality of the remote controllers, respectively, identifying a plurality of the remote controllers using the remote controller

outputted from a plurality of the remote controllers, respectively and if the remote controller identifier is included, identifying the remote controller corresponding to the remote controller identifier.","In another aspect of the present invention, an interfacing system between a digital TV and a plurality of remote controllers includes a reception unit receiving signals from a plurality of the remote controllers, a memory storing a resource for information used in analyzing to convert remote controller identifiers for identifying a plurality of the remote controllers and remote

identifier, the control unit generating an event signal corresponding to the identified remote controller to control the digital TV according to the event signal.","Preferably, the resource includes an event manager managing an event generation according to the signal of the identified remote controller.","Preferably, the resource defines the information used in analyzing to convert the remote controller identifier enabling to one remote controller set to a default and the remote control to the appropriate event.","In another aspect of the present invention, a remote controller interfacing with a digital TV includes a key input unit for inputting key signals, a memory storing a remote controller key code and a remote controller identifier corresponding to each key of the key input unit, a control signal generating unit extracting the remote controller key code and the remote controller identifier corresponding to the inputted key signal from the memory, the control signal generating

Hence, if a predetermined RF signal is inputted from one specific remote controller among a plurality of the remote controllers, the remote controller is identified using the remote controller identifier (RcID) and it is checked which key is pressed in the identified remote controller using a keycode factor, keychar factor, and the like, whereby the corresponding event signal can be generated.
