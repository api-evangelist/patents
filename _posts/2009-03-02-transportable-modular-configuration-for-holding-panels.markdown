Research supporting at least part of the work described herein was accomplished with the United States Gypsum Company under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, CRADA-05-GSL-04, dated 20 May 2005. This and related patents are available for licensing to qualified licensees. Please contact Phillip Stewart at 601 634-4113.","It is important to protect both material and personnel from catastrophe, especially in cases where the probability of occurrence is greater than the norm. Conventionally, both temporary and permanent means may be used for this purpose, depending on the scenario. For example, a permanent military facility may best be protected by a permanent configuration, whereas a mobile field unit would best be served by a temporary, but not necessarily less effective, configuration. Conventionally, protection against manmade catastrophe, such as occurs in war zones, has been provided with large bulky concrete structures or earthen embankments that require heavy equipment to produce, whether temporary or permanent. Common needs for protective structure may include barriers to prevent personnel access, vehicular intrusion, or even line-of-site access, as well as protective enclosures for emergency response personnel or revetments for high value assets. Because of constraints such as geography, response time, availability of both material and heavy equipment, and the like, select embodiments of the present invention that provide good protection for both personnel and valued assets are of value for protection of military, industrial, community and personal assets.","To protect personnel and assets, organizations such as the military use a variety of protective materials ranging from soil cover to expensive, high-performance, lightweight ballistic ceramics. For the military, a need exists for an inexpensive blast and fragmentation barrier for large-area applications, such as forward facilities, installation and structure perimeters, and both interior and exterior protective upgrades. Certain applications call for panels that may be emplaced on robust platforms, both the modular platform sections and panels being of sufficiently light weight to be man portable. Needs for physical protection exist in the commercial, first responder and consumer communities also, but on a different scale. For example, there is a need for a structure to hold inexpensive protective cladding with superior resistance to wind damage, including penetration of debris generated by natural forces, such as tornadoes and hurricanes.","Select embodiments of the present invention comprise transportable components for fortifying an area. Select embodiments of the present invention include box-shaped platform modules for holding panels in order to provide a secure perimeter. The panels may be resistant to sudden impulses such as may occur with explosions or impact with projectiles and also may shield what they are protecting from view of possible adversaries.","In select embodiments of the present invention, a transportable configuration provides modular support to be combined with panels of pre-specified content for isolation, including physical protection, of assets. A component of select embodiments of the present invention comprises an open stackable frame of a length greater than or equal to its width which in turn is less than or equal to its height.

Any advantages and benefits described may not apply to all embodiments of the invention.","While the invention has been described in terms of some of its embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modifications within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. For example, although the system is described in specific examples for use in protecting assets, it may be used for any type of portable structure where physical or visual restriction or even noise suppression is desired. Thus select embodiments of the present invention may be useful in such diverse applications as mining, logging, construction, outdoor concerts, parades, and the like. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents, but also equivalent structures. Thus, although a nail and a screw may not be structural equivalents in that a nail employs a cylindrical surface to secure wooden parts together, whereas a screw employs a helical surface, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a nail and a screw may be equivalent structures. Thus, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting, and the invention should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0006","num":"0005"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 13"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 15"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 16","FIG. 9"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 17","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 18","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 19","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 16"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 21"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 22"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
