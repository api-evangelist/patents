No. 61\/091,024, filed Aug. 22, 2008 and is a continuation-in-part of and claims priority to U.S. Utility patent application Ser. No. 12\/203,845, filed Sep. 3, 2008, titled, \u201cSystem For Mitigating The Unauthorized Use Of A Device,\u201d the disclosures of which are fully incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. All trademarks and service marks identified herein are owned by the applicant.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to systems and methods for providing an auxiliary user interface to a user of an electronic device, and various implementations of methods therefor.","2. Background of the Invention","Today, the use of electronic devices is widespread. Such devices can increase a user's productivity and quality of life, but they are susceptible to loss, theft, or unauthorized use. Examples of such devices are cellular phones, portable digital assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, and laptop computers. These devices often carry private, confidential and\/or difficult-to-replace data, and the loss of such data further compounds the loss of the electronic device since, while an electronic device that has been lost or stolen can be physically replaced, oftentimes the data stored on such a device is confidential and\/or irreplaceable.","Additionally, the authorized user (which may or may not be the owner) of a lost or stolen device may have to deal with ramifications, such as the misuse of information if an unauthorized user (as used herein, \u201cunauthorized user\u201d means anyone than the authorized user or someone authorized by the authorized user to use the device) gains access to information stored on the device. Further, it is not uncommon for hours or even days to elapse before the owner or authorized user of such a device discovers the loss, and during that time, an unauthorized user may be accessing sensitive data, misappropriating information, or running up charges for goods or services on the authorized user's accounts.","Many electronic devices offer a primary access interface, where a user first is presented with an opportunity to gain access to the electronic device. Such a primary interface often includes one or more fields to enter a userid and\/or password, and upon successful authentication, the user is given access. Embodiments of the present invention allow a user to gain access to useful features of the electronic device without having to log in or otherwise be authenticated.","Both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.","Methods and systems according to the present invention provide a user interface on a provided electronic device, the user interface including: (i) an auxiliary interface for receiving input from a user and providing output to the user; and (ii) a primary access interface. Using the auxiliary interface, a message to the user is provided, wherein the message is provided without requiring the user to be authenticated through the primary access interface. Input from the user is accepted through the auxiliary interface to access a service available from the provided electronic device, wherein access to the service is provided without requiring the user to be authenticated through the primary access interface.","As used herein, the term \u201cmobile device,\u201d \u201cmobile electronic device,\u201d or \u201cdevice\u201d generally refers to any electronic device capable of being lost or stolen. A mobile device may be a stand-alone device such as a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a mobile subscriber communication device, a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a data tablet, a digital camera, a video camera, a video game console, a media player, a global positioning system (GPS), Universal Serial Bus (USB) keys, mobile weapons, and combinations thereof. A mobile electronic device may also be any electronic device integrated with another system or device. For example, a stereo, global positioning system, or other electronic device contained within a vehicle may be monitored and protected in accordance with the present invention. Software to implement methods of the present invention can be (1) installed on, or (2) downloaded onto a mobile device indirectly or directly at any time by an authorized user through the Internet, SMS text message, or in any other suitable manner and at any suitable time for carrying out a method according to the invention. For example, the software may be installed on the device when purchased or downloaded after the device is purchased, or even after the device is lost or stolen. The mobile device may be insured against loss or theft, and systems and methods of the present invention may operate as part of, or in addition to, an insurance policy on the mobile device.","An authorized user of a mobile device may qualify for a lower insurance premium if the insured mobile device is protected by a lockout or recovery service as provided by embodiments of the present invention. In another embodiment, an insurance company may mandate recovery or lockout services be provided with an insured device where a claim against the policy may result in replacement for lost or stolen mobile devices. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention assist with preventing insurance fraud. For example, if a parent buys a new phone and insures the phone against loss or theft, the parent may desire to give the insured phone to one of his\/her children and file an insurance claim to replace the donated phone, claiming it as a lost or stolen device, thus avoiding the cost of purchasing a new phone. The present invention may be used to prevent such a fraudulent claim, by, for example, disabling use of the alleged lost or stolen phone, detecting attempted use of the alleged lost or stolen phone, or tracking location or users of the alleged lost or stolen phone.","In one embodiment, a mobile device operating in conjunction with the present invention includes a wireless transceiver to communicate with other systems and devices through a wireless system such as a wireless mobile telephony network, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) network, wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network, Personal Communication Service (PCS) network, Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) network, and\/or a satellite communication network. Mobile devices operating in conjunction with the present invention may also communicate with other systems and devices through any other type of connection, such as a wired Internet connection, a wireless Internet connection, a cellular telephone network connection, a wireless LAN connection, a wireless WAN connection, an optical connection, a USB connection, a mobile device synchronization port connection, a power connection, and\/or a security cable.","Systems and methods of the present invention may be employed as part of a subscriber-based service to help protect and recover a wide variety of different mobile devices. Authorized users can be linked to multiple mobile devices using a unique identifier for each device. Any suitable identifier may be provided, such as the serial number of the mobile device (or a component thereof), or a numeric, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or other identifier. The identifier can be used to verify the identity of authorized users associated with the device, as well as to monitor the mobile device and provide for its recovery should it be lost or stolen. In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, the identifier and information for associated authorized users may be stored in a storage medium (such as a memory on the mobile device or a central server) for future reference.","Moreover, a system and method according to the invention may have a different response for different inputs or conditions, including the sensing of varying threat levels. For example, a laptop sensing that it is in a prohibited area (such as outside of a building to which it is assigned or in a foreign country) might prevent access with one or more encryption techniques, delete data or corrupt the hard drive to make data retrieval difficult or impossible. The same laptop, upon receiving a signal that it is lost within a building to which it is assigned could simply provide notification describing how to return the laptop.","Any combination and\/or subset of the elements of the methods depicted herein may be practiced in any suitable order and in conjunction with any suitable system, device, and\/or process. The methods described and depicted herein can be implemented in any suitable manner, such as through software operating on the mobile device and a host server. The software may comprise computer-readable instructions stored in a medium (such as the memory of the mobile device or host server) and can be executed by one or more processors to perform the methods of the present invention.","Turning now to the figures, where the purpose is to describe preferred embodiments of the invention and not to limit same, exemplary methods according to various aspects of the present invention are depicted in .","In method  illustrated in , a notification is provided by a mobile device to an authorized user () describing how to return the mobile device. As used herein, \u201cunauthorized user\u201d means any person other than the authorized user. The notification can be provided in any number of ways and be triggered by any suitable event. For example, the notification may be a visual display or an audio signal, such as a voice. The notification should provide adequate information to the unauthorized user to enable the unauthorized user to return the device, and could include one or more of a phone number, address or email address. The notice could also offer a reward for return of the device.","The notice could be triggered in any suitable manner. For instance, the authorized user could send a signal to the device to display the notice, or the authorized user could contact a service that would send a signal to the device to activate the notice. The notice could also be displayed automatically, for example, if the wrong password were keyed in a predetermined amount of times or if the device sensed it was in a certain geographical area. Any other suitable self-triggering event could also be utilized.","Another and optional feature of the device is detection of a security compromise event () and a determination () of whether the function of the device should be altered in response to the security compromise event. If appropriate, the functionality of the device is altered () if a security compromise event (including the device being lost or stolen).","Providing Notification Describing how to Return the Mobile Device","In an exemplary process  according to the present invention depicted in , an event  triggers a notification to be provided  by the device describing how to return the device. The notification may be provided in any manner, such as by using a display, microphone, or other user interface feature(s) of the mobile device. The notification may include any symbols, characters, numbers, graphics, sounds (including recorded voice messages and\/or music), and\/or any other indicia to aid in describing how to return the device (for example a message displayed on a screen).","The notification may include, for example, one or more of a telephone number for a service providing recovery instructions or the telephone number of the authorized user, a turn-in location or address, instructions to activate a feature of the mobile device to initiate a return process, a web address for a service providing recovery instructions, and\/or a clickable link to a website comprising recovery instructions. The notification may also include a message that a reward is available for turning in the device to a recovery service. In one embodiment of the present invention, the notification is displayed on the login screen (including the mechanism for returning the device) such that it is the first information seen by a user before the user can access the device. If an authorized user (such as the owner) fears they have lost control of the device they can remotely activate the application on the mobile device and make sure that access is restricted to only showing a notification and details on how to return the device. One benefit of this approach is the preservation of the confidential nature of the information located on the mobile device, essentially protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. An innocent finder of the mobile device is also able to return the device without having to bypass or break the password on the mobile device to determine the identity of the authorized user.","When the notification is provided a separate signal or message that the mobile device has been lost or stolen. The notification can help an unauthorized user of the mobile device return it to its authorized user, and the notification is likely to increase the probability that the unauthorized user will do so, since he\/she is provided with the appropriate instructions or information. Additionally, the conspicuousness of the notification may also deter an unauthorized user who is a thief from stealing the mobile device or attempting to keep, use, or sell the mobile device.","The notification may be provided to any person (such as the unauthorized person currently in possession of the mobile device), as well as other individuals, systems, and devices in communication with the mobile device. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, referring to , providing a notification () describing how to return a mobile device (such as a mobile phone) may include: determining a phone number () dialed by the current unauthorized user of the mobile device, calling the phone number (), and presenting a message (such as pre-recorded, text or message from a live person) (). The message may include any desired information, such a notice that the mobile device has been reported lost or stolen, and\/or instructions to assist in initiating return of the mobile device.","Alternate embodiments may include presenting an SMS text message, an email message (e.g., sent to an email address of the current user), a sequence of dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) tones, and\/or any other message type. This allows the mobile device to alert the unauthorized user in possession of the mobile device that he\/she is not authorized to use the device and\/or provides instructions on how to return the device. This may expedite the return of the mobile device, as well as to deter individuals from stealing or withholding the device from its rightful owner.","The mobile device may include a read-only memory. For purposes of the present application, a read only memory (also known as a \u201cROM\u201d) includes not only non-modifiable memories such as mask ROMs and one-time programmable PROMs, but also persistent memories that may not be directly or indirectly modified through the user interface of a mobile device. Such persistent memories may include such storage devices such as field programmable ROMs, EPROMs, EEPROMs, FLASH memory, magnetic storage devices, optical storage devices, or other storage devices. In various embodiments of the present invention, an application may reside in a read-only memory of the mobile device detects that a security compromise event has occurred. In selected instances, the application may not be terminated by a current user of the mobile device if the current user is not the authorized user, providing additional security to prohibit unauthorized users from tampering with security protocols.","The mobile device may present an automated message with a variety of content to achieve any desired result to mitigate loss of control. For example, but not by way of limitation, the mobile device when detecting that a security event has occurred, may present an automated message to a current user of the mobile device, wherein the automated message comprises at least one of a notification: that the mobile device has been lost or stolen; that the current user may press any button to initiate contact with a security authority; that the current user of the mobile device should return the device; commanding the current user to return the device; that a reward is offered for the prompt return of the mobile device; and providing instructions for return of the mobile device.","The notification may be provided using some or all of the user interface capabilities of the mobile device. For example, a notification for a laptop computer may include a large, message on the screen to draw the attention of observers that it is protected, and\/or one or more sounds (including music, pre-recorded speech and alarm) played through the laptop's speaker. Similarly, a cell phone could present a text display and\/or emit sounds to instruct the unauthorized user how to return the device or an alarm sound to attract attention to the unauthorized user and make it undesirable to keep the device. The notification may be presented through one or more of any other user interface feature(s) integrated with, or in communication with, the mobile device, such as a printer.","Detecting a Security Compromise Event","In the exemplary method shown in , the mobile device detect that a security compromise event () has occurred. As used herein, a \u201csecurity compromise event\u201d generally refers to any situation where the mobile device (or any physical or functional portion thereof) is (or may be) outside the exclusive control of an authorized user, and a device may be able to detect multiple types of security compromise events, in which case the device may have different responses for different types of security compromise events.","A security compromise event may be actual (e.g., the mobile device has actually been stolen), or perceived (e.g., an authorized user is uncertain as to the status of the mobile device, but believes it may be lost or stolen). A security compromise event may include the loss of control of the mobile device by the authorized user, the theft of the mobile device, a loss of knowledge as to the whereabouts of the mobile device, the intrusion of an electronic threat (e.g., an electronic virus, an electronic worm, and\/or an electronic trojan horse), the unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to private information in the mobile device, use of the mobile device in a manner not authorized by a wireless service provider, the device sensing it is in an unauthorized location, entering an incorrect password multiple times, any other event where compromise of the ownership or security of the mobile device is indicated.","A security compromise event may be detected by the mobile device itself, and may be also be reported by an authorized user directly to the device or indirectly such as through a security authority or other entity, system or device in communication with the mobile device.","The mobile device may detect a security compromise event in any manner, such as by receiving a message from an authorized user or a security authority (such as a governmental law enforcement organization, private security firm, and\/or insurance agency), and in response to the message determining that a breach of security has occurred. The security authority may communicate with the mobile device in any desired manner, such as through software operating on a host server in communication with a database. As an example, an authorized user can report his\/her mobile device is missing to the security authority and instruct the security authority to signal the mobile device of a security threat (i.e., the user believes the mobile device has been lost, stolen, or may otherwise be subject to unauthorized access). The functionality of the mobile device can then be altered as a result (), as discussed further below.","In another embodiment, detecting, by the mobile device, that a security compromise event has occurred further comprises: obtaining, from a security authority, a pre-stored list of phone numbers characterizing allowable use of the mobile device; comparing a current phone number to the pre-stored list of phone numbers; and determining that the current phone number indicates that a call involving the current phone number is not authorized. In various embodiments, determining that the current phone number indicates that a call involving the current phone number is not authorized further comprises one of: determining: that the current phone number is a phone number associated with a call received by the mobile device; and the current phone number is not present within a first subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the first subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may be received by the mobile device; or the current phone number is present within a second subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may not be received by the mobile device; and determining: that the current phone number is a phone number associated with a call placed by a current user of the mobile device; and the current phone number is not present within a third subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the third subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may be placed by the mobile device; or the current phone number is present within a fourth subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the fourth subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may not be placed by the mobile device. In other implementations, determining that the current phone number indicates that a call involving the current phone number is not authorized further comprises determining: that the current phone number is a phone number associated with a call received by the mobile device; and the current phone number is not present within a first subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the first subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may be received by the mobile device; or the current phone number is present within a second subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may not be received by the mobile device.","Any notifications may be provided upon detecting a security compromise event, and in addition to other embodiments specified herein, a pre-designated contact may be notified that an unauthorized call has been received by the mobile device. Such a pre-designated contact may be identified by the authorized user at any time, such as during a registration process.","In another embodiment, determining that the current phone number indicates that a call involving the current phone number is not authorized further comprises determining: that the current phone number is a phone number associated with a call being placed by a current user of the mobile device; and the current phone number is not present within a third subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the third subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may be placed by the mobile device; or the current phone number is present within a fourth subset of the pre-stored list of phone numbers, the fourth subset comprising phone numbers associated with calls that may not be placed by the mobile device. In the event that a security compromise event has been detected, the mobile device may request a PIN number from the current user; and if the PIN number matches a predetermined PIN number, the current user of the mobile device may be allowed to place the call.","The mobile device may authenticate the validity of a message from a security authority, such as by computing a digest of the message and comparing the digest value to a previously stored authorization digest value. The computed digest value may be produced by providing the received message to a hashing algorithm such as the MD5 or SHA-1 Secure Hashing Algorithm as specified in National Institute of Standards and Technology Federal Information Processing Standard Publication Number 180-1, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The authorization digest value can be any number, code, value, or identifier that allows a received message to be identified as a valid transmission from a security authority. The stored authorization digest value can be provided to the mobile device upon activation of a loss\/theft recovery service, as well as in any other desired manner. Unless the authorization digest value matches the stored digest value, the message will not be authenticated and can be disregarded (if desired). A mobile device acting on a message from a security authority need not necessarily be predicated upon successful authentication of the message, however. The mobile device may authenticate the validity of the message in any other desired manner.","The mobile device may also authenticate the validity of a message from a security authority or other source by decrypting at least part of the message with a public key associated with the sender of the message as part of an asymmetric encryption algorithm. Asymmetric encryption algorithms and techniques are well known in the art. See, for example, RSA & Public Key Cryptography, by Richard A. Mollin, CRC Press, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,829, issued Sep. 20, 1983, the disclosures of which are fully incorporated by reference herein. In an illustrative example, if two parties (for example, \u201cAlice\u201d and \u201cBob\u201d) wish to communicate securely using public key cryptography, each party begins by generating a unique key pair, where one of the keys is a private key that is kept in confidence by that party, and the other key is a public key that may be publicly distributed, published only to a message recipient, or made available through a public key infrastructure. The key generation step need be done by a party only once, provided that the party's private key does not become compromised or known by another party. If Alice wants to send a message confidentially to Bob, she may use Bob's public key to encrypt the message, and once sent, only Bob can decrypt and view the message using Bob's private key. But if Alice also wanted Bob to have assurance that the message was in fact coming from her, she could further encrypt the message with her private key before sending, then when Bob's private key and Alice's public key are used to decrypt the message, Bob knows for certain that he was the intended recipient and that Alice was the one who originated the message, and Alice knows that only Bob will be able to decrypt and read her message.","Such a scheme may be utilized with embodiments of the present invention. In an embodiment, full two-way public encryption is used to authenticate that the sender is in fact the security authority (for example) and that the recipient of the message indicating a security compromise event has occurred is in fact the intended recipient. Alternatively, messages may be encrypted with only the private keys of the sending entity, and decrypted with the public keys to expedite processing time. Such encryption schemes assist with validation of security compromise event communications, both in providing validation of the source and destination of messages, as well as providing a means to security transmit commands to a compromised mobile device.","In alternate embodiment, encrypted or unencrypted data can be transmitted to and from the mobile device through an encrypted transmission protocol, such as the wireless encryption protocols (WEP, WPA and WPA2) associated with the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocols. Any number of other encryption methods can be used to encrypt data communicated to and from the mobile device in conjunction with the present invention.","A mobile device operating in conjunction with the present invention may receive information that a security compromise event has occurred from a security authority or other source using any number of messages in any format. For example, embodiments of the present invention may receive information in an SMS text message, a voice mail message, an email message, and\/or a predetermined sequence of one or more DTMF tones. The message can be of any desired format. For example, the message can be included in a file having a tokenized format such as standard ASCII text format, or any other suitable standardized file format, such as an MS Word document, MS Excel file, Adobe PDF file, or binary picture file (JPEG, bitmap, etc.). The data within such a file can be ordered in any manner and have any suitable delimiters, notations, or other features. The message may also have a unique and\/or propriety format.","In one embodiment, the message indicating a security compromise event occurred may be encoded in files such as binary picture files via steganographic techniques, so that any person viewing the file or picture may see an acceptable image while a hidden message is encoded in the data in the file and may be accessed by appropriate software techniques. For example, by sending a graphic image in a file that is named in a manner to solicit a user to open the message\/file (for example, \u201cHotJessica.JPG\u201d), then the current user of the mobile device may open the file which then triggers software on the mobile device to scan the image file, thereby extracting and decoding the steganographically encoded data from the image file. The mobile device may then interpret the decoded data, and if a lockdown event is indicated, the device may take predetermined actions to partially or completely disable use of the device in any of the manners described herein. The software on the mobile device may execute surreptitiously, whereby the application may execute forensic evidence gathering features such as taking a picture of the current user's face while the user is looking at the image file just opened while the current user is unaware that he\/she is being photographed or otherwise logged. Other commands may be sent via encoded or concealed messages, such as commands resetting the password of the device to an alternate or more secure password.","The format of the message can also be based on the method by which the message is transmitted to the mobile device. For example, where the message is transmitted to the mobile device using a wireless telephone connection, the message can be formatted as an SMS text message. Similarly, the message may be formatted as an XML record, email, and\/or facsimile. The message can include multiple formats and\/or multiple messages, and may be formatted having different formats for transmission in a variety of methods or to a variety of different mobile devices. A message received from a security authority, host server, authorized user, or other source may also include other information, such as instructions for altering the functionality of the mobile device as discussed further below.","In one embodiment of the present invention, a mobile device may be configured to assume a low-power, quiescent, or standby state, whereby the device may receive notifications from an authorized user or server such as a server administered by a security authority. Upon receiving such notification, the mobile device may take action at an appropriate time, based on contents of the notification. The mobile device may transition from a standby state to poll a server to determine whether a notification is waiting, and if so, downloads and acts upon the contents of the notification. Additionally or alternatively, the mobile device has a buffering provision that is capable of receiving notifications transmitted by a server or security authority, and acting upon the contents of the message at an appropriate time, such as when the message is received or at a predetermined time interval.","A mobile device may also detect a security compromise event by determining that the mobile device has been disassociated with a designated companion device. The mobile device may be associated with any desired type of device(s). For example, a mobile telephone may be a companion device to another mobile telephone. The two mobile telephones may be associated through a wireless connection (such as a Bluetooth connection), and the loss of the wireless connection may be used to trigger a security compromise event. Similarly, a security compromise event can be triggered when a mobile device is separated from a plurality of companion devices.","The mobile device may determine that it has been disassociated with the companion device in any desired manner, such as by measuring a power level of a wireless signal transmitted by the companion device, and determining that the measured power level has decreased below a predetermined threshold level. Additionally, the mobile device can determine it has been disassociated with the companion device by transmitting a message to the companion device and determining that a message was not received from the companion device that satisfies a predetermined confirmation criterion (e.g., an expected acknowledgement transmission). Additionally, the mobile device can determine it has been disassociated with the companion device where it is unable to establish a communications link with the companion device, or where the companion device sends a signal to the mobile device indicating that access to the mobile device should be restricted. The mobile device may determine it has been disassociated with the companion device when an amount of incident light illuminating at least one surface of the mobile device has varied from a predetermined threshold range. For example, if the mobile device is removed from a companion device such as a purse, carrying case, holster or briefcase, the increase in ambient light on at least one surface of the mobile device could be detected by an included sensor, indicating the device has been removed from a desired location. Similar approaches may include activating a security event check when, a case enclosing the mobile device is opened or if a light sensor in a mating surface between the mobile device and its companion device suddenly detects light when the two devices are disconnected or undocked.","The mobile device may be associated with a companion device in any desired manner, such as by pairing the mobile device with the companion device via a wired link and\/or a wireless link. Any desired wireless link and communications protocol may be used to pair a mobile device with a companion device. For example, a wireless link may include an ISO 14443 protocol, an ISO 18000-6 protocol, a Bluetooth protocol, a Zigbee protocol, a Wibree protocol, an IEEE 802.15 protocol, an IEEE 802.11 protocol, an IEEE 802.16 protocol, an ultra-wideband (UWB) protocol; an IrDA protocol, and combinations thereof. Likewise, a wired link may be implemented to pair a mobile device with a companion device, such as by using a computer network connection, a USB connection, a mobile device synchronization port connection, a power connection, and\/or a security cable.","A security compromise event may be associated with a change in the hardware of the mobile device. For example, a security compromise event may be determined when an identifier of a hardware identity module (such as a universal subscriber identity module and\/or a removable user identity module) in communication with the mobile device does not match one or more predetermined authorized identifiers. Any desired identifier may be used in conjunction with the present invention, such as an electronic serial number, a local area identity identifier, an integrated circuit identifier, an international mobile subscriber identifier, an authentication key identifier, and\/or an operator-specific emergency number identifier.","The hardware identity module identifier may be transmitted to a host server, stored in a storage medium (such as the memory of the mobile device or host server), or processed in any other desired manner. For example, the identifiers associated with hardware of a mobile device (e.g., hard drive, SIM card, or other hardware) can be used to determine whether an unauthorized user is attempting to circumvent software or hardware security protocols protecting the mobile device. The hardware identity module identifier (as well as any other data used in conjunction with the present invention) may be stored in any suitable manner, such as by using a memory storage device integrated with, or in communication with, the mobile device. The hardware identity module may also be encrypted, hidden, or protected in any other desired manner.","A security compromise event can be based on a change in a single hardware component of a mobile device, as well as on an overall hardware configuration of the mobile device. For example, the hardware configuration for a mobile device such as a laptop computer may include the identities of a particular hard drive, battery, RAM, BIOS, and other components of the laptop. The hardware configuration for the laptop can be stored (e.g., by a central server and\/or the mobile device) and then compared against the current hardware configuration for the laptop (e.g., periodically and\/or upon the occurrence of an event, such as a change in a hardware component). If the current hardware configuration has changed from the stored configuration beyond a predetermined threshold (e.g., more than two individual components are different), a security compromise event can be triggered. This allows a security compromise event to be issued where a thief may be swapping out components of a stolen mobile device in an attempt to circumvent security measures associated with (or stored on) the swapped components. Changes in the hardware configuration of a mobile device (such as changes in a SIM card in communication with the mobile device) can be tracked over time and reported to a security authority or authorized user to help locate the mobile device. Swapping or exchanging a SIM card may trigger a security compromise event,","A security compromise event may be determined based on the use of the mobile device and\/or the behavior of the current user. For example, referring to , determining a security compromise event () may include accumulating a usage profile of the mobile device over a predetermined time period (), accumulating information regarding continued usage of the mobile device (), and determining that the continued usage deviates from the usage profile by a predetermined threshold ().","The usage profile and the accumulated information may include any desired information about how the mobile device is used, such as a ratio of the number of calls placed from numbers residing within a contact list stored in the mobile device to numbers not residing within the contact list, the time of day that one or more calls were placed by the mobile device, a mean time interval between button presses, a pressed button type, a mean pressure exerted when pressing buttons, a number of times within a predetermined time interval that a password was input incorrectly, a number of consecutive times that a password was input incorrectly, and combinations thereof. The usage profile of an authorized user can then be compared to the accumulated information in order to determine whether or not the authorized user is still in control of the device. The mobile device may take any desired action to verify the current user is authorized to use the mobile device, such as prompting the current user to enter a password, and preventing further use of the device until the password is correctly entered.","The usage profile can be compiled over any desired time period(s). The time period may include a fixed period of time, or may be dynamically determined (e.g. shifting in time as the mobile device is utilized). The predetermined time period can be specified by an authorized user of the mobile device, as well as determined by the mobile device itself. The predetermined time period can be based on any desired criteria, such as the manner in which the device is used and\/or on the amount of information needed to compile the usage profile. Likewise, the period of time in which information about the continued usage of the mobile device can be accumulated may be specified in the same manner as that of the usage profile.","The accumulated continued usage information and the usage profile may be compared to determine the degree to which the continued usage deviates from the usage profile. A predetermined threshold may be selected according to any desired criteria to determine whether the continued usage is indicative of unauthorized use. For example, if the continued usage includes a significant number of calls outside the time range calls are usually made in the usage profile, the continued usage may be indicative of unauthorized use. Similarly, the time interval between button presses (i.e., the speed the current user is using the mobile device), the types of buttons pressed, the pressure exerted when pressing the buttons, the number of times (including consecutive times) a password is input incorrectly, and other events may be indicative (alone or in combination) of unauthorized use.","A combination of events may be weighted such that the occurrence of a security compromise event is based on a predetermined voting threshold. Individual events may be given more significance than other events, such that only a repeated occurrence of a particular event deviates from the predetermined threshold, while a single occurrence of another event deviates from the threshold. For example, a call outside the usage profile's normal time range may need to occur a total of four times before the predetermined threshold is exceeded, while the entering of an incorrect password two times in succession deviates from the threshold. Similarly, an incorrect password entry in combination with two calls outside the normal time range in the usage profile can deviate from the predetermined threshold. Events may be weighted or scored for the predetermined voting threshold in any desired manner.","A security compromise event may be determined based on the failure of a user to provide the proper biometric data. In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, a biometric measurement of a current user of the mobile device is obtained, and the biometric measurement is compared to a previously stored reference value. A security compromise event can then be determined where the biometric measurement exceeds a predetermined threshold variance from the previously stored reference value. The security compromise event may be based on any number of biometric measurements from the current user of a mobile device, such as a fingerprint scan, an iris scan, a retina scan, a voice sample, a breath sample, and\/or a photograph of a portion of the body of the current user of the mobile device.","A security compromise event may be determined based on the location of the mobile device. For example, referring now to , determining a security compromise event () may include obtaining a physical location of the mobile device (), analyzing the physical location of the mobile device to determine that the device is located in an unauthorized area (), and comparing the physical location of the mobile device to a previously stored location list ().","The physical location of the mobile device may be obtained in any manner. For example, the location of the mobile device may be ascertained using a global positioning system (GPS), through the triangulation of a signal emitted by the mobile device, through an Internet protocol (IP) address and\/or traceroute, or in any other manner. A global positioning system may include, for instance, a receiver that detects signals transmitted by transmission sources with known transmission timing and\/or known location, and through analyzing the received time-encoded signals at the mobile device. The mobile device may also ascertain its location with respect to the transmission sources. The transmission sources may be terrestrial, mobile, space-based, airborne, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the mobile device may ascertain its location on the surface of the earth by receiving and interpreting geolocation signals received from satellites in orbit about the earth. In another embodiment, the global positioning system may include a collection of terrestrial antennas and receivers that receive a signal transmitted from the mobile device, and by analyzing the angle of arrival, time of arrival, and\/or time differential of arrival of the mobile device's signal, the location of the mobile device may be ascertained via conventional multilateration approaches. Alternatively, the mobile device may receive one or more signals from known terrestrial transmitting sources such as cellular base station antennae, and through analyzing the received signals, compute its location with respect to the known terrestrial transmitting sources.","The area a mobile device is authorized to operate in may be defined in any manner. For example, the area may be a geographical area defined by a boundary, an area corresponding to a postal code, and\/or an area corresponding to a telephone area code. The area may include any number of separate individual areas. An area may be defined based on where the mobile device may operate (i.e. \u201cwhitelisting\u201d), as well as on where the mobile device may not operate (i.e. \u201cblacklisting\u201d).","The location of the mobile device may be compared to a list that defines one or more locations where the mobile device is authorized to be operated, one or more locations where the mobile device is not authorized to be operated, one or more locations where functionality of the mobile device is at least partially restricted, and\/or combinations thereof. The list may be defined by an authorized user of the device and\/or a security authority. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a central server (such as host server  depicted in ) monitors the location of the mobile device and compares the device's location to a location list previously stored in a database to determine if a security compromise event has occurred based on the location of the mobile device, and if the functionality of the device should be modified as a result. Among other things, this embodiment allows employers, parents, and other \u201csuper-users\u201d of mobile devices to define boundaries in which the mobile devices should operate when in the hands of employees or children.","A security compromise event may be determined based on the location of the mobile device. For example, referring now to , determining a security compromise event () may include measuring a first environmental parameter at a first time point (), measuring a second environmental parameter at a second time point (), comparing the first environmental parameter and second environmental parameter to a predetermined authorized use condition (), determining that the mobile device has been moved from a first location (), and transmitting at least one of the first and second measured environmental parameter to a security authority ().","As used herein, an \u201cenvironmental parameter\u201d generally includes any parameter pertaining to the mobile device's environment. The mobile device can measure any desired environmental parameter in any desired format, such as an image taken by the mobile device. Digital cameras (including cameras inside other devices, such as mobile phones), and other devices with imaging capability may thus be used to take an image of the mobile device's environment, including physical objects and people around the mobile device. Such images can then be used to identify the location of the mobile device and\/or the individual(s) responsible for taking or withholding the mobile device from its authorized user(s).","An environmental parameter may also include information from or about systems and devices in communication with the mobile device. In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, a wireless receiver in communication with the mobile device can be activated and used to sense one or more wireless network addresses from one or more signals received by the mobile device at different points in time. The network addresses sensed at different points in time can be compared to determine whether the sensed network addresses differ, and thus determine if the mobile device has moved.","An environmental parameter may further include geolocation information. The geolocation information may be measured from a global positioning system (GPS) in communication with the mobile device, as well as from any other desired source. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the mobile device may receive a signal comprising geolocation information and decode location signals received at the different points in time. The locations corresponding to the signals measured at different times may be compared to determine whether the location of the mobile device has changed, as well as whether the distance between two sampled locations exceeds a predetermined threshold. Any number of location samples can be similarly measured and compared, either to an initial location or to subsequently-measured locations. The predetermined threshold distance can be configured by a user, a security authority, and\/or automatically by the mobile device. This embodiment thus allows the movement of a mobile device to be monitored and a security compromise alert issued if it moves more than a predetermined distance.","In various embodiments of the invention, security compromise events may be detected when an unauthorized user attempts to tamper with a security provision of the mobile device. For example, conditions leading to a determination of tampering may include determining that an unauthorized user attempted to mask the reported location of the mobile device; attempted to re-route an electronic address in the mobile device; attempted to bypass a password prompt provided by the mobile device; attempted a brute force password attack on the mobile device; attempted to install applications intended to thwart operation system security, and combinations thereof. A user may specify criteria to define conditions that may indicated a security compromise event has occurred. In this context, detecting, by the mobile device, that a security compromise event has occurred further comprises obtaining from the authorized user a set of criteria indicating unauthorized use of the mobile device; and determining that at least one of the criteria indicating unauthorized use has occurred. The criteria may include a broad range of information such as, for example: a maximum number of calls that may be placed to numbers not included in a pre-stored authorized number list; a maximum number of calls that may be received by numbers not included in the pre-stored authorized number list; and the situation where a call is being placed to a country code not included in the pre-stored authorized number list. The set of criteria indicating unauthorized use of the mobile device may be stored in any suitable location, such as in the mobile device or in a database associated with a security authority.","Altering the Functionality of the Mobile Device","In the exemplary process depicted in , a determination is made as to whether the function of the device should be altered in response to the security compromise event (), and the functionality of the mobile device altered accordingly (). The functionality of a mobile device can be altered in any manner and to achieve any purpose, such as to mitigate the harm arising from the compromised status of the device, gather evidence to apprehend and convict a thief, as well as to encourage\/incentivize the return of the device to the proper owner. Referring to , altering the functionality of the mobile device () may include providing a notification to the current user (), inhibiting the functionality of the mobile device (), providing a notification to an authorized user and\/or security authority (), altering the manner in which communications to and from the mobile device are handled (), protecting data in the mobile device (), tracking the mobile device (), gathering and transmitting information on the usage of the mobile device to a security authority (), and communicating with other devices ().","The functionality of a mobile device can be altered in any manner in response to a security compromise event, including partially or completely disabling features of the device and\/or providing functionality not available prior to the security compromise event. In one embodiment of the present invention for example, the functionality of the mobile device can be altered to present an automated message to the current user of the mobile device (). The automated message may be in any format and may contain any desired information. For example, the automated message may notify the current user that the mobile device has been lost or stolen, that a reward is offered for the prompt return of the mobile device, and\/or provide instructions for returning the mobile device to the authorized user. The automated message may also notify the current user that any button may be depressed on the mobile device to initiate the recovery process, and\/or that a phone number need not be entered to contact a party to return device to its rightful owner. In such an instance, the mobile device may accept a single button press to initiate contact with a security authority or the authorized user to begin the recovery process. The message may be presented in any manner, such as an audio message, a textual message, and\/or a video message. In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, an SMS text message is transmitted by a security authority to a mobile device. The text message is decoded and a command sent to an application residing on the mobile device, such as a web browser, a text editor, graphic image displayer, a message screen, or a bitmap displayer and\/or any other application capable of displaying a notification. The command may, for example, display a pre-stored message or image, instructing the user in regards to returning the device to the authorized user. The application may reside on a hardware component within the mobile device, such as a SIM card installed in a mobile phone or laptop computer. The message may also be presented at any desired time or in response to any desired event, such as when the current user is attempting to utilize the mobile device (e.g., by placing a call on a mobile telephone). For example, the message may be presented upon startup of the device. In this manner, a user that has found a lost device may obtain information regarding returning the device even where the device has not established a connection to a host server such as one operated a security authority.","The functionality of the mobile device may be altered to inhibit a user's ability to utilize the mobile device (). For example, a sequence of DTMF tones (e.g., for a mobile telephone) or an unpleasant sound may be played over a speaker in the mobile device while the current user is attempting to use the mobile device. Additionally, the illumination level of a display on the mobile device may be altered to frustrate the use of the mobile device (e.g., by decreasing the illumination level) and\/or to draw attention to the mobile device (e.g., by increasing the illumination level) so that bystanders may notice the device or its unauthorized use. In addition, an aural may be played over a signal over a loudspeaker of the mobile device, and the aural signal may comprise a variety of information including a pre-recorded message such as a human voice notifying listeners that the mobile device has been lost or stolen; a pre-recorded scream; verbal instructions regarding how to return the mobile device to at least one of the authorized user and the security authority; or an alarm signal.","A predetermined set of features of the mobile device can be inhibited in response to a security compromise event, such as when the mobile device is reported stolen or lost by the authorized user. In one embodiment of the present invention, for example, the functionality of the mobile device is modified based on a list of features to be restricted upon occurrence of the security compromise event. The list of features may be defined in any manner, such as by an authorized user accessing a web interface and selecting features to be disabled if the mobile device is lost or stolen. The list of features may then be transferred to, and stored by, the mobile device. One or more specifically configured lists of features for various security compromise events may be provided to the mobile device, for example one list may indicate that or more of the features on the list could be disabled if the phone is reported stolen, while a less restrictive list may be provided for when the phone is reported as misplaced. In this manner, multiple feature modification lists for the mobile device may provide for event-appropriate responses based on the type of security compromise that has occurred. In another embodiment, a default security compromise action list is executed by the mobile device if the mobile device detects a security compromise event and no other list of restricted features has been transferred to the mobile device by the authorized user or a verified security authority. For example, but not by way of limitation, a default security compromise action list defines common features of a mobile device that need to altered when control of the mobile device is lost. Alternately, the list of features may be identified by a user through a software interface on the mobile device itself.","The functionality of the mobile device may be modified from a first set of features to a second set of features based on the occurrence of a security compromise event. The differences between the first feature set and second feature set can be based on any desired criteria, such as the context of use of the mobile device. For example, the feature sets may be based on a level of security desired for the mobile device, an application the mobile device is being used for, the location of the mobile device, or any other contextual factor(s).","The functionality of the mobile device may be inhibited in any other desired manner. For example, a mobile phone may be prevented from placing phone calls, sending emails or text messages, or engaging in other forms of communication. In the case where the mobile device comprises a mobile telephone, the phone numbers that may be called from the mobile device can be restricted to a predetermined list of numbers, or to only one or more predetermined numbers within a contact list on the mobile phone. For example, a mobile device may be restricted to only allow emergency calls to be placed, and\/or to place a call to a security authority (for example, a user may press a single key to place a call to the security authority). Additionally, DTMF tones can be played on a loudspeaker of the mobile device while the mobile phone is in use to interfere with the current user using the mobile phone. Similarly, frequent messages (e.g. a text message and\/or audio message) can be provided, instructing the current user of a mobile device to contact a security authority to initiate return of the mobile device to the authorized user. The subscriber identity module (SIM) of a mobile phone can also be locked out until the user enters a personal unblocking code. The unblocking code may be known to the authorized user(s) prior to the occurrence of the security compromise event, or can be provided to the authorized user(s) by a security authority. Additionally, an authorized user(s) may unlock the mobile device through a host server such a server operated by a security authority, or by entering a PIN number or password corresponding with a PIN number or password that was furnished by the user during a registration process and stored in a database for unlock authentication purposes. Any other functions of a mobile device can be disabled (in part or in whole), or interfered with, to diminish the usefulness of the mobile device to an unauthorized user.","The authorized user of the mobile device may also request to lock the device by using a web browser or other remote application to instruct a security authority to relay a command to lock the mobile device; and in this event message is formatted transmission to the mobile device, wherein the message comprises a command to be decoded by the mobile device. The command may instruct the mobile device to execute any desired function, including disabling at least one feature of the mobile device.","The functionality of the mobile device can be inhibited by requiring entry of a password before the mobile device may be used by a current user. Where an invalid password is entered, a delay may additionally be introduced before entry of another password may be attempted by the current user. In conjunction with requiring the password, selectable indicia (e.g., a web link and\/or button on a display) may be provided that give instructions on how to return the mobile device. The instructions can be provided without the current user needing to enter a valid user id and password. Additionally, the current user may be prompted to enter his or her identification information, which is stored on the mobile device and transferred to a security authority when the mobile device has an opportunity to make a communications connection to the security authority. This may allow a security authority to locate an innocent finder of the device, as well as someone who stole the device. For example, but not by way of limitation, the prompt can include a message that notifies the current user of the device that they have won a substantial prize and need to take an action to redeem the prize offer. In such a case, the current user of a device may be solicited to provide information that could be used to redeem the spurious prize, but in fact is used to locate and or apprehend current user. Alternatively, or in combination, the current user of the mobile device may be sent a graphical image with a name or image that encourages the current user to open a message or file, and while looking at the file or image, a command is decoded from the image via steganographic techniques, whereby the command may be executed by the mobile device to mitigate the loss of control of the mobile device.","The mobile device can be significantly disabled or entirely shut down to prevent its use and help prevent an unauthorized user from attempting to circumvent security protections on the mobile device. In some cases, such as when information stored on the mobile device is sensitive, or when there is a very small likelihood of recovering the mobile device (or its data), it may be desirable to command the mobile device to perform a destructive function that renders the mobile device inoperable. The destructive function may include erasing and\/or overwriting data and software stored on the mobile device. The destructive function may also include physically damaging the hardware of the mobile device, such as by commanding the mobile device to deliver an electric charge or current to damage an electronic component of the mobile device.","For example, when such a condition occurs, an integrated circuit within the mobile device could be rendered permanently inoperable. Alternatively, a component such as a fusible link which is designed to be electrically destroyed may be purposely blown by software in the mobile device, at which time the mobile device may be rendered inoperable, but repairable by a an authorized technician. Further, the mobile device may execute an instruction to cause an internal circuit breaker in the mobile device trip, thereby rendering the mobile device at least temporarily inoperable, until the circuit breaker is reset by an authorized technician.","The functionality of the mobile device may be altered to send a message to an authorized user of the device, a security authority, or other recipient (). The message may include any desired information, such as a phone number called by the mobile device, the current operational status of the mobile device, the location of the mobile device, a statement indicating that the mobile device has been removed from a predetermined location and\/or is in motion, a date and time stamp indicating when the device was first used after occurrence of the security event, and\/or instructions to call a security authority to initiate a recovery process. The mobile device can thus provide information on its use and location to aid a security authority or authorized user in finding the mobile device.","The authorized user(s) of the mobile device may not necessarily be aware that a security compromise event has occurred. In order to alert an authorized user that a security compromise event has occurred, a theft notification record for an authorized user can be stored at a central server as well as on the mobile device itself to allow the authorized user to be contacted and notified. The theft notification record can include any desired information regarding the authorized user, such as the authorized user's contact information and information that can be used to validate the authorized user's identity. A message to the authorized user may be in any format and may include any desired information. For example, a phone call can placed to a phone number specified in the theft notification record, whereupon audio instructions (from a live operator or pre-recorded) are provided to the authorized user regarding how to contact the current user of the mobile device to recover the mobile device. Likewise, a text message can be sent electronically, or a printed message may be sent by conventional mail, to an address specified in the theft notification record regarding how to contact the current user of the mobile device to recover it. The message may be provided by any system, device, or individual, such as a security authority monitoring the mobile device and\/or the mobile device itself.","The functionality of the mobile device may be altered with regards to the handling of communications to and from the mobile device (). In addition to prohibiting or restricting communications to and from the device as discussed above, communications from the device by an unauthorized user can be intercepted and forwarded to a security authority, an authorized user, or other recipients to aid in identifying the unauthorized user and the location of the mobile device. In this manner, the present invention will route calls that were directed to the authorized user's lost or stolen device to an alternate number designated by the authorized user; the authorized user will then be able to receive calls that would have otherwise been missed. In the case where the mobile device comprises a mobile telephone, telephone numbers dialed by the unauthorized user can be logged and transmitted to the security authority and\/or authorized user, and authorized user and\/or security authority can be alerted as the mobile device is engaging in a telephone call. A third party (such as a security authority) may request to access the telephone call, and then establish a conference connection to the telephone call. The third party may actively participate in the conversation or listen to the conversation surreptitiously.","When a current user of the mobile device enters a phone number in the mobile device and places a call, further steps may include intercepting the call and routing the call to an interactive voice response system. In one case, a pre-recorded message may be annunciated to at least the current user of the mobile device that the call is being recorded, followed by recording at least part of a conversation being conducted by the current user of the mobile device. In another embodiment, once the current user of the mobile device has entered a phone number to place a call, the mitigation process may include intercepting the call and routing the call to a predetermined phone number.","Text messages may also be intercepted. In one embodiment, altering the function of the mobile device includes intercepting a text message submitted by a current user of the mobile device; and routing a copy of the text message to at least one of a security authority and the authorized user.","The data stored on a mobile device may be protected () in any desired manner, such as by encryption. Any portion of the stored data may be encrypted, such as files or other data elements designated (e.g., by a list, flag on the file, location of the file, or other method) to be encrypted upon the occurrence of a security compromise event. Alternatively, files and data elements may be encrypted as they are created so that they cannot be viewed by an unauthorized user even before a security compromise event has been determined. An authorized user may designate individual files to be encrypted, as well as types of files to encrypt. In addition to, or as an alternative to, encryption, files may be hidden from the file system of the mobile device to prevent their access by an unauthorized user. Authorized users can gain access to such files through, for example, a software application independent of the operating system of the mobile device that verifies the user is authorized to access the files.","Designated files can be encrypted independent of the mobile device's operating system, such as through an independent software application that encrypts\/decrypts files and allows a user to access them. The operating system is thus blocked from accessing such files, preventing an unauthorized user from exploiting security flaws in the operating system to view protected files. Operating system calls to open such files can be intercepted and the files opened and decrypted if the current user is authorized to access the files. Similarly, operating system calls to close such files can be intercepted and the files closed and decrypted by the independent software application. Files stored on the mobile device may be encrypted and decrypted in any desired manner, such as with a password known by a security authority and\/or the authorized user.","In one embodiment of the present invention for example, to increase the level of protection for data stored on the mobile device, a password on the mobile device can be modified to utilize a password that is more secure, for example, by using a longer and\/or more complex password code, or setting a password where the mobile device was not protected by a password. Normally, these more secure or enhanced-strength passwords are considered less user friendly and are often not used as primary passwords by the authorized users. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention may adaptively modify the strength of passwords on mobile devices depending on the security state and context of a mobile device.","Some or all of the data stored on the mobile device may be erased in response to a security compromise event to protect it from unauthorized access. Any desired files of other data elements can be erased. For example, an authorized user may specify a list of data elements to be deleted upon occurrence of the security compromise event. Additionally, deleted data elements may be overwritten with other data to prevent forensic recovery of the data. Deleted data may be overwritten any desired number of times, and with any desired data (such as random data, alternating data values, predetermined data patterns, and a combination thereof).","Some or all of the data stored on the mobile device may further be archived to allow an authorized user to recover the data, even if the mobile device is not recovered. As with files marked for encryption and\/or deletion, an authorized user may specify particular files or other data to be archived in any desired manner. The authorized user may also specify one or more destinations to which the archived data should be transmitted to in the event of a security compromise event, such as a security authority, host server, or an alternate device accessible by the authorized user (e.g., another mobile device of the same type or a central data server). The archived data may be transmitted from the mobile device to a specified destination in conjunction with the encryption or deletion of the data upon a successful transfer. An authorized user may then retrieve the archived data to a replacement mobile device, or may instruct that the archived data be delivered to any other desired destination. For example, the authorized user may specify a destination address (such as an email address or physical mailing address) to which an electronic copy or physical copy (e.g., the archived data stored on a portable storage medium) can be delivered. Any type of data stored on the mobile device may be archived, such as documents, email or telephone contact information, software applications, media files, and\/or pictures. Additionally, licensing information pertaining to one or more data elements may be archived.","Data may be archived at any time, including, upon occurrence of a security compromise event, according to a predetermined schedule, and or at a time specified by an authorized user, security authority, or other authorized entity.","Systems and methods of the present invention may store sensitive data in a specified location for special processing upon the occurrence of a security compromise event. The specified location may be a physical location in a memory, as well as a location designated through the file system of the mobile device. For example, an authorized user may store sensitive data elements in a special folder on the file system of the mobile device. When a security compromise event occurs, one or more functions can be executed on the data elements within the folder, such as encrypting one or more of the sensitive data elements with a password known to the authorized user and\/or a security authority, deleting one or more of the sensitive data elements, multiply overwriting one or more of the sensitive data elements, and\/or transmitting one or more of the sensitive data elements to an address specified by the authorized user. The special designation of files allows, among other things, important data to be quickly protected, archived, and\/or destroyed before handling less sensitive data in the event of a security compromise event.","The functionality of the mobile device may be altered to aid in tracking the device () following the occurrence of a security compromise event. For example, the mobile device may determine a network address (including a wireless network address) assigned to the mobile device, as well as wireless access point identifiers from signals received by the mobile device. The mobile device can store and transmit the address(es) and identifier(s) to a security authority. The security authority may then determine, based on the network addresses and wireless access point identifiers, a location of the mobile device.","Similarly, the mobile device may receive a signal from a GPS or other source providing geolocation information. The geolocation information from the signal can be stored and transmitted to a security authority. A security authority or authorized user receiving location information from the mobile device can present the location on a map overlay to track the current position of the mobile device, as well as the date and time of any changes in the mobile device's position. The map of the mobile device's position can be provided through a web site over the Internet to allow police officers or other security authority members to locate the mobile device.","The functionality of a mobile device may be altered to gather information on how the mobile device is being used by an unauthorized user and provide that information to an authorized user or security authority to aid in locating the device and\/or unauthorized user (). For example, phone numbers and email addresses to which messages are sent after occurrence of the security compromise event may be stored by the mobile device and transmitted to a security authority. Data-capturing equipment onboard a mobile device (such as a digital camera or microphone) can also be used to gather information on the user of the mobile device, mobile device's present environment. A camera in communication with the mobile device, for example, can be activated to capture a still image or video clip, which can be stored in the mobile device and transmitted to a security authority. Similarly, a microphone may be used to capture audio clips. Data-capturing equipment such as the camera and microphone can be used to take continuous samples of data to help locate the device, inhibit use of the data capture device by the unauthorized user, and\/or to wear down the battery of the mobile device to diminish it's usefulness to the unauthorized user. Alternately, the data capture device may be disabled to preserve battery life and\/or to prevent its use by the unauthorized user.","The microphone or camera may be activated upon any desired condition being satisfied, such as: the mobile device receiving a call from a predetermined phone number; when the mobile device receives a call during which a predetermined pattern of DTMF tones is received by the mobile device; or during a call received by the mobile device, an utterance received by the mobile device matches within a predetermined threshold a security enablement utterance stored within the mobile device. In other embodiments, the microphone or camera is activated upon the mobile device receiving a text message from a predetermined source, or when a received text message contains a predetermined text string such as a code indicating that the device should assume a security lockdown status. Audio or video samples obtained by the microphone and\/or video camera may be stored on the mobile device for later retrieval and\/or further relayed to the authorized user and\/or a security authority.","In order to help capture an image of the face of an unauthorized user, the mobile device may prompt the user to undertake an activity that involves looking at the mobile device, such as prompting the user to enter a password, playing an audio sequence on the mobile device, strobing a light source on the mobile device, announcing that the current user has won a prize and instructing him\/her to watch for prize redemption details, and\/or displaying a video sequence. While the current user's attention is focused on the mobile device, the camera may be used to capture an image of his\/her face for transmittal to a security authority. Similarly, a camera or microphone in communication with the mobile device can be activated in conjunction with initiating a surreptitious communication session with a security authority. Still images, video, and audio data captured by the mobile device can then be transmitted to the security authority. The security authority can use images\/video of the unauthorized user to identify him\/her (e.g., through comparing the images\/video to police booking photos), and can also use the images\/video to identify the surroundings of the mobile device. The unauthorized user may also be identified from samples of the unauthorized user's voice (taken from captured audio clips).","As discussed previously, messages sent to and from the mobile device may be intercepted and\/or rerouted to a security authority to prevent unauthorized use of the device and to help identify an unauthorized user and\/or the location of the mobile device.
