An electromagnetic service may comprise multiple categories of electromagnetic service, such as electrical power and data in a single signal. An electromagnetic service may be provided continuously, for specified times, for specified amounts, or for the duration of certain events, such as the duration of coupling to provide timed dispensing. Alternatively, an electromagnetic service may be provided in quanta, such, as packets of data. Also alternatively, an electromagnetic service may include data encoded into in waves such as light, radio, and sound.","\u201cWireless\u201d refers to a type of communication in which power and\/or data is transferred over a distance without the use of electrical conductors or wires. For example, electromagnetic waves, light waves, or acoustic waves can be used to carry power and\/or data over a distance without using electrical conductors or wires.","\u201cElectrical power communication\u201d is the coupling of at least two devices to supply electrical power from at least one of the devices to the other of the devices, such as through directly connected electronic lines or through wireless power communication (also referred to as wireless power transmission). Wireless power communication may include any type of wireless power communication, including, without limitation for illustration purposes, microwave transmission, laser transmission, and magnetic fields. Exemplary categories of power communication include the type of power, e.g. alternating current (also known as AC) or direct current (also known as DC), supplied to the functional device and variations in the characteristics of the power, such as the voltage or current.","\u201cData communication\u201d is the coupling of at least two devices to transmit data from at least one of the devices to the other of the devices, such as through directly connected electronic lines or through wireless data communication (also referred to as wireless data transmission).

The service connector components cooperate with one another to couple the useful devices to facilitate communication of a service between the useful devices. A service connector system may carry multiple services. An electromagnetic service connector system, for example, may be associated with or incorporated into a substance connector or may be independent of a substance connector but be associated with the same substance holder, substance provider or substance consumer.","A \u201cswitched service connector system\u201d is a service connector system having a switching capability in at least one of the service connector components operable to selectively permit the communication of a service between the components of the service connector system.","A \u201cservice switch\u201d is any component used to selectively permit the communication of a service between components of a service connector system. A service switch which selectively permits the communication of a substance may be referred to as a \u201csubstance switch\u201d. A service switch may be associated with more than one type of service. For example, an electromagnetic service switch may be associated with, integrated with, or comprise a substance switch or may be independent of a substance switch.","A \u201cservice line\u201d is a pathway for transferring a service from one location to another. The service line may have any of a variety of configurations, including, but not limited to, a pipe, a conduit, a wire, a tube, a channel, and a fiber optic cable. More particularly, to transfer electrical power or data service communication, an electromagnetic service line may include an electrically conductive wire, an optical data cable, or a wireless transmission system.","The terms \u201cprovide\u201d and \u201csupply\u201d and any variation thereof, are used herein to denote a source of the substance or an electromagnetic service relative to a device receiving the substance or electromagnetic service. Neither term is limited to the original source of the substance or electromagnetic service. A device that provides or supplies the substance or electromagnetic service may simply be passing on the substance or electromagnetic service from the original source. For example, a device that provides water may pass on water it receives from a residential water supply. However, the device may alternatively or additionally provide another substance that originates with the device, such as an additive stored in a reservoir.","The term \u201creceive\u201d and any variation thereof is used herein to denote receipt of the substance or an electromagnetic service relative to the device providing the substance or electromagnetic service. The term not limited to the ultimate consumer of the substance or electromagnetic service. The term \u201creceive\u201d is applicable as well to a device that may simply be passing on the substance or electromagnetic service from the source, such as an appliance, to a device that will consume, as hereinafter defined, the substance or electromagnetic service. The device which receives a substance is not necessarily the end consumer of the substance or electromagnetic service.","The term \u201cconsume\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, denotes the act of employing or dispensing at least a portion of the substance or electromagnetic service received in connection with performing a function.","The term \u201ccoupled\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, includes any type of connection that permits transfer of a substance or an electromagnetic service between two devices. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d does not require a physical connection between the two devices, so long as the coupling permits transfer of a substance or an electromagnetic service. The term \u201ccoupled\u201d includes both fixed and removable coupling, as well as both continuous and intermittent coupling.","The term \u201cuseful device\u201d and any variation thereof, as used herein, is a device that is capable of performing a useful physical or virtual function either alone or in combination with another device.","As used herein, the term \u201chost\u201d is an apparatus that has a primary function independent of providing or receiving a substance. A host may be a substance provider, a substance consumer, or both. For example, the host may be an appliance and the primary function may be performing a series of steps to conduct a useful cycle of operation. The appliance may be a conventional household appliance, such as a refrigerator performing a cooling cycle or an ice making cycle. Other examples of appliances that may be hosts include, but are not limited to, a freezer, a conventional oven, a microwave oven, a dishwashing machine, a stove, a range, an air conditioner, a dehumidifier, a clothes washing machine, a clothes dryer, a clothes refreshing machine, and a non-aqueous washing apparatus, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, the host may be a fixture such as a water softener, a water heater, a furnace, pool water treatment equipment, or an HVAC system. The host may be a small device such as a thermostat, a blender, a mixer, a toaster, a coffee maker, a trash compactor, an air purifier, an iron, a vacuum cleaner, or a robot. The host may alternatively comprise a structural feature of a building, such as a wall, a cabinet, or a door. The host may also provide other services, such as electrical power, electronic data, mechanical power, illumination, heat, or sound.","As used herein, the terms \u201caccessory\u201d or an \u201caccessory device\u201d refer to any useful device which may be coupled to a host and communicate a substance to or from the host. An accessory device may be used primarily in conjunction with a host to enhance, supplement, regulate, or monitor the functionality of the host or may have independent functionality and utility. An accessory device may be a substance provider, a substance consumer, or both. An accessory device may be a substance holder or a consumable holder. Examples of an accessory device include, but are not limited to, a paper product dispenser, a dry goods dispenser, a bottle opener, a liquid dispenser, a pill dispenser, a water dispenser, a fan, a motor, a tissue dispenser, a can opener, a mixer, a blender, an ice dispenser, an ice maker, an ice cream maker, a coffee maker, a soap dispenser, and a softener dispenser. An accessory or accessory device may also communicate electromagnetic service with the host.","A \u201cproximity target\u201d as used herein is any component or device that may be detected when positioned within a predetermined distance of an associated proximity sensor, defined below. A proximity target may be passive, such as a visual target or a magnetic target formed of magnetic or magnetic responsive material. Other examples of passive proximity targets may include a conductive component or surface capable of cooperating with a magnetic field, a current, or a voltage provided by a proximity sensor. A proximity target may alternatively be active or powered such as an electromagnet, a generator of a magnetic field, a current, a voltage or an acoustic wave. An active proximity target may alternatively provide a powered readable display or dispense a detectable chemical.","A \u201cproximity sensor\u201d as used herein is any component or device that may detect an associated proximity target when the proximity target is within a predetermined distance of the proximity sensor. A proximity sensor may detect, for example, a change in an electromagnetic field, an electromagnetic wave, an acoustic wave, a visual target, a chemical component, an electrical signal, a change in voltage, a change in current, a change in frequency, a change in resistance, a change in inductance, a change in capacitance, a mechanical signal, a change in pressure, a displacement, a vibration, and the presence of a chemical, A proximity sensor may be active or passive, such as a magnetic sensor of magnetic or magnet responsive material, or may alternatively be active. Examples of active sensors include active magnetic sensors, light sensors, optical sensors, acoustic sensors, electromagnetic sensors, chemical sensors and thermal sensors. Examples of magnetic sensors include magnets and magnetic responsive components. Examples of optical sensors include infrared sensors, photoelectric sensors, fiber optic sensors, photo resistors, photovoltaic sensors, photo diodes and cameras. Examples of electromagnetic sensors include radio receivers, radar sensors, Hall Effect sensors, inductive sensors, capacitive sensors, variable reluctance sensors and eddy current sensors. Examples of acoustic sensors include ultrasonic sensors and microphones. A contact proximity sensor detects a proximity target by touching the proximity target. A contactless proximity sensor detects the proximity target through a wireless or contactless means. For example, magnetic flux can be used as the signaling mechanism between a contactless proximity sensor and a contactless proximity target.","As used herein, the term \u201cproximity system\u201d is a system that uses a \u201cproximity switch\u201d operated by a plurality of \u201cproximity coupling components,\u201d each associated with a different parent device, for determining that the parent devices are in proximity with each other. Parent devices are usually paired, examples of which include a service provide and a service consumer, a host and an accessory, and a host and an adapter. Proximity coupling components may include a proximity target associated with one parent device to actively or passively provide an indication of the presence of the one parent device and a proximity sensor associated with the other parent device that is responsive to the presence of the proximity target to activate the proximity switch. The proximity switch may be used to provide a signal or message indicative of the proximity of the parent devices or may directly or indirectly regulate the flow of a service along a service line. The proximity systems disclosed in herein employ contact proximity systems, wherein the proximity target and proximity switch use physical contact to detect the proximity of the two parent devices.","A \u201cplug\u201d as used herein is a generally male electromagnetic service connection component.","A \u201creceptacle\u201d as used herein is a generally female electromagnetic service connection component.","As used herein, the term \u201cadapter\u201d is an intermediate device that may be provided between a first and second useful device, such as between a host and an accessory, to facilitate the communication of substances between the first and second useful devices. An adapter may receive a substance from the first useful device and provide the substance or a modified version of the substance to the second useful device, for example, by providing a substance or by dispensing substance through a metering process, by processing the substance, or by combining the substance with an additive, for example. In some applications, multiple adapters may be interposed between two useful devices. In other applications, three or more useful devices may be coupled to a single adapter, such as multiple accessories for a host. In some applications, the adapter may itself be a useful device providing a useful function not provided by the other useful device or devices coupled to it. An adapter may also facilitate the communication of an electromagnetic service between the first and second useful devices. An adapter may optionally include a transformative component that transforms a service from a service provider to a different service, which is supplied to a service consumer. This may be useful when the service from the service provider is not compatible with the service consumer. The transformative component can be configured to transform the service into a compatible form for the service consumer. Examples of transformative components are protocol converters, power transformers, or other devices that convert substance, energy, or data from a first form to a second form.","Referring to , a substance handling system  is illustrated in schematic form and has a first substance communicating device , such as an appliance, with a smart process control apparatus , and a second substance communicating device , such as a consumable holder. Second substance communicating device  may be disposed inside or outside or on the first substance communicating device . It may be installed during manufacture and sold with first substance communicating device , or it may be made and sold separately as an upgrade or addition. Second substance communicating device  may optionally have its own process control apparatus , which may be in communication with smart process control apparatus  of first substance communicating device  or may operate independently. Process control apparatus  and  may provide at least a portion of the system software architecture and electronics  for substance handling system . Process control apparatus  and  may include sensors, actuators, wiring, and other components normally found in an electro-mechanical or mechanical control system. Either process control apparatus  or  may be able to control itself in limited ways through mechanical techniques. More typically and as illustrated herein, electronics , shown in , are connected to the process control apparatus  providing additional functionality. Process control apparatus  and electronics  may be considered in combination as a process control apparatus. Smart process control apparatus  may also include electronics which interact with the process control apparatus  in order to make control decisions based on inputs from sensors or networks and execute those decisions either by network message or the control of actuators within the process control apparatus, but the electronics are not illustrated herein.","First substance communicating device  may communicate, through one or more interface or service connector system , a substance with second substance communicating device , and may as well communicate one or more additional services, such as a data service or a power service. Service connector system  may include one or more service couplers or connector components, such as A and B for enabling the communication of one or more services, such as, for example, multiple substance services or a substance service and an electromagnetic service. For example, first substance communicating device  may be an automatic clothes washer acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be an additive dispensing accessory capable of dispensing one or more fabric treatment chemicals, such as detergent, bleach or softener, for use by the automatic clothes washer in the processing of a fabric load. As another example, first substance communicating device  may be a refrigeration appliance having a water supply and acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be a flavoring dispensing accessory capable of dispensing one or more food flavoring chemicals, such as fruit flavored drink powder, for use by the refrigeration in providing consumers with a flavored drink. As still another example, first substance communicating device  may be a refrigeration appliance having a water supply and acting as a host for the second substance communicating device , and second substance communicating device  may be a drink dispensing accessory holding one or more food flavoring chemicals, such as fruit flavored drink powder, and capable of receiving cooled water from the refrigeration appliance, mixing it with a food flavoring chemical, and dispensing a drink to a consumer. These and other examples are discussed below in more detail.","In general, first substance communicating device  may be configured to perform an operation on a physical article , such as clothing or food, using a resource, such as water, temperature-controlled air (hot or cold), steam, gas, or electricity, provided to first substance communicating device  by interfaces, not shown, with a utility, not shown, supplying the resource. Examples of appliances that perform an operation on physical article include a wide range of device types, including but not limited to, washers, dryers, ovens, ranges, steam cookers, ice makers, refrigerators, drink makers and the like. Articles  are the objects upon which a user intends the appliance to perform its cycle of operation. Typical examples as mentioned above would include food and clothing.","Smart process control apparatus  is configured to implement and control a cycle comprising at least one operation. Smart process control apparatus  may comprise one or more components, not shown, such as electronic control boards, wiring and wiring harnesses, power-supplies, sensors integrated with the electronics as digital or analog inputs, and actuators like valves, relays, heaters, and the like, any or all of which may integrate with the electronics as digital or analog outputs.","Exemplary second substance communicating device  is configured to hold, carry, supply, communicate with, or otherwise interact directly with a consulable . When performing a cycle of operation on an article , first substance communicating device  will often use at least one consulable . A consulable  in one sense comprises a substance, device, or other product that would be at least partially consumed or transformed by first substance communicating device  during a cycle of operation on an article , such that consulable  may be periodically replaced or replenished. The period after which consumable  may be replaced or replenished may be, but is not limited to, a single cycle of operation, multiple cycles of operation, an amount of time, or a number of uses. For example, many common washing machines require that a user place a single dose of detergent in a dispenser prior to initiating a cycle of operation. For each subsequent cycle of operation, the user must again place a single dose in the dispenser, as a single dose of detergent is consumed by the washing machine during each cycle of operation.","In some cases, the consulable  may be the article , on which the first substance communicating device  performs the cycle of operation, and the consumable may be subsequently consumed by a user. A consulable  may, for example, be anything that would be consumed or otherwise used by a person, such as food, beverages, cosmetics, or medicine. For example, in a cooking or refrigeration appliance, the consumable may be a food item communicated from a dispenser to an appliance, and the cycle of operation performed by the appliance may be heating or cooling the food.","Consumables are to be distinguished from resources, although resources may in some circumstances be \u201cconsumed\u201d during a cycle of operation. Resources are commodities that are continuously available to an appliance, and used by the appliance in its cycles of operation on articles  that are supplied by external utilities, such as a residential water, power, data or natural gas distribution system, or are available from the ambient environment, such as air. In some cases, a material resource, such as air and water, may also be considered an article  as in a refrigerator that chills and dispenses water. That is, water in that instance is a resource (continuously available to the refrigerator from a residential utility), but also an article  (intended by the user for the refrigerator to act upon). The cycles of operation performed by the refrigerator would include the chilling and dispensing. Things that hold or supply resources, such as water supply lines or air conduits are not considered consumable holders. They would be \u201cresource holders\u201d, which may be supplied by resource providers. In a refrigerator, for example, water supplied to the first substance communicating device  would be considered a resource and\/or an article . If flavoring is mixed with the water supplied to first substance communicating device , the flavoring may be considered a consulable , and whatever holds\/supplies the flavoring is then considered to be second substance communicating device .","Consumables are also to be distinguished from parts in an appliance, although parts wear out and need to be replaced or replenished as do consumables. Parts are devices, without which a cycle of operation by the appliance or a principal function of the appliance would be hampered. Examples include valves, actuators, switches, tubes, lamps, wiring, motors, pumps, seals, gears and the like. Consumables, on the other hand, are typically not critical to the operation of the appliance, although they provide a benefit to a user of the appliance. An appliance may typically still operate on an article  in some fashion without a consumable, though not necessarily as effectively or efficiently.","Second substance communicating device  comprises a device that holds or contains consulable . Typically, consulable  is contained by a consumable holder. In some cases, second substance communicating device  may be nested within one or more other consumable holders. For example, a cartridge holding a consumable may be disposed in a dispenser.","In some cases articles  on which the appliance operates may not be contained by a consumable holder, and may not be consumables in the sense herein defined. Rather, the articles  may be enabled to perform at least some of the functionalities of a consumable and\/or a substance communicating device. An example of an article  with substance communicating device capabilities is a shirt having a bar code thereon containing information that is directly readable by first substance communicating device . The bar code may be, for example, on a performance tag. First substance communicating device  may use data and\/or information represented by the bar code for use in configuring and selecting the cycle of operation of the appliance. The bar code may be read by first substance communicating device  while the shirt is being operated contemporaneously with the cycle of operation.","A performance tag is an information holder either integrally formed or selectively attached to an article  and adapted to maintain its integrity over the life of the article . For example, a performance tag for clothing would be adapted to maintain its integrity throughout the repeated processes of washing in a washing machine appliance, drying in a dryer, being cleaned at a dry cleaners, being ironed, being left in the sun, and being subjected to the impacts sustained during usage. Examples of impacts sustained during usage for a shirt are those that might occur during a soccer match where the shirt impacts the earth and other players at considerable speeds and forces repeatedly. Likewise, performance tags for dishes would be subjected to similar impacts, and similar wash and dry cycles from a dishwasher. Performance tags integrally formed with fabric items might be sewn in, glued in, woven in, stamped on, or printed on during the manufacturing of the article  or by a home machine adapted to integrate the article  and the tag. Performance tags integrally formed with dishware might be glued, stamped, printed, embossed, cast, molded, or otherwise formed during the manufacturing of the article  or by a home machine adapted to integrate the article  and the tag. Performance tags that are selectively attached to an article  could be attached by sewing, gluing, pining, sticking, printing, embossing, or other like methods in the home environment for articles  not specifically adapted for receiving a performance tag. Performance tags are constructed of any suitable material that may be used to hold encoded information about a cycle structure, or information about a consumable, the description of which is contained herein. Examples of materials for holding the information include magnetic strips, bar codes, and images of encoded data including color patterns, shape patterns, plain texts, numeric identifiers, and the like. An appliance having a cycle architecture and being in communication with a performance tag (as for example by using a consumable reader) may optimize the cycle of operation in the appliance for the article  in response to the cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, and\/or data about a consumable held by the performance tag. Performance tags may either hold information or hold other information about how to find the information. An example of a performance tag that holds other information is a performance tag holding a URL wherein the data returned when invoking the URL is the information. Further, the appliance may alter or optimize the user experience further by providing information on a user interface in response to the cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, and\/or data about a consumable.","Other examples further illustrate the foregoing distinctions. Consider using an oven to cook a turkey in a roasting pan where there is a steam dispenser with a basting cartridge for automatic basting. The turkey is the article  upon which the appliance (the oven) performs its cycle of operation (cooking) However, the turkey is also a consumable in the sense that it is a food item to be consumed by the user. The basting cartridge would be a consumable holder and its contents a consumable. The water used to generate the steam is a resource, making the steam a changed resource. The roasting pan would be a second consumable holder, holding the turkey. The appliance or the roasting pan or some other device (such as a performance tag described below) may also hold information about the turkey or how to cook a turkey or how to cook a turkey in different kinds of ovens. Such information would be considered information about a consumable and information about a cycle structure.","Consider also a powdered detergent box with a performance tag configured to communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with the dispensing of the detergent to a washer. The washer is the appliance, the detergent is a consumable, and the box is a consumable holder. The performance tag may hold information about the chemistry of the powder, information about cycle structures, and data about cycle structures wherein the information and data are associated with other information comprising appliance types, fabric types, stain types, and the like so that the data and information may be used alone or combined with the other information to create a cycle of operation in response to the data and the information and in response to the user and the user preferences about the cycle of operation, the data, the information, and the other information.","Consider also a detergent pellet with an etched or embossed or imprinted cycle structure enabled to communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with being introduced into a washing machine before or during a wash cycle. Here, the washing machine is an appliance and the detergent pellet is a consumable. There is no separate consumable holder. The cycle structure is intended to effect the cycle of operation (washing). Consider also a detergent pellet having a data pod. The detergent pellet is a consumable, but the data pod is a form of performance tag that could communicate with an appliance contemporaneously with being introduced into the use environment for the purpose of effecting the cycle of operation.","A consumable or a consumable holder or a performance tag or data pod or anything that may hold and convey information (consumable information holder) might comprise one or more cycle structures. A first cycle structure may be associated with a first appliance or first appliance type and a second cycle structure may be associated with a second appliance or a second appliance type such that the appropriate cycle structures are introduced to the appropriate appliance or appliance type when the consumable or consumable holder is in useful communication with the appliances. For example, a frozen food (a consumable) or a package of frozen food (a consumable holder) might have cycle instructions for freezing, defrosting, or preserving cycles in a refrigerator or freezer appliance, and also might have cycle instructions for defrosting, cooking, or warming cycles for a cooking appliance like an oven or microwave.","A consumable information holder may comprise one or more user interface data sets, with or without cycle structures, which may be communicated to a user interface, such as might be on the appliance. User interface data is considered to include anything that may be rendered to be responsive to a user's senses, such a visual displays, audible sounds, and tactile displays. A first user interface data set may be associated with a first appliance or first appliance type and a second user interface data set may be associated with a second appliance or a second appliance type such that the appropriate user interface data are conveyed to a user interface associated with the appropriate appliance or appliance type when the consumable or consumable holder is in useful communication with the appliances. For example, a frozen food (a consumable) or a package of frozen food (a consumable holder) might convey to a refrigerator an expiration date to be rendered on a user interface on the refrigerator. The frozen food or its package might also convey to an oven serving suggestions to be rendered on a user interface on the oven.","Consumables, consumable holders, performance tags, data pods and the like (consumable information holders) may be enabled not only to provide data, but also may be configured to receive and store information associated with the consumable. Exemplary information includes data about a consumable, a cycle structure, data about a cycle structure, tracking the number of times a shirt or a dish is washed, the number of cycles and the parameters thereof, which have been executed by or in combination with an appliance and consumable holder. It may also include the types of consumables introduced into the use environment, information entered into an appliance user interface including cycle selections, usage patterns, user information, user identification, other data associated with the cycle of operation of an appliance, and any data held by a data source in communication with the holder, tag, or pod which either the data source writes to the holder, tag, or pod, or any data or the holder, tag, and pod reads from the data source. Such information may be sequentially added to a database on the consumable information holder for later retrieval. For example, a shirt with a performance tag may keep data about how many times it has been washed, about different wash cycles it has been through, and the specific machines in which it has been washed.","More specific examples of consumables  for use with or by appliances  include dispensing additives for laundry washers, dryers, or combination washer\/dryer appliances. Other additive examples are provided in the definition of consumables above.","An additive dispenser in this case would be second substance communicating device  and may be a single load dispenser that dispenses all of additive contained therein during a single cycle or a bulk dispenser that dispenses only some of the additive contained therein during a single cycle. An appliance comprising a bulk dispenser may meter and dispense the correct amount of additive for each particular load and provide information to the user regarding the remaining amount of additive in the bulk dispenser after dispensing.","Because each additive may have different parameters associated with its use, information about each consumable may be provided with each consulable . This information may be provided on the packaging of consulable  (i.e. the consumable holder), in consulable , or by any other suitable means (performance tag, data pod, user interface, etc.). For example, different additives may have different concentrations, and the amount of a given additive needed for a particular load will vary depending on the concentration of that additive. The amount of a particular additive needed to complete a cycle of operation will also depend on the amount and type of laundry being treated, as well as the condition of the laundry (e.g. soil and stain level). The amount, type, and condition of the laundry may be determined utilizing information supplied by the user, information gathered by sensors associated with the appliance, or information otherwise obtained during the operation of the first substance communicating device .","Additional information provided with the consumable may also be used to tailor the cycle of operation to that consulable . In a laundry application, the additive will have to be dispensed at the right time during the cycle, such as before, during, or after wash, rinse, spin, or drying. Particular additives may also require that they are dispensed under certain conditions, such as at a given water temperature or air temperature. Additionally, particular additives might require at least one additional step in a cycle for optimal performance. For example, the presence of a particular additive might require that the cycle structure be augmented by inserting an additional ordered collection of steps such as filling at a new temperatures to a new level after spinning, then soaking for an amount of time, then draining, then spinning for a new amount of time at a new spin speed between the original step in the cycle and the last step in the cycle.","The smart process control apparatus  or electronics  may determine parameters to be used for the cycle of operation or the structure of the appropriate cycle of operation or changes to an existing cycle of operation for different operations based on the information provided with consulable , user input, and information obtained by sensors associated with first substance communicating device .

Refrigerators, dryers, washers, and dishwashers are all known to use filters that are consumed in the sense that they must be replaced after a certain amount of time or usage due to wear and dirtying of the filter. Filters, in particular, depending on the embodiment may be construed as a consumable, a consumable holder, or both. For example, if there is a filter assembly holding a filtering material, then the filter assembly may be considered a consumable holder and the filtering material may be considered a consumable because it is disposed of after it usability is consumed; its life and the life of the consumable holder are significantly different. On the other hand, the filter assembly and the filter material may be integrally formed and introduced and removed from the use environment as a unit. In this case, the assembly and the filter material would be considered both a consumable holder and consumable because the assembly and the filter material comprise functionality and attributes of both consumable holders and consumables.","Consumables may also include food, as mentioned above, and articles of clothing. Such consumables may or may not be contained by a consumable holder. However, non-contained consumables may still have consumable holder functionality in that they may comprise information about the consumable that is retrievable by the appliance. For example, a food item may carry information about itself that is contained in edible ink printed on the surface of the food item.","Returning to the drawings, service connector system  may be an internal or external interface configured to removably couple second substance communicating device  and first substance communicating device .

For example, a mechanical, electrical or data service from first substance communicating device may trigger an actuator in second substance communicating device . A substance communicated across a service connector system may be a consumable, a resource or non-consumable substance. Substance and mechanical communication between second substance communicating device  and first substance communicating device  will normally require a physical coupling.
