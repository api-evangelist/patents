{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention pertains to the field of aiming devices, more particularly to end of barrel sighting aiming devices, and most particularly end of barrel sighting aiming devices for small caliber dearming units used to render safe unexploded ordnance (UXO) or improvised explosive devices (IEDs).","2. Description of the Related Art","The military often must dispose of UXO or IEDs such as mines and live ammunition under difficult conditions. In order to safely dispose of UXO or IEDs, the firing train of the explosive must be jammed, removed or interrupted (disrupted) in order to render it safe, thus precluding its detonation or explosive functioning. Most current methods employ a gun type system to drive a low velocity projectile into the fuze mechanism, jamming the firing train components or interrupting\/moving the firing train components out-of-line such that they can not function the explosive as designed. The firing train consists of combustible and explosive elements arranged in order of decreasing sensitivity. A fuze explosive train may consist of a primer, a detonator, a delay, a relay, a lead and a booster charge used in combination to generate suitable energy to actuate the main charge. The momentum (velocity and mass dependant) of the projectile must be of a sufficient magnitude to effectively penetrate and disrupt the fuze by move the fuzing train\/component(s) out-of-line or to decapitate the fuze from the explosive components without initiating an energetic response in the fuzing\/initiation train. As such, the projectile velocity must be minimal enough so the shock delivered by the projectile impacting the explosive fuze does not cause an explosive response in the fuze firing train components. For smaller UXO or IEDs, that are not heavily encased, an MK 38 small caliber dearmer is used by the military in the above described capacity. The MK 38 small caliber dearmer is designed to use either 9 mm or .22 caliber rounds to dearm UXO or IEDs as described above. A standoff of at least the length of the projectile being used is required in order to ensure that the projectile achieves maximum velocity prior to engaging the fuze. The target area for dearmers can be quite small due to having to hit an exact spot on fuzes ranging from one quarter inch to about one inch for small caliber dearmers.","One problem associated with the use of the system described above is due to the standoff requirement and the relative small target area described above. Due to these constraints, it is difficult for an operator to aim the device with the accuracy necessary to render safe the UXO or IEDs. The operator is also normally in a heavy suit, which makes aiming the very narrow barrel of the device even more difficult. Due to the small nature of the MK 38 small caliber dearmer, using a normal electronic sight would be extremely cumbersome. Such sights are also very costly. Also, due to safety concerns, the operator should spend as little time as possible near the unexploded UXO or IED. Thus, any method of reducing aiming time is a significant benefit.","Therefore, an inexpensive, light-weight device that could assist operators in more accurately and more quickly aiming the MK 38 small caliber dearmer is desired.","The present invention comprises an aiming device that is attached to the end of the barrel of a small caliber dearmer to assist operators in aiming the dearmer more quickly and more accurately. The aiming device of the present invention is inexpensive and light-weight, so it can easily be added to a bomb technician's standard field pack.","Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an aiming device for a small caliber dearmer.","It is a further object of this invention to provide an inexpensive aiming device.","A still further object of this invention is to provide a light-weight aiming device.","This invention accomplishes these objectives and other needs related to aiming devices for small caliber dearmers by providing an aiming device having attaching means to attach the aiming device to the barrel of a dearmer or gun system. Two extensions, approximately opposite one another, extend from the attaching means. The length of these extensions is the minimum standoff for the dearmer or gun system upon which the aiming device will be employed. At the ends of these extensions, two more extensions extend at an angle to create an almost V-shape. The aiming device is attached to the end of the barrel of the dearmer or gun system. In order to align the system, the V-shaped extensions are aligned with the periphery of the target. The V-shaped extensions are pushed toward the target until both extensions are against the target, with the \u201cV\u201d. This aligns the dearmer or gun system with the direct center of the target. The angle, the length of the two extensions extending from the attaching means, and the distance between these extensions assist in ensuring that the target remains at least at the minimum standoff requirement for the dearmer or guns system.","The invention, as embodied herein, comprises an aiming device that is attached to the end of the barrel of a dearmer or gun system in order to more quickly and more precisely align the dearmer or gun system with precise, small target. The aiming device also ensures that the dearmer or gun system remains at the minimum standoff distance required without the need to specifically measure the placement.","In general the aiming device comprises two extensions connected to an attaching means for attaching the aiming device to the barrel of a dearmer of gun system. The two extensions are approximately opposite one another and comprise a length of about the minimum standoff distance for the dearmer or gun system being used. Two further extensions extend from the ends of the initial extensions at an angle from the barrel, again, approximately opposite one another. When the aiming device is attached to the barrel of a dearmer or gun system, one aims the system by placing the two angled extensions around the periphery of the target. The target can be slid along the extensions, toward the barrel, until the target cannot move further. This aims the barrel directly at the center of the target. Due to the angle, the space between the two extensions extending from the attaching means, and the length of those extensions, the end of the barrel of the dearmer or gun system will always remain at least the minimum standoff distance from the target, without the necessity of measuring the distance.","Referring to , the invention comprises an attaching means  to attach the device to the barrel  of a dearmer or guns system. First and second extensions ,  extend from the attaching means  and are approximately opposite one another. The length of the first and second extensions ,  is about the minimum standoff distance for the dearmer or gun system being employed. The distance  between the first and second extensions ,  is designed to be smaller than the minimum diameter of the target . This ensures that the distance between the dearmer or gun system and the target  is at least the minimum standoff distance required (length of the first and second extensions , ). Even if the distance  is smaller than the minimum diameter of the target , a substance (not shown) can be placed across the ends of the first and second extensions , , such as tape, in order to ensure that the target  does not go between the first and second extensions ,  to ensure that the target  remains at least the minimum standoff distance from the dearmer or gun system. Any such substance would be selected so as not to interfere with the progress of a projectile leaving the dearmer or gun system. Third and fourth extensions ,  extend from the first and second extensions at an angle . The angle  is determined based upon the size of the target  against which the dearmer or gun system will be employed. Due to the angle , the third and fourth extensions ,  form a V-shape extending from the first and second extensions , . This V-shape is used in order to align the dearmer or gun system with the target  as is described more fully below.","The device can be made of almost any material and a material may be selected by one skilled in the art. One preferred material is plastic due to its light weight and low cost. The dimensions of the device may also be selected by one skilled in the art. The dimensions of the device depend directly upon the dearmer or gun system being employed, as well as the size of the target . The invention may be used with almost any type of dearmer or gun system having an extended barrel . However, the device was specifically designed to be used with a small caliber dearmer device in order to address specific issues related to that device as described above. As noted above, the length of the first and second extensions ,  are about the minimum standoff distance required for the dearmer or gun system being used.","The distance  between the first and second extensions ,  and the angle  depend mainly upon the size of the target  against which the system is being employed. For the device to operate at maximum efficiency, the distance  is less than the diameter of the minimum size of the target  in order to ensure that the target  does not go between the first and second extensions , . This ensures that the target  remains at least the mimimum standoff distance from the dearmer or gun system. However, the distance  must inherently be at least the diameter of the barrel . For a small caliber dearmer, the diameter of the barrel  is between 0.4\u20130.5 inches. Therefore, the distance  will normally be the same as the diameter. The first and second extensions ,  are connected to the attaching means . Any method of connecting may be selected by one skilled in the art that holds the first and second extensions substantially rigid, in place. One preferred connection method is to provide separate extensions  molded to the ends of attaching means  that can be joined to the first and second extensions through adhesive material or other connection methods. Finally, it is preferred that the first and second extensions ,  be approximately parallel to one another so the extensions ,  do not interfere with the exit of the projectile from the barrel .","The third and fourth extensions ,  are attached to first and second extensions ,  and extend at an angle  from the barrel . The attachment method can be selected by one skilled in the art. When the materials of the entire system are plastic, the preferred attachment method is to mold the first and third extensions ,  and the second and fourth extensions ,  together. The size of the angle  depends upon the length of the third and fourth extensions , , the distance  and the diameter of the target  and may be determined by one skilled in the art. For a maximum diameter target , the ends of the third and fourth extensions ,  should be a distance  equivalent to that maximum diameter from one another. This allows both the third and fourth extensions ,  to contact the target  to align the barrel  with the center of the target  as depicted in . For example, when the target  comprises a 1 inch maximum diameter, the angle  is calculated to provide a distance  of one inch. For a small caliber dearmer having an aiming device of about 3 inches in length, such an angle  would be about 10 degrees.","The attaching means may comprise numerous methods and devices that may be selected by one skilled in the art. One preferred attaching means is depicted in . The attaching means  comprising a hollow tube  fits over the end of the barrel . It is preferred that some type of stopper  is present to ensure that the end of the barrel  does not protrude through hollow tube . The stopper  is herein depicted as a molded flap to stop the barrel , however, many other embodiments, such as tabs, etc. are possible. The method to affix the hollow tube  to the barrel  may also be selected by one skilled in the art. One preferred method is depicted in . An etched cutout  depicting an X-shape would be placed on two sides of the hollow tube  approximately opposite one another. When the hollow tube  is placed over the barrel , the etched cutout  would be pushed in so the edges  of the cutout  would contact the barrel  to impede movement. Many variations of this method or other methods could be employed to hold the hollow tube  in place upon the barrel .","The invention also includes a method of using the device in order to render safe unexploded ordnance. In practice the device operates in the following manner. The invention is placed over the end of the barrel  and locked in place using the attaching means . The device is positioned so that the plane made by the V-shape of the third and fourth extensions ,  is approximately perpendicular to the target . The operator aligns the ends of the V-shape with the target  and pushes the V-shape toward the target  until the third and fourth extensions both contact the target  without in any way bending or deforming the extensions , . This aligns the barrel  with the center of the target  and ensures that the target  is at least the minimum standoff distance from the barrel . The operator finally initiates the dearmer or gun system in order to fire a projectile at the target .","What is described are specific examples of many possible variations on the same invention and are not intended in a limiting sense. The claimed invention can be practiced using other variations not specifically described above."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention, and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
