{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to memory systems, and more particularly relates to techniques for reducing read data strobe latency in a memory system.","Over the past several years, memory systems, particularly in the personal computer (PC) sector, have seen a dramatic increase in data bandwidth requirements. One industry segment that has experienced significant growth as a result of this increase in data bandwidth requirements is dynamic random access memory (DRAM), particularly double data rate (DDR) synchronous DRAM (SDRAM). DDR memory architectures use both the rising and falling edges of a clock signal to access memory, which facilitates data transmission at twice the standard clock rate. DDR SDRAM also consumes less power than conventional SDRAM, with an operational supply voltage of about 2.5 volts, instead of 3.3 volts for SDRAM.","DDR memory's ability to transfer data at double the standard SDRAM data rate often imposes significant challenges on memory system designers. The speeds at which a memory controller must reliably operate (e.g., 400 megahertz (MHz) across traces on a typical woven glass reinforced epoxy resin printed circuit board (PCB)) make PCB layout particularly challenging. Moreover, incorporating a DDR memory interface into a flexible field programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric presents the designer with the related complexity of meeting very critical and tight timing constraints in an inherently non-deterministic routing fabric. The difficulties often encountered arise predominantly from the physical realities of working with data windows that are well within the magnitude of signal propagation delays in PCB and FPGA routing (e.g., about 2.5 nanoseconds (ns) or less for a 400 MHz clock). These timing requirements are further complicated by the variation in logic speed over process, voltage and\/or temperature (PVT) conditions to which the memory system may be subjected. The memory system designer can no longer simply connect data lines and address lines and expect to have a robust, high-speed memory interface.","Depending on the layout of the memory system on a PCB and on the number of banks of memory employed, if a memory controller must fetch data from a large number of banks concurrently, the difference in board delays between the various memory banks and the controller can often exceed one clock cycle, thereby increasing latency in the memory system. One known approach which attempts to address this issue is to compute a round trip (RT) delay value for each memory bank in the system, and to store the various RT delay values in a register. A programmable delay line is then utilized in the memory system for selectively delaying a read strobe signal based on the computed RT delay value(s) corresponding to the memory bank(s) being read. This approach, however, requires an initialization procedure for determining the RT delay value of each memory bank, and additionally requires a programmable delay line which significantly increases the cost of the memory system. Moreover, this approach does not adjust for variations in certain operating characteristics of the memory system, such as, for example, supply voltage and\/or temperature, which may occur after the RT delay values have been determined.","Accordingly, there exists a need for techniques for reducing read strobe latency in a memory system that does not suffer from one or more of the problems exhibited by conventional memory systems.","The present invention meets the above-noted need by providing, in an illustrative embodiment, an activity detector circuit for reducing read strobe latency in a DDR SDRAM memory system. The activity detector circuit is operative to detect read activity across multiple phases of a core reference clock and to convert the activity into a synchronous output signal indicative of data to be read from a DDR SDRAM array external to the activity detector.","In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a read activity detector circuit for use in a random access memory array includes a plurality of synchronizer circuits operative to receive a plurality of respective reference clock signals each having a frequency that is substantially the same as a frequency of a core reference clock and having different phases relative to one another. Each of the synchronizer circuits, in response to a first control signal presented thereto, generates an output signal having a rising edge or a falling edge which is substantially aligned to a rising edge or a falling edge of the reference clock signal corresponding thereto. The activity detector circuit further includes a controller operative to receive the respective output signals from the plurality of synchronizer circuits and to generate an output signal as a function thereof which is indicative of data to be read from the random access memory array.","In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a memory system includes a random access memory array and a memory controller circuit connected to the memory array. The memory controller circuit includes at least one read activity detector circuit comprising a plurality of synchronizer circuits operative to receive a plurality of respective reference clock signals having a frequency that is substantially the same as a core reference clock and having different phases relative to one another. Each of the synchronizer circuits, in response to a first control signal presented thereto, generates an output signal having a rising edge or a falling edge which is substantially aligned to a rising edge or a falling edge of the reference clock signal corresponding thereto. The at least one read activity detector circuit further includes a controller operative to receive the respective output signals from the plurality of synchronizer circuits and to generate an output signal as a function thereof which is indicative of data to be read from the random access memory array.","These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments thereof, which is to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings.","The present invention will be described herein in the context of illustrative activity detector circuits, as may be used, for example, in a DDR SDRAM memory system. It should be understood, however, that the present invention is not limited to these or any particular circuit arrangements. Rather, the invention is more generally applicable to techniques for reducing read data strobe latency in a memory system. Although implementations of the present invention are described herein with specific reference to DDR SDRAM, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to such memory, and that other suitable memory, such as, for example, fast cycle random access memory (FCRAM), quad data rate (QDR) SDRAM, reduced latency DRAM (RLDRAM), etc., may be similarly employed, as will become apparent to those skilled in the art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","110","112","114","116","118","100","106","108","107"]},"The first and second multiplexers ,  are preferably configured for accessing odd and even data bits, respectively, in an external DDR SDRAM array (not shown). Each of the data registers ,  is preferably operative to store odd or even data bits, respectively, read from the DDR SDRAM array. For example, register  preferably receives data from odd memory locations and generates odd data signals QD[], QD[], QD[] and QD[]. Likewise, register  preferably receives data from even memory locations and generates even data signals QD[], QD[], QD[] and QD[]. Each multiplexer ,  preferably generates a corresponding output signal, namely, DRODD and DREVEN, respectively. Multiplexer selection circuitry  is operative to generate control signals, namely, MUXSEL[] and MUXSEL[], for selecting which one of the four data signals from each multiplexer ,  is to produce the corresponding output signal DRODD, DREVEN. It is to be understood that the exemplary memory interface circuit  is not limited to the number of data bits shown.","Demultiplexer selection circuitry  is preferably operative to generate output control signals, EN[], EN[], EN[] and EN[], for enabling one of individual flip-flops  in each of the data registers ,  at any given time. The output control signals EN[] through EN[] are generated as a function of input control signals, namely, CLK_S_DLY, which may be a delayed version of a read data strobe signal, SR, received by the memory interface circuit  from the external DDR SDRAM array, and RESTART_N, which is a reset signal generated by count start circuit . The flip-flops  in data registers ,  are preferably clocked by a clock signal CLK_S, which is essentially a ninety-degree phased shifted version of the read data strobe signal SR. Clock signal CLK_S may be generated by the 90-degree slave delay circuit , or alternative delay control circuitry.","Activity detector  is preferably operative to generate a control signal, ACTIVE, for enabling the multiplexer selection circuitry . Additionally, a READY signal generated by the multiplexer selection circuitry  as an output of the memory interface circuit  is a function of the ACTIVE signal. The READY signal is preferably indicative that data is available to be read from the memory interface circuit . In accordance with one aspect of the invention, in order to reduce read data strobe latency, the activity detector  is preferably operative to sample the read data strobe signal at multiple phases of a reference clock and to select which of the phases of the reference clock is most closely aligned with a change in state of the strobe signal. By sampling the read data strobe signal at multiple phases of the reference clock, rather than just a single phase as is conventionally done, the activity detector  functions, at least in part, to more accurately frame a window for reading data, thereby reducing latency in the memory system by one or more clock cycles.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","200","202","204","0","90","180","270","1","2","3","4","201","00","90"]},"The clock signals clk, clk, clk and clk preferably are of substantially the same frequency as a core reference clock signal, which may be generated externally to the activity detector circuit , and have different phases relative to one another. For example, clock signal clk may be considered a zero phase clock signal, while clock signal clk is shifted in phase by 90 degrees relative to clk, clock signal clk is shifted in phase by 180 degrees relative to clk and 90 degrees relative to clk, and clock signal clk is shifted in phase by 270 degrees relative to clk, 180 degrees relative to clk and 90 degrees relative to clk. Since in a standard DDR SDRAM system it is necessary to generate a double rate (2\u00d7) clock, one skilled in the art will find it relatively easy to generate clock signals of four different phases. It is to be appreciated that the phase difference(s) between the respective clock signals is not limited to any particular amount(s). Furthermore, the invention is not limited to any particular number of clock signals. For instance, in another embodiment of the invention, the synchronization circuitry  may be configured to receive eight clock signals, each of the clock signals being phase shifted from one another by multiples of 45 degrees.","The synchronization circuitry  preferably includes a plurality of flip-flops, such as, for example, D-type flip-flops (DFFs), , , , , , ,  and . The DFFs are preferably connected together in pairs, with each pair of DFFs being clocked by a respective one of the clock signals. Specifically, for a first pair of DFFs, a data input (D) of DFF  receives input signal SOR, an output (Q) of DFF  is connected to a data input of DFF , an output of DFF  generates the output control signal B which is supplied to the controller , and clock inputs of DFFS  and  receive clock signal clk. For a second pair of DFFs, a data input of DFF  receives input signal SOR, an output of DFF  is connected to a data input of DFF , an output of DFF  generates the output control signal B which is supplied to the controller , and clock inputs of DFFs  and  receive clock signal clk. For a third pair of DFFs, a data input of DFF  receives input signal SOR, an output of DFF  is connected to a data input of DFF , an output of DFF  generates the output control signal B which is supplied to the controller , and clock inputs of DFFs  and  receive clock signal clk. Likewise, for a fourth pair of DFFs, a data input of DFF  receives input signal SOR, an output of DFF  is connected to a data input of DFF , an output of DFF  generates the output control signal B which is supplied to the controller , and clock inputs of DFFs  and  receive clock signal clk.","Since the input signal SOR arrives asynchronously as a function of the read data strobe signal DQS generated by a particular DDR SDRAM array external to the activity detector , once a change in state of the input signal SOR is detected, the output control signal whose corresponding clock signal has a phase that is most closely synchronized to the change in state of the input control signal SOR will be latched first by the corresponding pair of DFFs, followed by the output control signal whose corresponding clock signal is next closest in phase to the change in state of SOR, and so on. By way of example only, assume that a rising edge of clock signal clk occurs just after input SOR transitions from a logic low level to a logic high level. Output control signal B, corresponding to clock signal clk, will therefore be the first of the output control signals to change state, after a latency of up to two clock cycles. Output control signal B will be the next signal to change state, followed by output control signal B, and then output control signal B.","Controller  is preferably operative to receive the plurality of control signals generated by the synchronization circuitry  and to select which one of the output control signals is the first to transition, thereby selecting the clock phase which is most closely aligned to the asynchronous input signal SOR. The controller  preferably includes a 4-input AND gate connected to a flip-flop (e.g., a DFF) for each of the corresponding control signals B through B. Specifically, a first input of a first 4-input AND gate  receives control signal B, an output of AND gate  is connected to a data input (D) of a first DFF , a clock input (CP) of the first DFF receives clock signal clk, and an output (Q) of first DFF  generates output control signal F. A first input of a second 4-input AND gate  receives control signal B, an output of AND gate  is connected to a data input of a second DFF , a clock input of second DFF  receives clock signal clk, and an output of second DFF  generates output control signal F. A first input of a third 4-input AND gate  receives control signal B, an output of AND gate  is connected to a data input of a third DFF , a clock input of third DFF  receives clock signal clk, and an output of third DFF  generates output control signal F. Likewise, a first input of a fourth 4-input AND gate  receives control signal B, an output of AND gate  is connected to a data input of a fourth DFF , a clock input of fourth DFF  receives clock signal clk, and an output of fourth DFF  generates output control signal F.","The output control signals F through F generated by controller  are preferably inverted and connected to second, third and fourth inputs of the respective AND gates , , , , in a feedback arrangement. Specifically, output signal F is connected to the second input of AND gates ,  and . Output signal F is connected to the second input of AND gate , and to the third input of AND gates  and . Output signal F is connected to the third input of AND gates  and , and to the fourth input of AND gate . Output signal F is connected to the fourth input of AND gates ,  and . In this manner, once a change in state of one of the output signals F, F, F, F is detected, the controller  is operative to latch the output signal that changed state and to lock out the remaining output signals from changing state. All of the output signals F through F are preferably logically ORed together by 4-input OR gate . The output of OR gate  is supplied to a data input of DFF , which functions to latch an ACTIVE output signal generated by controller  indicating the presence of data to be read and framing a window for reading the data.","The activity detector circuit  functions reasonably well as long as there is sufficient time between consecutive read operations, such as, for example, at least two clock cycles. This is due primarily to the arrangement of the synchronization circuitry . Since each pair of DFFs (e.g., , ) is clocked by the same clock signal, there is a minimum latency of one clock cycle, assuming the read data strobe signal is coincident with a rising edge of the corresponding clock signal (e.g., clk). By modifying the synchronization circuitry , the activity detector circuit  can be configured to beneficially reduce the amount of time required between consecutive read operations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 1","FIG. 2A"],"b":["250","100","250","200","252","254","252","000","090","180","270","00","90","1","2","3","4","252","1","2","3","4"]},"The clock signals CLK_, CLK_, CLK_ and CLK_ are preferably of substantially the same frequency as a core reference clock signal, which may be generated externally to the activity detector circuit  (e.g., by a phase-locked loop (PLL) in the memory system), and have different phases relative to one another. For example, clock signal CLK_ may be considered a zero phase clock signal, while clock signal CLK_ is shifted in phase by 90 degrees relative to CLK_, clock signal CLK_ is shifted in phase by 180 degrees relative to CLK_ and 90 degrees relative to CLK_, and clock signal CLK_ is shifted in phase by 270 degrees relative to CLK_, 180 degrees relative to CLK_ and 90 degrees relative to CLK_.

Likewise, for a fourth pair of DFFs, a data input of DFF  receives input signal SOR, an output of DFF  is connected to a data input of DFF , and an output of DFF  generates the output control signal B which is supplied to the controller .","As previously stated, the synchronization circuitry  in activity detector circuit  is preferably modified compared to synchronization circuitry  shown in , so as to reduce a latency thereof, and thereby advantageously minimize the number of clock cycles required between consecutive read operations. This can be accomplished, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, by clocking each of the DFFs in a given pair of DFFs in synchronization circuitry  with clock signals that are shifted in phase from one another, such as, for example, by 270 degrees. Using this circuit configuration, the SOR signal propagates through the pairs of DFFs within one clock cycle, rather than requiring two clock cycles as in the case of the activity detector circuit  of . Thus, for the first pair of DFFs, a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_ and a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_. For the second pair of DFFs, a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_ and a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_. For the third pair of DFFs, a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_ and a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_. For the fourth pair of DFFs, a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_ and a clock input of DFF  preferably receives clock signal CLK_. It is to be understood that the phase difference between two DFFs in a given pair of DFFs in the synchronization circuitry  is not limited to any particular value.","Controller  is preferably operative to receive the plurality of control signals B, B, B, B generated by the synchronization circuitry  and to select which one of the output control signals is the first to transition, thereby selecting the clock phase which is most closely aligned to the read data strobe signal. While controller  shown in  is suitable for use in the activity detector circuit , controller  has been modified slightly compared to controller  in order to eliminate a metastable condition which can occur when the read data strobe is precisely aligned with a rising edge of one of the reference clock signal CLK_. Specifically, when the read data strobe is substantially aligned with the reference clock signal CLK_, a metastable condition may result wherein the logic state of the first data bit cannot be determined with adequate certainty. In order to avoid this potential condition, the controller  is preferably configured to select the second closest clock phase which captures the first data bit. The slight penalty in latency which may result by employing this approach is beneficially balanced by the elimination of any metastable conditions that can occur.","Thus, in accordance with another aspect of the invention, controller  preferably comprises, for each of the signal paths corresponding to reference clock signals CLK_, CLK_, CLK_, CLK_, a combinatorial logic circuit including a 5-input AND gate, a 2-input AND gate, and a 2-input OR gate. Each of the control signals B, B, B, B generated by the synchronization circuitry  is preferably connected to a pair of combinatorial logic circuits associated with a given reference clock signal and a reference clock signal having a next adjacent phase (e.g., CLK_ and CLK_). Specifically, in a first combinatorial logic circuit, first inputs of a 5-input AND gate  and a 2-input AND gate  receive control signal B generated by synchronization circuitry . A second input of AND gate  receives control signal B. Output signals C and D generated by AND gates  and , respectively, are supplied to an OR gate  which generates an output control signal E. In a second combinatorial logic circuit, first inputs of a 5-input AND gate  and a 2-input AND gate  receive control signal B generated by synchronization circuitry . A second input of AND gate  receives control signal B. Output signals C and D generated by AND gates  and , respectively, are supplied to an OR gate  which generates an output control signal E.

Likewise, in a fourth combinatorial logic circuit, first inputs of a 5-input AND gate  and a 2-input AND gate  receive control signal B generated by synchronization circuitry . A second input of AND gate  receives control signal B. Output signals C and D generated by AND gates  and , respectively, are supplied to an OR gate  which generates an output control signal E.","Output control signals E, E, E and E are preferably supplied to corresponding latch circuits. For example, control signal E is supplied to a data input of a first DFF  which generates an output signal F. A clock input of DFF  preferably receives reference clock signal CLK_. Control signal E is supplied to a data input of a second DFF  which generates an output signal F. A clock input of DFF  preferably receives reference clock signal CLK_. Control signal E is supplied to a data input of a third DFF  which generates an output signal F. A clock input of DFF  preferably receives reference clock signal CLK_. Control signal E is supplied to a data input of a fourth DFF  which generates an output signal F. A clock input of DFF  preferably receives reference clock signal CLK_.","The output signals F, F, F, F generated by the respective latch circuits are preferably fed back to inputs of the combinatorial logic circuits. Specifically, output signal F is preferably connected to a second input of AND gate , and to third inputs of AND gates ,  and . Output signal F is preferably connected to a second input of AND gate , a third input of AND gate , and fourth inputs of AND gates  and . Output signal F is preferably connected to a second input of AND gate , fourth inputs of AND gates  and , and a fifth input of AND gate . Output signal F is preferably connected to a second input of AND gate , and fifth inputs of AND gates ,  and . Using this feedback approach, the controller  is able to select an appropriate clock signal and lock out the remaining clock signals. Output signals F, F, F, F are preferably corresponding inputs of a 4-input OR gate , which generates an output signal ACTIVE that is indicative of data to be read from external DDR SDRAM.","In order to initialize the activity detector circuit  to a known logic state, a reset signal, namely, RESTART_N, is preferably provided to the activity detector circuit. The reset signal may be generated external to the activity detector circuit , such as by the count start circuit  shown in , as previously explained. The reset signal RESTART_N is preferably an active low signal that is supplied to a clear input (CLR) of each of the DFFs in the synchronization circuitry , namely, DFFs , , , , , ,  and , and each of the DFFs in the controller , namely, DFFs , ,  and .","As previously explained, the strobe signal SOR used by the activity detector circuit (e.g.,  or ) is preferably based on a logical OR of the read data strobe signal, CLK_S, which is a function of the read data strobe DQS, and a 90 degree delayed version of the read data strobe signal, CLK_S. This approach provides certain benefits compared to using the read data strobe signal CLK_S alone, as will be explained in conjunction with the illustrative cases shown in .","By way of example only and without loss of generality,  is a logic timing diagram illustrating two exemplary cases, namely, Case  and Case , for determining when to sample a burst of data based only on an undelayed read data strobe signal, CLK_S, in accordance with one aspect of the invention. In Case , each clock cycle, t, of the read data strobe signal CLK_S, contains two logic high samples, labeled \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd,\u201d and two logic low samples, labeled \u201cb\u201d and \u201cc.\u201d In this case, the samples labeled \u201cd\u201d are the first to go high after the rising edge of the strobe CLK_S, but the samples labeled \u201ca\u201d may be the better choice, especially as the \u201cd\u201d samples move near the leading edge of CLK_S, due, for example, to PVT variations. Thus, the exact phase relationship is important in determining whether the best samples are those that begin with the first or second high sample following the start of a received burst of data. There is a lack of sufficient information in this case to unambiguously make such a determination.","In Case , each clock cycle tincludes one logic high sample, labeled \u201cd,\u201d one logic low sample, labeled \u201cb,\u201d and two samples, labeled \u201cc\u201d and \u201ca,\u201d that are substantially coincident with the rising and falling edges of the read strobe signal CLK_S such that these samples may be considered either a logic high or a logic low. In this case, the samples labeled \u201cd\u201d are the best choice, but generating a rule to unambiguously select the reference clock phase corresponding to sample \u201cd\u201d is essentially not possible since samples \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d cannot be resolved with certainty.","Suppose, for example, that the first sample \u201cc\u201d in a given burst resolves to a logic high state. The phase corresponding to sample \u201cc\u201d would therefore be the best to sample the burst. However, depending on certain characteristics of the memory system, sample \u201cc\u201d cannot be relied upon to consistently resolve to a logic high state. Alternatively, suppose that sample \u201cc\u201d resolves to a logic low state, and thus sample \u201cd\u201d would be the first sample to go high. As previously stated, it is preferred to use the second sample to go high as the proper phase selection, which would be sample \u201ca.\u201d However, sample \u201ca,\u201d being coincident with the falling edge of CLK_S, cannot be resolved to a logic high state with certainty and may, in fact, change its logic state as a function of PVT variations. If the first sample to go high during each clock cycle of CLK_S is used, then sometimes the clock phase corresponding to sample \u201cc\u201d would be selected and other times the clock phase corresponding to sample \u201cd\u201d would be selected. If a phase corresponding to sample \u201cc\u201d is selected followed by a phase corresponding to sample \u201cd,\u201d and if CLK_ corresponds to sample \u201cc,\u201d then the activity detector will skip one cycle. This means that the read latency would be variable, which is generally not desirable from the standpoint of the overall memory system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["1","2","00","90","1"]},"In Case , each cycle tof the read data strobe signal SOR includes two logic high samples, labeled \u201cd\u201d and \u201ca,\u201d and two samples that are substantially coincident with the rising and falling edges of the SOR signal such that the samples may be considered either a logic high or a logic low, labeled \u201cc\u201d and \u201cb.\u201d In this case, the samples labeled \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d are equally appropriate choices. If the first sample, labeled \u201cc,\u201d of the burst of data resolves to a logic high state, then sample \u201cd\u201d will be the second sample to go high, and the reference clock phase corresponding to sample \u201cd\u201d is preferably used thereafter for the duration of the burst. Alternatively, if sample \u201cc\u201d resolves to a logic low state, then sample \u201ca\u201d will be the second sample to go high, and therefore the reference clock phase corresponding to sample \u201ca\u201d is preferably used thereafter for the duration of the burst. The clock phases corresponding to samples \u201cb\u201d or \u201cc\u201d are preferably avoided as sampling phases, since neither of these samples can be relied upon to be high with any certainty.","By way of example only,  are exemplary logic timing diagrams illustrating operation of the activity detector depicted in , in accordance with aspects of the present invention.  depicts an exemplary nominal operation of the activity detector circuit  of  with a round trip delay of 0.125 T, where T is a period of the reference clock CLK_.
