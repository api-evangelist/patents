title: Method for producing cyclic organic compounds from crop oils
abstract: A method for producing products containing cyclic organic compounds from biomass oil includes adding a biomass oil to a vessel; heating the biomass oil to crack the biomass oil; removing undesired or unreacted materials, heavy ends, and light ends from the cracked biomass oil; and extracting components from the cracked biomass oil to produce a mixture of products containing between 5% and 90% cyclic organic compounds by weight. A method for producing a high-octane aviation fuel with low lead content includes cracking a biomass oil, separating a middle distillate mixture from cracked biomass oil, decarboxylating the middle distillate mixture to produce a mixture of products containing at least about 50% cyclic alkane and alkene compounds by weight, and blending the mixture of products with a fuel having an octane number below 95 to produce an aviation fuel having an octane number of at least 100.

The petrochemical industry represents a substantial benefit to human society and the invention and commercialization of alternative sources for petrochemicals is of great importance.","One category of organic chemicals that is often produced from petroleum includes aromatics and cycloparaffins. These chemicals have a wide range of uses including serving as monomers for many types of polymers, paints, and coatings, serving as chemical intermediates for many types of industrial and consumer chemicals, and serving as valuable chemical components of heterogeneous transportation fuels such as gasoline, diesel, aviation gasoline, and jet fuel.","Surprisingly, very little work has been done to develop commercially-relevant products rich in aromatics and\/or cycloparaffins generated from triacylglycerides (TAGs) and other fatty acids. Thus, a need exists to provide an alternative source for these chemicals so that demand can be satisfied as the available supply of source material, i.e., crude oil, is depleted.","A method for producing chemical products containing cyclic organic compounds from biomass oil includes adding a biomass oil to a reactor vessel; heating the biomass oil to a temperature ranging from about 100\u00b0 C. to about 800\u00b0 C. for a time sufficient to crack the biomass oil; removing undesired materials, unreacted biomass oil, heavy ends, and light ends from the cracked biomass oil; and extracting components from the cracked biomass oil to produce a mixture of chemical products containing between 5% and 90% cyclic organic compounds by weight. The biomass oil is heated at a pressure between about vacuum conditions and about 2000 psia.","A method for producing a high-octane aviation fuel with low lead content includes heating a biomass oil to a temperature between about 100\u00b0 C. and about 800\u00b0 C. to crack the biomass oil, separating a middle distillate mixture from the cracked biomass oil, decarboxylating the middle distillate mixture to produce a mixture of chemical products containing at least about 50% cyclic alkane and alkene compounds by weight, and blending the mixture of chemical products with a fuel having an octane number below 95 to produce an aviation fuel having an octane number of at least 100. The biomass oil is heated at a pressure between about vacuum conditions and about 2000 psia. The middle distillate mixture contains at least about 50% cyclic organic compounds by weight. The aviation fuel contains lead at a concentration less than about 0.5 grams per liter.","Aromatic and cycloparaffin compounds can be produced from crop oils via chemical reaction using a zeolite-based, heterogeneous catalyst. The catalyst H-ZSM-5 (an aluminosilicate zeolite) generally produces more aromatic compounds than other catalysts according to experiments with canola and palm oils. However, the complex mixture of H-ZSM-5-catalyzed reaction products limits the suitability of its use for the production of other chemicals. Furthermore, the mixture of chemical reaction products produced by H-ZSM-5 is not useful for applications such as aviation gasoline or JP-8 jet fuel, as the mixture of products is a blend of gaseous, solid, aqueous liquid, and organic liquid material.","The present invention unexpectedly resolves the aforementioned problems. The integration of multiple processing steps creates valuable chemical products outside the scope of general crop oil processing. One example is the purification of aromatic compounds so that they can be converted into raw materials from which polymers can be made. Another example of additional processing steps creating new products from crop oils utilizes an additional chemical reaction in which aromatic compounds are reacted further with other products to produce alkylated aromatic compounds. These alkylated aromatic compounds exhibit properties that are desirable for both aviation gasoline and jet fuel, whereas the original aromatic compounds do not. An optional subsequent reaction can be employed to convert some or all of these alkylated aromatic compounds and other aromatic compounds into cycloparaffins, which have some unique properties compared to other compounds that make them desirable in aviation gasoline and jet fuel. A heterogeneous mixture of aromatic, cycloparaffinic, and other compounds can be produced that is suitable as an aromatics-rich blendstock that can be used to replace petroleum-based aromatics in conventional processes which generate aviation turbine fuels.","\u201cCyclic organic compounds\u201d are chemical compounds containing one or more bonded ring of carbon atoms forming the backbone of the chemical compound. Cyclic organic compounds include aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, cycloalkanes, such as cyclohexane and cyclodecane, and cycloparaffins. \u201cAromatics,\u201d \u201caromatic compounds\u201d or \u201caromatic hydrocarbons\u201d are hydrocarbons containing planar sets of six carbon atoms that are connected by delocalized electrons in a manner as if they were connected by alternating single and double covalent bonds. \u201cCycloparaffins\u201d are alkanes with one or more rings of carbon atoms in the chemical structure of their molecules and generally have a total of 20 or more carbon atoms in the molecule.","Aromatic compounds include, but are not limited to: benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, methyl benzene, ethyl methyl benzene, dimethyl benzene, trimethylbenzene, propyl benzene, methyl propyl benzene, tetramethyl benzene, cetyl butenyl benzene, and methyl propyl benzene. Aromatic compounds also include polyaromatics, such as naphthalene, methyl naphthalene, ethyl naphthalene, tetrahydro methyl naphthalene, and tetra hydro ethyl naphthalene. Cycloparaffins include, but are not limited to: cyclopentane, butyl cyclopentane, cyclohexane, methyl cyclohexane, ethyl cyclohexane, trimethyl cyclohexane, ethyl methyl cyclohexane, methyl propyl cyclohexane, butyl cyclohexane, propyl cyclohexane, pentyl cyclohexane, cyclodecane, dimethyl ethyl cyclodecane, heptylcyclohexane and octylcyclohexane.","Embodiments of the present invention are directed to the production and purification of products that contain cyclic organic compounds from plant oils, biologically generated lipids, and animal fats. Specifically, the feedstocks are triacylglycerides (TAGs), long chain fatty acids, long chain lipids, or similar chemicals. Embodiments of the present invention provide means to produce these valuable and necessary chemicals from feedstocks not currently utilized to produce these chemicals. The chemical modifications, based on the use of cracking, chemical reactions, and separation techniques, are designed to produce commercial-quality chemical products that can directly replace comparable chemical products generated from other feedstock sources and to produce fuel blendstocks that are advantageous because of their high concentration of cyclic organic compounds containing aromatic compounds and cycloparaffins. \u201cCracking\u201d refers to any process that changes the chemical composition of an organic chemical or chemical mixture by cleaving one or more carbon-carbon bonds.","Research involved in TAGs and thermal and catalytic cracking (either individual TGs or vegetable oils) has occurred sporadically in the last few decades.

It has been shown that medium (ten to fourteen carbons) and long (greater than sixteen carbons) chain fatty acids are compatible with cracking processes, using either thermal or catalytic cracking. These techniques have been used to modify the chemical composition of crop oils or biodiesel. However, they have not been used to produce commercial-quality cyclic organic compounds.","The production of aromatic compounds from TAGs and fatty acids using thermal or catalytic cracking has been previously described, but the prior art fails to identify a complete series of process steps that takes the aromatic compounds and\/or cycloparaffins generated during cracking and subsequently produces commercially-viable products. Embodiments of the present invention allow a crop oil, biologically generated lipid, or animal fat oil feedstock to be converted into these important and valuable chemical products. The present invention utilizes separation and chemical reaction technologies, coupled with thermal and\/or catalytic cracking techniques in order to develop crop oil-, biologically generated lipid-, or animal fat-based chemicals that can replace commercially available chemicals generated from other feedstock sources and to develop heterogeneous cyclic organic compound-rich fuel blendstocks.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","10","12","12","12","10"]},"The products resulting from cracking reaction  are dependent upon the cracking conditions and the original composition of raw material  (feed oil, for example) and the gaseous environment present in the cracking reactor. The cracking conditions can be varied based on detailed chemical analyses in order to produce an optimal mixture of chemical components. A catalyst can be used in the cracking reactor to (1) improve the yield of desirable products, especially aromatic compounds; (2) decrease the formation of unwanted products; and\/or (3) increase the efficiency of cracking reaction  due to lower pressure, temperature, or residence time requirements. Suitable catalysts include, but are not limited to, activated alumina, silica-alumina, aluminum, zeolites, sulfated metal oxides, rare metals such as palladium, niobium, molybdenum, platinum, titanium, cobalt, gold and combinations thereof.","The cracking output (crackate) is subjected to purification and\/or processing step  depending upon the material generated. The output from the cracking reactor depends upon the specific reactor design employed. Suitable reactor types include batch, continuous flow through, flow through packed bed, and fluidized bed. Material generated in the cracking reactor can generally be classified in one of four general classes: residual materials or residue , middle distillates , light ends  and unreacted raw materials . Purification and\/or processing step  can include separating residual materials or residue , middle distillates , light ends  and unreacted raw materials ;","Residual material or residue (tars)  includes chemicals produced during cracking reaction  that have a higher molecular weight, lower volatility or lower heating value than is desirable for middle distillates . Some residue  can be separated from middle distillates  along with unreacted raw materials  and processed along with unreacted raw materials . Other residues , typically those of higher molecular weight, will be in the form of solid material after cracking reaction . These compounds are typically known as \u201ctars.\u201d \u201cTars\u201d refers to very long chain chemical compounds generated during the cracking reaction. Tars  can contain valuable chemical compounds, such as boiler fuel or other by-products that can be extracted by various processing methods including solvent extraction or distillation. Depending upon the design of the cracking reactor, tars  may not be amenable to further processing. These tars  can be oxidized, combusted or otherwise removed from the cracking reactor or cracking catalysts by methods known to those skilled in the art.","Middle distillate components  are a mixture of aromatic compounds, cycloparaffinic compounds, short chain carboxylic acid compounds, linear paraffinic compounds, olefins, and other components generated in the cracking reactor that have desirable properties and include the primary products that the process is designed to generate. \u201cMiddle distillates\u201d refers to chemicals which have properties amenable for inclusion in a gasoline, kerosene, or diesel type fuel or which have a volatility similar to those paraffins and\/or olefins which are amenable for inclusion in a gasoline, kerosene, or diesel type fuel.","\u201cLight ends\u201d refers to chemicals which stay in the gaseous phase at conditions of temperature and pressure at which middle distillates are in the liquid phase. Light ends  include unreacted vapor-phase material that was added to the reactor to manipulate cracking reaction , such as hydrogen, nitrogen, or water vapor, in addition to low molecular weight organic chemicals and hydrocarbons generated by cracking reaction . Low molecular weight organic chemicals and hydrocarbons, such as methane, methanol, ethane, ethanol, n-pentane, i-pentane, pentene, pentanol n-butane, i-butane, butanol, butane, methyl ester, ethyl ester, etc., have chemical and physical properties (e.g., volatility) that are undesirable when present in substantial concentrations in mixtures of aromatic compounds and other middle distillates . Light ends  are separated from the other material that exits the cracking reactor by gas-liquid phase separation, distillation, condensation, or other processes.","Unreacted raw materials  are chemicals that enter the cracking reactor and undergo cracking reaction , but are not converted to chemical compounds with carbon chains shorter than C16. \u201cUnreacted raw materials\u201d are those compounds in the cracking reactor product stream that have a chemical composition that is not amenable as a middle distillate component and can be exposed to cracking reactor conditions and transformed into middle distillate and\/or light ends and\/or tars. These compounds may be chemically identical to the originating oil, a fatty acid whose length is identical or similar to the fatty acid chains on the original TAG, when TAGs are in the feedstock oil, or a partially cracked paraffin, olefin, or carboxylic acid that has too many carbon atoms in the primary carbon chain to be amenable as a middle distillate blend component. These materials have some undesirable chemical and physical properties. Unreacted raw materials  are separated from middle distillates  by distillation or other separation techniques. Unreacted or uncracked raw materials  can be returned to the cracking reactor for additional cracking reactions , fed to a second cracking reactor or utilized for some other purpose.","Subsequent purification and\/or processing step  of middle distillates  depends upon the products desired for the specific application. Purification and\/or processing step  can include solvent extraction, distillation, chemical reaction and combinations thereof. Subjecting cyclic organic compounds contained in middle distillates  to additional purification and\/or processing step  yields additional middle distillates  as well as the desired aromatic compounds or cycloparaffin end products . End products  can include aromatic compounds and cycloparaffins for use as fuel blendstocks or commercial grade chemicals. Undesired materials (not shown in ) can be removed during purification and\/or processing step  in addition to additional middle distillates .
