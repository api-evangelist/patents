In some situations, helper T cells designated Th1 in the murine system, facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by cell-mediated responses. In other cases, helper T cells designated Th2 cells facilitate immune effector functions that are typically dominated by humoral responses. A vigorous Th1 response is usually desirable to help clear infections or to slow the progression of an infection. When a subject's immune response is biased to, or dominated by, a Th2-type response, the cytokines associated with the Th2 response tend to suppress the immune system's capacity to mount a vigorous Th1 response at the same time. The converse is also generally true. When mammalian immune responses begin to result in an increasing Th2 response, the Th1 response to the same condition tends to weaken. Insufficient Th1 responses may be associated with progression of some infections or other conditions, see, e.g., M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer, 14:107-111, 1993; M. Clerici and G. M. Shearer, 15:575-581, 1994. The invention provides compounds and compositions useful to enhance Th1 immune responses.","Hemopoiesis or hematopoiesis is the formation and development of the various types of blood cells and their progenitor cells. Mature cells are found in circulation or tissues such as the lymph nodes or the thymus. Many of the stem cells that give rise to mature forms reside in the bone marrow, although some may circulate in the blood for some time. Clinical blood cell deficiencies such as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia or erythropenia can arise from causes such as impaired hemopoiesis or abnormal loss or destruction of mature or immature blood cells.","Thrombocytopenia (\u201cTP\u201d), abnormally low platelet counts, can arise from impaired platelet production, sequestration of platelets in the spleen or abnormal loss of circulating platelets. Impaired production can result from causes such as chemotherapies or radiation therapies. Abnormal loss of circulating platelets is often associated with autoreactive antibodies that bind to platelets and reduce their life span. These underlying causes give rise to the various clinical forms of TP, such as autoimmune neonatal TP, immune thrombocytopenic purpra, radiation induced TP, chemotherapy induced TP and amegakaryocitic TP.","A number of treatment options are available and the selection of a treatment typically depends on the source of the disorder and its severity. Treatments include administering one or more of glucocorticoid steroids (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone), human IgG antibodies, anti-Rh(D) antibodies for Rh (D) patients, an androgen such as danazol, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine), thrombopoietin and immunosuppresants (e.g., azathioprine, cyclophosphamide). Splenectomy is also indicated, for example when first line treatments fail. The goal of treatment is typically to increase platelet counts to 20,000 mmor more typically to at least about 50,000 mmand to maintain these levels.","Although the treatment options to increase platelet levels are generally known, they usually have a number of drawbacks. For example, infusion of IgG antibodies is not always effective and the treatment is relatively expensive. Other treatments, such as prednisone are also not always effective and they typically are discontinued or tapered off after several weeks due to toxicity or unwanted side effects.

NP can arise from impaired production of neutrophil precursors or mature neutrophils, movement of neutrophils from the circulation to tissue, abnormal circulating neutrophil loss or a combination of these causes. Impaired neutrophil production can be acquired from, e.g., treatment with a cytotoxic or cytostatic drug, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or an autoimmune response. The abnormal loss of circulating neutrophils in autoimmunity is associated with autoreactive antibodies that bind to the cells and reduce their life span. These underlying causes give rise to the various clinical forms of NP, such as postinfectious NP, drug-induced NP, autoimmune NP, or chronic idiopathic NP.","The sources of NP and treatment options have been described.

Such spirolactones include 5 and 6 membered rings, e.g., a spiro compound with a spiro ring at the 17 position such as",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00006","num":"00006"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00006","he":"158.75mm","wi":"55.63mm","file":"US07947846-20110524-C00006.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein X is \u2014C(R)\u2014 or \u2014CHR\u2014 and wherein independently selected Rgroups are bonded to the 1-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 8-, 9-, 12-, and 14-positions. In some of these embodiments, the Rvariable group independently is \u2014H, \u2014OH, \u2014OCH, \u2014CHor an optionally substituted alkyl.","Unless otherwise stated or implied by context, expressions of a percentage of a liquid ingredient, e.g., an excipient, in an invention composition or formulation mean the ingredient's percent by volume (v\/v). Thus, 20% propylene glycol means 20% v\/v propylene glycol is present in an invention composition or formulation. The amount of excipient indicated in invention compositions is not affected by the form used, e.g., NF or USP grade solvent or excipient. Thus, an invention composition that comprises about 30% polyethylene glycol 300 NF can instead comprise a USP counterpart, provided that other limitations, such as the amount of water present, are not exceeded.","As used herein, \u201cinnate immunity\u201d refers to one or more components typically associated with nonspecific immune defense mechanisms in a subject. These components include the alternate complement pathway, e.g., Factor B, Factor D and properdin; NK cells, phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages), neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, fibrocytes; anti-microbial chemicals, e.g., one or more of defensins; physical barriers\u2014skin, mucosal epithelium; or certain interleukins, chemokines, cytokines, lung or alveolar macrophage respiratory burst activity or a lung surfactant protein such as surfactant protein A or surfactant protein D. Innate immunity plays a role in resistance to intracellular parasite infections, e.g., white blood cell infection, a liver infection, and other infections, e.g., lymph node infections. Detectable enhancement of innate immunity mechanism by formula 1 compounds or method described herein can also enhance phagolysosome fusion or movement, which some pathogens, e.g., intracellular bacteria such as mycobacteria, or inhibit.","Terms such as \u201cimmune disregulation\u201d, \u201cimmune disregulation condition\u201d, \u201cunwanted immune response\u201d and the like mean that a subject has or is subject to developing an immune response that is not desirable or is suboptimal for the subject's condition. Such disregulation or unwanted responses can arise from various clinical conditions or diseases or as a result of treatment of such conditions or diseases, e.g., inflammation, autoimmunity, organ or tissue transplant rejection (e.g., allograft, xenograft), infections, cancers, chemotherapy treatments, trauma, allergy conditions or in conditions where a subject mounts a Th1, Tc1, Th2 or Tc2 immune response that is considered to be pathogenic, ineffective, insufficient or suboptimal. Immune disregulation conditions are as described herein or in the cited references.","Terms such as \u201ccellular response\u201d, \u201ccellular activity\u201d, \u201cbiological response\u201d, \u201cbiological activity\u201d and the like mean a response or activity that is detectably modulated in response to the presence of a formula 1 compound. Such responses or activities can be direct effects or indirect effects on one or more cellular activities or on the expression or level of one or more molecules that the affected cell(s) bind, sequester, synthesize or respond to. Such responses or activities include a detectable change in the synthesis or level of one or more cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors (including receptors and their cofactors), enzymes, Th1- or Th2-associated antibody subtype responses or the like. Typically, the cytokines, growth factors, transcription factors, enzymes or antibodies that are modulated are involved in the amelioration of a pathological condition or in the establishment, maintenance or progression of a pathological condition.","As used herein, references to CD molecules, specific immune cell subsets, immune responses and the like, generally use nomenclature that applies to molecules, cells or the like that are found in humans. Analogs or counterparts of such molecules, cells or the like in other species may have a differing nomenclature, but are included in this invention. A description of the nomenclature and function of various CD molecules and immune cell subsets are as found in the scientific literature. References to Th0, Th1 or Th2 cells and references to Th1 or Th2 immune responses in the context of human patients refers to the human counterparts of the murine Th0, Th1 or Th2 immune cells or responses. For reviews see, e.g., A. K. Abbas et al., editors, , W.B. Saunders Company, third edition, 1997, ISBN 0-7216-4024-9, pages 4-469, and I. Kimber and M. K. Selgrade, editors, , John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 1998, ISBN 0-471-97194-4, pages 1-53.","\u201cImmunosuppressive molecule\u201d means molecules such as cyclosporin, cyclohexamide, mitomycin C, adriamycin, taxol and amphotericin B. These molecules tend to have toxicities toward the immune system and are directly or indirectly immunosuppressive, e.g., they are toxic to dividing cells, they inhibit proliferation of immune cell precursors or they can downregulate an otherwise desired or improved immune response or condition.","\u201cSteroid receptor\u201d means a gene product, typically a protein monomer or dimer that can bind to a ligand, e.g., a natural steroid, a steroid analog, or another ligand such as a formula 1 compound or a metabolic precursor thereof or a metabolite thereof, a lipid, e.g., a prostaglandin, or the like. Steroid receptors include orphan steroid receptors. Orphan steroid receptors are proteins for which the natural ligand or biological function is at least partially unknown. As used here, steroid receptors include homodimers, e.g., SXR and (CAR\u03b2), and heterodimers, e.g., PXR-CAR\u03b2 or RXR-CAR\u03b2. Steroid receptors also include isoforms, e.g., PXR.1 and PXR.2 for the PXR receptor, and homologs of the steroid receptors, e.g., the homolog of CAR\u03b2 known as MB67. Isoforms are typically generated by different splicing pathways for a nuclear RNA from one gene, while homologs are typically a distinct copy of a steroid receptor gene, where the gene copy encodes only relatively small differences compared to the reference steroid receptor gene product. Such differences are most often found in areas other than the dimerization region and the steroid binding region of the steroid receptor's structure. Typically isoforms and homologs bind the same or similar ligands as the reference gene product or steroid receptor. Steroid receptors may be of human or animal origin, e.g., obtained from cells, tissues or cDNA expression libraries derived from cells or tissues of any primate, rodent (including murine), avian, ovine, bovine, equine, canine or feline species or any of the species or any species within any group (e.g., Family or Genus) of species mentioned elsewhere herein or in any reference cited herein. Modulation of steroid receptors by formula 1 compounds can arise from (1) their direct interaction with a steroid receptor or a cofactor thereof or (2) indirect effects such as (A) detectably increased or decreased synthesis or level of the steroid receptor or (B) generation of a signal or stimulus that leads to detectable modulation of one or more biological activities of the receptor, e.g., detectable inhibition of steroid receptor mediated gene transcription or detectable enhancement of steroid receptor mediated gene transcription.","In the context of a combination of molecules that includes a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound, \u201cinvention complexes\u201d or \u201ccomplexes\u201d include a complex that comprises a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound and optionally other molecules. These other molecules include (i) a DNA recognition sequence (\u201cDNARS\u201d hereafter), i.e., a sequence that the steroid receptor specifically recognizes and binds to and (ii) a transcription factor that can bind to the steroid receptor-formula 1 compound complex. As used herein, these complexes can arise in cells in vitro or in vivo, or in cell-free systems. Complexes include, for example, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor monomer-formula 1 compound combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS) combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS) combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-transcription factor combinations, steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-transcription factor combinations, steroid receptor heterodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS)-transcription factor combinations and steroid receptor homodimer-formula 1 compound-DNA (or DNARS)-transcription factor combinations.","An \u201cagonist\u201d or an \u201cantagonist\u201d is a compound or composition that respectively, either detectably increases or decreases the activity of a receptor, an enzyme or another biological molecule, which can lead to increased or decreased transcription of a regulated gene or to another measurable effect. The increase or decrease in a receptor's or enzyme's activity will be an increase or a decrease of at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or a range about between any two of these values, for one or more measurable activities. Receptors, their accessory factors and associated transcription factors can modulate transcription of their target gene(s) by detectably enhancing transcription or decreasing it. Biological activities of receptors may also include modulating biological responses such as signal transduction within a cell or ion flux, e.g., sodium, potassium or calcium, across cell or organelle membranes.","Terms such as \u201cbiologically active metabolite\u201d and the like mean derivatives of the formula 1 compounds that retain a detectable level, e.g., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30% or at least about 50%, of at least one desired activity of the parent compound, e.g., antiinflammatory activity or stimulation of a desired immune response. Determination of a desired activity is accomplished essentially as described herein. Such metabolites can be generated in the gastrointestinal tract, in blood or in one or more subject tissues. Such metabolites are detected using standard analytical methods, e.g., GC-MS analysis of an optionally radiolabeled formula 1 compound and its metabolites, in blood, urine or other biological samples after it is administered to a subject by one or more routes as disclosed herein. Terms such as \u201cmetabolic precursor\u201d of formula 1 compounds and the like can include compounds that generate a detectable level of the formula 1 compound or a detectable level, e.g., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30% or at least about 50%, of at least one desired activity of the formula 1 compound. Determination of a desired activity is accomplished essentially as described herein. Conversion of metabolic precursors can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, in blood or in one or more subject tissues.","\u201cAmino acid\u201d means an amino acid moiety that comprises any naturally-occurring or synthetic amino acid residue, i.e., any moiety comprising at least one carboxyl and at least one amino residue directly linked by one, two three or more carbon atoms, typically one (\u03b1) carbon atom. The nature and identity of the intervening structure located between the carboxyl and amino groups can have a variety of structures including those described herein. Typically, amino acids linked to the steroid through the amine group have sufficient conformation and length to be capable of autocatalytic hydrolysis of the amino acid-steroid bond and release of the steroid. This can occur when the free carboxyl is generated in vivo by deesterification, deamidation or peptidolytic cleavage of the precursor containing a linkage between the amino acid's amine group and the steroid. Hydrolysis of the bond between an amino acid's carboxyl or amino group and the steroid can also occur by chemical or enzymatic activity, e.g., esterase cleavage or non-enzymatic hydrolysis.","In general, the amino acids corresponding to the residues employed in the formula 1 compounds are naturally occurring and have no significant pharmacological activity per se. However, optimal pharmacokinetic activity, (substantially complete hydrolysis upon hydrolysis of the distal amide or ester bond) may be achieved by using non-naturally occurring amino acid residues. The intervening structure may be as simple as methylene when the amino acid residue is glycyl, or substituted methylene for other \u03b1 amino acids. The structure ordinarily contains up to about 5 carbon or heteroatoms in the direct linkage between the amino acid's carboxyl carbon and the amine nitrogen. Thus, amino acids can comprise intervening ethylene, propylene, butylene, or pentylene groups or their substituted analogs, such as for example, oxyesters or ethers in which oxygen replaces carbon and, as appropriate, hydrogen. An example of such an intervening structure would be \u2014CH\u2014O\u2014C(R)(R)\u2014, where Rand Rare independently selected hydrogen or organic moieties as described above for esters. In some embodiments one of Rand Ris hydrogen and the other is a C2-20 organic moiety. Typically the organic moieties contain about 1-20 carbon atoms and 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 independently selected heteroatoms, which are typically selected from oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. In general, fewer intervening atoms are used when more rapid hydrolysis is desired, although larger structures are suitable if, e.g., they possess sufficient flexibility or have conformations to allow positioning of the carboxyl group in proximity to the amino acid-steroid bond.","Ordinarily, Ris \u2014H, methyl or hydroxymethyl, usually \u2014H, and Ris a side chain or group of a naturally occurring amino acid. Amino acid side chains include analogs where the side chain is a Chomolog of the corresponding natural compound, e.g., methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene or a substituted derivative thereof, e.g., an alkyl, ether or alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy) substituted derivative. In general, for carboxyl-containing side chains, if the C atom of the side chain carboxyl is linked by 5 or less atoms to the N then the carboxyl optionally will be blocked, e.g. by esterification or amidation wherein the ester or amide bonds are hydrolyzable in vivo. Ralso is taken together with Rto form a proline residue (\u2014CH\u2014). Thus, Ris generally a side group such as \u2014H, \u2014CH, \u2014CH(CH), \u2014CH\u2014CH(CH), \u2014CHCH\u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014CH, \u2014CHCH\u2014S\u2014CH, \u2014CHOH, \u2014CH(OH)\u2014CH, \u2014CH\u2014SH, \u2014CH\u2014CHOH, \u2014CH\u2014CO\u2014NH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014CO\u2014NH, \u2014CH\u2014COOH, \u2014CH\u2014CH\u2014COOH, \u2014(CH)\u2014NHand \u2014(CH)\u2014NH\u2014C(NH)\u2014NH. Ralso includes 1-guanidinoprop-3-yl, benzyl, 4-hydroxybenzyl, imidazol-4-yl, indol-3-yl, methoxyphenyl and ethoxyphenyl. The optimal Rgroup is readily selected using routine assays.","In general, the amino acid residue has the structure shown in the formulas below. Ordinarily, n is 1 or 2, Ris \u2014H and Ris a moiety containing one or more of the following groups: amino, carboxyl, amide, carboxyl ester, hydroxyl, C-Caryl, ether (\u2014O\u2014), thioether (\u2014S\u2014), n-, s- or t-alkyl (C-C), guanidinyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, sulfhydryl, sulfoxide, and phosphoryl. The Rand Rsubstituents can have a wide variety of structures including those disclosed herein, e.g., esters, ethers or carbonates.","When the amino acid residues contain one or more chiral centers, any of the D, L, meso, threo or erythro (as appropriate) racemates or mixtures thereof, fall within the scope of this invention. In general, if it is desired to rely on non-enzymatic means of hydrolysis, D isomers should be used. On the other hand, L isomers may be more versatile since they can be susceptible to both non-enzymatic as well as potential targeted enzymatic hydrolysis, and are more efficiently transported by amino acid or dipeptidyl transport systems in the gastrointestinal tract.","Examples of suitable amino acid residues include the following: Glycyl; aminopolycarboxylic acids, e.g., aspartic acid, \u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid, glutamic acid, \u03b2-hydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2-methylaspartic acid, \u03b2-methylglutamic acid, \u03b2,\u03b2-dimethylaspartic acid, \u03b3-hydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2,\u03b3-dihydroxyglutamic acid, \u03b2-phenylglutamic acid, \u03b3-methyleneglutamic acid, 3-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, 2-aminosuberic acid and 2-aminosebacic acid residues; amino acid amides such as glutaminyl and asparaginyl; polyamino- or polybasic-monocarboxylic acids such as arginine, lysine, \u03b2-aminoalanine, \u03b3-aminobutyrine, ornithine, citruline, homoarginine, homocitrulline, 5-hydroxy-2,6-diaminohexanoic acid (commonly, hydroxylysine, including allohydroxylysine) and diaminobutyric acid residues; other basic amino acid residues such as histidinyl; diaminodicarboxylic acids such as \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosuccinic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoglutaric acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoadipic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminopimelic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diamino-\u03b2-hydroxypimelic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosuberic acid, \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminoazelaic acid, and \u03b1,\u03b1\u2032-diaminosebacic acid residues; imino acids such as proline, 4- or 3-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinecarboxylic acid (commonly, hydroxyproline, including allohydroxyproline), \u03b3-methylproline, pipecolic acid, 5-hydroxypipecolic acid, \u2014N([CH]COOR), wherein n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and Ris \u2014H or a protecting group, and azetidine-2-carboxylic acid residues; a mono- or di-alkyl (typically C-Cbranched or normal) amino acid such as alanine, valine, leucine, allylglycine, butyrine, norvaline, norleucine, heptyline, \u03b1-methylserine, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b3-hydroxyvaleric acid, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b4-hydroxyvaleric acid, \u03b1-amino-\u03b1-methyl-\u03b5-hydroxycaproic acid, isovaline, \u03b1-methylglutamic acid, \u03b1-aminoisobutyric acid, \u03b1-aminodiethylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisopropylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodi-n-propylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisobutylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodi-n-butylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminoethylisopropylacetic acid, \u03b1-amino-n-propylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminodiisoamyacetic acid, \u03b1-methylaspartic acid, \u03b1-methylglutamic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; isoleucine, alloisoleucine, tert-leucine, \u03b2-methyltryptophan and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-ethyl-\u03b2-phenylpropionic acid residues; \u03b2-phenylserinyl; aliphatic \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-hydroxy acids such as serine, \u03b2-hydroxyleucine, \u03b2-hydroxynorleucine, \u03b2-hydroxynorvaline, and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-hydroxystearic acid residues; \u03b1-Amino, \u03b1-, \u03b3-, \u03b4 - or \u03b5-hydroxy acids such as homoserine, \u03b3-hydroxynorvaline, \u03b4-hydroxynorvaline and epsilon-hydroxynorleucine residues; canavinyl and canalinyl; \u03b3-hydroxyornithinyl; 2-Hexosaminic acids such as D-glucosaminic acid or D-galactosaminic acid residues; \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-thiols such as penicillamine, \u03b2-thiolnorvaline or \u03b2-thiolbutyrine residues; other sulfur containing amino acid residues including cysteine; homocystine; \u03b2-phenylmethionine; methionine; S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide; 2-thiolhistidine; cystathionine; and thiol ethers of cysteine or homocysteine; phenylalanine, tryptophan and ring-substituted a amino acids such as the phenyl- or cyclohexylamino acids \u03b1-aminophenylacetic acid, \u03b1-aminocyclohexylacetic acid and \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-cyclohexylpropionic acid; phenylalanine analogues and derivatives comprising aryl, lower alkyl, hydroxy, guanidino, oxyalkylether, nitro, sulfur or halo-substituted phenyl (e.g., tyrosine, methyltyrosine and o-chloro-, p-chloro-, 3,4-dichloro, o-, m- or p-methyl-, 2,4,6-trimethyl-, 2-ethoxy-5-nitro, 2-hydroxy-5-nitro and p-nitro-phenylalanine); furyl-, thienyl-, pyridyl-, pyrimidinyl-, purine or naphthylalanines; and tryptophan analogues and derivatives including kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine, 2-hydroxytryptophan and 4-carboxytryptophan residues; \u03b1-amino substituted amino acid residues including sarcosine (N-methylglycine), N-benzylglycine, N-methylalanine, N-benzylalanine, N-methylphenylalanine, N-benzylphenylalanine, N-methylvaline and N-benzylvaline; and \u03b1-Hydroxy and substituted \u03b1-hydroxy amino acid residues including serine, threonine, allothreonine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues.","Any one of the foregoing or other known amino acids are suitably employed in this invention. Typically, amino acids are capable of autocatalytically hydrolyzing the amino acid-steroid bond. Thus, they typically contain, or upon being hydrolyzed in vivo, contain a free carboxyl group or amine group.","Also of interest are hydrophobic amino acids such as mono- or di-alkyl or aryl amino acids, cycloalkylamino acids and the like. These residues, together with R-R(R-Rare defined below) can contribute to cell permeability by modulating the lipophilicity of a formula 1 compound. Typically, the residue does not contain a sulfhydryl or guanidino substituent.","Peptide means one, 2, 3 or more of the two or more amino acids as defined above are bonded together, usually by an amide bond. Variable groups in the formula 1 compounds such as R-Rcan comprise a peptide. Typically the amino acids are linked through normal peptide bonds, e.g., \u2014CO\u2014NH\u2014, between adjacent amino acid residues. Peptides comprise dipeptides (dimers), tripeptides (trimers), short peptides of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or 15 residues, and longer peptides or proteins having about 100 or more residues. Formula 1 compounds that comprise a peptide can be used as immunogens, prodrugs or as synthetic precursors for other steroid derivatives. In one embodiment, the peptide will contain a peptidolytic enzyme cleavage site at the peptide bond linking the first residue and the next residue distal to the steroid residue. Such cleavage sites are optionally flanked by enzymatic recognition structures, e.g. particular residues recognized by a hydrolytic enzyme, e.g., a peptidase located in the serum or in cells.","Peptidolytic enzymes are well known, and in particular include carboxypeptidases. Carboxypeptidases digest polypeptides by removing C-terminal residues, and are specific in many instances for particular C-terminal sequences. Such enzymes and their substrate requirements in general are well known. For example, a dipeptide having a given pair of residues and a free carboxyl terminus is covalently bonded through its \u03b1-amino group to the steroid nucleus. It is expected that the peptide will be cleaved by the appropriate dipeptidase, protease or by chemical hydrolysis, leaving the carboxyl of the proximal amino acid residue to autocatalytically cleave the amidate bond.","Examples of suitable dipeptidyl groups (designated by their single letter symbols) are shown in the tables

are in the L configuration, the D configuration or mixtures of configurations.","Tripeptides, i.e., 3 linked amino acid residues, are also useful embodiments. Each amino acid in a tripeptide may be in an L, D or mixed configuration. Tripeptides include those where A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W or Y is linked by a standard peptide bond to the amino or the carboxyl terminus of any of the dipeptides listed above. The sequence \u2014X1-pro-X2-(where X1 is any amino acid and X2 is hydrogen, any amino acid residue or a carboxyl ester of proline) will be cleaved by luminal carboxypeptidase to yield X1 with a free carboxyl, which in turn autocatalytically cleaves the amidate bond. X2 usually will be a benzyl ester of the carboxy group of X2. Other embodiments include tetrapeptides such as ones where any two of the dipeptides listed above, which may be the same or different dipeptides (e.g., AA and AA linked together or, e.g., AA and GI linked together), are linked to each other by a peptide bond through the amino terminus or carboxyl terminus. One, 2 or more tetrapeptides may bonded to the formula 1 or formula 2 compound through the tetrapeptide's amino or carboxyl terminus.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 or formula 2 compound comprises one or more amino acids or peptides having the structure (A), (B) or (C):\n\n","If the amino acid(s) or residue(s) has 2 or more amine groups, e.g., a lysinyl or arginyl, or ornithinyl residue, then Ris usually \u2014H and Rmay comprise \u2014[C(R)]N(R)\u2014 where n2 is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, Ris \u2014H or a protecting group and each Rindependently is \u2014H, C-Coptionally substituted alkyl, C-Coptionally substituted aryl, C-Coptionally substituted alkylaryl, C-Coptionally substituted arylalkyl, C-Coptionally substituted alkoxy, C-Coptionally substituted aryloxy or hydroxyl. Such compounds will contain a plurality of steroid moieties. For example when both the epsilon (\u03b5) or delta (\u03b4) and alpha (\u03b1) amino groups of lysine or ornithine are substituted with steroid moieties the amidate is believed to be capable of releasing two molecules of active drug, each expected to emerge under different pharmacokinetics and therefore further sustaining the drug release.","Salts of formula 1 compounds. Invention embodiments include salts and complexes of formula 1 compounds, including pharmaceutically acceptable or salts that are relatively non-toxic. Some of the formula 1 compounds have one or more moieties that carry at least a partial positive or negative charge in aqueous solutions, typically at a pH of about 4-10, that can participate in forming a salt, a complex, a composition with partial salt and partial complex properties or other noncovalent interactions, all of which we refer to as a \u201csalt(s)\u201d. Salts are usually biologically compatible or pharmaceutically acceptable or non-toxic, particularly for mammalian cells. Salts that are biologically toxic are optionally used with synthetic intermediates of formula 1 compounds. When a water-soluble composition is desired, monovalent salts are usually used.","Metal salts typically are prepared by reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts that are optionally prepared in this way are salts containing Li, Na, and K. A less soluble metal salt can be precipitated from the solution of a more soluble salt by adding a suitable metal compound. Invention salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic acids, such as organic carboxylic acids, and inorganic acids, such as alkylsulfonic acids or hydrogen halide acids, to acidic or basic centers on formula 1 compounds, such as basic centers on the invention pyrimidine base analogs. Metal salts include ones containing Na, Li, K, Ca or Mg. Other metal salts may contain aluminum, barium, strontium, cadmium, bismuth, arsenic or zinc ion.","Salt(s) of formula 1 compounds may comprise a combination of appropriate cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary ammonium ions with the acid anion moiety of the phosphoric acid or phosphonic acid group, which may be present in invention polymers or monomers.","Salts are produced by standard methods, including dissolving free base in an aqueous, aqueous-alcohol or aqueous-organic solution containing the selected acid, optionally followed by evaporating the solution. The free base is reacted in an organic solution containing the acid, in which case the salt usually separates directly or one can concentrate the solution.","Suitable amine salts include amines having sufficient basicity to form a stable salt, usually amines of low toxicity including trialkyl amines (tripropylamine, triethylamine, trimethylamine), procaine, dibenzylamine, N-benzyl-betaphenethylamine, ephenamine, N,N\u2032-dibenzylethylenediamine, N-ethylpiperidine, benzylamine and dicyclohexylamine.","Salts include organic sulfonic acid or organic carboxylic acid salts, made for example by addition of the acids to basic centers, typically amines. Exemplary sulfonic acids include Caryl sulfonic acids, Cheteroaryl sulfonic acids and Calkyl sulfonic acids such as phenyl sulfonic acid, a-naphthalene sulfonic acid, \u03b2-naphthalene sulfonic acid, (S)-camphorsulfonic acid, methyl (CHSOH), ethyl (CHSOH), n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl and hexyl sulfonic acids. Exemplary organic carboxylic acids include Calkyl, Caryl carboxylic acids and Cheteroaryl carboxylic acids such as acetic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, glutaric, tartaric, citric, fumaric, succinic, malic, maleic, oxalic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicylic, nicotinic and 2-phenoxybenzoic.","Invention salts include those made from inorganic acids, e.g., HF, HCl, HBr, HI, HSO, HPO, NaCO, KCO, CaCO, MgCOand NaClO. Suitable anions, which are optionally present with a cation such a Ca, Mg, Li, Na or K, include arsenate, arsenite formate, sorbate, chlorate, perchlorate, periodate, dichromate, glycodeoxycholate, cholate, deoxycholate, desoxycholate, taurocholate, taurodeoxycholate, taurolithocholate, tetraborate, nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, sulfamate, hyposulfite, bisulfite, metabisulfite, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, silicate, metasilicate, CN, gluconate, gulcuronate, hippurate, picrate, hydrosulfite, hexafluorophosphate, hypochlorite, hypochlorate, borate, metaborate, tungstate and urate.","Salts also include the formula 1 compound salts with one or more amino acids. Many amino acids are suitable, especially the naturally-occurring amino acids found as protein components, although the amino acid typically is one bearing a side chain with a basic or acidic group, e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine or glutamic acid, or a neutral group such as glycine, serine, threonine, alanine, isoleucine, or leucine.","The invention compositions include formula 1 compounds, their hydrates and the compounds in their un-ionized, as well as zwitterionic form.","Stereoisomers. The formula 1 compounds include enriched or resolved optical isomers at any or all asymmetric atoms as are apparent from the depictions. Both racemic and diasteromeric mixtures, as well as the individual optical isomers can be isolated or synthesized so as to be substantially free of their enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners, and these are all within the scope of the invention. Chiral centers may be found in formula 1 compounds at, for example, one or more of R, R, R, R, or R.","One or more of the following methods are used to prepare the enantiomerically enriched or pure isomers herein. The methods are listed in approximately their order of preference, i.e., one ordinarily should employ stereospecific synthesis from chiral precursors before chromatographic resolution before spontaneous crystallization.","Stereospecific synthesis is described in the examples. Methods of this type conveniently are used when the appropriate chiral starting material is available and reaction steps are chosen do not result in undesired racemization at chiral sites. One advantage of stereospecific synthesis is that it does not produce undesired enantiomers that must be removed from the final product, thereby lowering overall synthetic yield. In general, those skilled in the art would understand what starting materials and reaction conditions should be used to obtain the desired enantiomerically enriched or pure isomers by stereospecific synthesis.","If a suitable stereospecific synthesis cannot be empirically designed or determined with routine experimentation then those skilled in the art would turn to other methods. One method of general utility is chromatographic resolution of enantiomers on chiral chromatography resins. These resins are packed in columns, commonly called Pirkle columns, and are commercially available. The columns contain a chiral stationary phase. The racemate is placed in solution and loaded onto the column, and thereafter separated by HPLC. See for example, Proceedings Chromatographic Society\u2014International Symposium on Chiral Separations, Sep. 3-4, 1987. Examples of chiral columns that could be used to screen for the optimal separation technique would include Diacel Chriacel OD, Regis Pirkle Covalent D-phenylglycine, Regis Pirkle Type 1A, Astec Cyclobond II, Astec Cyclobond III, Serva Chiral D-DL=Daltosil 100, Bakerbond DNBLeu, Sumipax OA-1000, Merck Cellulose Triacetate column, Astec Cyclobond I-Beta, or Regis Pirkle Covalent D-Naphthylalanine. Not all of these columns are likely to be effective with every racemic mixture. However, those skilled in the art understand that a certain amount of routine screening may be required to identify the most effective stationary phase. When using such columns it is desirable to employ embodiments of the compounds of this invention in which the charges are not neutralized, e.g., where acidic functionalities such as carboxyl are not esterified or amidated.","Another method entails converting the enantiomers in the mixture to diasteriomers with chiral auxiliaries and then separating the conjugates by ordinary column chromatography. This is a very suitable method, particularly when the embodiment contains free carboxyl, amino or hydroxyl that will form a salt or covalent bond to a chiral auxiliary. Chirally pure amino acids, organic acids or organosulfonic acids are all worthwhile exploring as chiral auxiliaries, all of which are well known in the art. Salts with such auxiliaries can be formed, or they can be covalently (but reversibly) bonded to the functional group. For example, pure D or L amino acids can be used to amidate the carboxyl group of invention embodiments that comprise a carboxyl group and then separated by chromatography.","Enzymatic resolution is another method of potential value. In such methods one prepares covalent derivatives of the enantiomers in the racemic mixture, generally lower alkyl esters (for example of carboxyl), and then exposes the derivative to enzymatic cleavage, generally hydrolysis. For this method to be successful an enzyme must be chosen that is capable of stereospecific cleavage, so it is frequently necessary to routinely screen several enzymes. If esters are to be cleaved, then one selects a group of esterases, phosphatases, and lipases and determines their activity on the derivative. Typical esterases are from liver, pancreas or other animal organs, and include porcine liver esterase.","If the enantiomeric mixture separates from solution or a melt as a conglomerate, i.e., a mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals, then the crystals can be mechanically separated, thereby producing the enantiomerically enriched preparation. This method, however, is not practical for large-scale preparations and is of limited value for true racemic compounds.","Asymmetric synthesis is another technique for achieving enantiomeric enrichment. For example, a chiral protecting group is reacted with the group to be protected and the reaction mixture allowed to equilibrate. If the reaction is enantiomerically specific then the product will be enriched in that enantiomer.","Further guidance in the separation of enantiomeric mixtures can be found, by way of example and not limitation, in \u201cEnantiomers, Racemates, and resolutions\u201d, Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, and Samuel H. Wilen (Krieger Publishing Company, Malabar, Fla., 1991, ISBN 0-89464-618-4): Part 2, Resolution of Enantiomer Mixture, pages 217-435; more particularly, section 4, Resolution by Direct Crystallization, pages 217-251, section 5, Formation and Separation of Diastereomers, pages 251-369, section 6, Crystallization-Induced Asymmetric Transformations, pages 369-378, and section 7, Experimental Aspects and Art of Resolutions, pages 378-435; still more particularly, section 5.1.4, Resolution of Alcohols, Transformation of Alcohols into Salt-Forming Derivatives, pages 263-266, section 5.2.3, Covalent Derivatives of Alcohols, Thiols, and Phenols, pages 332-335, section 5.1.1, Resolution of Acids, pages 257-259, section 5.1.2, Resolution of Bases, pages 259-260, section 5.1.3, Resolution of Amino Acids, page 261-263, section 5.2.1, Covalent Derivatives of Acids, page 329, section 5.2.2, Covalent derivatives of Amines, pages 330-331, section 5.2.4, Covalent Derivatives of Aldehydes, Ketones, and Sulfoxides, pages 335-339, and section 5.2.7, Chromatographic Behavior of Covalent Diastereomers, pages 348-354.","General methods. Methods have been described, for example Karl Fischer (KF) and loss on drying (LOD), to determine the content of water or solvents in various compositions. LOD measures all volatiles in a sample, while KF is typically used to measure all water. When water is the only volatile present, LOD values are equal to or less than KF values for a given composition. KF measures water in hydrates of a compound and LOD determines both water and the amount of other volatiles that may be present. Invention compositions and formulations are conveniently assayed for water content by KF titration (e.g., using a Metrohm 684 KF Coulometer or equivalent) according to a published procedure (, vol. 23, 1995, chapter <921>, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md.) and manufacturer's Coulometer instructions. The amount of material used in the assay, about 50-100 mg, is measured using a five-place analytical balance (Sartorius, Model RC210D, or a suitable equivalent). The amounts of water specified in invention compositions and formulations are the amount obtained by KF analysis.","Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods have been used to characterize various crystalline compounds (see, e.g., , volume 23, 1995, <941>, p. 1843-1845, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md.; Stout et al., -, MacMillan Co., New York, N.Y., 1986). The diffraction pattern, or portions thereof, obtained from a crystalline compound is usually diagnostic for a given crystal form, although weak or very weak diffraction peaks may not always appear in replicate diffraction patterns obtained from successive batches of crystals. Also, the relative intensities of XRD bands, particularly at low angle X-ray incidence values (low Theta), may vary due to preferred orientation effects arising from differences in, e.g., crystal habit, particle size or other measurement conditions. Peaks on XRD spectra are typically defined at a given Theta value +\/\u2212about 0.1 to 0.2. XRD information from the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more main intensity XRD peaks, optionally combined with one or more other diagnostic data (melting point, DSC, IR), is usually suitable to characterize or describe a crystalline material such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone hemihydrate (\u201cBrEA hemihydrate\u201d) from other crystal forms that contain the same compound.","Other techniques that are used to identify or describe a crystalline material such as BrEA hemihydrate include melting point (MP), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared absorption spectroscopy (IR) data. DSC measures thermal transition temperatures at which a crystal absorbs or releases heat when its crystal structure changes or it melts. MP data and DSC thermal transition temperatures are typically reproducible within about 1 or 2\u00b0 C. on successive analyses. IR measures absorption of infrared light that is associated with the presence of particular chemical bonds that are associated with groups, e.g., hydroxyl, that vibrate in response to particular light wavelengths.","BrEA hemihydrate.

Related embodiments include BrEA hemihydrate and one or more excipients, e.g., suitable for human pharmaceutical use or for veterinary use. Another related embodiment is a method to make BrEA hemihydrate comprising precipitating or crystallizing BrEA from a solution comprising ethanol and water.","BrEA hemihydrate is typically substantially free of other forms of BrEA, such as amorphous BrEA or anhydrous BrEA. As used herein, BrEA hemihydrate or crystalline BrEA hemihydrate refers to solid BrEA and water having an ordered arrangement of substantially all of the constituent molecules in a defined three-dimensional spatial pattern or lattice. Crystalline BrEA hemihydrate may comprise one or more crystal habits, e.g., tablets, rods, plates or needles. BrEA hemihydrate that is substantially free of other forms of BrEA means a dry or substantially dry (where a liquid(s) comprises less than about 10% w\/w of the total weight) solid preparation where more than about 55% w\/w of the BrEA in the preparation is present as BrEA hemihydrate. Such compositions typically comprise at least about 60% w\/w, or at least about 70% w\/w, or at least about 80% w\/w, usually at least about 90% w\/w or at least about 95% w\/w, or at least about 98% w\/w of BrEA hemihydrate, with the remaining BrEA being present as other forms of BrEA such as the amorphous or anhydrous BrEA. Solid BrEA hemihydrate will typically comprise at least about 90% w\/w, usually at least about 97% or about 98% w\/w of the compound and less than about 10% w\/w, usually less than about 3% or 2% w\/w of by-products, which may include the 16\u03b2 isomer of BrEA or one or more by-products of BrEA synthesis. Often the amount of solid BrEA that is present in a solid or a liquid medium will not contain detectable amounts of other forms of BrEA (using standard analytical methods such as, e.g., FTIR, DSC or XRD) and the hemihydrate will may thus comprise about 99-100% w\/w of the total amount of BrEA that is present.","Other invention embodiments include compositions that comprise a substantial amount of BrEA hemihydrate that is present in compositions that comprise one or more other forms of BrEA, e.g., amorphous BrEA or anhydrous BrEA, and optionally one or more additional components, such as any excipient described herein. As used herein, the \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of BrEA hemihydrate in these compositions comprises at least about 15-20% w\/w or at least about 20% w\/w of BrEA hemihydrate of the total amount of BrEA that is present, typically at least about 25% w\/w, more typically at least about 30% w\/w, often at least about 35% w\/w and usually at least about 45% w\/w. These compositions are generally solids, e.g., formulations or unit dosages, but they also include suspensions, precipitates, gels and colloids that contain solid BrEA. Such suspensions or precipitates may arise from, e.g., precipitation of BrEA hemihydrate from a solution that contains water or from addition of solid BrEA to a liquid excipient(s). Obviously, compositions that comprise a substantial amount of BrEA may be substantially free of other forms of solid BrEA as discussed above.","BrEA hemihydrate may conveniently be identified by reference to BrEA hemihydrate characterized by one or more of (1) its melting or decomposition point or range (optionally expressed as +\/\u22122\u00b0 C.), (2) one or more BrEA hemihydrate DSC transition temperatures or ranges (any of which may be optionally expressed as +\/\u22122\u00b0 C.), (3) one or more characteristic BrEA hemihydrate IR absorption bands, (4) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the highest intensity XRD peaks (any one or more of which are optionally expressed as +\/\u22120.1\u00b0 Theta or +\/\u22120.2\u00b0 Theta) obtained from an XRD spectrum of BrEA hemihydrate using Cu\u2014K\u03b1 radiation (e.g., obtained essentially according to the method described at , volume 23, 1995, <941>, p. 1843-1845), (5) the presence of less than about 3% or less than about 2% w\/w of other compounds, (6) a water content of dry BrEA hemihydrate of about 2.5% w\/w (e.g., 2.3-2.7% w\/w), where dry BrEA hemihydrate means compound dried by filtration, optionally washed once with an anhydrous solvent such as hexane, filtered again and dried in vacuo at about 60\u00b0 C. until no further weight loss occurs over 24 hours at about 60\u00b0 C. (e.g., where water content is determined essentially by the Karl Fisher or other method described at , vol. 23, 1995, p 1801-1802 or 1840-1843 methods <731> or <921>), (7) cell constants and the orientation matrix obtained from single crystal X-ray crystallography of BrEA hemihydrate (obtained, e.g., essentially as described in WO 99\/04774 at example 13), (8) a description of crystal shapes as observed at about 100\u00d7 magnification to about 150\u00d7 magnification by polarized light microscopy or (9) average BrEA hemihydrate crystal size and shape descriptions.","Thus, for example, BrEA hemihydrate may be characterized by or one or more of its IR absorption bands, e.g., the carbonyl peaks at 1741 cmand 1752 cm, and either its melting or decomposition point or range and\/or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of the XRD peaks (usually the highest intensity peaks) at Theta (X-ray diffraction angle) values of 17.8, 23.8, 24.2, 26.9-27.2, 28.6, 30.1 and 32.2.","BrEA hemihydrate is suitable to prepare compositions comprising an excipient(s) suitable for human pharmaceutical use or for veterinary use. Such compositions are used to prepare formulations and unit dosages. Unit dosages typically comprise tablets, capsules, lozenges or sterile solutions, including sterile solutions for parenteral administration. Solid unit dosage forms typically comprise about 1-1000 mg of BrEA hemihydrate, typically about 20-400 mg, e.g., about 10 mg, about 25 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 150 mg or about 250 mg per unit dose.","The invention provides a method to make BrEA hemihydrate comprising contacting water, 16\u03b1-bromo-3\u03b2-hydroxy-5\u03b1-androstan-17-one and a C1-C6 alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol) and water. Typically the only one C1-C6 alcohol is present, e.g., ethanol, which is anhydrous or which may comprise up to about 2% w\/w water. In some embodiments, the method utilizes a solution that comprises about 5-25% w\/w water, about 30-45% w\/w ethanol and about 30-45% w\/w of a BrEA preparation. Typical BrEA preparations are solid preparations that comprise at least about 80% w\/w, usually at least about 90% w\/w or at least about 95% w\/w of BrEA. The solutions may comprise about 18-22% w\/w water, about 37-43% w\/w ethanol and about 37-43% w\/w of a BrEA preparation. In conducting the precipitation or crystallization method, the solution will typically be at a temperature of about \u221220\u00b0 C. to about 45\u00b0 C., usually at about 0\u00b0 C. to about 20\u00b0 C. The solution is maintained at this temperature range for about 30 minutes to about 12 hours and the solution is optionally agitated using slow to moderate agitation during crystallization.","A related embodiment comprises a method to prepare BrEA hemihydrate comprising precipitating BrEA from a solution comprising at least about 15-25% w\/w water, about 35-45% w\/w of a BrEA preparation and at least about 35-45% w\/w of one or more water-miscible solvents, typically Calcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol). The BrEA preparation may optionally comprise one or more by-products of BrEA synthesis. Typical BrEA hemihydrate preparations or batches comprise less than about 5% w\/w, usually less than about 3% or about 2% w\/w of other compounds, such as by-products of BrEA synthesis. Aspects of this method include contacting water with an organic solution that comprises BrEA and an organic solvent such as a C1-C6 alcohol (e.g., ethanol) or acetone. Addition of water to such solutions leads to precipitation of BrEA hemihydrate. Solutions that contain BrEA hemihydrate crystals or precipitate are invention embodiments that are used to prepare solid BrEA that is later dried and stored, typically at ambient temperatures and typically under conditions that limits or blocks light that reaches the compound.","Precipitation or crystallization of BrEA hemihydrate from water-containing solutions is accomplished by known methods, e.g., reducing the solution's temperature, using saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions, vacuum concentration of saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions (which is typically conducted at a relatively low temperature, usually about 15-25\u00b0 C.), seeding with saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solutions with BrEA hemihydrate crystals (e.g., about 10-100 mg per 1-10 L of solution), by heating a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA solution (about 25-35\u00b0 C. for a few minutes followed by allowing the temperature to fall or by actively cooling the solution) and optionally seeding the solution with BrEA hemihydrate crystals or by addition of a liquid, e.g., additional water or ethanol, to a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA ethanol-water solution, which causes the solution to become supersaturated. BrEA may also be precipitated from other solvents or solvent systems, including acetone and acetone-ethanol. Such solvents are typically water miscible. Two-stage precipitation of BrEA may also be used to recover solid BrEA hemihydrate, e.g., initial precipitation and recovery of the solid, followed by either cooling and seeding of the mother liquor or by allowing the mother liquor to stand, e.g., for about one, two or more days at ambient temperature, to obtain a second crop of crystals. Also, BrEA hemihydrate crystals may optionally be recrystallized, essentially as described herein, to further increase the purity of the final solid. Methods for crystallizing organic compounds have been described, e.g., A. S. Myerson, 1993, Butterworth-Heinemann, Stoneham, Mass., p 1-101.","Other related embodiments comprise a product produced by the process of contacting a solution comprising BrEA and an organic solvent with water. Typically the solutions are as described above, e.g., a solution comprising about 3-5% v\/v water and at least about 40% v\/v of one or more water-miscible solvents, typically polar solvents such as Calcohols or ketones (e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, typically ethanol or acetone). Such processes are accomplished by any one or more of the techniques described in the paragraph above, e.g., cooling of a saturated or nearly saturated BrEA water-ethanol solution and optionally seeding the cooled solution with BrEA hemihydrate. An embodiment related to this comprises solutions or solids that comprise wet BrEA hemihydrate crystals or wet filtered or centrifuged BrEA hemihydrate cakes, which may be obtained after crystallization. Examples of these embodiments include adding water to a BrEA-alcohol solution, e.g., slow addition of about 0.5-1.5 volumes or about 0.8-1.2 volumes of water to about 6 volumes of a BrEA-ethanol solution to obtain BrEA hemihydrate. Other examples of these embodiments include adding water to a BrEA-ketone solvent solution, e.g., slow addition of about 0.5-1.5 volumes or about 0.8-1.2 volumes of water to about 10 volumes of a BrEA-acetone solution to obtain BrEA hemihydrate.","Another related embodiment is BrEA hemihydrate that is milled to an average particle size of about 0.01-200 \u03bcM, or about 0.1-10 \u03bcM or about 0.5-5 \u03bcM. Average particle size or diameter for milled BrEA hemihydrate may thus be relatively small, e.g., about 0.03-2.0 \u03bcM or about 0.1-1.0 \u03bcM, or somewhat larger, e.g., about 0.5-5.0 \u03bcM or about 1-5.0 \u03bcM. Milled BrEA hemihydrate is suitable for preparing solid formulations and parenteral formulations for human or veterinary use. The milled material facilitates dissolution of BrEA hemihydrate in solvents or excipients and facilitates mixing with solids or solid excipients.","While it is possible to administer BrEA hemihydrate as a pure compound to a subject, it is usually presented as a solid formulation or used to prepare a liquid formulation. Formulations will typically be used to prepare unit dosages, e.g., tablets, capsules or lozenges for oral, buccal or sublingual administration, that comprise about 10-1000 mg or typically about 25-400 mg of BrEA hemihydrate. Alternatively, embodiments include a product for parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, subdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal) administration made by the process of contacting BrEA hemihydrate and a liquid excipient, e.g., any one, two, three or more of PEG 100, PEG 200, PEG 300, PEG 400, propylene glycol, benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol or ethanol, and optionally sterilizing the solution and optionally dispensing the solution into vials or ampules (typically amber glass), which may be single-use or multi-use and optionally storing the formulation at reduced temperature (about 0-12\u00b0 C., or about 2-10\u00b0 C.). Such products for parenteral administration typically comprise BrEA at a concentration of about 10-170 mg\/mL, usually at about 20-110 mg\/mL or about 30-100 mg\/mL, and optionally one or more of a salt, buffer or bacteriostat or preservative (e.g., NaCl, BHA, BHT or EDTA).","Other embodiments include a product produced by the process of contacting BrEA hemihydrate, which may be substantially free of other forms of BrEA, with an excipient suitable for human pharmaceutical use or for veterinary use. The product is useful to make formulations or unit dosage forms that contain the hemihydrate. Exemplary excipients include one or more of those disclosed herein, e.g., sucrose, mannitol, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, magnesium stearate and the like.","Specific embodiments of formula 1 compounds.

In some embodiments, the non-aqueous formulations described herein that comprise a formula 1 compound(s) are administered i.m. or s.c., while aqueous formulations that contain formula 1 compound(s) is administered by i.v., i.m., s.c. or other parenteral routes.","Intermittent dosing embodiments include administration of a formula 1 compound, e.g., orally, topically or parenterally as follows: (1) daily dosing for about 3 to about 190 days (e.g., about 3 to about 20 days), (2) no dosing of the formula 1 compound for about 4 to about 190 consecutive days (e.g., about 4 to about 20 days), (3) daily dosing for about 3 to about 190 days (e.g., about 3 to about 20 days), and (4) optionally repeating the dosing protocol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 30 or more times. Often, the dosing of steps (1) and (3) will be maintained for about 3-15 consecutive days, usually about 3, 4, 5 or 6 consecutive days. In general, steps (1)-(3) of the dosing protocol recited above, will be repeated at least one time, typically at least 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times. For infections that tend to remain chronic, e.g., HIV, HCV or other chronic virus or parasite infection, the intermittent dosing protocol is typically maintained over a relatively long time period, e.g., for at least about 6 months to about 5 or more years.","In some embodiments, the number of days of continuous dosing in steps (1) and (3) is the same in each round of treatment, i.e., each time period in step (1) and (3) is the same in the initial and subsequent rounds of the method. In other embodiments they differ. Thus, in some embodiments, step (1) may comprise daily dosing of about 20 mg\/day to about 1500 mg\/day (e.g., about 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350 or 400 mg\/day) of a formula 1 compound for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days.","Then, step (2) may comprise not administering any formula 1 compound for at least about 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 84, 98, 112 or more consecutive days. Step (3) could comprise daily administration of about 20 mg\/day to about 1500 mg\/day (e.g., about 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350 or 400 mg\/day) of a formula 1 compound for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days. Steps (1) through (3) is optionally repeated for about 1-30 or more times. On days when the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject, it may be delivered in a single dose or in two, three or more subdoses at, e.g., about 12 hour or about 8 hour time intervals. Administration of the formula 1 compound would be by one or more of the routes described herein.","Exemplary embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20 or more days, followed by (b) no dosing for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 20 or more days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. A subset of these embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 20 or more days, followed by (b) no dosing for at least about 7-190 consecutive days, e.g., about 10-40 days, and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once every other day for about 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, or more days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. In any of these embodiments, one can administer the formula 1 compound(s) in 2 or 3 subdoses per day.","Other embodiments comprise (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every day (or in 2 or 3 daily subdoses) for 3-15 or about 8-12 days, followed by (b) no dosing for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once per day for about 3-15 or about 8-12 consecutive days essentially as described in step (a) and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. A subset of these embodiments are (a) administering a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester or carbonate of BrEA, once every day for about 10 days, followed by (b) no dosing for about 10-40 days and then (c) administering the formula 1 compound(s) at least once more on one day, e.g., administering the formula 1 compound(s) once per day for about 10 days and (d) optionally repeating (a), (b) and (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times or more. In any of these embodiments, one can administer the formula 1 compound(s) in 2 or 3 subdoses per day.","One aspect of invention intermittent dosing is monitoring the subject's response to a particular dosing regimen or schedule, e.g., to any intermittent administration method disclosed herein. For example, while dosing a subject who has a viral infection (e.g., HCV, HIV, SIV, SHIV), one can measure the subject's or pathogen's response, e.g., amelioration of one or more symptoms or a change in infectious particles or viral DNA or RNA in the serum or a change in an immune parameter of interest. Once a response is observed dosing can be continued for one, two or three additional days, followed by discontinuing the dosing for at least one day (at least 24 hours), usually for at least about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days. Once the subject's response shows signs of remission (e.g., a symptom begins to intensify, viral serum DNA or RNA begins to increase or an immune parameter, e.g., as described herein, begins to deteriorate), dosing can be resumed for another course. An aspect of the subject's response to formula 1 compound(s) is that the subject may show a measurable response within a short time, usually about 5-10 days, which allows straightforward tracking of the subject's response, e.g., by monitoring viral titer in peripheral white blood cells (\u201cPBMC\u201d), by measuring viral nucleic acid levels in the blood or by measuring a white blood cell population(s) or expression of a cytokine or interleukin by e.g., white blood cells or a subset(s) thereof. One may monitor one or more immune cell subsets, e.g., NK, LAK, dendritic cells or cells that mediate ADCC immune responses, during and after intermittent dosing to monitor the subject's response and to determine when further administration of the formula 1 compound is indicated. These cell subsets are monitored as described herein, e.g., by flow cytometry.","For any of the treatments or methods described herein, prolonged beneficial effects or a sustained immune response by a subject may result from a single administration or a few daily administrations of the formula 1 compound for from intermittent treatment with the formula 1 compound. A single administration means that a formula 1 compound is administered to the subject in one, two, three or more doses within a 24 hour period and no further administration of any formula 1 compound to the subject occurs for at least about 7-90 days, e.g., about for at least about 30 days to about 2 months, or for about 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more months. Prolonged beneficial effects or immune responses may also persist after a short course of treatment has been completed (e.g., daily dosing for 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 days) and the subject is no longer receiving any formula 1 compound, or, in some cases, any other therapeutic treatment to treat the primary cause of the subject's pathological condition. Such beneficial effects can persist for more than about 5-30 days, e.g., for at least about 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more days.","Other intermittent dosing embodiments comprise administering to a subject having or susceptible to a condition as described herein an effective amount of a formula 1 compound using an initial induction or high dosing regimen. The high dosing regimen may comprise, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more daily doses of about 4 to about 40 mg\/kg that are administered daily, every other day, every 3day, every 4day or every 5day. Then, the subject is not dosed with a formula 1 compound for a period, e.g., of about 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112 or more consecutive days. Then a lower daily dosing regimen is administered to the subject, e.g., about 0.2 mg\/kg to about 4 or about 6 mg\/kg, essentially as described for the high dosing regimen. Alternatively, this low dosing regimen may comprise 1, 2, 3, 6 or more rounds of a low to moderate initial level, e.g., about 2 to about 10 mg\/kg\/day, optionally followed by subsequent rounds of daily dosing that decrease the initial low to moderate level by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or more in each subsequent round of treatment, which is continued until administration is discontinued.","In some cases, beneficial effects from treatment have been observed for more than 3 months (4 or 5 or more months) after a short course of treatment of a subject with a formula 1 compound. Thus, administration of a formula 1 compound provides a method to help protect a subject against progression of an infection or against adverse consequences of unwanted immune reactions (e.g., inflammation) or against immunosuppression (from infection, chemotherapy, or as disclosed herein), without any dosing of the compound for at least 3 months after an initial dosing protocol, which could be an intermittent or a continuous dosing protocol over, e.g., 1 day to about 4 months (1-15 days, about 1 month, about 2 months, etc).","Dosages of the formula 1 compound, routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for any of the diseases or conditions that are disclosed herein. Thus, the formula 1 compounds may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically in chronic conditions or they may be administered at the time of or relatively soon after an acute event such as the onset of surgery, a migraine or the occurrence of trauma, e.g., accidental central nervous system injury or a cerebral stroke or infarction. For acute events, the formula 1 compounds may thus be administered concurrently, e.g., within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes of the onset or occurrence of the acute event, or at a later time, e.g., at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 or 120 hours after the onset or occurrence of the acute event. The formula 1 compounds may thus be administered at about 6-120 hours, or about 8-48 hours, about 10-24 hours or about 12-16 hours after an acute event starts or occurs.","Alternatively, the formula 1 compounds may thus be administered before, e.g., within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes before the onset or occurrence of a planned or anticipated acute event, or at an earlier time, e.g., at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 or 120 hours before the onset or occurrence of the acute event. The formula 1 compounds may thus be administered at about 6-120 hours, or about 8-48 hours, about 10-24 hours or about 12-16 hours before the planned or anticipated acute event starts or occurs.","Invention embodiments include a method to modulate an immune or cellular response in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1. Immune and cellular response modulation includes enhancing Th1 immune responses, reducing Th2 immune responses, reducing Th1 immune responses, enhancing Th2 immune responses, reducing unwanted or pathological inflammation, enhancing hemopoiesis or modulating the synthesis, level or a biological activity of a biomolecule such as (1) a transcription factor such as a steroid receptor or other associated steroid receptor factor, (2) a purine such as adenosine, (3) a nucleotide cofactor such as NADPH, (4) a cytokine or interleukin or a receptor for a cytokine or interleukin, or (5) another biomolecule as disclosed herein. Such enhancements, reductions, levels or activities are usually in an easily detectable range, e.g., a change compared to a suitable control of at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or a range that is between about any two of these values. Typically the subject is in need of such treatment, e.g., by having a clinical condition disclosed herein or being subject to developing such a condition, e.g., having been exposed or potentially exposed to a pathogen or having a predisposing condition such as precancer.","In some embodiments one or more formula 1 compounds or groups of formula 1 compounds may excluded from one or more of the uses disclosed herein. For example, if the subject is in need of enhanced hemopoiesis, the formula 1 compound optionally excludes 5-androstene-3\u03b2-ol-17-one, 5-androstene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol, 5-androstene-3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-triol or a derivative of any of these three compounds that can convert to these compounds by hydrolysis, or if the subject has or is susceptible to developing a memory impairing neurological disorder or memory impairment condition, the compound is not 5-androstene-3\u03b2-ol-7,17-dione or 5-androstene-3\u03b2,7-diol-17-one or a derivative of these compounds that can has a group at the 7-position that can convert to \u2014OH or \u2550O by hydrolysis. In other embodiments, formula 1 compound is not 4-pregnene-11\u03b2,17\u03b1,21-triol-3,20-dione, 17\u03b1,21-dihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,11,20-trione, 11\u03b2,21-dihydroxy-3,20-dioxopregn-4-en-18-al, 11\u03b2,17\u03b1,21-trihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 17\u03b1,21-dihydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione, 3\u03b2-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one, 3\u03b2-hydroxyandrost-5-ene-17-one, pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 21-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 9-fluoro-11\u03b2,16\u03b1,21-trihydroxy-16-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 9-fluoro-11\u03b2,16\u03b1,17,21-tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 9-fluoro-11\u03b2,17\u03b1,21-trihydroxy-16-methylpregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, dehydroepiandrosterone-3-sulfate, 1,4-pregnadiene-17\u03b1,21-diol-3,11,20-trione, androsterone, androsterone acetate, androsterone propionate, androsterone benzoate, androstenediol, androstenediol-3-acetate, androstenediol-17-acetate, androstenediol-3,17-diacetate, androstenediol-17-benzoate, androstenediol-3-acetate-17-benzoate, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, 4-dihydrotestosterone, 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone, dromostanolone, dromostanolone propionate, ethylestrenol, nandrolone phenpropionate, nandrolone decanoate, nandrolone furylpropionate, nandrolone cyclohexanepropionate, nandrolone benzoate, nandrolone cyclohexanecarboxylate, oxandrolone, stanozolol, testosterone, methyl testosterone, testolactone, oxymetholone, fluoxymesterone, acetoxypregnenolone, allylestrenol, anagestone acetate, chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone, cyproterone acetate, desogestrel, dihydrogesterone, dimethisterone, ethisterone (17\u03b1-ethynyltestosterone), ethynodiol diacetate, fluorogestone acetate, gestadene, hydroxyprogesterone, hydroxyprogesterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, hydroxymethylprogesterone, hydroxymethylprogesterone acetate, 3-ketodesogestrel, levonorgestrel, lynestrenol, medrogestone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol, megestrol acetate, melengestrol acetate, norethindrone, norethindrone acetate, norethisterone, norethisterone acetate, norethynodrel, norgestimate, norgestrel, norgestrienone, normethisterone, and progesterone, progesterone, cyproterone acetate, norethindrone, norethindrone acetate, levonorgestrel, an ester of any of the foregoing compounds (e.g., acetate, enanthate, propionate, isopropionate, cyclopropionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, valerate, caproate, isocaproate, hexanoate, heptanoate, octanoate, nonanoate, decanoate, undecanoate, phenylacetate or benzoate esters, e.g., hydroxyl esters), a naturally occurring glucorcorticoid, a species disclosed herein or a derivative of any of these that can convert to these molecules by hydrolysis or metabolism, e.g., a metabolizable or hydrolyzable ester or ether such as a cyclic ketal, an acetate, a diacetete, a proprionate, a diproprionate, or an O-alkyl, an acyl, e.g., \u2014C(O)\u2014C1-C6 alkyl or another moiety that is bonded at, e.g., a variable group such as for R-Ras disclosed herein.","Synthesis methods. Reagents and reaction conditions that one can use to make the formula 1 compounds have been described, see e.g., the citations above, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,874,598, 5,874,597, 5,874,594, 5,840,900; PCT publication number WO 9901579. General chemical synthetic methods to link a variety of organic moieties to various reactive groups have been described. For example, in G. T. Hermanson, , Academic Press, 1996, functional targets such as amino acids, peptides and carbohydrates are described at pages 3-136, while the chemistries of reactive groups in the functional targets, e.g., amine, thiol, carboxyl, hydroxyl, aldehyde, ketone and reactive hydrogen atoms (e.g., \u2014H linked to an electron-donating moiety such as a heteroaryl moiety) are described at pages 137-166. This reference also describes reagents useful to make the derivatives, e.g., zero-length cross-linkers, heterobifunctional cross-linkers, homobifunctional cross-linkers, tags, probes and polymers are described at pages 169-416 and 605-638. This reference also describes synthetic methods to modify oligonucleotides at pages 639-671.","In one aspect, amino acids or peptides are linked to the steroid through the amine group using a coupling reagent such as phosgene (Cl\u2014CO\u2014Cl) or Cl\u2014CS\u2014Cl and suitably protected amino acids or peptides and steroids, which are protected as needed. Such linkage generates an intervening \u2014CO\u2014O\u2014 or a \u2014CS\u2014O\u2014 moiety between the amino acid or peptide and the steroid nucleus.","By way of exemplification and not limitation, the following methods are used to prepare the one or more of the compounds disclosed herein.

Methods to convert hydroxyl to other functional groups are accomplished essentially as described, e.g., in the references cited herein. For example, esters, of formula 1-10c compounds, such as \u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014Rwhere Ris a Corganic moiety, are prepared from the steroid alcohol by treatment with the appropriate acid anhydride or acid chloride (R\u2014C(O)\u2014Cl) to form any desired ester. Ethers, such as \u2014O\u2014R, are prepared from alcohols by formation of the alkaline metal alkoxide (N or K) followed by treatment with a primary or secondary iodide (R\u2014I). Thionoesters, R\u2014C(S)\u2014O\u2014, are prepared by treating the R\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 ester with Lawesson's reagent.","Sulfates, NaO\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, R\u2014O\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, e.g., CH(CH)\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014O\u2014, are prepared by treatment of alcohols with chlorosulfonic acid followed by NaOH or alternatively by oxidation of sulfites using KMnO. If the alkyl (e.g., methyl) ester is desired alkylchloro-sulfonate (methylchloro-sulfonate) can be used. Sulfites HO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014 and ammonium salts NHO\u2014S(O)\u2014O, or RO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014 esters (e.g., CHO\u2014S(O)\u2014O\u2014) are prepared by standard methods. The ammonium salts are prepared by treatment of alcohols with ammonia and sulfur dioxide. The esters such as alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl esters (e.g., methyl ester) are obtained when alcohols are treated with alkylchlorosulfite (e.g., methycholorosulfite), alkenylchlorosulfite or alkynylchlorosulfite in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. Phosphoesters, RO\u2014P(OR)(O)\u2014O\u2014 are prepared by treating the alcohol with diethylchlorophosphate in the presence of NaCO. Alternatively, if the alcohol is treated with phosphoric acid diesters in the presence of triphenylphospine (PPh) and diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) the corresponding triesters are formed with inversion (Mitsunobu reaction).","Phosphothioesters, RO\u2014P(SR)(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated by treatment of alcohols with the monothio analog of diethylchlorophosphate as described for phosphoesters yielding the phosphothioesters. Carbonates, RO\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated from the corresponding steroid alcohol using the chloroformate (R\u2014C(O)\u2014Cl), e.g., Calkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chloroformates (e.g. CH(CH)\u2014C(O)Cl). Carbamates, R\u2014NH\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are made from steroid alcohols by treatment with isocyanates (RN\u2550C\u2550O) or NaOCN in the presence of trifluororoacetic acid. Aminoacid esters, ZNX\u2014CHY\u2014C(O)\u2014O\u2014 are generated by coupling the steroid alcohol with the acid chloride of the N-protected amino acid.","Oxidation of hydroxyl groups that are linked to the steroid nucleus is used to obtain ketones and related functionalities. For example, conversion of alcohols to ketones can be achieved using a variety of oxidizing agents such as CrOin AcOH, or pyridinium cholorchromate, pyridinium dichromate or oxalyl chloride with triethylamine (Swern oxidation). Thioketones (\u2550S) are prepared by treating ketones with Lawesson's reagent (2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-disulfide; commercially available from Aldrich). Thioacetals, \u2014C(SR)(SR)\u2014, are prepared from ketones (\u2014C(O)\u2014) by treatment with R\u2014SH thiols under acid catalysis conditions (e.g., HCl). Phosphonoesters, RO\u2014P(OR)(O)\u2014, are generated by addition of the phosphorus acid diester to ketones in the presence of KF to yield hydroxy phosphonoesters. One may optionally remove the hydroxy group using a dehydration and hydrogenation sequence.","Substitution of hydroxyl groups is used to generate a number of functionalities. For example, thiols, \u2014SH, are prepared from alcohols by conversion of the alcohol with inversion to the bromide using PBr. Treatment of the bromide with thiourea followed by NaOH gives the thiol. Thioethers, R\u2014S\u2014, are prepared from thiols by treatment with NaOH and the required halide, e.g., alkyl halide. Alternatively, alcohol derivatives like tosylates or mesylates can be displaced by thiolate anions, R\u2014S, to yield the thioether. Thioesters, R\u2014C(O)\u2014S\u2014, are prepared by treating the tosylate (mesylate) of the alcohol with the sodium salt of the thioacid.","Substitution of hydroxyl groups can be used to generate both esters, RO\u2014C(O)\u2014, and amides, NHR\u2014C(O)\u2014, linked to the steroid at carbon atoms. For amides and amines, Ris \u2014H, a protecting group or a Corganic moiety. These are synthesized from the steroid bromide with inversion by displacement with NaCN. The cyanide group can be hydrolyzed to the amide or the acid. The acid is esterified or treated by standard peptide coupling reactions with an acid-protected amino acid in the presence of a suitable carboxyl activating agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to form steroid \u2014C(O)\u2014NH\u2014CHY\u2014C(O)\u2014OR, where Y is the side chain of an amino acid or a C1-C10 organic moiety and R is a protecting group (or hydrogen when deprotected).","Amines and derivatives of amines, e.g., RNH\u2014, R\u2014C(O)NH\u2014, ROC(O)\u2014NH\u2014 or RO\u2014C(O)\u2014CHR\u2014NH\u2014 linked to steroid carbon atoms, are typically prepared by standard methods. For example, amines (NH-steroid) are generally prepared using the Hoffmann rearrangement (Br, NaOH) from the amide (NH\u2014C(O)-steroid) or the Curtius rearrangement (NaN) from the acid chloride of the steroid. The Rsubstituent can subsequently be introduced by alkylation. Steroid alcohols can be used as starting materials under standard Mitsunobu conditions (PPh, DEAD) to yield N-Boc sulfonamides using N-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-p-toluenesulfonamide. One can selectively remove either protecting group. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid affords the sulfonamide (R\u2014S(O)(O)\u2014NH-steroid). Alternatively, sodium napthalenide deprotects to give the N-Boc compound. Amines (NH-steroid) can be converted to amides (R\u2014C(O)\u2014NH-steroid) using acyl chlorides (R\u2014C(O)\u2014Cl). Treatment with ethyl chloroformate gives the N-carbamate (RO\u2014C(O)\u2014NH-steroid). The amine (NH-steroid) can be alkylated with an \u03b1-bromoester to yield the amino acid substituted steroid (R\u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014CHY\u2014NH-steroid).","Where reactions such as substitutions give a product mixture, the desired intermediate is optionally separated from other products or at least partially enriched (e.g., enriched at least about 10-fold, usually at least about 50-100-fold) from other products before subsequent reactions are conducted. Substitution at steroid carbon atoms will generally proceed with greatest efficiency at the 3-position, which is relatively sterically unhindered and C-17 is generally somewhat less accessible than the C-3 position. The relative reactivities of the C-3, C-7, C-17 and C-16 positions allows one to use their reactivities to control the sequential introduction of different functional groups into the same steroid molecule. Also, groups, such as hydroxyl at more reactive positions, C-3 or C-17, may be sequentially protected or deprotected to allow introduction of functional groups at other positions, such as C-7 or C-16.","Polymers such as PEG are linked to the compounds essentially as described above. For example, PEG200 or PEG300 is linked to the steroid at the 3, 7, 16, 17 or other positions by an ether linkage (PEG-O-steroid) using a PEG alkoxide (PEG-ONa), to displace the steroid bromide. Alternatively, PEG-Br can be treated with the steroid alkoxide. Polyethylene glycol esters such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,964 can also be prepared using a suitable formula 1 compound and the methods described therein. Monosaccharides or polysaccharides and oligonucleotides are linked to steroid hydroxyl groups using known methods, see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,627,270.","Formula 1 steroid analogs that comprise one or more ring heteroatoms are synthesized according to the following methods.","Scheme 11. Formula 1 compounds that comprise two or three ring heteroatoms are prepared as shown in the following schemes. In the scheme, X is \u2014CH\u2014, \u2014NH\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, or \u2014S\u2014; Ris \u2014H or \u2014Br; Ris an organic moiety having about 12 carbon atoms or less, typically C1-C8 optionally substituted alkyl (e.g., methyl, hydroxymethyl, ethyl, propyl, \u2014CH(O), \u2014CH(S)) or C2-C8 optionally substituted alkenyl having a single double bond (e.g., vinyl) with 1, 2, 3 or more independently selected substituents (e.g., \u2014OH, \u2014COOH, \u2014O\u2014) and with any substituents that comprise a functional group generally being protected. Preparation of compound 20 from 19 is accomplished using a glycol such as HOC(CH)C(CH)OH in acid (H) (B. H. Lipshutz et al., 12: 267, 1982). The use of a bulky protecting group facilitates generation of a double bond at the 5-6 position over the 4-5 position.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0445","num":"0598"},"chemistry":[{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00081","num":"00081"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00081","he":"247.23mm","wi":"75.78mm","file":"US07947846-20110524-C00081.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00082","num":"00082"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00082","he":"250.02mm","wi":"75.86mm","file":"US07947846-20110524-C00082.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00083","num":"00083"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00083","he":"82.72mm","wi":"74.93mm","file":"US07947846-20110524-C00083.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}]},"Schemes 12A-12D.

As shown in scheme 11, the bromine atom is ultimately found at the 7-position. The bromine may be converted to a hydroxyl by reaction of the steroid with base (e.g., aqueous KOH), and the hydroxyl may in turn be protected using known methods, e.g., using CH\u2014CH\u2014Br and base (KOH). The alcohol is protected and deprotected essentially using described methods, see, e.g., W. H. Hartung et al., 7: 263, 1953; E. J. Rerst et al., 29: 3725, 1968; A. M. Felix et al., 43: 4194, 1978; D.

Other substituents are linked to the steroids essentially as described in schemes 1-10.","Alternative routes to introduce a functional group into the 7-position are also suitable. For example, formula 1 compounds that have a double bond at the 5-6 position and are unsubstituted at the 7-position are optionally protected, e.g., hydroxyl groups are protected with acetate, and a ketone is introduced into the 7-position by oxidation with chromic acid essentially as described (U.S. Pat. No. 2,170,124). The carbonyl (\u2550O) at 7 is reduced to a hydroxyl using mild conditions, e.g., Al(Oi-Pr), to avoid reducing the 5-6 double bond.","Selective hydrogenation of a double bond at the 16-17 position without reduction of a double bond at 5-6 is accomplished using Hand Pd. In general, ketones (\u2550O) can be protected using a glycol, e.g., reaction with ethylene glycol in p-toluenesulfonic acid and benzene, before subsequent oxidation or reduction reactions are conducted.","Various groups that may comprise the formula 1 compounds described herein, e.g., hydroxyl groups or ketones bonded to the steroid nucleus, or substituted alkyl groups, substituted heterocycles, amino acids and peptides, can contain one or more reactive moieties such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino or thiol. Intermediates used to make formula 1 compounds may be protected as is apparent in the art. Noncyclic and cyclic protecting groups and corresponding cleavage reactions are described in \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\u201d, Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, ISBN 0-471-62301-6) (hereafter \u201cGreene\u201d) and will not be detailed here. In the context of the present invention, these protecting groups are groups that can be removed from a formula 1 compound without irreversibly changing the covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state of the remainder of the molecule. For example, the protecting group, \u2014R, that is bonded to an \u2014O\u2014 or \u2014NH\u2014 group can be removed to form \u2014OH or \u2014NH, respectively, without affecting other covalent bonds in the molecule. At times, when desired, more than one protecting group can be removed at a time, or they can be removed sequentially. In formula 1 compounds containing more than one protecting group, the protecting groups are the same or different.","Protecting groups are removed by known procedures, although it will be understood that the protected intermediates fall within the scope of this invention. The removal of the protecting group may be arduous or straight-forward, depending upon the economics and nature of the conversions involved. In general, one will use a protecting group with exocyclic amines or with carboxyl groups during synthesis of a formula 1 compound. For most therapeutic applications amine groups should be deprotected. Protecting groups commonly are employed to protect against covalent modification of a sensitive group in reactions such as alkylation or acylation. Ordinarily, protecting groups are removed by, e.g. hydrolysis, elimination or aminolysis. Thus, simple functional considerations will suffice to guide the selection of a reversible or an irreversible protecting group at a given locus on the formula 1 compounds. Suitable protecting groups and criteria for their selection are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Eds. \u201cProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\u201d 2nd edition, Wiley Press, at pps. 10-142, 143-174, 175-223, 224-276, 277-308, 309-405 and 406-454.","Determination of whether a group is a protecting group is made in the conventional manner, e.g., as described by Kocienski, Philip J.; \u201c\u201d (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994) (hereafter \u201cKocienski\u201d), Section 1.1, page 2, and Greene Chapter 1, pages 1-9. In particular, a group is a protecting group if when, based on mole ratio, 90% of that protecting group has been removed by a deprotection reaction, no more than 50%, typically 25%, more typically 10%, of the deprotected product molecules have undergone changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. When multiple protecting groups of the same type are present in the molecule, the mole ratios are determined when all of the groups of that type are removed. When multiple protecting groups of different types are present in the molecule, each type of protecting group is treated (and the mole ratios are determined) independently or together with others depending on whether the deprotection reaction conditions pertinent to one type are also pertinent to the other types present. In one embodiment, a group is a protecting group if when, based on mole ratio determined by conventional techniques, 90% of that protecting group has been removed by a conventional deprotection reaction, no more than 50%, typically 25%, more typically 10%, of the deprotected product molecules have undergone irreversible changes to their covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state other than those occasioned by the removal of the protecting group. Irreversible changes require chemical reactions (beyond those resulting from aqueous hydrolysis, acid\/base neutralization or conventional separation, isolation or purification) to restore the covalent bond structure or oxidation\/reduction state of the deprotected formula 1 compound.","Protecting groups are also described in detail together with general concepts and specific strategies for their use in Kocienski, Philip J.; \u201cProtecting Groups\u201d (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

Prodrugs for carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are detailed in Bundgaard at pages 3 to 10, for amides, imides and other NH-acidic compounds at pages 10 to 27, amines at pages 27 to 43, and cyclic prodrugs at pages 62 to 70. These moieties are optionally bonded to the steroid at one, two or more of the variable groups that are bonded to the rings in the formula 1 compounds, e.g., one or more R-R, R, R, Rand R.","Metabolites. Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolites of the compounds described herein and the use of the metabolites for use in the therapeutic treatments or other methods described herein or in the cited references. This includes metabolites or products that are novel and unobvious over the prior art as new compounds as such and their uses. Metabolites may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, glycosidation and the like of the administered formula 1 compound, due to enzymatic or chemical processes. Metabolites may be generated in vivo in a subject or they may arise ex vivo from cells or tissues, e.g., from a mammal such as a human, rodent or a primate. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a subject or a subject's cells or tissue for a period of time sufficient to yield detectable amounts of a metabolic product thereof. Such products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled or mass labeled formula 1 compound that comprises, e.g., 1, 2, 3 or more C, C, H, H, I, P, S or Tc atoms bonded to the compound, and administering it as a trace labeled compound along with the unlabeled compound. The labeled and unlabeled compound is administered by any suitable route (by, e.g., a buccal, sublingual, parenteral, topical or oral route) in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.1 \u03bcg\/kg, or at least about 10 \u03bcg\/kg or at least about 0.5 mg\/kg of the labeled compound) to a subject, e.g., an animal or mammal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, primate, or to a human. After administration sufficient time is allowed for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and conversion products are isolated from one or more of the urine, blood, plasma, feces or other suitable biological sources. The amount of labeled formula 1 compound that is administered to a subject will vary with the specific activity of the labeled compound. Exemplary metabolic conversions of formula 1 compounds include modification of hydrogen atoms or other moieties that are bonded to, e.g., one or more of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 15, 16 or 17 positions. Exemplary conversions at these one or more of positions include hydroxylation of ring atoms, e.g., ring carbon atoms, conjugation of hydroxyl groups that are bonded to one or more of those positions with moieties such as sulfate, phosphate or a monosaccharide or disaccharide such as glucuronic acid and hydrolysis of moieties such as esters or alkoxy groups.","Exemplary radiolabeled and heavy atom labeled formula 1 compounds include ones that comprise 1, 2, 3 or more C, C, H, H, I, P or S atoms that are at (or bonded to), e.g., one, two, three or more of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19 positions. In some embodiments, the molecule comprises only one or two types, e.g., C or H, of labeled atoms. Suitably labeled compounds include any of the compounds disclosed herein, e.g., any formula 1 compound in compound groups 1 through 54. Such labeled compounds may comprise, e.g., a C at the 18 or 19 positions and one two or three H may be bonded to the C atom(s) or to a ring carbon(s). Other formula 1 compounds may comprise one or two H or H atoms bonded to one or more of the 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11 or 12 positions and optionally a C at the 18 or 19 position(s).","These products or metabolites are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated, e.g., by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS, GC-MS, HPLC including reverse phase HPLC, or NMR analysis. See, e.g., H. L. J. Makin et al., eds. 1995, Chapman & Hall, ISBN 0751401285. In general, analysis of metabolites is accomplished in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies, which are known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, especially when they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the formula 1 compounds even if they possess only limited therapeutic activity of their own.","Formulations and compositions for preparing formulations. Invention embodiments include formulations described here and elsewhere in this disclosure. While it is possible for the formula 1 compound(s) to be administered alone it is usual to present them as formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, comprise at least one formula 1 compound, together with one or more excipients and optionally one or more additional therapeutic ingredients.","This aspect of the invention includes compositions comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. The compositions are used to prepare formulations suitable for human or animal use. Suitable administration routes for formulations include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, rectal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal, intraocular and epidural). In general, aqueous and non-aqueous liquid or cream formulations are delivered by a parenteral, oral or topical route. In other embodiments, such as the invention intermittent dosing methods, the formula 1 compound(s) may be present as an aqueous or a non-aqueous liquid formulation or a solid formulation suitable for administration by any of the routes disclosed herein, e.g., oral, topical, buccal, sublingual, parenteral, inhaled aerosol or a depot such as a subcutaneous depot or an intraperitoneal or intramuscular depot. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with, for example, the subject's pathological condition or weight or the subject's response to therapy with a formula 1 compound or other therapy that is used or that is appropriate to the circumstances.","The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques, excipients and formulations generally are found in, e.g., , Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1985, 17edition, Nema et al., 1997 51:166-171, G. Cole, et al., editors, Pharmaceutical Coating Technology, 1995, Taylor & Francis, ISBN 0 136628915, H. A. Lieberman, et al., editors, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 1992 2revised edition, volumes 1 and 2, Marcel Dekker, ISBN 0824793870, J. T. Carstensen. 1998, pages 1-306, Technomic Publishing Co. ISBN 1566766907. Exemplary excipients for formulations include emulsifying wax, propyl gallate, citric acid, lactic acid, polysorbate 80, sodium chloride, isopropyl palmitate, glycerin, white petrolatum and other excipients disclosed herein.","Methods to make invention formulations include the step of bringing into association or contacting a formula 1 compound(s) with one or more excipient, such as one described herein or in the cited references. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the formula 1 compound(s) with liquid excipients or finely divided solid excipients or both, and then, if appropriate, shaping the product.","Formulations suitable for oral administration are prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the formula 1 compound(s); as a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The formula 1 compound(s) may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.","A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the formula 1 compound(s) in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered or granulated formula 1 compound and one or more excipients, which are optionally moistened, with an inert liquid diluent or excipient. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the formula 1 compound(s) therefrom. An exemplary tablet or caplet (a capsule shaped tablet) formulation suitable for buccal or sublingual delivery of a formula 1 compound to a subject's tissues comprises about 25 or 50 mg of a formula 1 compound such as BrEA hemihydrate comprising per 25 mg of the formula 1 compound about 6.2 mg povidone, about 0.62 mg magnesium stearate, about 45 mg mannitol and about 48 mg of compressible sucrose.","For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g., the mouth or skin, the formulations are typically applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the formula 1 compound(s) in an amount of, for example, about 0.075 to about 20% w\/w (including formula 1 compound(s) in a range between about 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w\/w such as about 0.6% w\/w, about 0.7% w\/w, about 1% w\/w, about 1.5% w\/w, about 2% w\/w, about 2.5 w\/w, about 3% w\/w, about 5% w\/w, about 7% w\/w, about 10% w\/w etc.), including about 0.2 to 15% w\/w and about 0.5 to 10% w\/w. When formulated in an ointment, the formula 1 compound(s) may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, they may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base.","If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w\/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, butane 1,4-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and a polyethylene glycol (including, e.g., PEG 300 and PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may include a compound that enhances absorption or penetration of the formula 1 compound(s) through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs.","The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known excipients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. A hydrophilic emulsifier may be included together with a lipophilic emulsifier, which acts as a stabilizer. Some embodiments include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations.","Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulations include Tween60\u2122, Span80\u2122, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate.","The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. Creams are generally a non-greasy, non-staining and washable products with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and\/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye include eye drops wherein the formula 1 compound(s) is dissolved or suspended in a suitable excipient(s), including an aqueous solvent for a formula 1 compound(s) that comprise at least about 0.5, one, two or more charges at pH values near neutrality, e.g., about pH 6-8. The formula 1 compound(s) is typically present in such formulations in a concentration of about 0.5-20% w\/w, about 1-10% w\/w or about 2-5% w\/w.","Formulations suitable for topical administration to oral mucosa include lozenges or tablets comprising the formula 1 compound(s) in a flavored basis or a monosaccharide or disaccharide such as sucrose, lactose or glucose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the formula 1 compound(s) in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the formula 1 compound(s) in a suitable liquid excipient(s). In some embodiments, the lozenges or tablets optionally comprise the property of rapid dissolution or disintegration, e.g., disintegration within about 15 seconds to about 2 minutes, while in others, the lozenges or tablets comprise the property of slower dissolution or disintegration, e.g., disintegration within about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes or more.","Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate.","Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the formula 1 compound(s) such excipients as are known in the art to be appropriate.","Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, salts (e.g., NaCl, potassium or sodium carbonate or bicarbonate or potassium or sodium phosphates) and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended subject; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents or thickening agents. In general, the formula 1 compound that is present in liquid compositions or formulations is completely dissolved in aqueous or non-aqueous excipients. However, in some embodiments, e.g., transient compositions or some formulations, the formula 1 compound is partially dissolved while the remaining portion is present as a solid, which can be a suspension or a colloid.","Exemplary formulations suitable for parenteral delivery of formula 1 compounds to subjects such as humans or animals typically comprise one, two, three or more excipients. Exemplary embodiments include (1) any two, three or four of propylene glycol, PEG200, PEG300, ethanol and benzyl benzoate and (2) any two, three or four of propylene glycol, PEG100, PEG200, PEG300, PEG400 and benzyl benzoate. Another exemplary formulation suitable for parenteral use include an aqueous","BrEA hemihydrate suspension comprising about 50-120 mg\/mL of BrEA hemihydrate that has an average particle size of 20 \u03bcm or less, about 0.05-0.2% w\/v carboxymethylcellulose sodium, about 1-3% w\/v polysorbate 80, about 0.75-0.85% w\/v NaCl, about 0.023% w\/v dibasic sodium phosphate, about 0.101% w\/v monobasic sodium phosphate, about 0-0.5% ethanol v\/v, pH 6.5+\/\u22120.4 and optionally about 0.1-0.3% w\/v of a preservative such as methylparaben.","Exemplary compositions and formulations generally comprise about 0.01-10% of a formula 1 compound, usually about 1-5%, and about 0.01-3% water, typically about 0.05-3%, usually about 0.1-1%. The formulations include unit or multi-unit dosages suitable for parenteral administration once or twice per day or once per 2-3 days. Unit dosages comprise about 3-1000 mg of formula 1 compound per unit dose, typically about 5-500 mg, usually about 10-200 mg. For treating retroviruses such as HIV in humans, a unit dose usually comprises about 10-250 mg of BrEA hemihydrate, usually about 100-200 mg, in a volume of about 1-6 mL, usually about 2-4 mL.","Formulations, or compositions disclosed herein for use to make formulations suitable for administration by the routes disclosed herein optionally comprise an average particle size in the range of about 0.01 to about 500 microns, about 0.1 to about 100 microns or about 0.5 to about 75 microns. Average particle sizes include a range between 0.01 and 500 microns in 0.05 micron or in 0.1 micron or other increments, e.g., an average particle size of about 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 75, 85, 100, 120, etc. microns). When formula 1 compounds or compositions that comprise a formula 1 compound are used as intermediates to make a formulation, they may comprise one, two, three or more of these average particle sizes, or size ranges. In preparing any of the compositions or formulations that are disclosed herein and that comprise a formula 1 compound (and optionally one or more excipients), one may optionally mill, sieve or otherwise granulate the compound or composition to obtain a desired particle size, e.g., as described above.","Milling may occur before or after the formula 1 compound is contacted with one or more excipients. For example, one may mill a formula 1 compound such as 16\u03b1-bromoepiandrosterone hemihydrate, to obtain an average particle size (or diameter) of about 0.05-50 \u03bcM or about 0.5-10 \u03bcM (e.g., about 0.04, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 or 120 \u03bcM average particle size or diameter) before contacting the milled formula 1 compound with a liquid or solid excipient. In some cases the formula 1 compound is milled or sieved to obtain an average particle size of about 5 \u03bcm or about 10 \u03bcm before it is contacted with a solid or liquid excipient(s) to obtain a solution or suspension or a powder suitable for making a tablet, capsule or other dosage form as described herein or in the cited references.","As used herein, reference to an average particle size or an average particle diameter means that the material, e.g., a formula 1 compound(s), an excipient(s) or a composition that comprises both, is ground, milled, sieved or otherwise treated so as to comprise the specified average size. It is to be understood that some particles may be larger or smaller, but the composition or the formula 1 compound(s) will comprise a significant proportion of the material with the specified size or within an acceptable range of the specified size. Micronization methods include milling by ball mills, pin mills, jet mills (e.g., fluid energy jet mills) and grinding, sieving and precipitation of a compound(s) from a solution, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,919,341, 5,202,129, 5,271,944, 5,424,077 and 5,455,049. Average particle size is determined by, e.g., transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and light scattering methods or Coulter counter analysis.","Thus, the formula 1 compounds may comprise a powder that consists of one, two or more of these average particle sizes and the powder may be contacted with a solid excipient(s), suitably mixed and optionally compressed or formed into a desired shape. Alternatively, such a formula 1 compound(s) is contacted with a liquid excipient(s) to prepare a liquid formulation or a liquid composition that is incorporated into a solid formulation. Suitable micronized formulations thus include aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions of the formula 1 compound(s).","Formulations suitable for aerosol administration typically will comprise a fine powder, e.g., having an average particle size of about 0.1 to about 20 microns or any one, two or more of the average particle sizes within this range that are described above. The powder is typically delivered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the bronchioles or alveolar sacs of the lungs.","Formulations suitable for aerosol, dry powder or tablet administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of viral or other infections as described herein. Such formulations may be administered, e.g., orally, parenterally (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intrathecal), topically, sublingually or by a buccal or sublingual route.","Micronized formula 1 compound is useful, e.g., to facilitate mixing, dissolution or uniform suspension of the formula 1 compound in one or more liquid or solid excipients, e.g., a PEG such as PEG 300 or PEG 400, or propylene glycol or benzyl benzoate, a complexing agent, such as a cyclodextrin (e.g., an \u03b1-, \u03b2- or \u03b3-cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin). Micronized formula 1 compound is also useful to facilitate uniformly distributing drug substance when the micronized compound is contacted with one or more solid excipients (e.g., a filler, a binder, a disintegrant, complexing agent (e.g., a cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin), a preservative, a buffer or a lubricant).","In related embodiments, suitable compositions or formulations comprise a formula 1 compound that is present in two or more physical forms. For example, a liquid composition or formulation may comprise a formula 1 compound that is present in solution and as undissolved particles, which may be milled as described herein. Alternatively, a solid composition or formulation may comprise a formula 1 compound that is present as an amorphous form and as a crystal or in an encapsulated granule. Such encapsulated granules may comprise a slow release type formulation and the formula 1 compound that is present may be in one or more physical forms, e.g., liquids or solids as described herein, but usually as a solid in tablets or other solid formulations.","The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets as described above. Unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as recited herein, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the formula 1 compound(s).","It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents or excipients conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.","Formulations made from or comprising a formula 1 compound such as BrEA hemihydrate are optionally stored under conditions that limit the amount of light or water that reaches the formulation, e.g., in a sealed container that holds a formulation or unit dosage form and optionally contains silica gel or activated carbon. Water permeation characteristics of containers have been described, e.g., Containers\u2014Permeation, Chapter, USP 23, 1995, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc., Rockville, Md., p. 1787. Storage of BrEA hemihydrate or formulations that contain it is typically at about 4-30\u00b0 C.","The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one formula 1 compound together with a veterinary excipient(s) therefor. Veterinary excipients are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials that are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the formula 1 compound(s). These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.","Invention formulations include controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing a formula 1 compound(s) (\u201ccontrolled release formulations\u201d, \u201cslow release formulations\u201d or the like) in which the release of the formula 1 compound(s) is controlled or regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given formula 1 compound(s). Polymers and other materials that are suitable to prepare controlled release formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,652,443, 4,800,085, 4,808,416, 5,013,727, 5,188,840.","Thus, microcapsules, granules or other shaped forms may comprise a formula 1 compound and a slow release polymer or polymer matrix that comprises or consists of one or more of ethylene dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tetrathylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylaminoethyl dimethacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, epoxy acrylate, glycidyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl methacrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxyhexyl methacrylate, hydroxyhexyl acrylate, butanediol dimethacrylate, butanediol diacrylate, propanediol dimethacrylate, propanediol diacrylate, pentanediol dimethacrylate, pentanediol diacrylate, hexanediol dimethacrylate, hexanediol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, trimethylopropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethyloethane triacrylate, trimethylolethane trimethacrylate, polypropyleneglycol diacrylate, and polypropylene glycol dimethacrylate.","An effective dose of formula 1 compound(s) depends in part on one or more of the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the formula 1 compound(s) is being used prophylactically (generally lower doses) or against an active infection or condition, the method of delivery, and the formulation. For use in humans, the effective dosage will typically be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. In other subjects, the dose is obtained by similar dose escalation analyses. For humans, an effective dose can be expected to be from about 0.05 to about 50 mg\/kg body weight per day, e.g., about 2 mg\/kg\/day, about 4 mg\/kg\/day, about 6 mg\/kg\/day, or about 8 mg\/kg\/day. For example, for topical delivery the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, generally between about 5 mg and about 40 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses or administration sites. For non-human subjects, e.g., mammals such as rodents or primates, the effective daily dosage may comprise about 0.05 mg\/kg\/day to about 300 mg\/kg\/day, including about 1 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day. As used herein, an \u201ceffective dosage\u201d or an \u201ceffective amount\u201d of a formula 1 compound(s) is one that is sufficient to result in, e.g., a detectable change in a symptom or an immune parameter such as one described herein.","An effective dosage (or daily dosage) may be administered to a subject over a period of time, e.g., at least about 1-14 days before a symptom change or an immune parameter detectably changes. Effective dosages may include any of the dosages as described herein.","Embodiments include formulations that comprise a liposome or lipid complex that comprises a formula 1 compound(s), e.g., BrEA or an ester, carbamate, carbonate, amino acid or peptide thereof. Such formulations are prepared according to known methods, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,427,649, 5,043,165, 5,714,163, 5,744,158, 5,783,211, 5,795,589, 5,795,987, 5,798,348, 5,811,118, 5,820,848, 5,834,016 and 5,882,678. The liposomes optionally contain an additional therapeutic agent(s), e.g., amphotericin B, cis-platin, adriamycin, a protease inhibitor, a nucleoside or a nucleotide analog, such as one of those mentioned herein. Formulations that comprise liposomes can be delivered to a subject by any standard route, e.g., oral, aerosol or parenteral (e.g., s.c., i.v. or i.m.).","Liposome formulations can be used to enhance delivery of the formula 1 compound(s) to certain cell types such as tumor cells (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,163) or to cells of the reticuloendothelial system (\u201cRES\u201d). The RES includes macrophages, mononuclear phagocytic cells, Kupfer cells, cells lining the sinusoids of the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow, and the fibroblastic reticular cells of hematopoietic tissues. In general, RES cells are phagocytic and they are targets for targeted delivery of a formula 1 compound(s) in vitro or in vivo using liposomes, or other compositions or formulations. Thus, one can deliver formula 1 compound to a neoplasm that is derived from reticuloendothelial tissue (reticuloendothelioma). The liposomes may optionally comprise a peptide from an infectious agent such as a malaria parasite, a virus or a tumor associated antigen. The peptides may facilitate the generation of a MHC class II and B cell response.","Invention embodiments include the product made by a process of combining, mixing or otherwise contacting a formula 1 compound such as BrEA hemihydrate and one, two or more excipients. Such products are produced by routine methods of contacting the ingredients. Such products optionally contain a diluent, a disintegrant, a lubricant, a binder, or other excipients described herein or in references cited herein.","Other embodiments include compositions that transiently occur when a method step or operation is performed. For example, when a formula 1 compound such as BrEA, containing less than about 3% water is contacted with an excipient, e.g., a PEG, an alcohol, propylene glycol or benzyl benzoate, the composition before addition of one ingredient with another is a non-homogenous mixture. As the ingredients are contacted, the mixture's homogeneity increases and the proportion of ingredients relative to each other approaches a desired value. Thus, invention compositions, which contain less than about 3% water can comprise about 0.0001-99% of a formula 1 compound such as BrEA and one or more excipients. These transient compositions are intermediates that necessarily arise when one makes an invention composition or formulation and they are included in invention embodiments to the extent that they are useful in the disclosed methods or that they are patentable.","When a formula 1 compound and an excipient(s) is contacted or mixed, the final composition may comprise a homogenous mixture or it may comprise a mixture that is not homogenous for one or more of the compounds that are present in the composition. Compositions and formulations that are either homogenous or non-homogenous are included in the scope of the invention. Non-homogenous compositions can be used to make controlled release formulations.","Invention embodiments include compositions and formulations that comprise less than about 3% water, a formula 1 compound and a compound that is not generally considered suitable for human use but is useful to make an invention formulation for veterinary use. Veterinary formulations are compositions useful for the purpose of administering invention compositions to primates, cats, dogs, horses, cows, rabbits and other subjects and may contain excipients acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with formula 1 compounds such as BrEA. These veterinary compositions may not always be suitable for human use because they contain an excipient that is not suitable for human use, e.g., an alcohol other than ethanol such as methanol, propanol or butanol. Typically such excipients will be present at relatively low levels, e.g., about 1-30%, usually about 1-5%.","Invention embodiments include compositions and formulations, e.g., unit dosage forms and sterile solutions, that comprise (1) about 1-100 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 57.5% propylene glycol, about 25% PEG300, about 12.5% ethanol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (2) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 70% propylene glycol, about 25% PEG300 and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (3) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 25% PEG300, about 35% propylene glycol, about 35% mannitol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (4) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 57.5% propylene glycol, a mixture comprising about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1), about 12.5% ethanol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (5) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 75% propylene glycol, a mixture comprising about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., a PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1) and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (6) about 1-60 mg\/mL of a formula 1 compound(s), about 25% PEG300 and PEG200 (e.g., PEG300:PEG200 in a ratio of about 1:10 to about 10:1), about 35% propylene glycol, about 35% mannitol and about 5% benzyl benzoate; (7) any of formulations (1) through (6) where the formula 1 compound(s) is about 40-55 mg\/mL; (8) any of formulations (1) through (6) where the formula 1 compound(s) is about 30-100 mg\/mL; (9) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1, 2, 3 or 4 formula 1 compounds are present; (10) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1 or 2 formula 1 compounds are present; (11) any of formulations (1) through (8) where 1 formula 1 compound is present; (12) any of formulations (1) through (11) where the formula 1 compound comprises independently at 1, 2 or 3 of any of the variable groups that are bonded to the formula 1 compounds, e.g., R-R, R, R, Ror R, an independently selected ester, thioester, carbonate, carbamate, amino acid or peptide of 1 or 2 independently selected formula 1 compounds; (13) any of formulations (1) through (12) where the formula 1 compound comprises or is BrEA or BrEA hemihydrate; (14) any of formulations (1) through (13) where the formula 1 compound comprises or is an ester, a sulfate ester, a monosaccharide conjugate or phosphoester of BrEA.","Exemplary embodiments include liquid formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound, one, two, three, four or more excipients and less than about 3% v\/v water, wherein the formulation is optionally disposed in containers that exclude water. These excipients are optionally selected from those disclosed herein. Such formulations optionally comprise less than about 2% v\/v water, less than about 1% v\/v water, less than about 0.5% v\/v water, less than about 0.2% v\/v water or less than about 0.1% v\/v water. Such formulations are suitable for use in methods to modulate an immune response or cellular response in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1. The subject in need thereof would have, or be subject to, a condition such as one disclosed herein as amenable to treatment, prevention, amelioration using a formula 1 compound, which is optionally combined with the use of another therapeutic treatment or agent as disclosed herein or in the cited references. These formulations are suitable for use in any of the dosing methods or protocols disclosed herein, including the intermittent dosing protocols disclosed herein.","Buccal formulations. Formula 1 compounds may be administered to subjects by buccal or sublingual dosing. The buccal area generally refers to the subject's mouth and pharynx, and the buccal mucosa includes the mucosa of the mouth and pharynx. The sublingual area refers generally to the mucosa below and adjacent to the tongue. Formulations suitable for buccal or sublingual administration typically comprise about 1-100 mg of formula 1 compound per unit dose, often about 2-60 mg. Buccal or sublingual formulations may comprise a tablet that contains about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 or 60 mg of a formula 1 compound. Solid and liquid buccal or sublingual formulations optionally include one, two, three or more excipients such as fillers, binders, lubricants, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents or disintegrants, e.g., lactose, sucrose, mannitol, Tween-80, magnesium stearate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, cyclodextrins (e.g., \u03b1-cyclodextrins, \u03b2-cyclodextrins, \u03b3-cyclodextrins, hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin), carbomers, hydrolyzed polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene oxide, polyacrylates, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, and combinations thereof. Such formulations may be a unit solid such as a tablet, or a powder or liquid. Buccal tablets may comprise a concave surface for contacting the buccal mucosa and adhering to it. A buccal or sublingual dosage may comprise a compressed tablet of a substantially uniform mixture of a bioerodible polymeric carrier, which on sustained contact with the oral mucosa, substantially or completely erodes within a predetermined period in the range of about 10 minutes to about 24 hours. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered by a method for administering the compound to the subject, e.g., to a mammal or a human, comprising affixing a unit dosage or tablet to the subject's buccal mucosa in a region at or near the upper gum between the first bicuspid on the left and the first bicuspid on the right (or an alternative location for the dosage unit is the inner lip area opposing the this upper gum area) and optionally allowing the tablet to remain in place until erosion thereof is complete or nearly complete. Exemplary excipients may comprise a combination of polyethylene oxide and a carbomer, e.g., wherein the polyethylene oxide and the carbomer are in an approximately 1:5 to 5:1 ratio by weight.","Tablets or unit dosages for buccal or sublingual delivery may be about 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height, so that the unit dosage occupies about 40 mm. Such dosages will typically weigh less than about 100 mg (e.g., about 5 to 60 mg), with a contact surface area of about 10-30 mm, e.g., about 15-20 mm. Such dosages will generally be about 4-10 mm in diameter and about 1-3 mm in height. When a polymer excipient is used, it optionally comprises a polymer having sufficient tack to ensure that the dosage unit adheres to the buccal mucosa for a sufficient time period, e.g., the time period during which drug is to be delivered to the buccal mucosa. The polymeric excipient is gradually \u201cbioerodible,\u201d and it hydrolyzes, dissolves, erodes or disintegrates (collectively \u201cerodes\u201d) at a predetermined rate upon contact with water or saliva. The polymeric carrier is generally sticky when moist, but not when dry, for convenience in handling. The average molecular weight of the polymer may be about 400 to 1,000,000, or about 1,000 to 100,000. Higher the molecular weight polymers generally erode more slowly.","For these buccal and sublingual dosages, a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer(s) can be used. Such polymers will provide a suitable degree of adhesion and the desired drug release profile, and are generally compatible with the drug to be administered and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. The polymeric carriers optionally comprise hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers that are useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as \u201ccarbomers\u201d (Carbopol\u2122, which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other suitable polymers include hydrolyzed polyvinylalcohol; polyethylene oxides (e.g., Sentry Polyox\u2122 water soluble resins, available from Union Carbide); polyacrylates (e.g., Gantrez\u2122, which may be obtained from GAF); vinyl polymers and copolymers; polyvinylpyrrolidone; dextran; guar gum; pectins; starches; and cellulosic polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, (e.g., Methocel\u2122, which may be obtained from the Dow Chemical Company), hydroxypropyl cellulose (e.g., Klucel\u2122, which may be obtained from Dow), hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,285 to Alderman), hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate butyrate, and the like. The carrier may also comprise two or more suitable polymers in combination, for example, a carbomer combined in an approximately 1:5 to 5:1 ratio, by weight, with a polyethylene oxide.","Buccal dosages may contain only the formula 1 compound and the polymer(s). However, it may be desirable in some cases to include one or more additional excipients. For example, a lubricant may be included to facilitate the process of manufacturing the dosage units; lubricants may also optimize erosion rate and drug flux. If a lubricant is present, it may optionally represent about 0.01 wt. % to about 2 wt. %, or about 0.01 wt. % to 0.5 wt. %, of the dosage unit. Suitable lubricants include, but are not limited to, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearylfumarate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oils and polyethylene glycol. However, modulating the particle size of the components in the dosage unit and\/or the density of the unit can provide a similar effect, e.g., improved man ufacturability, and optimization of erosion rate and drug flux without addition of a lubricant.","Other excipients are also optionally incorporated into buccal unit dosages. Such additional optional excipients include, one or more disintegrants, diluents, binders, enhancers, or the like. Examples of disintegrants that may be used include, but are not limited to, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidones, such as crospovidone (e.g., Polyplasdone\u2122 XL, which may be obtained from GAF), cross-linked carboxylic methylcelluloses, such as croscarmelose (e.g., Ac-di-sol\u2122, which may be obtained from FMC), alginic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl starches (e.g., Explotab\u2122, which may be obtained from Edward Medell Co., Inc.), methylcellulose, agar bentonite and alginic acid. Suitable diluents are those which are generally useful in pharmaceutical formulations prepared using compression techniques, e.g., dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (e.g., Di-Tab\u2122, which may be obtained from Stauffer), sugars that have been processed by cocrystallization with dextrin (e.g., co-crystallized sucrose and dextrin such as Di-Pak\u2122, which may be obtained from Amstar), lactone, calcium phosphate, cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, dry starch, powdered sugar and the like. Binders, if used, are those that enhance adhesion. Examples of such binders include, but are not limited to, starch, gelatin and sugars such as sucrose, dextrose, molasses, and lactose. Permeation enhancers may also be present in the novel dosage units in order to increase the rate at which the active agent passes through the buccal mucosa. Examples of permeation enhancers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol monolaurate (\u201cPEGML\u201d), glycerol monolaurate, lecithin, the 1-substituted azacycloheptan-2-ones, particularly 1-n-dodecylcyclaza-cycloheptan-2-one (available under the trademark Azone\u2122 from Nelson Research & Development Co., Irvine, Calif.), lower alkanols (e.g., ethanol), SEPA\u2122 (available from Macrochem Co., Lexington, Mass.), cholic acid, taurocholic acid, bile salt type enhancers, and surfactants such as Tergitol\u2122, Nonoxynol-9\u2122 and TWEEN-80\u2122.","Flavorings are optionally included in buccal or sublingual formulations. Any suitable flavoring may be used, e.g., one or more of mannitol, sucrose, glucose, lactose, lemon, lemon lime, orange, menthol or artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin sodium, dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, stevia and thaumatin. Some sweeteners such as sucrose may also aid in dissolution or erosion of solid formulations. Coloring agents may also be added, e.g., any of the water soluble FD&C dyes or mixtures thereof, e.g., one or more of FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C RED No. 2, FD&C Blue No. 2, etc., food lakes or red iron oxide. In addition such formulations dosages may be formulated with one or more preservatives or bacteriostatic agents, e.g., methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, chlorocresol, benzalkonium chloride, or the like.","Other embodiments include solid buccal or sublingual formulations comprising (i) a formula 1 compound and (ii) erythritol, (iii) crystalline cellulose and (iv) a disintegrant, e.g., crospovidone. These formulations are capable of buccal disintegration or dissolution and may further comprise mannitol. These formulations may dissolve completely in solely saliva within about 1-10 minutes of administration to a subject. The erythritol is optionally contained in a proportion of about 5-90 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the solid buccal formulation. The crystalline cellulose is optionally contained in a proportion of about 3-50 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the formulation. The disintegrant is optionally contained in a proportion of 1-10 parts by weight. In any of the solid buccal or sublingual formulations the ingredients are generally uniformly mixed, although non-uniform mixtures may be used. An exemplary formulation comprises a solid capable of buccal disintegration or dissolution, which comprises (i) about 0.3-50 parts by weight of a formula 1 compound, (ii) about 50-80 parts by weight of erythritol, (iii) about 5-20 parts by weight of crystalline cellulose and (iv) about 3-7 parts by weight of a disintegrant, which optionally is one or more of crospovidone, croscarmellose, croscarmellose sodium, carmellose calcium, carboxymethylstarch sodium, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose or corn starch. Examples of the crystalline cellulose include products of various grade such as CEOLUS KG801, avicel PH101, avicel PH102, avicel PH301, avicel PH302, avicel RC-591 (crystalline cellulose carmellose sodium) and so on. One crystalline cellulose may be used or two or more species may be used in combination. The disintegrant, e.g., crospovidone, may be used singly or in combination with other disintegrants. Crospovidone includes any cross-linked 1-ethenyl-2-pyrrolidinone homopolymer, and may comprise a polymer of molecular weight of 1,000,000 or more. Examples of commercially available crospovidone include Cross-linked povidone, Kollidon CL, Polyplasdone XL, Polyplasdone XL-10, INF-10 (manufactured by ISP, Inc.), polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, PVPP and 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone homopolymer. The disintegrants are optionally incorporated in a proportion of about 1-15 parts by weight, or about 1-10 parts by weight, or about 3-7 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the solid formulation.","Solid or liquid buccal or sublingual formulations are useful to administer a formula 1 compound to a subject (e.g., mammal or human) to achieve a prolonged plasma concentration of the compound. This is accomplished comprising the steps of (1) preparing a solution of the compound dissolved in an aqueous carrier solution; (2) disposing the solution within the subject's sublingual or buccal area in a quantity to deliver a dosage of about 0.01 to about 2.0 or 4.0 mg\/kg of body weight or about 0.1-1 mg\/kg, e.g., a dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg or about 1-50 mg; and (3) contacting the formulation with the buccal or sublingual mucosa, which creates or maintains prolonged detectable plasma concentrations of the formula 1 compound or a metabolite thereof, e.g., for at least about 2, 4, 8, 24, 48 or 72 hours or more.","In other embodiments, buccal or sublingual delivery of a formula 1 compound is accomplished using formulations present as tablets or lozenges, which comprise a candy carrier or a hard candy matrix and sufficient compound, e.g., about 1-100 mg. The candy may be present as a sucker or lollipop.","Some embodiments include a solid buccal or sublingual formulation containing a formula 1 compound where unit doses of the formulation substantially or completely disintegrates or erodes within about 20-120 seconds in water at 37\u00b0 C. or on insertion of the unit dose into the buccal area or upon placement under the tongue. Such formulations may comprise a swellable hydrophilic excipient, a water-soluble or a water-dispersible excipient, e.g., one or more of partially hydrolyzed gelatin, hydrolyzed dextran, dextrin, mannitol, alginates, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidine, water soluble cellulose derivatives, methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, alginates, gelatin, guar gum, gum tragacanth, gum acacia, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polysilicic acid, polylactic acid, polymaleic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, nonionic blocked polymers, carbomers, polycarbophils, a water soluble starch, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, silica or polyethyleneglycol, e.g., PEG2000, PEG8000 or PEG20000, or a polyethylene oxide (\u201cPEO\u201d), PEO100000 or PEO5000000.","Buccal and sublingual formulations comprising a formula 1 compound are suitable for delivery of the compound to subjects using continuous or intermittent dosing protocols, e.g., any protocol described herein. Excipients disclosed for buccal or sublingual formulations may also be used in formulations suitable for administration by other routes disclosed herein, e.g., oral or parenteral. Other suitable excipients or formulations that may be modified to comprise a formula 1 compound or methods to make, use or characterize them have been described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,727,064, 4,877,774, 4,764,378, 5,135,752, 5,624,677, 5,763,476, 5,958,453, 6,284,262, 6,284,263, 6,264,974, 6,248,357, 6,200,593 and 6,103,257.","Other embodiments include the product obtained by storing invention compositions or formulations, e.g., unit dosage forms, any of embodiments (1)-(14) above, or compositions used to make formulations, at about 4-40\u00b0 C. for at least about 3 days, e.g., storage at ambient temperature for about 1-24 months. Invention formulations will typically be stored in hermetically or induction sealed containers for these time periods. Compositions and formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound will typically be held in closed or sealed containers, particularly when the composition is a formulation for pharmaceutical or veterinary use. The specification and claims disclose exemplary suitable formulations and unit dosage forms for these embodiments.","Immune modulation. As noted elsewhere, the formula 1 compounds, or the biologically active substances produced from these compounds by hydrolysis or metabolism in vivo, have a number of clinical and non-clinical applications. The compounds are generally useful to correct immune dysregulation, e.g., imbalanced immune responses to disease conditions, pathogens or the like, suppression of an innate or acquired immune response(s) and inflammation conditions in vertebrate or mammalian subjects, e.g., as disclosed herein. Thus, while the compounds will generally enhance a deficient immune response in a given clinical condition, they will generally reduce the same immune response when it is too active in a different clinical condition. For example, they can enhance insufficient or suboptimal Th1 immune responses, reduce excess or undesirable Th2 immune responses, reduce excess or undesirable Th1 immune responses or enhance insufficient or suboptimal Th2 immune responses or they can reduce excess or undesirable inflammation or one or more of its symptoms. The compounds will generally also modulate dysregulated Tc1 and Tc2 immune responses (associated with CD8 T cells) in a similar manner, e.g., excessive Tc1 or Tc2 responses will be detectably decreased and deficient or suboptimal Tc1 or Tc2 responses will generally be detectably enhanced.","In modulating one or more activities of Th1, Th2, Tc1 or Tc2 cells or their function(s), the formula 1 compounds will typically detectably modulate one, two, three or more factors, e.g., immune cell subsets or populations, cytokines, interleukins, surface antigens such as a CD molecule(s) and\/or their receptors that affect the development, migration, numbers or biological function(s) of such cells. When a Th1 or Tc1 cell or population is affected, the formula 1 compounds will typically increase or decrease the synthesis or level of one, two or more of an associated effector factor, e.g., IFN\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, T-bet, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 or a cell surface molecule, e.g., as disclosed herein or in the cited references, that is associated with or needed for normal, optimal or enhanced Th1 or Tc1 cells or cell function. Such molecules are generally associated with development or enhancement of Th1 or Tc1 cells or their biological function(s). When a Th2 or Tc2 cell or population is affected, the formula 1 compounds will typically increase or decrease the synthesis or level of one, two or more of an associated effector factor, e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, GATA-3, COX-2 or a cell surface molecule, e.g., as disclosed herein or in the cited references, that is associated with or needed for normal, optimal or enhanced Th2 or Tc2 cells or cell function(s). Such molecules are generally associated with development or enhancement of Th2 or Tc2 cells or their biological function(s).","Similarly, when a subject has or is subject to developing an unwanted or excessive inflammation, the formula 1 compounds will generally detectably modulate one or more relevant effector factors for inflammation, e.g., a decrease of one, two, three or more of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, \u03b3IFN, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and COX-2, or an increase of one or more suppressor factors or antagonists of inflammation. Such modulation can comprise increases or decreases of at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 500%, 1000%, 5000% or within a range between any two of these values, e.g., between about 5-95%, about 10-90%, about 5-60% or about 40-95%. In general, such changes leads to a detectable amelioration of an inflammation-associated disease, condition, symptom or to the detectable slowing of the progression thereof or to a detectably reduced incidence or severity of or susceptibility to developing an unwanted inflammatory response.","In conditions where an unwanted or excessive Th1, Tc1, Th2 or Tc2 response is associated with or causes a disease(s), disease(s) progression, disease(s) state maintenance, condition(s) or symptom(s), the formula 1 compounds will generally decrease the level or one or more biological activity of one, two or more of their respective associated effector molecules. In conditions where a deficient or suboptimal Th1, Tc1, Th2 or Tc2 response is associated with or causes a disease(s), disease(s) progression, disease(s) state maintenance, condition(s) or symptom(s), the formula 1 compounds will generally increase the level or one or more biological activity of one, two, three or more of their respective associated effector molecules. Such changes in the level or biological activity(ies) the associated effector molecules is generally detectable using standard methods and is typically an increase (when a response is insufficient) or a decrease (when a response is in excess) of at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or within a range between any two of these values, e.g., between about 5-95%, about 10-90%, about 5-60% or about 40-95%. In general, such changes leads to a detectable amelioration of a disease, condition, symptom or to the detectable slowing of the progression thereof or to a detectably reduced incidence or severity of or susceptibility to developing a disease(s) or the occurrence of a symptom(s) for a at least a portion of subjects that are treated with a formula 1 compound, e.g., at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60% or 80% of treated subjects. The formula 1 compounds may facilitate the clinical cure of a disease(s), prolong remission of a disease(s) or eliminate or ameliorate a clinically detectable symptom(s).","The formula 1 compound will generally also affect the function of other immune cell subsets in a similar manner. Thus, when an insufficient macrophage, dendritic cell or neutrophil response is associated with the establishment, maintenance or progression of a disease, symptom or a condition, the formula 1 compounds will generally enhance of the level or a biological activity(ies) of one or more effector molecule associated with or needed for an optimal or more normal response or immune function that is mediated by the macrophages, dendritic cells or neutrophils. Similarly, when the subject suffers from a excessive or pathological activity associated with macrophages, dendritic cells or neutrophils, which is associated with the establishment, maintenance or progression of a disease, symptom or a condition, the formula 1 compounds will generally detectably reduce the level or a biological activity(ies) of one or more effector molecule associated with or needed for an optimal or more normal response or immune function that is mediated by the macrophages, dendritic cells or neutrophils. Such effector molecules are as described herein or in the cited references.","As used herein, reference to Th1 or Th2 immune responses means such responses as observed in mammals generally and not as observed in the murine system, from which the Th1 and Th2 terminology originated. Thus, in humans, Th1 cells are CD4+T lymphocytes and they usually preferentially display chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5, while Th2 cells are CD4+T lymphocytes and usually preferentially express the CCR4, CCR8 and\/or CXCR4 chemokine receptor molecule(s) and generally a smaller amount of CCR3, see, e.g., U. Syrbe et al., 1999 21:263-285, S. Sebastiani et al., 2001 166:996-1002. Tc1 and Tc2 immune responses are mediated by CD8 lymphocytes and means to identify these cells and their associated lymphokines, cell specific antigens and biological activities have been described, see, e.g., M. B. Faries et al., 2001 98:2489-2497, W. L. Chan et al., 2001 167:1238-1244, C. Prezzi et al., 2001 31:894-906, H. Ochi et al., 2001 119:297-305, D. H. Fowler and R. E. Gress, 2000 38:221-234.","The formula 1 compounds are useful in reestablishing normal immune function in various immune dysregulation or immune suppression conditions. For example, they are useful to treat, slow progression of or to ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with one or more of an autoimmune condition(s), a inflammation condition(s), an infection(s), a cancer(s), a precancer(s), a chemotherapy(ies), radiation therapy, a burn(s), a trauma(s), a surgery(ies), a pulmonary condition, a cardiovascular disease(s) and a neurological or neurodegenerative disease(s). Without being limited to any theory, the formula 1 compounds are believed to act through several mechanisms, including by directly or indirectly modulating steroid receptor activity or by affecting or modulating other biological targets such as transcription factors, steroid binding proteins or enzymes in at least some of the diseases, conditions or symptoms disclosed herein.","The formula 1 compounds are useful to modulate delayed-type hypersensitivity (\u201cDTH\u201d) responses and anergic conditions in subjects having to subject to developing abnormal DHT responses or anergy. Means to measure such responses and conditions are known and can be used to characterize the effects of the formula 1 compounds on these responses and conditions. See, e.g., A. E. Brown, et al., 83:633-639 2000, R. A. Smith et al., 27:384-390 2000, N. M. Ampel, 37:245-250 1999. The compounds will generally detectably enhance or restore DTH in immune suppression conditions. They will also generally detectably reduce or eliminate anergy in subjects having significantly reduced or no immune response to, e.g., specific antigens or pathogens.","The invention provides a method to detectably enhance an antigen specific immune response, cell mediated immune response or a delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response in a subject having impaired or negligible antigen specific immune response, cell mediated immune response or delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response, comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound. The antigen specific immune response, cell-mediated immune response or delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response can be enhanced at least about 25%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 75% or at least about 90%. Some of the subjects may have an antigen specific immune response, cell mediated immune response or a delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response that is impaired or negligible, e.g., about 50% or less or about 30% or less or about 10% or less of the response that an otherwise normal subject would be expected to have. Such subjects may not detectably respond to at least 1 antigen out of 2, 3, 4 or 5 antigens that a normal subject would respond to. In some embodiments, the subject is an HIV-infected human having a CD4+T cell count of about 0-150 cells\/mmor about 2-100 cells\/mmand\/or wherein the antigen specific immune response, cell mediated immune response or delayed-type hypersensitivity immune response is an enhanced response to a viral, bacterial, parasite or fungal antigen such as an HIV, HCV, HBV or CMV antigen such as a viral or HIV core antigen or HIV p24 antigen or a viral or HIV envelope antigen, a antigen, a viral, bacterial, parasite or fungal antigen essentially as described herein or to phytohemagglutinin. The responses to treatment with a formula 1 compound may be quantitated by, e.g., mixed lymphocyte reaction, ELIspot analysis or flow cytometric analysis of, e.g., circulating blood cells such as CD4 or CD8 T cells or for levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-2, TNF\u03b1 or IFN\u03b3) in such cells. Such analyses have been described, e.g., V. P. Badovinac and J. T. Hardy, 2000, 238:107-117, N. Favre et al., 1997, 204:57-66, E. Hagiwara et al., 1995, 7:815-822, N. W. Lukacs et al., 1993, 82:3668-3674, M. Umemoto et al., 1998, 112:459-463, A. Fietta et al., 1994, 40:237-245, C. H. Orteu et al., 1998, 161:1619-1629.","Clinical indications that have an association with or have a symptom(s) that is consistent or associated with an excessive or unwanted Th2 immune response include, e.g., fatigue, pain, fever or an increased incidence of infection, schizophrenia, acute myelitis, tumor progression, progressive systemic sclerosis, Omenn's syndrome, atopic disease, atopy, allergen hypersensitivity, atopic asthma, atopic dermatitis, burns, trauma (e.g., bone fracture, hemorrhage, surgery), immune responses to xenotransplantation, chronic periodontitis, SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus), discoid lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis, myasthenia gravis, Graves disease, mite-associated ulcerative dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Excessive Th2 immune responses are also associated with an unwanted symptom or pathology, e.g., fatigue, pain, fever or an increased incidence of infection, that is associated with aging, allergy and inflammation conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in cystic fibrosis patients, allergic respiratory disease, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, subepithelial fibrosis in airway hyperresponsiveness, chronic sinusitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, fibrosing alveolitis (lung fibrosis). This common underlying immune component is at least part of the pathology or symptoms of all of these conditions. This allows a formula 1 compound to be effectively used to prevent or treat the condition or to treat or ameliorate one or more symptoms that are associated with these conditions. Thus, in some embodiments, an unwanted or excessive Th2 response is present and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with this condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound according to the methods described herein, e.g., formula 1 compound is administered using a formulation and a route of administration essentially as described herein on an intermittent or a daily basis.","Typically, unwanted Th2 immune responses are associated with, or caused by, increased expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins such as one, two, three or more of cortisol, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13. Administration of a formula 1 compound will generally reduce the expression of one or more of the Th2-associated cytokines or interleukins. At the same time, the compounds generally enhance the expression of one or more cytokines or interleukins associated with Th1 immune responses. Because of their capacity to modulate or to balance Th1 and Th2 immune responses, the compounds are useful for a variety of clinical conditions, e.g., infection, immunosuppression or cancer, where an enhanced Th1 immune response is desired. Effects of the formula 1 compounds in treating, preventing or slowing the progression of the clinical conditions described herein can include one or more of (1) enhancing the Th1 character of a subject's immune response or immune status, (2) increasing the intensity of a Th1 or a Th2 immune response or both and (3) decreasing inflammation or a symptom thereof.","Exemplary conditions where an immune imbalance or an excessive Th1 immune response is involved include autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease (regional enteritis), ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, reactive arthritis, acute allograft rejection, sarcoidosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, associated peptic ulcer, graft versus host disease and Hashimotos' thyroiditis. Because these conditions are associated with a similar type immune dysfunction, a formula 1 compound can be effectively used to prevent or treat these conditions or to treat or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated therewith. Thus, in some embodiments, an unwanted or excessive Th1 response is present and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with this condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound according to the methods described herein, e.g., formula 1 compound is administered using a formulation and a route of administration essentially as described herein on an intermittent or a daily basis. In other embodiments, an deficient Th1 response is enhanced, which is optionally observed as a detectable increase in one or more of IFN\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12 or IL-18 in Th1 cells or in accessory cells such as a dendritic cell or macrophage. In all of the conditions where an insufficient or excess Th1, Th2, Tc1 or Tc2 response is present, amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with the condition is accomplished by administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound according to the methods described herein.","Aspects of the invention include the use or administration of compositions or formulations that comprise a carrier and an amount of at least one formula 1 compound effective to detectably modulate an immune parameter. For example, to enhance the relative proportion of a desired immune cell subset, e.g., CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, LAK cells, neutrophils, granulocytes, basophils, eosinophils or dendritic cells, or to modulate (detectably increase or decrease) one or more functions of immune cell subsets. The formula 1 compounds can modulate the expression of CD molecules or alter the proportion of cell subsets, e.g., CD4 or CD8 T cells, or their relative numbers in a subject's blood or tissues. CD and related molecules participate in the function of various immune cell subsets and can be useful as markers for immune function in vivo. In some aspects, the formula 1 compounds activate immune cells which generally alters (increases or decreases) expression of, or changes the numbers of cells that express one or more of, CD4, CD6, CD8, CD25, CD27, CD28, CD30, CD36, CD38, CD39, CD43, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62L, CD69, CD71, CD90 or HLA-DR molecules. Often, the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased, e.g., CD25, CD16 or CD69. Typically, such increases are observed as an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules or white blood cells CXCR3, CCR5, CCR4, CCR8 and\/or CXCR4. In some cases the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered.","Expression of one or more adhesion molecules CD2, CD5, CD8, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD29, CD31, CD36, CD44, CD49a, CD49b, CD49c, CD49d, CD49e, CD49f, CD50, CD54, CD58, CD103 or CD104 are also detectably modulated after administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject. Often, the numbers of cells that express these molecules are increased, e.g., CD5 or CD56. The adhesion molecules function in various aspects of immune responses, such as binding to class I MHC molecules, transducing signals between cells or binding to molecules in the extracellular matrix associated with endothelial or other cell types. Administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject also affects the numbers of certain immune cell subsets, e.g., NK cells (e.g., CD8, CD56 or CD8, CD56) or lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK). Increased circulating NK or LAK cells are typically observed, which is reflected in increased numbers of cells that express one or more of CD16, CD38, CD56, CD57 or CD94. Also, increased numbers of circulating dendritic cell precursors are observed, as shown by increases in cells that express one or more of CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD106 or CD123. Although one can observe an increased proportion of circulating white blood cells that express one or more of these molecules, in some instances the number of such molecules per cell is detectably altered. Both the cell numbers and the density of CD molecule per cell can also be detectably modulated. Modulation of immune cell subsets typically occurs on intermittent dosing of a formula 1 compound, but will arise from any suitable dosing regimen, e.g., as described herein.","Expression of one or more homing or other receptors or receptor subunits such as CD62L, CLA-1, LFA1, CD44, ICAM, VCAM or ECAM may also be detectably affected after administration of the formula 1 compounds to a subject. The numbers of cells that express these molecules, or the relative amounts per cell of, e.g., CD44 or CD62L, may be increased where a desired immune response is desired, e.g., migration of T cells to mucosal tissues or exposure of na\u00efve T cells to antigen in lymph nodes. Alternatively, numbers of cells that express these molecules, or the relative amounts per cell of, e.g., CLA-1, may be decreased where inhibition of an undesired immune response, such as an inflammatory response is desired. The subject's response to such enhanced expression includes migration of cells such as movement of na\u00efve T cells to peripheral lymph nodes in response to modulation of CD62L or other homing receptor expression. Thus, the formula 1 compounds can also facilitate migration of various immune cell types, e.g., dendritic cells, NK cells, LAK cells, macrophages or lymphocytes, from one location to another within a subject. For example, the compounds can enhance dendritic cell or lymphocyte migration from areas such as the skin tissues to the gut associated lymphoid tissue (\u201cGALT\u201d), lymph nodes or spleen. Such migration may facilitate the function of those cell types by increasing their transit to tissues where their effector functions, e.g., antigen presentation by dendritic cells, normally occur. The migration period is often relatively transient (e.g., observable over about 1-7 days) or occasionally longer (e.g., occurring for about 8-40 days), depending on the dosing regimen and other factors. This migration can be observed by standard methods, e.g., by cell staining, by PCR analyses or by determining the presence of a given cell type in circulation or determining a decrease in the number circulating cells. A decrease would generally reflect sequestration of an immune cell population(s) in a tissue(s) where the immune cell normally exercises its effector functions.","Thus, in some embodiments, the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD11C cells from tissue such as skin or lung through the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT is seen as a transient increase in the level of circulating CD11C cells in response to exposure of the subject's tissues to a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound. Thus, the level of CD11C cells in the blood will generally detectably increase, e.g., a statistically significant increase, plateau and then decrease as migration of the cells to immune tissue subsides. In these embodiments, the proportion of the cells of the affected immune cell subset is typically relatively low in most physiological immune states, e.g., normal or abnormal immune conditions, compared to the total white blood cell population in circulation. In other embodiments, the migration of one or more immune cell subsets such as CD123 cells from the circulation to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT results in a decrease. In these embodiments, the decrease in the numbers of circulating immune cells reflects the migration of the immune cells from the blood to immune tissue such as lymph nodes or GALT. Such a decrease may be transient and followed by recovery of the affected immune cell subset(s) over about 2 to 24 weeks. In conducting these embodiments, administration of the formula 1 compound to the subject is accomplished using the formulations or the methods as described herein.","Thus, an aspect of the invention is a method to enhance the migration of one or more immune cell types in a subject from one location (e.g., bone marrow, circulating blood or a tissue such as the skin, liver, central nervous system or lung) to another (e.g., to the blood or to a lymphoid tissue such as a lymph node, spleen or a mucosal tissue such as GALT) by administration to a subject as described herein of an effective amount of a formula 1 compound essentially as described by any of the methods disclosed herein. A related aspect is the monitoring, e.g., by suitable blood counts or tissue biopsy, of the subject's response to determine the timing and extent of such immune cell migration.","Other CD molecules that are modulated by the presence of the formula 1 compounds in a subject include cytokine receptor molecules such as one or more of CD115, CDW116, CD117, CD118, CDW119, CD120a, CD120b, CD121a, CD121b, CD122, CD123, CD124, CD125 CD126, CDW127, CDW128 or CDW130. Often, the numbers of receptor molecules per cell will be modulated. For example, receptors for cytokines that mediate or facilitate Th1 immune responses or innate immune responses (e.g., one or more of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, \u03b3IFN or \u03b1-interferon) will typically increase in or on cells that mediate Th1 or innate immune responses. Modulation of these molecules may be by direct interactions with a receptor(s) in the cell that expresses the cytokine receptor or indirectly by modulation of cytokine synthesis in the affected cells or in other cells, typically immune cells that may interact with the cells whose receptor synthesis is being modulated. Thus, autocrine or paracrine mechanisms may underlie some of the effects associated with administration of a formula 1 compound(s) such as altered cytokine profiles in immune cells or altered immune cell populations. Endocrine cytokine mechanisms may also contribute to desired immune responses.","Treatment of a subject with a formula 1 compound can result in a change of at least about 20-80% or about 25-50% above or below (e.g., at least 30% or at least 40% above or below) the control or basal level of affected immune cell subsets. For example, increases of more than about 30% in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells, e.g., CD8, CD69, CD25 T cells, CD8, CD69, CD25 T cells or CD8+, CD69, CD25 T cells, can occur by 7 days after a single dose of a formula 1 compound to a subject. Such increases may be greater than 50%, 60% or 100% in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells in individual subjects. Typically such increases are about in the total numbers of activated CD8 T cells or subsets of activated CD8 T cells averages about 30-40%, with individual subjects experiencing increases over 100% in the numbers of activated CD8 T cells per unit blood volume compared to the basal level.","Administration of the formula 1 compounds can affect other immune cell subsets. For example, the concentration of circulating CD4, CD69, CD25 (Th1 helper cells) and CD8, CD16, CD38 LAK cells or CD8, CD16, CD38 LAK cells typically increases during or after the course of dosing a subject with a formula 1 compound. Also, CD8, CD16, CD38 and CD8, CD16, CD38 (ADCC effector cells) and low side scatter Lin, DR, CD123 (dendritic precursors) or low side scatter Lin, DR, CD11c (dendritic cells or precursors) may show modest to significant increases.","In subjects that are immunosuppressed, e.g., from certain infections (e.g., viral (HIV, HCV), bacterial infection or parasite infection) or from chemotherapy (e.g., an antiviral therapy, a cancer chemotherapy or a radiation therapy), administration of the formula 1 compounds to the subject results in a favorable shift in the balance of Th1 or Th2 responses the subject can mount in the face of immunosuppression. When Th1 responses are suboptimal or insufficient, treatment with a formula 1 compound results in enhancement of Th1 responses or a reduction in Th2 responses. Conversely, when Th2 responses are suboptimal or insufficient, treatment with a formula 1 compound results in enhancement of Th2 responses, which may occur with a concomitant modulation (increase or decrease) in Th1 responses. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used to shift the nature of a subject's immune response to result in a more balanced immune response from immunosuppression. Alternatively, the compounds can selectively suppress inappropriate or unwanted immune responses. Enhanced Th1 responses appears to be at least partly due to one or more of (i) a reduction in biological restraints, e.g., high levels of IL-4 or IL-10, on Th1 functions by preexisting primed Th1 effector cells, (ii) enhanced differentiation of Th0 cells to Th1 cells or enhanced responses mediated by Th1 cells, (iii) enhanced function of accessory cell function, e.g., antigen presentation by dendritic cells, dendritic precursor or progenitor cells or by macrophages or their precursors or progenitors, (iv) enhanced proliferation and differentiation of Th1 precursor or progenitor cells, (v) enhanced IL-12 expression in dendritic cells or their precursors, which results in enhanced differentiation of Th1 cells from Th0 precursors, (vi) enhanced expression or activity of factors associated with Th1 functions, e.g., IL-2, gamma interferon (\u03b3IFN or IFN\u03b3), IL-18 or lymphotoxin.","An aspect of the invention methods is an alteration in the expression of IL-4 or IL-10 that occurs after administration of a formula 1 compound, e.g., BrEA, to a subject. A consistent observation is that extracellular IL-4 or IL-10 levels rapidly decrease to levels that are undetectable by ELISA. Intracellular IL-10 levels are reduced to levels that are near or below the limits of detection by flow cytometry. The administration of a formula 1 compound to a subject thus provides a means to inhibit either or both of these interleukins. Such inhibition may be associated with enhancement of Th1 immune responses relative to Th2 or Th0 responses, e.g., in subjects where Th1 responses are suppressed (e.g., from viral, bacterial or parasite infection (HIV, HCV, etc) or chemotherapy) or are otherwise suboptimal. In many subjects, levels of either IL-4 or IL-10, usually IL-10, before dosing with a formula 1 compound is low or undetectable. In these subjects, dosing with the formula 1 compound results in a rapid drop in the interleukin that is detectable, usually IL-4.","Clinical conditions are described in more detail below where the formula 1 compounds are useful for treating, preventing, slowing the progression of, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with the described conditions. In any these conditions, any formula 1 compound disclosed herein can be used according to one or more of the dosing methods that are disclosed herein. For these conditions, dosages for the formula 1 compounds, formulations and routes of administration are as described herein. Additional information regarding these and other clinical conditions or symptoms that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated with the formula 1 compounds are found at e.g., 17edition, M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors, 1999, Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, N.J., ISBN 0911910-10-7, or in other references cited herein.","Responses to treatment of a subject having a condition disclosed herein with a formula 1 compound is optionally monitored by observing changes in one or more immune or other appropriate clinical parameters, e.g., as described herein or in D. S. Jacobs et al., editors, 4edition, pages 11-686, Lexi-Comp Inc., Hudson, Ohio, ISBN 0-916589-36-6, or in any of the references cited herein, or by monitoring the progression or severity of the underlying condition according to known methods, e.g., J. B. Peter, editor, 5Edition, pages 1-309, 1998, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif., ISBN 1-889342-13-0.","Infection treatments. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered to a subject who has a pathogen infection, such as a viral, bacterial, fungal, yeast, intracellular parasite or extracellular parasite infection. The formula 1 compounds can be considered for use in a broad scope of infections (see, e.g., J. B. Peter, editor, 5edition, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, 1998, pages 1-271), since the compounds generally enhance Th1 immune responses and\/or reduce Th2 immune responses and\/or reduce inflammation or its symptoms. Difficulty in treating many infections, e.g., progressive toxoplasmic encephalitis, malaria, tuberculosis, Leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis, often appear to be associated with one or more of an unwanted Th2 immune responses, a suboptimal Th1 response or the development of resistance of the infectious agent to antimicrobial agents. For example, in disseminated or diffuse tuberculosis, a reduced Th2 response would be desirable to allow a patient to slow progression of the disease or to clear infected cells more efficiently. In treating chloroquine resistant or sensitive malaria, the formula 1 compounds have essentially the same activity.","Exemplary viral infections that the formula 1 compounds can be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate include infections by one or more DNA or RNA viruses, or a symptom(s) associated with such infection(s), such as a genogroup, Glade, serotype, serotype subtypes, isolate, strain, subtype or so forth of influenza viruses (e.g., a human influenza A virus, a human influenza B virus, an avian (e.g., chicken, duck, goose) influenza virus, a swine influenza virus or a recombinant avian-swine influenza virus), respiratory syncytial viruses, Rotaviruses, Hantaviruses, animal or human Papillomaviruses (e.g., HPV-16, HPV-18), Poxviruses, Poliovirus, rabies viruses, human and animal Retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2, LAV, human T-cell leukemia virus I (\u201cHTLV I\u201d), HTLV II, HTLV III, SIV, SHIV, FIV, FeLV), Togaviruses and Flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, Dengue viruses), Herpesviruses (e.g., CMV, EBV, Varicella Zoster Virus, Herpes simplex virus 1 (\u201cHSV-1\u201d), Herpes simplex virus 2 (\u201cHSV-2\u201d), human Herpesvirus 6 (\u201cHHV-6\u201d), human Herpesvirus 8 (\u201cHHV-8\u201d)), measles viruses, mumps viruses, rubella virus, Hepadnaviruses or hepatitis viruses, Adenoviruses, Retroviruses, Togaviruses, Alphaviruses, Arboviruses, Coronaviruses, Flaviviruses, Filoviruses, Rhinoviruses, Picornaviruses, Papovaviruses, Bunyaviruses, Picornaviruses, Poxviruses and\/or Pestiviruses.","Specific viruses, including their genogroups, clades, isolates, serotypes, serotype subtypes, strains and so forth, that may establish a virus infection susceptible to the treatment methods disclosed herein include one or more of human hepatitis C virus (\u201cHCV\u201d), human hepatitis B virus (\u201cHBV\u201d), human hepatitis A virus (\u201cHAV\u201d), human hepatitis delta virus, human hepatitis E virus, duck hepatitis virus, woodchuck hepatitis virus, one or more of human herpesviruses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7 or 8, one or more of human papilloma viruses 1-60, e.g., HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, HPV 18, HPV 31, HPV 45, animal papilloma viruses, poliovirus 1, poliovirus 2, poliovirus 3, one or more of Dengue virus types 1, 2, 3 or 4, one or more of foot-and-mouth disease virus 1-7, including serotypes 0, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and ASIA 1, one or more of coxsackievirus A1-A22, A24, and B1-B6, one or more of human echovirus 1-9, 11-27 and 29-34, one or more of human enterovirus 68-71, one or more of adenovirus 1-49, one or more of Parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 or 4, Human respiratory coronaviruses 229E and OC43, one or more of Human rotaviruses, BK virus, Bunyamwera virus, California Encephalitis Virus, Central European Encephalitis Virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, Colorado tick fever virus, Cowpox virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Argentine hemorrhagic fever virus, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever virus, Lacrosse virus, Hantaan virus, JC virus, Lassa virus, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Kyasanur forest virus, Marburg virus, Measles virus, Mokola virus, Monkeypox virus, Molluscum contagiosum virus, Mumps virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, Norwalk virus, O'nyong-nyong virus, Omsk hemmorhagic virus, Orf virus, Rabies virus, RA-1 virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Yellow Fever Virus, West Nile virus, Variola (smallpox) virus, cowpox virus, Vaccinia virus, Ebola virus, Respiratory syncytial virus, human cytomegalovirus, Rhinoviruses 1-113, Rift Valley fever virus, Ros river virus, Rubella virus, Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus, Sandfly fever viruses, St. Louis encephalitis virus, SV40 virus, vaccinia virus, Varicella-zoster virus, Vesicular stomatitis viruses and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus.

The formulation is delivered intravenously in a single daily dose or two subdoses per day. The patients are dosed with 1 to 10 mg\/kg\/day for 4 to 10 days, followed by no dosing for 5 to 30 days, followed by dosing again with the cyclodextrin formulation for 4 to 10 days. The dosing regimen is repeated one, two or more times. Clinical markers for HCV infection are followed during treatment, e.g., viral nucleic acid in the blood or plasma, liver enzyme levels in the blood or plasma (e.g., AST\/SGOT, ALT\/SGPT, alkaline phosphatase). For these patients, an anti-HCV treatment(s), e.g., \u03b3IFN, \u03b1IFN, a retroviral protease inhibitor, a nucleoside analog, and\/or ribavirin, is optionally started or continued according to the recommendations of the patient's doctor and with the patient's informed approval. In some of these embodiments, a formula 1 compound(s) is administered daily continuously as a component in an oral or parenteral composition or formulation, e.g., for a formula 1 compound(s) that is a new compound per se. BrEA is optionally also administered systemically using, e.g., a parenteral formulation to deliver 0.1-5 mg\/kg\/day either daily or every other day for about 1 to 4 months, or an oral formulation to deliver about 0.5-40 mg\/kg\/day either daily or every other day for about 1 to 4 months.","In related embodiments, the formula 1 compounds are used to treat, prevent or ameliorate Arbovirus infections, Arenavirus infections, Hantavirus infections and hemorrhagic fever virus infections, or a symptom(s) or complication(s) thereof, in subjects such as humans. In treating such infections, the formula 1 compound is administered at a dosage disclosed herein, e.g., about 0.5-4 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for about 5-14 consecutive days. An oral dosage would be about 10-25 mg\/kg\/day of a formula 1 compound for about 5-14 consecutive days. Typically dosing with the formula 1 compound will begin at the time that (or shortly thereafter, e.g., within about 1-12 hours) the infection is suspected or is diagnosed. The patient is optionally monitored and the amelioration of one or more symptoms or a slowed disease progression is observed. For example, arbovirus encephalitis, which is typically a serious brain infection, can be treated, prevented or ameliorated. Several types of viral encephalitis are transmitted by insect bites, e.g., western equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and California encephalitis. In these infections the formula 1 compounds can treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms including fever, headache, drowsiness, vomiting, stiff neck, mental confusion, muscle trembling, convulsions, and coma. Hemorrhagic fevers in humans are associated with infection by Hantaviruses and Filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg viruses, which can cause infections that include Korean, Bolivian and Argentinean hemorrhagic fevers, Congo fever and Lassa fever. The formula 1 compounds can be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of these infections, e.g., a hemorrhagic fever virus infection, in a subject such as a human. Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections can be accompanied by mucous membrane bleeding, fever, diarrhea, bleeding, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, pain, e.g., chest pain, coughing, vomiting, stupor, coma or loss of consciousness and failure of multiple organs. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compounds can function by one or more mechanisms, including enhancing innate immune responses, modulating, e.g., detectably increase or decrease, the level or activity of one or more of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, gro-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IP-10, GM-CSF, RANTES or their isotypes or homologs or cortisol. The compounds can also detectably increase the synthesis or level of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IgG1 and\/or IgG3 in these conditions.","Treatment of a subject such as a human who is anticipated to potentially come in contact with Arbovirus, Arenavirus, Hantavirus or a hemorrhagic fever virus is accomplished by administering a formula 1 compound to the subject by, e.g., daily or intermittent dosing, beginning at about 1-14 days before an anticipated potential exposure. The daily doses and routes of administration are essentially as described herein, e.g., for an adult human, about 0.5-4 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 consecutive days or on alternate days over a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 day period in advance of a potential exposure.","Hantavirus infection is a viral disease that rodents can transmit to humans and the infection is associated with serious lung or kidney infection. Symptoms of Hantavirus infection of the lungs include one or more of fever, muscle pain, myalgia, headache, abdominal pain, conjunctival bleeding, diarrhea, vomiting, coughing, shortness of breath or low blood pressure (shock). Hantavirus kidney infection may be mild or severe and is associated with fever, headache, backache, abdominal pain, small bruise-like patches on the whites of the eyes, abdominal rash, impaired kidney function, nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue and intracranial bleeding.","The formula 1 compounds can also be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate infections caused by members of the Poxyiridae family, e.g., members of the Orthopoxvirus genus in subjects such as mammals or humans. The compounds can be used to treat, ameliorate or prevent one or more symptoms associated with Orthopoxvirus infections. For example, the variola or smallpox virus causes a serious infection with symptoms that include fever, chills, backache, headache, skin lesions and death. In treating Orthopoxvirus infections, the formula 1 compound is administered at a dosage disclosed herein, e.g., about 0.5-4 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, for about 5-14 consecutive days. Typically dosing with the formula 1 compound will begin at the time that (or shortly thereafter, e.g., within about 1-12 hours) the infection is suspected or is diagnosed. In treating Orthopoxvirus infections such as a variola infection, the formula 1 compounds can result in enhanced efficacy of host factors such as CC cytokines or interferons such as IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3. The subject may also be optionally treated with another agent such as IFN-\u03b3, a nucleoside analog or a nucleotide analog such as one described herein or in the cited references.","Treatment of a subject such as a human who is anticipated to potentially come in contact with an Orthopoxvirus such as the variola virus or the vaccinia virus is accomplished by administering a formula 1 compound to the subject by, e.g., daily or intermittent dosing, beginning at about 1-14 days before an anticipated potential exposure. The daily doses and routes of administration are essentially as described herein, e.g., for an adult human, about 0.1-10 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 consecutive days or on alternate days over a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 day period in advance of a potential exposure.","In other embodiments, formula 1 compound(s) are administered to a subject or delivered to the tissues of a subject who has a pathogen infection (or is susceptible to an infection) such as one caused by or associated with a parasite, bacterium, fungus or yeast, to slow the progression of infection, interfere with replication or development of the infectious agent or to ameliorate one or more of the associated symptoms, e.g., weight loss, anemia, fever, pain, fatigue, inflammation, immune dysfunction, secondary infections, skin lesions or ulcers or mood changes such as depression. Parasites include malaria parasites, sleeping sickness parasites and parasites associated with gastrointestinal infections.","Exemplary parasite, fungi, yeast and bacterial infections that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated in subjects such as mammals or humans, include ones caused by or associated with species, groups, genotypes, serotypes, strains or isolates of gastrointestinal helminths, microsporidia, , cryptococci, cryptosporidia (), sp.

For any of these infections, a subject who has the infection, or is susceptible of developing the infection, e.g., by suspected exposure to an infectious agent, is treated by administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound to the subject. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compounds can function by one or more mechanisms, including enhancing innate immune responses, modulating, e.g., detectably increase or decrease, the level or activity of one or more of the transcription factors, enzymes or other biomolecules described herein, e.g., IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, gro-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, IP-10, GM-CSF, RANTES or their isotypes or homologs or cortisol. For example, molecules such as IL1\u03b1, TNF\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1 or MCP-1 are generally decreased in infections where there is an overexpression of one or more of these molecules. Generally a decrease of one or more of these molecules occurs.","Fungal infections that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated thus include invasive aspergilliosis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspergilloma and chronic necrotizing aspergillosis. Bacterial infections that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated thus include infections by intracellular or extracellular gram positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, acid fast bacteria or by Mycoplasma. Other pathogens that are amenable to treatments according to the present invention are as described. See, e.g., J. B. Peter, editor, 5Edition, pages 1-309, 1998, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif., ISBN 1-889342-13-0.","In an exemplary embodiment, a subject such as a human that is known or suspected of having been exposed to spores or cells is treated with a formula 1 compound. The subject may have overt symptoms of either cutaneous or pulmonary infection. The formula 1 compound is administered at a dosage disclosed herein, e.g., about 0.05-10 mg\/kg\/day or about 0.1-5 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection, for about 5-14 consecutive days. An oral dosage would be about 10-25 mg\/kg\/day of a formula 1 compound for about 5-14 consecutive days. Dosing with the formula 1 compound will typically begin at about the time that the infection is suspected or is diagnosed, or shortly thereafter, e.g., within about 1-12 hours.","During or after treatment, the patient is optionally monitored and the amelioration of one or more symptoms or a slowed disease progression is observed. Such symptoms can include one or more of a red-brown bump with swelling at the edges, blisters, formation of a black scab or eschar at the site of skin infection, edema, respiratory difficulty and swelling of regional or local lymph nodes. Other symptoms of cutaneous anthrax that can be ameliorated include fever, headache, muscle ache, nausea, and vomiting. In treating infections, the formula 1 compounds will typically enhance innate immune responses, enhance humoral immune responses, reduce TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 levels or activity and\/or enhance killing or phagocytosis of pathogen in the infected subject or the subject's immune cells, e.g., monocytes, neutrophils or macrophages.","Treatment of a subject such as a human who is anticipated to potentially come in contact with a pathogen described herein, e.g., spores or vegetative cells, is accomplished by administering a formula 1 compound to the subject by, e.g., daily or intermittent dosing, beginning at about 1-14 days before an anticipated potential exposure. The daily doses and routes of administration are essentially as described herein, e.g., for an adult human, about 0.05-5 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 consecutive days or on alternate days over a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 day period in advance of a potential exposure.","For a pulmonary anthrax infection, amelioration of one or more of fever, bleeding and necrosis of lymph nodes near the lung, local chest infection, shock, coma or death can occur. Infection of the brain and meningoencephalitis may occur and is treated in a similar manner, although an increased dosage can be utilized, e.g., about 20-50 mg\/kg\/day of the formula 1 compound is administered by a parenteral, e.g., intravenous, sublingual or buccal route. In any of these skin, pulmonary or gastrointestinal infections, the subject is also optionally treated using one or more standard antibiotics and routes of administration, e.g., (1) 600,000 U i.m. bid for about 7-10 days of procaine penicillin G, optionally combined with about 500 mg\/day of streptomycin, optionally administered q 8 h i.m., (2) 2 g\/day of tetracycline for 5-10 days for an adult human, (3) oral erythromycin administered at about 250 to 1000 mg\/day in subdoses administered at 12 or 8 hour intervals, (4) intravenous or oral ciprofloxacin for about 5-30 days with daily doses optionally subdivided for administration 2 or 3 times per day, e.g., about 250-500 mg of ciprofloxacin administered twice per day orally for a human adult, (5) doxycycline administered, e.g., at an induction dose of 100 mg twice on the first day and a maintenance dose of 50 mg twice per day for about 7-20 days for a human adult, (6) a fluoroquinoline antibiotic such as levofloxacin, norfloxacin or oxofloxacin is administered according to standard dosing and administration protocols or (7) a corticosteroid for local or systemic inflammation, e.g., of the lung, for a pulmonary anthrax infection, which permits the corticosteroid to exert an antiinflammatory activity while avoiding at least some of the immune suppression generally associated with corticosteroids.","The use of the formula 1 compounds will generally ameliorate the inflammation, sepsis or shock that can occur when antibiotics are administered to subjects having a systemic or pulmonary infection. A potential adverse effect of antibiotic use to treat a systemic or pulmonary infection is serious or potentially lethal inflammation, sepsis and\/or shock that results from release of anthrax lethal toxin or factor or other inflammatory molecules on lysis of the bacteria. Release of bacterial lethal factor from lysed bacterial cells is associated with an intense inflammation, which is at least partially mediated by one or more inflammatory factors such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8 or COX-2. The formula 1 compounds detectably reduce the level and\/or biological effects of such inflammatory factors and can also detectably maintain or facilitate macrophage viability or one or more desired macrophage function(s) at the same time, e.g., phagocytosis, killing of phagocytosed bacterial cells or debris or limiting of reactive oxygen species generation by the macrophages. Similar considerations apply for the use of antibiotics to kill other types of bacteria, e.g., bacteria disclosed herein, that can release pro-inflammatory molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, when an antibiotic kills or lyses bacterial cells.","Similarly, the formula 1 compounds can be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate an infection by one or more gram-negative enteric bacteria. Such bacteria are commonly members of the or genera. For these infections, the formula 1 compound is administered to a subject such as a human at a dosage disclosed herein, e.g., about 0.5-4 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection, for about 5-14 consecutive days. An oral dosage would be about 10-25 mg\/kg\/day of a formula 1 compound for about 5-14 consecutive days. Typically dosing with the formula 1 compound will begin at the time that (or shortly thereafter, e.g., within about 1-12 hours) the infection is suspected or is diagnosed. The patient is optionally monitored and the amelioration of one or more symptoms or a slowed disease progression is observed. The compounds can reduce the adverse effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin that is associated with these organisms. For example, the compounds are therapeutically useful for infection by , which causes plague. Several forms of plague can exist, i.e., bubonic, pneumonic, septicemic, or pestis minor. The compounds ameliorate one or more of the symptoms associated with these infections. For example, in a bubonic plague infection, symptoms typically arise several days after exposure to , and can include a fever of up to 106\u00b0 F., chills, rapid weak heartbeat, low blood pressure, lymph node swelling accompanied by tenderness, restlessness, confusion, uncoordinated movements, liver and spleen swelling. Symptoms associated with pneumonic plague include high fever, chills, rapid heartbeat, severe headache, coughing, blood-tinged sputum and rapid and labored breathing.","Treatment of a subject such as a human who is anticipated to potentially come in contact with cells of a gram negative enteric bacterium is accomplished by administering a formula 1 compound to the subject by, e.g., daily or intermittent dosing, beginning at about 1-14 days before an anticipated potential exposure. The daily doses and routes of administration are essentially as described herein, e.g., for an adult human, about 0.5-4 mg\/kg\/day by buccal delivery or by a parenteral route such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 consecutive days or on alternate days over a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 or 14 day period in advance of a potential exposure.","In infections, the subject is optionally treated using one or more standard antibiotics and routes of administration, e.g., one or more of (1) for septicemic or pneumonic infection, streptomycin at 30 mg\/kg\/day is administered IM in 4 divided doses for about 7-10 days for an adult human, (2) tetracycline at 30 mg\/kg\/day is administered IV in 4 divided doses for about 7-10 days for an adult human or (3) gentamycin or chloramphenicol according to standard doses and dosing routes.","In a subject having a infection, symptoms typically arise several days after exposure to the pathogen, and can include a fever, chills, diarrhea, which can be serious or fatal if untreated, oliguria, muscle cramps and hypovolemia. In infections, the subject is treated with a formula 1 compound and optionally with one or more standard therapies, e.g., one or more of (1) intravenous and\/or oral replacement of water, glucose and electrolytes, (2) tetracycline for about 3-4 days at 500-1000 mg\/day in 2, 3 or 4 optionally subdivided doses for adult humans, (3) doxycycline at 300 mg\/day for several days, (4) erythromycin, furazolidone norfloxacin, trimethoprim and\/or sulfamethoxazole, according to standard dosages and routes of administration, e.g., oral or parenteral.","In any of these bacterial infections, the subject is optionally treated with a suitable or appropriate antibacterial agent(s). Such agents include one, two or more antibacterial agents selected from an aminoglycoside, an amphenicol, an ansamycin, a \u03b2-lactam, a lincosamide, a macrolide, a peptide, a tetracycline, a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine, a nitrofuran, a quinolone, a sulfonamide, a sulfone, cycloserine, mupirocin and tuberin, wherein the aminoglycoside optionally is dihdrostreptomycin, fortimicin(s), gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, neomycin undecylenate, spectinomycin, streptomycin, streptonicozid or tobramycin; the amphenicol optionally is azidamfenicol, chloramphenicol, chloramphenicol palmitate, chloramphenicol pantothenate, florfenicol or thiamphenicol; the ansamycin optionally is rifamide, rifampin or rifamycin; the \u03b2-lactam optionally is imipenem, cefactor, cefadroxil, cefamandole, cefatrizine, cefazedone, cefazolin, cefixime, ceftibuten, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime, cefuzonam, cephacetrile sodium, cephalexin, cephaloglycin, cephaloridie, cephalosporin, cephalothin, cephapirin sodium, amidinocillin, amdinocillin pivoxil, amoxicillin, apalcillin, carbenicillin, carfecillin sodium, carindacillin, floxicillin, a penicillin G, penicillin G potassium, penicillin G procaine, penicillin N, penicillin O, penicillin V or pivapicillin; the lincosamide optionally is clindamycin or lincomycin; the macrolide optionally is azithromycin, clarithromycin or erythromycin; the polypeptide optionally is amphomycin, bacitracin, a gramicidin, gramicidin S, mikamycin, polymyxin, polymyxin B-methanesulfonic acid, or zinc bacitracin; the tetracycline optionally is clomocycline, demeclocycline, doxycycline, oxytetracycline, or tetracycline; the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine optionally is brodimoprim, tetroxoprim or trimethoprim; the nitrofuran optionally is furaltadone, nifuradene, nifuratel, or nifurpirinol; the quinolone optionally is amifloxacin, cinoxacin, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, flumequine, nomefloxacin, miloxacin, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, oxolinic acid, pefloxacin, pipemidic acid, piromidic acid, rosoxacin, temafloxacin or tosufloxacin; the sulfonamide is optionally selected from acetyl sulfamethoxypyrazine, azosulfamide, benzylsulfamide, chloramine-T, p-nitrosulfathiazole, succinylsulfathiazole or sulfathiazole; and the sulfone optionally is acedapsone, acetosulfone sodium, dapsone, solasulfone, succisulfone, sulfanilic acid, sulfoxone sodium or thiazolsulfone.","The formula 1 compounds are useful to detectably reduce the incidence, severity or progression of one or more symptoms or conditions associated with a viral, bacterial, fungal, yeast or parasite infection. Exemplary symptoms and conditions associated with infections such as one or more of those described above include one or more of sepsis, septicemia, fever, e.g., moderate to high fever, inflammation, pain, e.g., chest pain, muscle pain, joint pain, back pain or headache, chills, itching, rash, skin lesions, erythema, e.g., peripheral erythema, lymphadenopathy, e.g., local, regional or systemic lymphadenopathy, nausea, vomiting, cyanosis, shock, coma, necrosis, hemorrhage, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, cramping, mild to severe diarrhea, cough, weakness, splenomegaly, anorexia and weight loss. Specific symptoms that are associated with infections are known. See, e.g., 17edition, M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors, 1999, Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, N.J., ISBN 0911910-10-7, J. B. Peter, editor, 5Edition, pages 1-309, 1998, Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif., ISBN 1-889342-13-0. In treating any of these infections, the formula 1 compound will act through one or more mechanism, e.g., by decreasing TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2 where, e.g., inflammation is a symptom, or by enhancing the activity of cell mediated immune responses in clearing infected cells or extracellular infectious agents.","In any of the embodiments or treatment methods disclosed herein, one can optionally administer an additional therapeutic treatment in conjunction with, i.e., before, during or after, administration of a formula 1 compound(s) to a subject(s). For example, in subjects who have a viral or parasite infection and are in the course of administration of a formula 1 compound, other treatments can also be administered to the subject, e.g., nucleoside analogs for viral infections or an antimalarial(s) agent such as one or more of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, a artemisinin analog (e.g., as disclosed in J. Han et al., 64:2101-1205 2001 or G. A. Balint 90:261-265 2001), dapsone, sulfadoxin, pyrimethamine, chloroquine, mefloquine, halofantrine, proguanil, proguanil hydrochloride, cycloguanil, chlorocycloguanil, atovaquone, quinine, berberine, and\/or primaquine for subjects having or subject to developing a malaria infection. Subjects suffering from or subject to developing a fungal infection can optionally be treated with a formula 1 compound and an antifungal agent, e.g., an azole or a polyene such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, anidalfungin, amphotericin B or a liposomal formulation that comprises an azole or polyene such as amphotericin B. Subjects suffering from another condition such as an inflammation condition, an autoimmune condition or a cancer are optionally treated using one or more additional treatments. Such additional treatments will typically include standard therapies for the subject's pathological condition(s), but they can also include experimental or other treatments. For example, one can coadminister vitamins (e.g., multivitamins, individual vitamins), antioxidants or other agents (e.g., vitamin E, allopurinol, folinic acid, carnitine, a C2-8 alkanoyl carnitine such as acetyl or propionyl L-carnitine), nutritional supplements (e.g., liquid protein or carbohydrate preparations) or other therapies as the patient's medical condition warrants or as the patient's doctor recommends. Any of these additional treatments can be coupled with the administration of any of the formula 1 compounds, e.g., BrEA, an ester, carbamate, carbonate or amino acid or peptide conjugate thereof, in any of the embodiments described herein.","Such additional therapeutic agents or therapeutic treatments are apparent to the skilled artisan. Such treatments are selected based on the condition(s) to be treated, cross-reactivities of ingredients and pharmaco-properties of the combination. For example, when treating a viral infection(s), e.g., a retroviral infection, in a human or other subject, the formula 1 compounds are combined with one or more reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, antibiotics or analgesics. Suitable formula 1 compounds that are combined with such therapeutic agents include those described, e.g., in the compound groups, embodiments or claims disclosed herein.","In some embodiments, the dosages and administration of an additional therapeutic agent or treatment will be used with a formula 1 compound treatment in essentially the same manner as usual for the agent or treatment. In other embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is coupled with an altered dosage or dosing protocol, either of which may be appreciably increased or decreased. For example, in subjects such as adult humans that are infected with malaria parasites, the use of a formula 1 compound such as BrEA is optionally preceded by administration of about 25-500 mg\/day, e.g., about 50 mg\/day, about 100 mg\/day or about 200 mg\/day, of the antimalarial agent artemisinin for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days followed one day after artemisinin or dihydroartemisinin dosing by administration of about 25-200 mg\/day of BrEA for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more consecutive days. In related embodiments, the formula 1 compound and artemisinin are administered at partly or completely overlapping times or the formula 1 compound is administered before artemisinin or dihydroartemisinin is administered to the infected subject. The daily dosage or the total dosage for a course of therapy with other therapeutic agents such as cancer chemotherapy agents or antimicrobial agents (e.g., antiviral, antiparasite, antibacterial or antifungal agents as disclosed herein or in a cited reference) may be increased or decreased by at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more compared to standard dosages for such additional agents. The use of the formula 1 compounds with other therapeutic agents can reduce the toxicity of other therapeutic agents and\/or enhance their potency or their therapeutic index (or selectivity), thereby allowing effective increased or decreased dosages of the other therapeutic agent.","Exemplary antiviral agents suitable for use in the method include reverse transcriptase or polymerase inhibitors such as AZT (zidovudine or 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine), 3TC, D4T, ddI, ddC, 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxynucleosides such as 2\u2032,3\u2032-didoxycytidine, 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyadenosine, 2\u2032,3\u2032-didoxyinosine, 2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydrothymidine, carbovir and acyclic nucleosides, e.g., acyclovir, ganciclovir.

Such cytokines or interleukins can be used for any viral infection essentially according to known dosing methods and dosages, e.g., as disclosed herein or in the cited references.","In these treatment methods the infectious agent in the infected subject (or one susceptible to infection) may be sensitive or resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents. For example, bacteria causing an infection can be sensitive or resistant to antibiotics such as a penicillin (e.g., ampicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillan, carbenicillin, cloxacillin, cyclacillin, dicloxacillin, floxicillin, penicillin G, penicillin G calcium or penicillin N), a cephalosporin (e.g., cefadroxil, cefamandole, or cefatrizine), a sulfa drug, a tetracycline, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, erythromycin, rifampin, tobramycin, gentamycin, amikacin, a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin) or a quinoline. Infecting parasites can similarly be sensitive or resistant to antimicrobials, e.g., chloroquine resistant or sensitive parasites. Thus, in some embodiments, the subject's therapeutic regimen will optionally include treatment of resistant or sensitive infectious agents with one or more known antimicrobial agents. The antimicorbial can be administered orally, by intravenous injection or drip or as otherwise indicated by the subject's condition.

For example, treatment of subjects who are immune suppressed, e.g., from a retrovirus infection, cancer chemotherapy or other cause, generally show improvement of one or more associated symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, anemia, pain, fatigue or reduced infection symptoms that are associated with a secondary infection(s), e.g., HSV-1, HSV-2, papilloma, human cytomegalovirus (\u201cCMV\u201d), (e.g., ) or () infections.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered as a nonaqueous liquid formulation as described herein or the formula 1 compound(s) is administered according to any of the intermittent dosing protocols described herein using a solid or liquid formulation(s). In the case of a subject who has a retroviral infection, e.g., a human with an HIV infection, with symptoms that include one or more of, a relatively low CD4 count (e.g., about 10-200, or about 20-100 or about 20-50), one or more additional pathogen infections (HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, HHV-8, CMV, HCV, a HPV, or infection) and one or more of anemia, fatigue, Kaposi's sarcoma, fever or involuntary weight loss (at least about 5% of body weight), administration of about 0.1 to about 10 mg\/kg\/day (usually about 0.4 to about 5 mg\/kg\/day) of a formula 1 compound(s) to the subject typically results in noticeable improvement of one or more of the symptoms within about 1-4 weeks. In other embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is administered to a subject who has a condition that appears to be associated with a viral infection, e.g., pneumonia or retinitis associated with CMV, nasopharyngeal carcinoma or oral hairy leukoplakia associated with Epstein-Barr virus, progressive pancephalitis or diabetes associated with Rubella virus or aplastic crisis in hemolytic anemia associated with Parvovirus 19.","One or more intermittent dosing protocols disclosed herein or one or more of the liquid non-aqueous formulations described herein can be applied by routine experimentation to any of the uses or applications described herein. For a formula 1 compound(s) that is a new compound per se, the compound(s) can be administered to a subject according to an invention intermittent dosing protocol(s) or by other protocols, e.g., continuous daily dosing of a single dose or two or more subdoses per day. In addition any of the formula 1 compounds, e.g., one or more formula 1 compounds that are new per se, can be present in any solid or liquid formulation described herein. These formulations and dosing protocols can be applied by routine methods to any of the uses or applications described herein.","Antibodies, vaccines and vaccine adjuvants. The formula 1 compounds disclosed herein may also be used as vaccine adjuvants with immunogens or components of immunogenic compositions to prepare antibodies capable of binding specifically to the formula 1 compounds, their metabolic products which retain immunologically recognized epitopes (sites of antibody binding) or prepare antibodies that bind to antigens that can be used for vaccination against, e.g., infectious agents or malignant cells. The immunogenic compositions therefore are useful as intermediates in the preparation of antibodies that bind to formula 1 compounds for use, e.g., in diagnostic, quality control, or the like, methods or in assays for the compounds or their novel metabolic products. In addition, the compounds are useful for raising antibodies against otherwise non-immunogenic polypeptides, in that the compounds may serve as haptenic sites stimulating an immune response against the polypeptide.","The hydrolysis products or metabolites of formula 1 compounds include products of the hydrolysis of the protected acidic, basic or other reactive groups that variable groups, e.g., R-R, optionally comprise. In some embodiments, acidic or basic amides comprising immunogenic polypeptides such as albumin (e.g., human or mammalian), keyhole limpet hemocyamin and any other peptide described herein are used as immunogens. The metabolites of formula 1 compounds may retain a substantial degree of immunological cross reactivity with the unmetabolized parent compounds. Thus, in some embodiments, the antibodies will be capable of binding to the metabolites of the parent formula 1 compound without binding to the parent compound itself. In other embodiments, the antibodies, will be capable of binding to the parent compounds only, while in other cases the antibodies will be capable of binding to either of these. Some of the antibodies will not substantially cross-react with naturally occurring materials or epitopes that are present in the subject. Substantial cross-reactivity is reactivity under specific assay conditions for specific analytes sufficient to interfere with the assay results.","The immunogens of this invention may comprise a formula 1 compound that has 1 or more epitopes in association with another immunogenic substance. Within the context of the invention such association means covalent bonding to form an immunogenic conjugate (when applicable) or a mixture of non-covalently bonded materials, or a combination of the above. Immunogenic substances include adjuvants such as Freund's adjuvant, immunogenic proteins such as viral, bacterial, yeast, plant and animal polypeptides, including keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor, and immunogenic polysaccharides. Typically, the formula 1 compound having one, two or more epitopes is covalently conjugated to an immunogenic polypeptide or polysaccharide by the use of a polyfunctional (ordinarily bifunctional) cross-linking agent. Methods for the manufacture of immunogens that comprise one or more haptens are conventional per se. Any suitable known method for conjugating haptens to immunogenic polypeptides or the like are used here, taking into account the functional groups on the precursors or hydrolytic products which are available for cross-linking and the likelihood of producing antibodies specific to the epitope in question as opposed to the immunogenic substance.","Typically a polypeptide, polysaccharide or other suitable immunogenic moiety is conjugated to a site on a formula 1 compound in a location that is distant from the epitope on the formula 1 compound to be recognized.","The conjugates are prepared in conventional fashion. For example, the cross-linking agents N-hydroxysuccinimide, succinic anhydride or Calkyl-N\u2550C\u2550N\u2014Calkyl are useful in preparing the conjugates. The conjugates comprise a formula 1 compound that is attached by a bond or a linking group of 1-100, typically, 1-25, more typically about 1-10 carbon atoms to the immunogenic substance. The conjugates are separated from starting materials and by-products using chromatography or the like, and then are optionally sterile filtered, or otherwise sterilized, or are optionally vialed for storage. Synthetic methods to prepare hapten-carrier immunogens have been described, see e.g., G. T. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Academic Press, 1996, pages 419-493.","The formula 1 compounds are cross-linked for example through any one or more of the following groups: a hydroxyl group, a thiol group, a carboxyl group, a carbon atom, or an amine group. Included within such compounds are amides of polypeptides where the polypeptide serves as an above-described protecting group.","Animals or mammals are typically immunized once, twice or more times against the immunogenic conjugates that comprise a formula 1 compound or their derivatives and polyclonal antisera or monoclonal antibodies prepared in conventional fashion. In some embodiments, about 0.0001 mg\/kg to about 1 mg\/kg, e.g., about 0.001 or about 0.01 or about 0.1 mg\/kg, of immunogenic conjugate or derivative is used on one, two, three or more occasions to immunize the subject as described herein. The immunogenic conjugates are administered, orally, topically or parenterally as described herein, e.g., by i.m. or s.c. injection. Methods to prepare antibodies, including methods to obtain antibodies that bind to steroids have been described, see, e.g., R. O, Neri et al., 74:593-598 1964, M. Ferin et al., 85:1070-1078 1969, J. Vaitukaitis et al., 33:988-991 1971 and M. Ferin et al., 94:765-775 1974. Such methods can be used essentially as described to prepare antibodies or monoclonal antibodies that bind to a formula 1 compound. Invention embodiments include serum or other preparations that comprise any polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies that bind to a formula 1 compound(s), methods to make them and compounds or compositions that are used in conducting these methods.","In other embodiments the formula 1 compounds are used as adjuvants to enhance a subject's immune response to antigens such as proteins, peptides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins or killed or attenuated viruses or cell preparations. In these methods, an effective amount of the formula 1 compound is administered at about the same time that the antigen is delivered to the subject, e.g., within about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days of when the antigen is administered to the subject. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered 1, 2, 3, 4 or more times (usually once or twice per day) at 1, 2, 3 or 4 days before or after the antigen is administered to the subject. In other embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered on the same day that the antigen is administered to the subject, e.g., within about 1-4 hours. Such immunization methods may be repeated once, twice or more as needed. The formula 1 compound can be administered to the subject using any of the formulations or delivery methods described herein or in the references cited herein. Subjects suitable for these vaccinations include young and elderly mammals, including humans, e.g., humans about 3-36 months of age or older and humans about 60, 65, 70, 75 years of age or older. The amount of antigen used can be about 0.01 \u03bcg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, typically about 1-100 \u03bcg\/kg. Dosages of the formula 1 compound used in these vaccinations is essentially as described herein, e.g., about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of a formula 1 compound is used per day on days when it is administered as part of the vaccination method.","Related embodiments include compositions or formulations that comprise a formula 1 compound, an antigen(s) or antigen(s) preparation and optionally one or more excipients. The antigen is essentially as disclosed herein or in a cited reference. Antigen preparations may comprise one or more of (1) lethally or sublethally radiated cells or pathogens, (2) disrupted cells or viruses or such as attenuated viruses, (3) a nucleic acid or DNA vaccine, (4) an antigenic protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide or a fragment or derivative of any of these molecules, (5) chemically treated cells or pathogens, e.g., formalin or detergent treated cells, viruses or cell or virus extracts and (6) genetically engineered viral or bacterial vectors that express one or more antigens or antigen fragments, e.g., canarypox virus containing HIV or other pathogen sequences or other animal viruses carrying HIV or other pathogen sequences. Pathogens include prions or the etiologic agents of, e.g., Creutzfelt-Jacob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie in sheep, goats or mice. Where cells or disrupted are present in an antigen preparation, they may by genetically modified, e.g., to express one or more antigens or epitopes against which an immune response is desired. Such cells may also be genetically modified to optionally express one or more factors, e.g., an interleukin or a cytokine, such as one described herein, to enhance the desired immune response. As used here, an antigen means a moiety that can be used to elicit an immune response when it is administered to a subject. In some embodiments, the antigen is foreign to the subject. For foreign antigens, the subject to be vaccinated may not encode or express the antigen, while the antigen is usually part of or expressed by a pathogen or by a subject or mammal of a different species. In other embodiments, antigens are endogenous or non-foreign to the subject, e.g., they are usually encoded or expressed by the subject or another subject of the same species. Endogenous antigens are suitable for use in, e.g., tumor vaccination methods.","Exemplary tumors from which a suitable antigen(s) may be obtained are as described herein or in the cited references. A DNA vaccine as used here typically comprises a nucleic acid, usually DNA, that encodes one or more antigens or epitopes that a pathogen, e.g., a parasite, fungus, virus or bacterium, or a tumor encodes or can express. Tumor antigens that are suitable for use in vaccination methods that employ a formula 1 compound include tumor-associated antigens and tumor-specific antigens. These molecules typically comprise one or more protein, glycoprotein, carbohydrate or glycolipid. Vaccinations that employ a tumor antigen(s) may comprise autologous tumor cells or allogenic tumor cells, which are optionally disrupted and optionally used with a non-formula 1 adjuvant, such as Calmette-Guerin (BCG), purified protein derivative, Freund's complete adjuvant, , oligonucleotides that consist of or comprise an unmethylated CpG dimer or an alum precipitate. In some embodiments, tumor cells treated with neuraminidase comprise all or part of the tumor antigen source. The non-formula 1 adjuvants are also optionally used in any of the vaccination methods disclosed herein. As used here, tumor associated antigens, e.g., the carcinoembryonic antigen, \u03b1-fetoprotein or the prostate specific antigen, are molecules that are often associated with or detectably expressed by premalignant or malignant cells or cell populations and also with some normal tissues during at least part of the subject's life cycle.","Tumor-specific antigens, e.g., the R24c mutation of the cyclin dependent kinase-4 protein or certain sialylated glycoconjugates such as protein containing N-glycolyl neuraminic acid that is found in some human tumors (e.g., colon cancers, liver cancer, lymphoma), are molecules whose expression is restricted to pretumors or tumors and they are not expressed in normal adult or fetal tissue of a subject or a species to a significant extent. Vaccination with one or more tumor antigens and a formula 1 compound may be administered to a subject who has a cancer or a precancer, or to a subject who is considered potentially susceptible to developing such a condition. The tumor antigens are optionally combined with protein or other non-formula 1 adjuvants, e.g., keyhole-limpet hemocyanin or an immunoglobulin from a different species, which may be covalently bonded to the tumor antigen(s).","Suitable natural and synthetic nucleic acid sequences, cells, attenuated pathogens or infectious agents such as attenuated viruses, and protein, glycoprotein, polysaccharide, oligosaccharide or peptide antigens derived various infectious agents and tumors have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,053,585, 4,081,334, 4,115,543, 4,503,036, 4,466,917, 4,508,708, 4,601,903, 4,632,830, 4,683,200, 4,727,136, 4,735,799, 4,784,850, 4,784,941, 4,803,164, 4,831,121, 4,831,126, 4,853,333, 4,863,200, 4,857,452, 4,916,055, 4,939,240, 4,960,716, 4,963,484, 5,013,661, 5,032,397, 5,075,218, 5,077,220, 5,093,118, 5,011,920, 5,110,588, 5,112,749, 5,126,264, 5,134,075, 5,162,226, 5,185,432, 5,198,535, 5,231,168, 5,225,193, 5,283,321, 5,302,386, 5,328,835, 5,378,814, 5,393,532, 5,395,614, 5,456,911, 5,474,900, 5,478,556, 5,348,887, 5,455,332, 5,489,525, 5,527,891, 5,541,292, 5,582,831, 5,591,596, 5,609,872, 5,614,194, 5,639,621, 5,639,863, 5,641,492, 5,643,567, 5,654,136, 5,679,342, 5,688,657, 5,688,658, 5,705,341, 5,712,118, 5,723,130, 5,747,028, 5,756,101, 5,780,591, 5,798,445, 5,814,617, 5,824,316, 5,824,777, 5,837,830, 5,843,451, 5,844,075, 5,849,306, 5,849,476, 5,858,685, 5,866,679, 5,871,936, 5,874,060, 5,895,285, 5,895,651, 5,916,571, 5,916,754, 5,916,879, 5,932,412, 5,935,818, 5,942,235, 5,948,410, 5,948,412, 5,961,985, 5,968,514, 5,985,571, 5,993,813, 5,993,828, 5,994,523, 6,013,765, 6,013,779, 6,017,527, 6,020,478, 6,024,961, 6,025,191, 6,025,474, 6,030,624, 6,030,797, 6,045,802, 6,056,963, 6,060,280, 6,083,703, 6,083,683, 6,087,441, 6,093,540, 6,096,320, 6,100,049, 6,100,088, 6,100,241, 6,100,444, 6,110,468, 6,110,724, 6,110,898, 6,120,770, 6,113,917, 6,120,770, 6,127,116, 6,127,333, 6,130,082, 6,207,170, PCT publication Nos.

Hamilton, Ontario. Antigens suitable for use with the formula 1 compounds include the molecules disclosed in any of these references or antigenic fragments thereof. Such antigenic fragments will typically retain at least about 20% of the antigenicity of the unmodified antigen. Thus, these fragments will retain at least about 20% of the native antigen's capacity to generate an antibody response or to generate a T cell response against the unmodified antigen or the like.","Other suitable antigens include STn, sialyl Tn-KLH, carbohydrate conjugates, carcinogenic embryonic antigen, MAGE-1, MUC-1, HER-2\/neu, prostate specific antigen, p53, T\/Tn, bacterial flagella antigens or capsular polysaccharide antigens (e.g., capsular polysaccharide antigens) and antigenic fragments or antigenic synthetic derivatives of any of these molecules. See, e.g., L. A. Holmberg et al., 2000 25:1233-1241, J. W. Hadden, 1999 21:79-101, G. Ragupathi et al., 1998 15:217-221, A. I. Fattom et al., 1998 66:4588-4592, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,770,208, 5,866,140 and 6,194,161 and citations elsewhere herein, including the preceding paragraph.","An antigenic protein, peptide or glycoprotein can be identified by standard methods, e.g., protein or nucleic acid sequencing, for any of the infectious agents or tumors that are described herein or in the cited references. Thus, in some embodiments, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject, or delivered to the subject's tissues, to stimulate an immune response against the antigen. The antigen may comprise one, two or more antigenic epitopes, which may come from one, two or more genes. In some embodiments, the subject is optionally monitored to follow or determine the immune, dendritic cell, B cell, T cell, antibody or cytokine response, such as one disclosed herein, e.g., modulation or increase in \u03b3IFN, IL-2 or IL-12 levels or measurement of the production of one or more immunoglobulin types or subtypes. The subject may also be monitored by in vitro cell assays, e.g., for activation of T cells or subsets of T cells or other relevant white blood cell types. Such assays include measuring T cell activation using chromium release assays, or mixed lymphocyte assays. The subject is optionally treated with one or more additional booster vaccinations, when this is called for under the circumstances.","Nucleic acid or DNA vaccines as used here will typically comprise a nucleic acid comprising an expressible region that encodes one, two or more suitable antigens or epitopes, e.g., all or an antigenic portion of a viral, bacterial, fungal or parasite protein or glycoprotein. The expressible region will usually comprise a transcription promoter and optionally other control sequences that are operatively linked to the antigen coding region where the promoter and control sequences are transcriptionally active in the intended subject or tissue. Suitable control sequences include enhancers, recognition sequences for transcription factors and termination sequences. Such expression vectors may optionally comprise one, two or more expressible genes or gene fragments, which may each comprise their attendant operatively linked expression sequences. Suitable methods and expression vectors to deliver nucleic acids for vaccine purposes have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,223,263, 5,580,859, 5,703,055, 5,846,946 and 5,910,488.","Thus, in some embodiments, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject to stimulate an immune response against the antigen, wherein the antigen is encoded by a suitable expression construct. Exemplary antigens that are suitable in these methods are, e.g., essentially as described in any reference cited herein or as is apparent to the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, the antigen is encoded by a parasite such as a or a species such as one described herein. The formula 1 compound can be administered before, essentially simultaneously with or after administration of the antigen, as noted above. The dosages of the formula 1 compound are essentially as described for the other conditions described herein.","Vaccinations that utilize a formula 1 compound and an antigen(s) are generally suitable for eliciting or enhancing desired immune responses in conjunction with exposure of a subject to an antigen(s), compared to vaccination without the compound. Antigen specific humoral antibody responses or antigen specific T cell responses may be enhanced or elicited. Typically vaccination using a formula 1 compound and a suitable antigen is conducted to prevent a potential infection or to reduce the severity of a future infection. However, in some cases the vaccination is conducted in a subject that has an infection such as a chronic or a latent infection such as a parasite or a retrovirus or herpesvirus infection, which may be latent or in relapse. In other cases the subject may have a cancer or precancer. Thus, the subject may be exposed to, or contain, one or more of the antigens that are used in one of these vaccination procedures. Such vaccinations are included within the scope of the invention.","In related embodiments, the formula 1 compounds are useful to facilitate preparation of hybridoma clones that express monoclonal antibodies. In these methods, a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound, e.g., about 100 \u03bcg to about 2 mg for a small mammal, is administered to a subject, e.g., a mouse, to enhance the immune response to the desired antigen, which is also administered to the subject. After antigen challenge, suitable cells are recovered from the subject, e.g., anti-antigen immunoglobulin expressing HPRT spleen cells from a mouse. These cells are then fused with suitable immortal cells (e.g., mouse melanoma cells) using, e.g., PEG or Sendai virus, and selected in suitable selection growth medium, e.g., tissue culture medium that contains hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine, to obtain a group or panel of hybridomas that express anti-antigen monoclonal antibodies. The hybridoma panel is used to generate individual clones, which are optionally screened to determine the antibody specificity and antigen binding properties. About one, 100, 1000, 10,000, 100,000 or more individual clones are screened by standard methods. The monoclonal antibodies may be from any suitable source, e.g., murine, human, human-murine hybrid or the like. Methods to obtain human, human-murine hybrid or related monoclonal antibodies have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,562,903, 5,461,760, 5,705,154, 5,854,400, 5,858,728, 5,874,082, 5,874,540, 5,877,293, 5,882,644, 5,886,152, 5,889,157, 5,891,996, 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615, 5,998,209, 6,013,256, 6,075,181, 6,901,001, 6,114,143, 6,114,598, 6,117,980. The formula 1 compounds can be used in any of the methods disclosed in these references to facilitate generation or recovery of hybridoma panels and clones that express monoclonal antibodies.","An aspect of these methods comprise a product, i.e., a hybridoma panel or a hybridoma clone, that is obtained by the process of contacting a subject (such as a mouse) with (1) a suitable amount of a formula 1 compound and (2) a suitable amount of an antigen, allowing sufficient time to generate an immune response in the subject against the antigen and then fusing suitable anti-antigen immunoglobulin producing cells from the subject, e.g., the subject's spleen cells, with a suitable immortal cell line (e.g., a HPRT mouse myeloma). The antigen or immunogen is as described above, e.g., a suitable protein, protein fragment or glycoprotein such as an interleukin, cytokine or antigen from an infectious agent. In these methods, a mouse is typically the subject, but other mammals, e.g., humans or other rodents, are also suitable according to known methods.","The amount of antigen for immunization used in preparing monoclonal antibodies in a small mammal will typically be about 1 \u03bcg to about 100 \u03bcg, e.g., about 2 \u03bcg, 5 \u03bcg, 10 \u03bcg or 50 \u03bcg of antigen. The antigens are essentially as described in the vaccination methods described above, e.g., disrupted cell, a protein or glycoprotein, which is optionally combined with a suitable amount of an adjuvant such as Freund's complete adjuvant, alum precipitate, a bacterial lipopolysaccharide or BCG. The formula 1 compound is typically parenterally administered, e.g., subcutaneous or intraperitoneal, within about 2-4 days (e.g., about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 days before or after antigen challenge) of the time that the subject is challenged with antigen. In some cases, the antigen and the formula 1 compound is administered at the same time or at about the same time, e.g., within about 5 minutes to about 1 hour. The formula 1 compound may be administered on one, two, three or more occasions in the process, e.g., a formula 1 compound is administered once per day on one or more of the four days before antigen challenge and then it is optionally administered again on the same day as antigen challenge and then optionally administered daily at one, two, three or more days after antigen challenge.","Related embodiments include a method comprising administering to a subject (e.g., a mammal such as a human or a primate), or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and a specific antigen. Immune responses that are enhanced include a mucosal immune response to an antigen such as a protein, peptide, polysaccharide, microorganism, tumor cell extract or lethally radiated tumor or pathogen cells (e.g., antigens or cells from melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, virus or bacteria, or other tumor or pathogen as disclosed herein). Aspects of these embodiments include enhancement of the subject's immune response when an antigen or immunogen is administered intranasally or orally. In these aspects, the formula 1 compound is administered about simultaneously with the antigen or within about 3 hours to about 6 days of antigen administration. The use of immune modulating agents to enhance immune responses to a vaccine has been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,725.","Other uses for the formula 1 compound(s) include administering the compound(s) to a subject who suffers from a pathological condition(s). The treatment may treat or ameliorate the source of the condition(s) and\/or symptoms associated with the pathological condition(s) such as infection with a pathogen(s) (viruses, bacteria, fungi), a malignancy, unwanted immune response, i.e., an immune response that causes pathology and\/or symptoms, e.g., autoimmune conditions or allergy or conditions such as hypoproliferation conditions, e.g., normal or impaired tissue growth, or wound healing or burn healing, or in immunosuppression conditions, e.g., conditions characterized by an absence of a desired response and\/or an inadequate degree of a desired response.","As noted in the foregoing applications where a formula 1 compound and an antigen are administered to a subject to enhance the subject's immune response, the antigen may be obtained from any suitable source. The antigen will generally be capable of eliciting an immune response against the original pathogen or cell. Desirable immune responses obtained from vaccination of a subject with an antigen and a formula 1 compound include one or more of an enhanced antibody response, an enhanced antigen specific CD4 T cell response or an enhanced cytotoxic T cell response to pathogen infected cells, extracellular pathogen or to tumor cells.","Enhanced antibody responses include detectable enhancement of antibody titer or a shift in the antibody response from a Th2 biased response to an increased Th1 biased component of the response. In such antibody shifts, the Th1 and Th2 character of the response is determined by known methods. For example, a relatively low ratio of IgG1 (or the analogous antibody subclass in humans and other subjects) to IgG2a (or the analogous antibody subclass in humans and other subjects), e.g., about 6:1 to about 12:1, that is generated after exposure of a subject (a mouse for the IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses) to an antigen indicates a Th1 biased antibody response. Conversely a higher ratio, e.g., about 20:1 to about 30:1 indicates a Th1 biased antibody response. Generation of antigen-specific IgG1 generation involves T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells, and for IgG2a, T-helper type 1 (Th1) cells. The formula 1 compounds can detectably increase the Th1 character of an antibody response to an antigen or they can increase the magnitude of both the Th1 and Th2 response.","Exemplary antigen sources include pathogens, cells or their individual proteins, peptides, glycoproteins or polysaccharides or antigenic fragments of any of these molecules. The antigenic material is recovered from suitably treated pathogens or cells and administered to a subject, or it can be recovered using recombinant means to obtain a purified or partially purified antigen source.","Exemplary pathogens or cells that are suitable sources for antigens or a gene(s) that encode suitable antigens include influenza viruses (e.g., influenza A, influenza B), respiratory syncytial viruses, Rotaviruses, Hantaviruses, human Papilloma viruses (e.g., HPV-16, HPV-18), Poxviruses, Poliovirus, rabies viruses, Retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1, HIV-2), hepatitis viruses (e.g., human HAV, HBV or HCV), Togaviruses and Flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, Dengue viruses), Herpesviruses (e.g., CMV, EBV, Varicella Zoster Virus, HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV-6, HHV-8), measles viruses, mumps viruses, rubella virus, pneumococci such as cells or capsule material, enteric bacterial cells (e.g., , or or species), gram positive bacterial pathogens (e.g., ), gram negative bacterial pathogens, diphtheria pathogens, or human or animal cells obtained from a melanoma or skin cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, nervous tissue cancer (e.g., neuroblastoma, glioma), lymphoma, leukemia cells, kidney or renal cell cancer, ovarian cancer or lung cancer (e.g., small cell carcinoma, non-small cell carcinoma). Exemplary parasites or antigen sources include and . The antigen(s) that is used may comprise a pathogen coat protein(s), pathogen cell wall or other structural proteins. Antigen(s) from tumor cells or parasites may comprise cell membrane associated structures or intracellular molecules that are characteristic of, or unique to, the tumor or parasite. Other suitable antigen or pathogen sources are as described herein or in the cited references.","Cancer and hyperproliferation conditions. Many cancers, precancers, malignancies or hyperproliferation conditions are associated with an unwanted Th2 immune response, a deficient Th1 response or unwanted inflammation. An insufficient Th1 immune response may play a role in the capacity of malignant or premalignant cells to escape immune surveillance. The formula 1 compounds, including those in the compound groups and embodiments disclosed herein, may thus be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of one or more cancers, precancers or cell hyperproliferation conditions or they may be used to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof. In these conditions, the formula 1 compounds are useful to enhance the subject's Th1 responses or to reestablish a more normal Th1-Th2 balance in the subject's immune responses. The formula 1 compounds may function at least in part by decreasing inflammation or inflammation associated markers such as IL-6 and\/or by enhancing hemopoiesis in many of these conditions.","These conditions include cancers or precancers comprising carcinomas, sarcomas, adenomas, blastoma, disseminated tumors and solid tumors such as one associated with or arising from prostate, lung, breast, ovary, skin, stomach, intestine, pancreas, neck, larynx, esophagus, throat, tongue, lip, oral cavity, oral mucosa, salivary gland, testes, liver, parotid, biliary tract, colon, rectum, cervix, uterus, vagina, pelvis, endometrium, kidney, bladder, central nervous system, glial cell, astrocyte, squamous cell, blood, bone marrow, muscle or thyroid cells or tissue. The formula 1 compounds are thus useful to treat, prevent, slow the progression of, or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a precancer, cancer or related hyperproliferation condition such as myelodysplastic syndrome, actinic keratoses, endometriosis, Barrett's esophagus, leiomyoma, fibromyoma, benign or precancerous intestinal or bowel polyps or benign prostatic hyperplasia. The compounds can also be used to treat, prevent, slow the progression of, slow the replication or growth of, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms of a primary tumor, a metastasis, an advanced malignancy, a blood born malignancy, a leukemia or a lymphoma.","The formula 1 compounds can be used to treat paraneoplastic syndromes or conditions such as ones associated with lung or breast cancers that secrete calcitonin or that enhance osteoclast activity. Such conditions include hypercalcemia, Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia. The compounds are used to decrease osteoclast activity or other symptoms associated with such conditions.","Hyperproliferation conditions that can be treated include melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell cancer or carcinoma, glioma, glioblastoma, pancreatic or gastric adenocarcinoma, gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, human papillomavirus associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, cervical carcinoma, hepatoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatocellular adenoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides, Sezary syndrome), colorectal cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, ALL or follicular lymphoma, multiple myeloma, carcinomas with p53 mutations, colon cancer, cardiac tumors, adrenal tumors, pancreatic cancer, retinoblastoma, a small cell lung cancer, a non-small cell lung cancer, intestinal cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, neuroblastoma, neuroma, myxoma, myoma, endothelioma, osteoblastoma, osteoclastoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, adenoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, ovarian cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Treating a subject with a formula 1 compound can ameliorate one or more side effects of chemotherapy or cancer symptoms such as alopecia, pain, fever, malaise, chronic fatigue and cachexia or weight loss. Other cancers, precancers or their symptoms that can be treated, prevented or ameliorated are described in, e.g., 5, 5edition, R. C. Bast et al., editors, 2000, ISBN 1-55009-113-1, pages 168-2453, B. C. Becker Inc. Hamilton, Ontario, Canada or 17edition, M. H. Beers and R. Berkow editors, 1999, Merck Research Laboratories, Whitehouse Station, N.J., ISBN 0911910-10-7.","In some of these embodiments, the subject's hyperproliferation or malignant condition may be associated with or caused by one or more pathogens. Such conditions include hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HCV or HBV, Kaposi's sarcoma associated with HIV-1 or HIV-2, T cell leukemia associated with HTLV I, Burkitt's lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus or papillomas or carcinoma associated with papilloma viruses (e.g., human HPV 6, HPV 11, HPV 16, HPV 18, HPV 31, HPV 45) or gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric MALT lymphoma or gastric inflammation associated with or propionibacteria infection.","In some of these embodiments, the formula 1 compounds may be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of or ameliorate one or more conditions in a subject having or subject to developing a hyperproliferation condition where angiogenesis contributes to the pathology. Abnormal or unwanted angiogenesis or neovascularization contributes to the development or progression of solid tumor growth and metastases, as well as to arthritis, some types of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma, rubeosis, retinoblastoma, uvietis and pterygia or abnormal blood vessel growth of the eye, and psoriasis. See, e.g., Moses et al., 9:630-634 1991, Folkman et al., 333:1757-1763 1995, and Auerbach et al., 29:401-411 1985.","Dosages of the formula 1 compound, routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for cancer or hyperproliferation conditions or other conditions as disclosed herein. This, in some embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for a cancer or precancer(s), e.g., one or more of surgery and treatment with an antiandrogen or an antiestrogen as described herein or in the cited references, an antineoplastic agent such as an alkylating agent, a nitrogen mustard, a nitrosourea, an antimetabolite or cytotoxic agent, or an analgesic such as propoxyphene napsylate, acetaminophen or codeine. Exemplary anticancer and adjunct agents include methotrexate, thioguanine, mercaptopurine, adriamycin, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, procarbazine, hydroxyurea, allopurinol, erythropoietin, G-CSF, bicalutamide, anastrozole, fludarabine phosphate and doxorubicin. Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and they would precede, be essentially concurrent with and\/or follow treatment with a formula 1 compound. In some embodiments, such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a formula 1 compound is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the formula 1 compound is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 303-3250, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a formula 1 compound to ameliorate, slow the establishment or progression of, prevent or treat any of the appropriate cancers, precancers or related conditions described herein, or any of their symptoms.","In treating cancers or hyperproliferation conditions, the formula 1 compounds may detectably modulate, e.g., decrease or increase, the expression or level or activity of one or more biomolecules associated with the prevention, establishment, maintenance or progression of the cancer or hyperproliferation condition. Such biomolecules include one or more of carcinoembryonic antigen, prostate specific antigen, her2\/neu, Bcl-XL, bcl-2, p53, IL-1a, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, or TNF\u03b1, GATA-3, COX-2, NF\u03baB, IkB, an IkB kinase, e.g., IkB kinase-\u03b1, IkB kinase-\u03b2 or IkB kinase-\u03b3, NFAT, calcineurin, calmodulin, a ras protein such as H-ras or K-ras, cyclin D, cyclin E, xanthine oxidase, or their isoforms, homologs or mutant forms, which may have either reduced or enhanced biological activity(ies), and which may be detectably decreased. Biomolecules or their activity(ies) that can be detectably increased include IL-2, IFN\u03b3, IL-12, T-bet, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase, calcineurin, calmodulin, a superoxide dismutase (e.g., Mn, Zn or Cu), a tumor suppressor protein such as the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) or CDKN2A (p16), BRCA1, BRCA2, MeCP2, MBD2, PTEN, NBR1, NBR2 or the isoforms, homologs or mutant forms, which may have either attenuated or enhanced biological activity(ies), of any of these molecules. One or more of these biomolecules may be modulated in any the cancers or conditions described herein.","The formula 1 compounds can modulate the synthesis or a biological activity of one or more other gene products such as transcription factors, enzymes or steroid or other receptors that are associated with the establishment, progression or maintenance of a cancer or precancer or associated symptom. The compounds can inhibit AIB-1 coactivator or HER2\/neu synthesis or activity in breast cancer cells or breast cancer conditions. They can enhance the synthesis or an activity of an estrogen receptor such as ER\u03b1, ER\u03b21 or ER\u03b22 or progesterone receptor in breast cancer or colon cancer cells or conditions. These effects can include modulation of the expression or one or more biological activities of proteins or enzymes that contribute to disease establishment or progression. Thus, the compounds can decrease IL-4, IL-6 or IL-13 expression by stromal cells or immune cells that are in proximity to or adjacent to solid or diffuse tumor cells in a subject such as a human or another mammal. In the cancers or precancers described herein, the compounds can thus directly or indirectly modulate (e.g., decrease) the activity or expression of relevant enzymes such as STAT-6, neutral endopeptidase, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, such as a 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or a 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.","In an exemplary embodiment, human patients suffering from melanoma or melanoma precursor lesions are treated with a topical cream formulation containing 2-20% BrEA (w\/w). The cream is applied to primary nevi (dysplastic nevi or common acquired nevi), primary cutaneous melanomas, secondary cutaneous melanomas and the skin surrounding the nevi or melanomas. The areas to be treated are washed with soap or swabbed with an alcohol (e.g., ethanol or isopropanol) prior to administering the cream, when this is practical. About 0.1-0.4 g of cream, depending on the size of the treated area, is applied once or twice per day per treated region or lesion for about 10-20 days. The cream is left undisturbed at the administration site for about 15-30 minutes before the patient resumes normal activity. Progression of the nevi and melanomas is retarded in the majority of patients and significant regression is observed for some lesions. Following initial treatment, the formulation is administered every other day for at least 1 to 4 months using the same dosing described for the initial round of treatment. For these patients, standard therapy to treat precursor lesion or melanoma, e.g., dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide or nitrosoureas (e.g., BCNU, CCNU), is optionally started or continued according to the recommendations of the patient's doctor and with the patient's informed approval. In cases where a tumor or precursor lesion is surgically removed and the site has sufficiently healed, the patient optionally continues using the topical formulation at the site and the adjacent surrounding area every other day for at least 1 to 4 months. In some of these embodiments, a formula 1 compound(s) is administered daily continuously as an oral composition or formulation, e.g., for a formula 1 compound(s) that is a new compound per se. BrEA is optionally also administered systemically using, e.g., a formulation described in the examples below to deliver 0.1-5 mg\/kg\/day every other day for about 1 week to about to 4 months, e.g., in the case of malignant melanoma.","Cardiovascular applications. The formula 1 compounds, including those in the compound groups and embodiments disclosed herein, may be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of one or more of congenital heart defects, cardiovascular diseases, disorders, abnormalities and\/or conditions, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof in a subject. These include peripheral artery disease, arterio-arterial fistula, arteriovenous fistula, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, aortic coarctation, cor triatum, coronary vessel anomalies, patent ductus arteriosus, Ebstein's anomaly, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, levocardia, transposition of great vessels, double outlet right ventricle, tricuspid atresia, persistent truncus arteriosus, and

stenosis, pulmonary subvalvular stenosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, Chagas cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis, myocardial fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, Kearns Syndrome, myocardial reperfusion injury, myocarditis, cardiovascular or vascular diseases such as dissecting aneurysms, false aneurysms, infected aneurysms, ruptured aneurysms, aortic aneurysms, cerebral aneurysms, coronary aneurysms, heart aneurysms, and iliac aneurysms, angiodysplasia, angiomatosis, bacillary angiomatosis, Sturge-Weber Syndrome, angioneurotic edema, aortic diseases, Takayasu's Arteritis, aortitis, Leriche's Syndrome, arterial occlusive diseases, arteritis, enarteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, cerebrovascular diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, diabetic angiopathies, diabetic retinopathy, thrombosis, erythromelalgia, hemorrhoids, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, hypertension, hypotension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral vascular diseases, phlebitis, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, Raynaud's disease, CREST syndrome, retinal vein occlusion, Scimitar syndrome, superior vena cava syndrome, telangiectasia, atacia telangiectasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, varicocele, varicose veins, varicose ulcer, vasculitis, venous insufficiency and arterial occlusive diseases such as arteriosclerosis, intermittent claudication, carotid stenosis, fibromuscular dysplasias, mesenteric vascular occlusion, Moyamoya disease retinal artery occlusion, thromboangiitis obliterans or atherosclerosis, any of which may be at an early stage or at a more advanced or late stage.","The formula 1 compounds can also be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of cerebrovascular diseases, thrombosis, and\/or conditions such as carotid artery diseases, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral aneurysm, cerebral anoxia, cerebral arteriosclerosis, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, cerebral artery diseases, cerebral embolism and thrombosis, carotid artery thrombosis, sinus thrombosis, Wallenberg's syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, cerebral ischemia (including transient), subclavian steal syndrome, periventricular leukomalacia, vascular headache, cluster headache, migraine, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, air embolisms, embolisms such as cholesterol embolisms, fat embolisms, pulmonary embolisms or amniotic fluid embolism, thromoboembolisms, thrombosis such as coronary thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion, carotid artery thrombosis, sinus thrombosis, Wallenberg's syndrome, and thrombophlebitis.","The formula 1 compounds can also be used to treat, prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of vascular ischemia or myocardial ischemias, vasculitis and coronary diseases, including angina pectoris, coronary aneurysm, coronary arteriosclerosis, coronary thrombosis, coronary vasospasm, myocardial infarction and myocardial stunning, cerebral ischemia, ischemic colitis, compartment syndromes, anterior compartment syndrome, myocardial ischemia, reperfusion injuries, peripheral limb ischemia, aortitis, arteritis, Behcet's Syndrome, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, thromboangiitis obliterans, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Schoenlein-Henoch purpura, allergic cutaneous vasculitis, and Wegener's granulomatosis.","Exemplary symptoms that the use of the formula 1 compounds can ameliorate include one or more of pain such as arm, jaw or chest pain, edema or swelling, high blood pressure, shortness of breath or dyspnea, e.g., on exertion or while prone, fatigue or malaise and low cardiac injection fraction. In treating a cardiovascular condition in a subject or in improving one or more symptoms thereof, the formula 1 compounds may accomplish one or more of increasing cardiac ejection volume or fraction, decreasing levels of IL-6, decreasing levels of C reactive protein, fibrinogen, cardiac creatinine kinase, increasing fatty acid metabolism or utlization by cardiac tissue, increasing carnityl palmitoyl fatty acid transferase or other cardiac metabolic enzymes, activating potassium dependent calcium channels, vasodilating or enhancing oxygen delivery to ischemic tissues or decreasing levels of scarring or plaque formation that occurs, e.g., after vascular damage. Symptoms associated with a cardiovascular condition such as ischemia that can be ameliorated also include acidosis, expression of one or more immediate early genes in, e.g., glial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells or endothelial cells, neuronal membrane depolarization and increased neuronal extracellular calcium and glutamate concentration. Other biological effects associated with treatment using a formula 1 compound may also be monitored, e.g., and increase or decrease of a cell surface antigen, a cytokine or an interleukin as disclosed herein.","Useful biological effects of the formula 1 compounds in cardiovascular indications such as myocardial ischemias also include preventing or reducing heart or vascular cell death and subsequent fibrosis. These effects are associated with a decreased oxidative capacity of heart cells or myocytes, which is associated with a decreased capacity of the cells to metabolize fatty acids efficiently. The compounds enhance fatty acid metabolism and ameliorate the deleterious effects of a limited oxidative capacity.","The formula 1 compounds also can limit inflammation or cell injury that is associated with ischemia or oxygen reperfusion after ischemia. Ischemia, which is a detrimental decrease in oxygenated blood delivery to affected cells or tissues, may arise from a cardiovascular condition or event such as an infarction, or from thermal injury or burns. Ischemia may also arise from accidental or surgical trauma. Reperfusion after cells have become hypoxic for a sufficient period of time can lead to tissue or cell injury that varies from slight to lethal. The compounds can reduce cell or tissue injury or death associated with ischemia and reperfusion, by, e.g., reducing inflammation or the level of a molecule associated with inflammation. Thus, levels of a proinflammatory cytokine or molecule such as leukotriene B4, platelet activating factor or levels of extracellular P-selectin may result from administration of a formula 1 compound to a subject who may experience reperfusion injury. Thus, the compounds can reduce injury or death of, e.g., neuron, cardiac, vascular endothelium, myocardial, pulmonary, hepatic or renal cells or tissues. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the compounds may act in part by reducing one or more of neutrophil activation, platelet activation, platelet aggregation, endothelial cell activation and neutrophil adherence or adhesion to endothelial cells in these conditions.","The use of any formula 1 compound or species in any genus of formula 1 compounds disclosed herein to treat, prevent or ameliorate any of these cardiovascular conditions or symptoms will generally use one or more of the routes of administration, dosages and dosing protocols as disclosed herein. Thus, in exemplary embodiments, about 0.5 to about 100 mg\/kg or about 1 to about 25 mg\/kg, of the formula 1 compound will be administered per day by an oral, buccal, sublingual or parenteral route. Such administration can be, e.g., daily for about 5 to about 60 days in acute conditions or it can be intermittent for about 3 months to about 2 years or more for chronic conditions. Alternatively, intermittent dosing can be used essentially as described herein for acute cardiovascular conditions. In conditions such as ischemia, administration of the formula 1 compound should generally occur before or as soon after the ischemic event as possible, e.g., within about 6 hours of an ischemic event or about 12-24 hours before an anticipated ischemic event.","In related embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for cardiovascular disorders, e.g., vascular surgery, cardiac surgery, angioplasty, or treatment with andrenergic blockers, coronary vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, anti-hypertensives, anti-inflammatory agents, diuretics, anti-arrhythmia agents, thrombolytic agents, enzyme inhibitors such as hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors or xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Exemplary hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors include statins such as mevastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin or compounds described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,346,227, 4,448,979, 4,739,073, 5,169,857, 5,006,530 or 5,401,746. Other additional therapies include treatment with one or more of digoxin, nitroglycerin, doxazosin mesylate, nifedipine, enalapril maleate, indomethicin, tissue plasminogin activator, urokinase, acetylsalicylic acid, allopurinol or the like. Any of such additional therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such therapies would precede, be concurrent with or follow treatment with a formula 1 compound. In some embodiments, such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a formula 1 compound is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the formula 1 compound is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 303-3251, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a formula 1 compound to treat any of the appropriate cardiovascular disorders described herein.","Applications in autoimmunity, allergy, inflammation and related conditions. As mentioned above, the formula 1 compounds, including those in the compound groups and embodiments disclosed herein, may be used to treat, prevent or slow the progression of one or more autoimmune allergic or inflammatory diseases, disorders, or conditions, or to ameliorate one or more symptoms thereof in a subject. These diseases and conditions include Addison's Disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis and other synovial disorders, an osteoarthritis including post-traumatic osteoarthritis and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, polyarthritis, epichondylitis, type I diabetes, type II diabetes, rheumatic carditis, bursitis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, a dermatitis such as contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, exfoliative dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis, mycosis fungoides, allergic encephalomyelitis, autoimmune glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's Syndrome, Graves'Disease, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, neuritis, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus, polyendocrinopathies, purpura, Reiter's Disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune pulmonary inflammation, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, autoimmune inflammatory eye disease, hepatitis C virus associated autoimmunity, postinfectious autoimmunity associated with, e.g., virus or bacterial infection such as a parvovirus such as human parvovirus B19 or with rubella virus, autoimmune skin and muscle conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris, pemphigus foliaceus, systemic dermatomyositis or polymyositis or another inflammatory myopathy, myocarditis, asthma such as allergic asthma, allergic encephalomyelitis, allergic rhinitis, a vasculitis condition such as polyarteritis nodosa, giant cell arteritis or systemic necrotizing vasculitis, chronic and an acute or chronic inflammation condition such as chronic prostatitis, granulomatous prostatitis and malacoplakia, ischemia-reperfusion injury, endotoxin exposure, complement-mediated hyperacute rejection, nephritis, cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury, cachexia, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease or inflammation associated with an infection, e.g., septic shock, sepsis, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Any of these diseases or conditions or their symptoms may be acute, chronic, mild, moderate, severe, stable or progressing before, during or after the time administration of the formula 1 compound to a subject such as a human, is initiated. In general, a detectable improvement is observed in the subject within a period of about 3 days to about 12 months after initiation of a dosing protocol, e.g., the severity of the disease or condition will detectably decrease, the rate of progression will detectably slow or the severity of a symptom(s) will detectably decrease.","As used herein, acute inflammation conditions are characterized as an inflammation that typically has a fairly rapid onset, quickly becomes moderate or severe and usually lasts for only a few days or for a few weeks. Chronic inflammation conditions as used herein are characterized as an inflammation that may begin with a relatively rapid onset or in a slow, or even unnoticed manner, tends to persist for at least several weeks, e.g., about 3-6 weeks, months, or years and may have a vague or indefinite termination. Chronic inflammation may result when the injuring agent (or products resulting from its presence) persists in the lesion, and the subject's tissues respond in a manner (or to a degree) that is not sufficient to overcome completely the continuing effects of the injuring agent. Other exemplary conditions are described in, e.g., , R. G. Lahita, editor, Lippincott Williams & Wikins, Philadelphia, Pa., 2000, ISBN 0-7817-1505-9, pages 175-851 and 2edition, J. H. Klippel et al., editors, 1998, ISBN 0-7234-2405-5, volume 1, sections 1-5 and volume 2, sections 6-8, Mosby International, London, UK.","A formula 1 compound can be used to inhibit or ameliorate one or more inappropriate immune responses or their symptoms in autoimmunity, inflammation, allergy or related conditions. The effects of the formula 1 compounds include detectably ameliorating one or more of (1) the proliferation, differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells, (2) reducing unwanted cytotoxic T cell responses, (3) reducing unwanted autoantibody or other antibody synthesis, e.g., an unwanted IgA, IgE, IgG or IgM, in allergy, asthma or another autoimmune or inflammation condition, (4) inhibiting the development, proliferation or unwanted activity of autoreactive T or B cells, (5) altering the expression of one or more cytokines, interleukins or cell surface antigens, e.g., a cytokine, interleukin or cell surface antigen described herein (decreasing IL-8 in an autoimmune condition, decreasing the level of acute phase proteins such as C reactive protein or fibrinogen in inflammation conditions, (6) decreasing eosinophilia in allergy conditions, (7) detectably decreasing the level or activity of one or more of ICAM-1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1 or IL-6 in, e.g., inflammation conditions or in autoimmune conditions such as an arthritis or a myocarditis condition such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, toxic myocarditis, indurative myocarditis or idiopathic myocarditis, (8) decreasing the level or biological activity of one or more of anti-islet antibody, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, an arthritis symptom(s), nephritis, skin rash, photosensitivity, headache frequency or pain, migraine frequency or pain, abdominal pain, nausea or anti-DNA antibodies in, e.g., insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or an autoimmune or inflammation condition such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease, (9) reducing induction of arachidonic acid metabolism or reducing eicosanoid metabolites such as thromboxanes or prostaglandins in, e.g., inflammation, asthma or allergy, (10) reducing IL-4, IL-8 or IL-10 synthesis, levels or activity in, e.g., allergy or inflammation such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or allergic asthma or (11) reducing or interfering with neutrophil chemotaxis by, e.g., reducing thioredoxin release from affected cells in conditions such as cancer, infections, inflammation or autoimmunity.","Exemplary symptoms that the use of the formula 1 compounds can ameliorate in these autoimmune, inflammatory and allergy conditions include one or more of pain such as shoulder, hip, joint, abdominal or spine pain, joint stiffness or gelling, bursitis, tendonitis, edema or swelling, fatigue or malaise, headache, dyspnea, skin rash, fever, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, skin or intestine ulceration, muscle weakness, pericarditis, coronary occlusion, neuropathy and diarrhea.

One or more of these biomolecules may be modulated in any inflammation condition described herein.","The use of any formula 1 compound or species in any genus of formula 1 compounds disclosed herein to treat, prevent or ameliorate any of these autoimmune, inflammatory or allergy conditions or symptoms will generally use one or more of the routes of administration, dosages and dosing protocols as disclosed herein. Thus, in exemplary embodiments, about 0.5 to about 100 mg\/kg or about 1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, of the formula 1 compound will be administered per day by, e.g., an oral, buccal, sublingual, topical or parenteral route. Such administration can be, e.g., daily for about 5 to about 60 days in acute conditions or it can be intermittent for about 3 months to about 2 years or more for chronic conditions. Alternatively, intermittent dosing can be used essentially as described herein for acute autoimmune, inflammatory and allergy conditions.","In related embodiments, the use of the formula 1 compound is optionally combined with one or more additional therapies for an autoimmune, inflammatory or allergy disorder(s), e.g., one or more of surgery and treatment with a corticosteroid or glucocorticoid such as hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone acetate, prednisone, prednisolone, prednisolone acetate, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, dexamethasone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide, leflunomide, an antibody, e.g., a human or humanized monoclonal antibody, that decreases the activity or level of C5 complement, TNF\u03b1 or TNF\u03b1 receptor, an antirheumatic drug such as methorexate, D-penicillamine, sodium aurothiomalate, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressive agents such as 6-thioguanylic acid, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide or cyclosporin, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent such as celecoxib, ibuprofin, piroxicam or naproxin, an antihistamine such as loratidine or promethazine hydrochloride or an analgesic such as propoxyphene napsylate, acetaminophen or codeine. Such therapies would be used essentially according to standard protocols and such they would precede, be concurrent with or follow treatment with a formula 1 compound. In some embodiments, such additional therapies will be administered at the same time that a formula 1 compound is being used or within about 1 day to about 16 weeks before or after at least one round of treatment with the formula 1 compound is completed. Other exemplary therapeutic agents and their use have been described in detail, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 303-3267, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. One or more of these exemplary agents can be used in combination with a formula 1 compound to ameliorate, prevent or treat any of the appropriate autoimmune, inflammatory or allergy conditions or disorders described herein or any of their symptoms.","Regeneration and wound healing. The formula 1 compounds can be used to facilitate cell differentiation or proliferation where regeneration of tissues is desired. The regeneration of tissues could be used to repair, replace, protect or limit the effects of tissue damaged by congenital defects, trauma (wounds, burns, incisions, or ulcers), age, disease (e.g. osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, periodontal disease, liver failure), surgery, including cosmetic plastic surgery, fibrosis, reperfusion injury, or systemic cytokine damage. Tissues for which regeneration may be enhanced include organs (e.g., pancreas, liver, intestine, kidney, skin, endothelium, oral mucosa, gut mucosa), muscle (e.g., smooth, skeletal or cardiac), vasculature (including vascular and lymphatics), nervous tissue, hematopoietic tissue, and skeletal tissue (e.g., bone, cartilage, tendon, and ligament). These effects may be accompanied by decreased scarring or an increased rate of healing.","The formula 1 compounds are thus useful to enhance healing or tissue repair in a subject having a bone fracture(s), e.g., a simple or compound skull, spine, hip, arm or leg bone fracture. Similarly, nerve or brain tissue treatment using a formula 1 compound allows treating, slowing the progression of, ameliorating or preventing diseases such as central and peripheral nervous system diseases, neuropathies, or mechanical and traumatic diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions (e.g., spinal cord disorders, head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, and stoke). The compounds are useful to treat diseases associated with peripheral nerve injuries, peripheral neuropathy (e.g., resulting from chemotherapy or other medical therapies), localized neuropathies, and central nervous system diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The subjects undergoing treatment in these conditions may be elderly, e.g., a human at least 55, 60, 65 or 70 years of age. Where the condition is acute, e.g., a bone fracture or a burn, the treatment may comprise administration of a formula 1 compound to the subject on a daily or intermittent basis for about 3 days to about 12 months, e.g., administration for about 2-12 weeks beginning after the subject sustains an injury.","Dosages of the formula 1 compound, routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described herein, e.g., for cardiovascular conditions or other conditions as disclosed herein.","Neurological conditions. Nervous system diseases, disorders, or conditions, which can be ameliorated, treated or prevented with any of the formula 1 compounds disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, nervous system trauma or injury, and diseases or conditions which result in either a disconnection of axons, a diminution of neuron function or degeneration of neurons, demyelination or pain.","Nervous system lesions which may be treated, prevented, or ameliorated in a subject include but are not limited to, the following lesions of either the central (including spinal cord, brain) or peripheral nervous systems: (1) ischemic lesions, in which a lack of oxygen in a portion of the nervous system results in neuronal injury or death, including cerebral infarction or ischemia, or spinal cord infarction or ischemia, (2) traumatic lesions, including lesions caused by physical injury or associated with surgery, for example, lesions which sever a portion of the nervous system, or compression injuries, (3) malignant lesions, in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by malignant tissue which is either a nervous system associated malignancy or a malignancy derived from non-nervous system tissue, (4) infectious lesions, in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured as a result of infection, for example, by an abscess or associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus, herpes zoster, or herpes simplex virus or with Lyme disease, tuberculosis, syphilis, (5) degenerative lesions, in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured as a result of a degenerative process including but not limited to degeneration associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), (6) lesions associated with nutritional diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions, in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by a nutritional disorder or disorder of metabolism including but not limited to, vitamin B 12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, Wernicke disease, tobacco-alcohol amblyopia, Marchiafava-Bignami disease (primary degeneration of the corpus callosum), and alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, (7) neurological lesions associated with systemic diseases including, but not limited to, diabetes (diabetic neuropathy, Bell's palsy), systemic lupus erythematosus, carcinoma, or sarcoidosis, (8) lesions caused by toxic substances including alcohol, lead, or particular neurotoxins, (9) demyelinated lesions in which a portion of the nervous system is destroyed or injured by a demyelinating disease including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus-associated myelopathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and central pontine myelinolysis or a myelopathy, e.g., diabetic meylopathy or a transverse myelopathy, (10) neurological conditions such as insomnia, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, addiction to a drug, substance such as tobacco, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, a barbiturate, a tranquilizer, a narcotic such as hydromorphone HCl, propoxyphene napsylate, meperidine HCl, codeine, cocaine, morphine, heroin or methadone and (11) cognitive dysfunction conditions or diseases such as one or more of impaired long-term or short-term memory, impaired concentration impaired attention or impaired learning, where the cognitive dysfunction condition or disease is optionally associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy or exposure, aging, trauma, e.g., CNS trauma, or neurodegeneration.","The formula 1 compounds are useful to ameliorate, treat or prevent the onset, severity or length of other neurological diseases or conditions such as headache or a migraine condition or symptom such as classic migraine, cluster headache, abdominal migraine, common migraine, hemiplegic migraine, ocular migraine, fulminating migraine, complicated migraine or a symptom of any of these such as head pain, vertigo, nausea, vomiting or potophobia.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is used to protect neural cells from the damaging effects of cerebral hypoxia, cerebral ischemia or neural cell injury associated with cerebral infarction, heart attack, stroke or elevated levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. The compounds are also useful for treating or preventing a nervous system disorder may be selected, e.g., by assaying their biological activity in promoting the survival or differentiation of neurons. For example, and not by way of limitation, compositions of the invention which elicit any of the following effects are useful: (1) increased survival time of neurons in culture, (2) increased sprouting of neurons in culture or in vivo, (3) increased production of a neuron-associated molecule in culture or in vivo, e.g., dopamine or choline acetyltransferase or acetylcholinesterase with respect to motor neurons or (4) decreased symptoms of neuron dysfunction in vivo. Such effects may be measured by any method known in the art. Increased survival of neurons may be measured using known methods, such as, for example, the method set forth in Arakawa et al. (10:3507-3515 1990); increased sprouting of neurons may be detected by methods known in the art, such as the methods set forth in Pestronk et al. (70:65-82 1980) or Brown et al. (4:17-42 1981). Increased production of neuron-associated molecules may be measured by, e.g., bioassay, enzymatic assay, antibody binding or Northern blot assay, using techniques known in the art and depending on the molecule to be measured. Motor neuron dysfunction may be measured by assessing the physical manifestation of motor neuron disorder, e.g., weakness, motor neuron conduction velocity, or functional disability. In other embodiments, motor neuron diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions that may be treated, prevented, and\/or ameliorated include diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions such as infarction, infection, exposure to toxin, trauma, surgical damage, degenerative disease or malignancy that may affect motor neurons as well as other components of the nervous system, as well as diseases, disorders, and\/or conditions that selectively affect neurons such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and including, but not limited to, progressive spinal muscular atrophy, progressive bulbar palsy, primary lateral sclerosis, infantile and juvenile muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis and the post polio syndrome, and hereditary motorsensory neuropathy.","In some conditions such as mood changes, depression anxiety, memory loss or motor function impairment, the formula 1 compounds can modulate one or more biological activities of a transcription factor or a steroid receptor such as ER\u03b1 in tissue such as the hypothalamus or amygdala or ER\u03b2 in tissue such as the hippocampus, thalamus or entorhinal cortex.","For any of these diseases, conditions or their associated symptoms, the presence of the disease, condition or symptom may be determined by suitable objective or subjective means, e.g., assays to detect tissue damage, levels of diagnostic markers, or an etiological agent, patient questionaires or behavior performance tests, measurement of a diagnostic marker(s), e.g., an enzyme, hormone, cytokine or drug substance in blood or tissue, electroencephalography, imaging methods such as X-ray, MRI scan or CAT scan, observation and diagnosis of clinical features or symptoms or biopsy of affected tissue or cells, e.g., aspiration biopsy, needle biopsy, incision biopsy or punch biopsy of tissue or cells. Neurological conditions, diseases and symptoms, which the formula 1 compounds can be used to treat or ameliorate and methods to diagnose and characterize such conditions or diseases have been described.

Lopes Da Silva, eds. 4ed. 1999 see, e.g., pages 13-1238, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, ISBN 0683302841. The use of the formula 1 compounds in these conditions is optionally combined with one or more of the therapeutic treatments that are described in these references. The formula 1 compound may be administered before, during or after another treatment is employed to treat or ameliorate a given neurological disease, condition or symptom.","Dosages of the formula 1 compound, routes of administration and the use of combination therapies with other standard therapeutic agents or treatments could be applied essentially as described above for cardiovascular conditions or as disclosed elsewhere herein. Thus, the formula 1 compounds may be administered prophylactically or therapeutically in chronic conditions or they may be administered at the time of or relatively soon after an acute event such as an epileptic seizure, onset of a migraine or occurrence of trauma, accidental head or central nervous system injury or a cereberal stroke or infarction. For acute events, the formula 1 compounds may thus be administered concurrently, e.g., within about 15 minutes or about 30 minutes of the onset or occurrence of the acute event, or at a later time, e.g., at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 or 120 hours after the onset or occurrence of the acute event. The formula 1 compounds may thus be administered at about 6-120 hours, or about 8-48 hours, about 10-24 hours or about 12-16 hours after an acute event starts or occurs.","Skin treatments. The affect of the formula 1 compounds on immune function permits their use to improve the function of organs or organ systems that rely on the optimal functioning of one or more immune responses. Thus, the formula 1 compounds can be administered to a subject to prevent, treat, ameliorate, slow the progression of or enhance the healing of certain skin conditions such as skin inflammation, lesions, atrophy or rash. As used here, skin includes external skin and internal skin or surfaces such as oral, intestinal and rectal mucosa. These conditions include lesions, rashes or inflammation associated with, e.g., burns, infections and the thinning or general degradation of the dermis often characterized by a decrease in collagen or elastin as well as decreased number, size and doubling potential of fibroblast cells. Such skin conditions include keratoses such as actinic keratosis, psoriasis, eczema, warts such as papillomavirus-induced warts, ulcers or lesions such as herpesvirus-induced ulcers or lesions or diabetes associated ulcers or lesions, discoid lupus erythematosus, erythema nodosum, erythema multiform, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, atopic dermatitis, inflammatory vasculitis, relapsing polychondritis, exfoliative dermatitis, sarcoidosis, burns, melanoma, rash or irritation from poison oak, poison ivy or poison Sumac, blemished or hyperpigmented skin, hyperkeratotic skin, dry skin, dandruff, acne, inflammatory dermatoses, scarring such as from a chemical or thermal burn and age-related skin changes. In these embodiments, treatment with the formula 1 compounds is optionally combined with other appropriate treatments or therapies essentially as described herein, e.g., one or more of a corticosteroid such as hydrocortisone or cortisol, prednisone, or prednisolone, an \u03b1-hydroxybenzoic acid or an \u03b1-hydroxycarboxylic acid(s) is coadministered with a formula 1 compound to treat, prevent or ameliorate a skin condition such as atrophy or a lesion. \u03b1-Hydroxybenzoic acids and \u03b1-hydroxycarboxylic acids suitable for use in these embodiments are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,262,407, 5,254,343, 4,246,261, 4,234,599 and 3,984,566. The formula 1 compound can be used to minimize cutaneous atrophy caused by corticosteroids, a side-effect of their application to the skin.","In these embodiments that address skin conditions, dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essentially as described herein. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject in the form of a topical cream, ointment, spray, foam or gel. These topical formulations will optionally comprise about 0.1% w\/w to about 20% w\/w, or about 0.2% w\/w to about 10% w\/w of a formula 1 compound in a composition that comprises one or more excipients that are suitable for such topical formulations, including, e.g., one or more agents that enhance penetration or delivery of the formula 1 compound into the skin. Such topical formulations can be administered, e.g., once, twice or three times per day using about 0.1 g to about 8 g or about 0.2 g to about 5 g of the topical formulation on each occasion. Administration may be daily for about 1 to about 28 days, or it may be intermittent and used as needed. The amount of a topical formulation that can be administered may be higher, e.g., about 15 g or about 20 g, if the size of the area to be treated is relatively large, e.g., at least about 30 cmto about 100 cmor more. Alternatively, systemic administration of the formula 1 compound such as oral, parenteral, sublingual or buccal delivery may be used, particularly when the area of the skin to be treated is relatively large. In some cases, both topical and systemic administration of a formula 1 compound can be used. Excipients that topical or other formulations may contain include those described herein, or agents that enhance permeation or solubilization of the formula 1 compound, e.g., DMSO or an alkylalkanol, such as a 2-alkylalkanol or a 3-alkyloctanol that comprises about 8-36 carbon atoms (e.g., 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or 20 carbon atoms) such as 2-ethyloctanol, 2-propyloctanol, 2-octyldodecanol, 2-butyloctanol, 2-hexyldecanol, 2-pentylnonanol, 3-ethyloctanol, 3-propyloctanol, 3-octyldodecanol, 3-butyloctanol, 3-hexyldecanol, 3-pentylnonanol, isostearyl alcohol, isocetyl alcohol, or mixtures thereof. Such alkylalkanol moieties include those having the structure HO\u2014CH\u2014(CH)\u2014CH(C1-10 alkyl)-(CH)\u2014CH, any of which are optionally substituted at the alkanol or the alkyl moiety with one, two, three or more independently selected substituents as described herein, e.g., with one, two, three or more independently selected \u2014O\u2014, \u2014F, \u2014OH, \u2014CN or \u2014CH\u2550CH\u2014 moieties. Such formulations can be used in therapeutic applications described herein or in cosmetic applications.","Enhancement of hematopoiesis. The invention includes methods to treat or prevent various blood cell deficiencies such as TP or NP. Without being bound to any theory, the treatment methods may at least in part result in enhanced hematopoiesis (or hemopoiesis) or the treatment methods may reduce the loss of cells such as platelets or neutrophils. Increased platelet or neutrophil production or reduced loss is typically observed as increased circulating blood cell counts. Thus, invention aspects comprise methods to treat or prevent neutropenia in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to a subject in need, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound.","Normal ranges of various white blood cells or blood components in adult (about 18-49 years of age) human blood are as follows. Total adult white blood cell counts average about 7500\/mm, with an approximate normal range of about 4.5-11.0\u00d710\/mm. The normal basophil level is about 35 mm, with a normal range of about 10-100\/mm. The normal adult neutrophil level is about 4400\/mm, with a normal range of about 2000-7700\/mm. The normal eosinophil level is about 275 mm, with a normal range of about 150-300\/mm. The normal monocyte level is about 540 mm, with a normal range of about 300-600\/mm. The normal adult platelet level is about 2.5\u00d710\/mm, with a normal range of about 2.1\u00d710-2.9\u00d710\/mm. The normal adult red cell mass corresponds to about 4.6\u00d710red cells\/L in females and about 5.2\u00d710red cells\/L in males.","Thus, a human patient in need of treatment will typically have, or be subject to, a cell count below these values. As used herein, neutropenia means generally a circulating neutrophil count of less than about 1800\/mm, generally a count of about 1500\/mmor less. Thrmobocytopenia generally means a circulating platelet count of less than about 1.6\u00d710\/mm, less than about 1.5\u00d710\/mm, less than about 1.3\u00d710\/mmor less than about 1.0\u00d710\/mm. Anemia generally means a red cell mass corresponding to less than about 4.0\u00d710red cells\/L in adult females and less than about 4.5\u00d710red cells\/L in adult males (a hemoglobin level of less than about 12.0 g\/dL in adult females and less than about 13.5 g\/dL in adult males).","In some cases, the diagnosis of a deficiency may cover a cell count that falls outside these ranges, due, e.g., to individual variations in a subject's age, sex, race, animal strain or normal blood cell status for the individual. Such variations are identified by known means such as by identification of a change from the subject's normal status or by multiple cell measurements over time that reveal a deficiency. See, e.g., 2edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 1995. Subjects with an identified or identifiable deficiency outside these standard ranges are included in the definition of a blood cell deficiency or a subject in need of treatment, as used herein.","Specific conditions that are amenable to prophylaxis or treatment by the invention methods include the acquired blood cell deficiencies. Exemplary deficiencies or groups of deficiencies are neonatal alloimmune TP, immune TP, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion purpura, radiation associated TP, chemotherapy associated TP (e.g., NSAID treatments such as with indomethicin, ibuprofen, naproxen, phenylbutazone, piroxicam or zompirac, or \u03b2-lactam antibiotic treatments such as with ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, or cephalosporin treatments such as with cefazolin, cefoxitin or cephalothin, anticoagulant treatments such as heparin, hirudin, lepirudin or aspirin, treatment with plasma expanders or psychotropic drugs), amegakaryocitic TP, chemotherapy associated TP, radiation associated TP, TP associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), cardiopulmonary bypass surgery or chemotherapy associated TP (e.g., an anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal or antiparasite therapy), cardiovascular disease or therapy associated TP (e.g., congenital cyanotic heart disease, valvular heart disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension disorders or diltiazem, nifedipine, nitroglycerin or nitroprusside therapy), TP associated with chronic or acute renal failure or treatment for these conditions (e.g., dialysis), TP associated with infection such as a virus or bacterial infection, postinfectious NP, drug-induced NP, autoimmune NP, chronic idiopathic NP, basophilic leukopenia, eosinophilic leukopenia, monocytic leukopenia, neutrophilic leukopenia, cyclic NP, periodic NP, chemotherapy associated NP, radiation associated NP, chemotherapy associated NP, radiation associated NP, NP associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), chemotherapy associated leukopenia, radiation associated leukopenia, leukopenia associated with solid organ allograft or xenograft rejection or immune suppression therapy in solid organ or other tissue transplants (e.g., liver, lung, kidney, heart, bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cell or endothelial cell transplant, implant or transfusion), immune hemolytic anemias, anemia associated with chronic or acute renal failure or treatment for these conditions (e.g., dialysis), anemia associated with chemotherapy (e.g., isoniazid, prednisone) or anemia associated with radiation therapy.","Some of the blood cell deficiencies are associated with, or caused by, other therapeutic treatments, e.g., cancer chemotherapy, anti-pathogen chemotherapy, radiation therapy and chemotherapy for suppression of autoimmunity or immune suppression therapy for organ or tissue transplantation or implantation. The formula 1 compounds are thus useful to facilitate or speed up immune system recovery in autologous bone marrow transplant or stem cell transplant situations. In many cases it would be medically sound to continue the treatment associated with causing or exacerbating the blood cell deficiency. Thus, one would generally conduct the invention methods with subjects who are undergoing another therapy at the same time or near the same time, e.g., within a few days to within about 1-6 months. Such subjects typically will have an identified blood cell deficiency such as a NP or a TP, e.g., as disclosed herein. However, the formula 1 compounds are generally suitable for preventing the onset of such deficiencies, and they can thus be used prophylactically in these indications. The invention includes all of these embodiments.","In some embodiments, the invention method is accomplished using an effective amount of one or more growth factors or cytokines as a means to further enhance the effect of the formula 1 compounds for their intended uses or to modulate their effects. Suitable growth factors and cytokines are as described herein or in the cited references. For example, when one administers the formula 1 compound to enhance generation of platelets in humans or other subjects, or their precursor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-Mk, CFU-Mk, immature megakaryocytes or mature postmitotic megakaryocytes, one can also administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, SCF, Steel factor (\u201cSF\u201d), leukemia inhibitory factor (\u201cLIF\u201d), interkeukin-1\u03b1, (\u201cIL-1\u03b1\u201d), IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, TPO, EPO, their isoforms, their derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. Similarly, administration of the formula 1 compound to enhance the generation or function of myelomonocytic cells such as neutrophils, basophils or monocytes in humans or other subjects, one can also administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, M-CSF, LIF, TPO, SF, interleukin-1 (\u201cIL-1\u201d), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, interleukin-5 (\u201cIL-5\u201d), IL-6, IL-11, interleukin-12 (\u201cIL-12\u201d), interleukin-13 (\u201cIL-13\u201d), FLT3 ligand, their isoforms, homologs or derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. To enhance generation of red cells or their precursor cells such as CFU-GEMM, BFU-E or CFU-E in humans being treated with a formula 1 compound, one can co-administer one or more of G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, TPO, EPO, transforming growth factor-[3], their isoforms, their derivatives (e.g., linked to a PEG or fusions such as PIXY321) or their homologs for other species. See, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2000 (see, e.g., Chapters 14-17 at pages 154-260). The co-administration of such factors in these methods is intended to enhance the efficacy of the formula 1 compound treatment, which is optionally measured by taking suitable blood or tissue, e.g., bone marrow, samples at one or more times before and after the compounds have been administered. Such co-administration will generally be compatible with a subject's condition and other therapeutic treatments. Co-administration of such factors can precede, be simultaneous with, or follow the times of administration of the formula 1 compound(s) to the subject. Dosages of such growth factors would generally be similar to those previously described, e.g., typically an initial course of treatment comprises administering about 1.0 to about 20 \u03bcg\/kg\/d for about 1-10 days, or as described in, e.g., 3edition, R. Hoffman, E. J. Benz Jr. et al., editors, Churchill Livingstone, New York, 2000 (see, e.g., Chapter 51 at pages 939-979 and the references cited therein).","In cases where a subject's blood cell deficiency is caused by, or associated with another therapy, the invention contemplates that the other therapy will continue, if this is reasonable under the circumstances. The timing of other therapies can precede, be simultaneous with, or follow the times of administration of the formula 1 compound(s) to the subject. For example, chemotherapy for some malignancies is accompanied by myelosuppression or a deficiency in one or more blood cell types, e.g., TP or NP. Continued treatment would be called for in some cases, and then the invention methods would be employed to deliver to the subject an effective amount of a formula 1 compound. Thus, alkylating agents, antimicrotubule agents, antimetabolites, topoisomerase I or II inhibitors, or platinum compounds such as one or more of mechlorethamine, vincristine, vinblastine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, methotrexate, ifosfamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, busulfan, carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin, dacarbazine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel (taxol), docetaxel, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, fludarabine, 2\u2032-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2\u2032-deoxycoformycin, 6-thioguanine, 6-mercaptopurine, 5-azacytidine, gemcitabine, arabinofuranosylguanine, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, amsacrine, topotecan, irinotecan, cisplatin, carboplatin, pilcamycin, procarbazine, aspariginase, aminoglutethimide, actinomycin D, azathioprine and gallium nitrate may be administered in conjunction with administration of any formula 1 compound(s) that is disclosed herein. Treatments with other therapeutic agents such as heparin or nucleoside analogs such as 3-thiacytosine, azidothymidine or dideoxycytosine, or other antimicrobials such as cephalosporin, quinine, quinidine, gold salts (e.g., aurothioglucose), a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin), clarithromycin, fluconazole, fusidic acid, gentamycin, nalidixic acid, penicillins, pentamidine, rifampicin, sulfa antibiotics, suramin or vancomycin may result in a blood cell deficiency(s) and they can thus be combined with administration of a formula 1 compound to treat the deficiency, or to ameliorate a symptom thereof. Similarly, anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., salicylates, entanercept (a dimeric fusion comprising a portion of the human TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 containing the C2 and C3 domain and hinge regions of IgG1) or a COX-2 inhibitor such as celexicob (4-5[-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide) or rofecoxib (4-[4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3-phenyl-2(5H)-furanone) or an IL-1 receptor antagonist such as anakinra), cardiac drugs (e.g., digitoxin), \u03b2-blockers or antihypertensive drugs (e.g., oxprenolol or captopril), diuretics (e.g., spironolactone), benzodiazepines, (e.g., diazepam) or antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline, doxepin). Any of these methods also optionally include co-administration of one or more of the growth factors described above, e.g., IL-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF or TPO.","In some embodiments, the formula 1 compounds that are used to enhance hematopoiesis or to treat associated conditions such as a TP or a NP disease or condition as disclosed herein, are characterized by having a lack of appreciable androgenicity. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compounds are characterized by having about 30% or less, about 20% or less, about 10% or less or about 5% or less of the androgenicity of an androgen such as testosterone, testosterone proprionate, dihydrotestosterone or dihydrotestosterone proprionate as measured in a suitable assay using suitable positive and\/or negative controls. Suitable assays for androgenicity of various compounds have been described, e.g., J. R. Brooks, et al., 1991, 18:215-227, M. Gerrity et al., 1981 4:494-504, S. S. Rao et al., 1969 7:20-22, O. Sunami et al., 2000 25:403-415, G. H. Deckers et al., 2000 74:83-92. The androgenicity of the formula 1 compounds are optionally determined as described or essentially as described in one or more of these assays or any other assay. Thus, one such embodiment comprises a method to enhance hematopoiesis or to treat TP or NP comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a formula 1 compound, or delivering to the subject's tissues an effective amount of a formula 1 compound, wherein the formula 1 compound has about 30% or less, about 20% or less, about 10% or less or about 5% or less of the androgenicity of an androgen such as testosterone, testosterone proprionate, dihydrotestosterone or dihydrotestosterone proprionate as measured in a suitable assay, e.g., as described in the citations above. In conducting such methods, the subjects, e.g., rodents, humans or primates, are optionally monitored for e.g., amelioration, prevention or a reduced severity of a disease, condition or symptom. Such monitoring can optionally include measuring one or more of cytokines (e.g., TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), WBCs, platelets, granulocytes, neutrophils, RBCs, NK cells, macrophages or other immune cell types, e.g., as described herein or in the cited references, in circulation at suitable times, e.g., at baseline before treatment is started and at various times after treatment with a formula 1 compound such as at about 2-45 days after treatment with a formula 1 compound has ended.","In related embodiments, the activity or numbers of neutrophils or monocytes is enhanced by co-administering the formula 1 compound with an neutrophil or monocyte stimulator, which is an non-protein agent or molecule that can stimulate the activity or number of neutrophils or monocytes in a subject. This aspect of the present invention encompasses any technique to enhance neutrophil or monocyte counts or activity. Means to accomplish this include administering an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an effective amount of one or more of lithium, e.g., in the form of a salt such as lithium carbonate or chloride, deuterium oxide, levamisole (an antihelminthic agent), lactoferrin, thyroxine, tri-iodothyroxine, anthrax toxin, ascorbic acid, I-palmitoyl-lysophosphatidic acid, a calcium ionophore, e.g., A23187, cytochalasin B, sodium butyrate, piracetamine, micronized L-arginine, hydroxyurea and a bacterial lipopolysaccharide.","The neutrophil or monocyte stimulator can be administered at various time relative to administration of the formula 1 compound, including about 2-4 hours to about 1 or 2 weeks before administering the formula 1 compound and including administration that is essentially simultaneous with administering the formula 1 compound. Typically a neutrophil or monocyte stimulator will be dosed according to known methods, including daily dosing of about 0.01 mg\/kg\/day to about 25 mg\/kg\/day. For example, about 1 g\/day of ascorbic acid (e.g., about 0.5 to about 1.5 g\/day) can be administered to humans. When deuterium oxide is used as a neutrophil or monocyte stimulator, liquid aqueous formulations may comprise a formula 1 compound and deuterium oxide in place of some or all of the water. Naturally occurring water contains approximately 1 part of deuterium oxide per 6500 parts water. Thus, the water present in a formulation may comprise, e.g., at least 1 part DO in 6000 parts HO, or at least 1 part in 100 parts, or about 50 parts or more per 100 parts of water. These aqueous formulations may comprise one or more additional excipients such as a cyclodextrin such as hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Formulations comprising cyclodextrin and deuterium oxide, or comprising cyclodextrin, deuterium oxide and water, may thus comprise deuterium oxide in an amount greater than 1 part per 6500 parts water, such as 1 part deuterium oxide per 1-100 parts water, e.g., 50 parts deuterium oxide per 100 parts water. The amount of cyclodextrin can be in the range of from about 2 to about 85 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide, such as in the range of from about 5 to about 70 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide, one example of a suitable amount being in the range of about 45 grams per liter of water and\/or deuterium oxide.","In conducting any of these methods, one can monitor the subject's clinical condition at any relevant time before, during or after administration of the formula 1 compounds, which treatments are optionally combined with any of the other agents or treatments disclosed herein, such as cytokines, interleukins or an agent or molecule that can stimulate the activity or number of neutrophils or monocytes. The subject's blood can be drawn on one, two or more occasions in advance of treatment to, e.g., obtain a baseline or initial level of white or red blood cells, to verify a presumptive diagnosis of a blood cell deficiency or to determine a blood parameter such as circulating myelomonocyte counts, circulating neutrophil counts, circulating platelet counts or the myeloperoxidase index. Then, during the course of treatment or thereafter the subject's blood can be drawn on one, two or more occasions to follow the subject's response.","Invention embodiments include methods that comprise administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a formula 1 compound and an effective amount of at least one form of interferon, such as \u03b3-Interferon or a growth factor or interleukin such as G-CSF or IL-6. Interferons can enhance the biological activity of the white cells that arise from increased hemopoiesis. This can be particularly useful when the subject's circulating blood cell deficiency is associated with, e.g., an infection or a chemotherapy that suppresses hemopoiesis. Administration of an growth factor or an interleukin such as IL-6 can facilitate hemopoiesis by stimulating quiescent stem cells or other progenitors that give rise to deficient cell types. Related embodiments replace growth factor or interferon administration partially or completely by increasing endogenous production in the subject using conventional methods, e.g., administering double stranded RNA to stimulate \u03b3-IFN.","For cases where \u03b3-IFN is administered, the administration is usually relatively constant, e.g., daily. This is because in patients in whom \u03b3-IFN is not generated endogenously in significant amounts, there is a tendency for levels of \u03b3-IFN to drop relatively quickly, i.e., within one day. In other words, in a patient in whom initially, \u03b3-IFN levels are close to zero, it should be administered in an amount which is effective to bring \u03b3-IFN levels to within normal levels, e.g., up to 10 nanograms per milliliter, and a similar amount of \u03b3-IFN should be administered each day thereafter.","Suitable forms of \u03b3-IFN and their biological properties and methods to obtain them have been described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,289,690, 4,314,935, 4,382,027, 4,376,821; 4,376,822, 4,460,685, 4,604,284 and 5,145,677, European patent publication nos. EP 063,482 EP 088 540, and EP 087 686, N. Fujii et al., 1983 130:1683-86. A. Zlotnick et al., 1983 131:794-80, M. deLey et al., 1980 10:877-83, F. Dianzani et al., 1980 29:561-63, G. H. Reem et al., 1982 37:216-21 (1982), R.

Novick et al., 1983 2:1527-30.","An aspect of the invention is method to enhance hemopoiesis in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a compound of formula 1. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is not 5-androstene-3\u03b2-ol-17-one, 5-androstene-3\u03b2,17\u03b2-diol, 5-androstene-3\u03b2,7\u03b2,17\u03b2-triol or a derivative of any of these three compounds that can convert to these compounds by hydrolysis. Exemplary formula 1 compounds in this method include compounds wherein (1) one or two Rat the 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14 positions is not \u2014H, wherein the one or two Rat the 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 14 positions are independently selected from \u2014F, \u2014Cl, \u2014Br, \u2014I, \u2014OH, \u2550O, \u2014CH, \u2014CH, an ether optionally selected from \u2014OCHand \u2014OCH, and an ester optionally selected from \u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014CHand \u2014O\u2014C(O)\u2014CH, and\/or (2) R, R, Rand Rare independently selected from \u2014H, \u2014OH, \u2550O, an ester and an ether. In these embodiments, the subject may have thrombocytopenia or neutropenia or the subject's circulating platelets, red cells, mature myelomonocytic cells, or their precursor cells, in circulation or in tissue may be detectably increased. In some cases the subject has renal failure. These methods may further comprise the steps of obtaining blood from the subject before administration of the formula 1 compound and measuring the subject's white or red cell counts and optionally, on one, two, three or more occasions, measuring the subject's circulating white cell or red cell counts after administration of the formula 1 compound, e.g., within about 12 weeks after an initial administration of a formula 1 compound or during or within about 12 weeks after a course of treatment. Such a treatment course may as described herein.","In any of the methods disclosed herein, a treatment may be interrupted briefly or for extended periods of time. The reason for such interruption can be any of a wide variety, e.g., patient non-compliance, apparent improvement in a subject's condition or by design. Any such interruption would not take a regimen outside the scope of the present invention. For example, a patient might miss a day or several days of administration. Similarly, the regimen might call for administration of one or more compounds for one or more day, and then non-administration of the one or more compounds for one or more day, and then resumption of the administration of the one or more compounds. Furthermore, a regimen according to the present invention can be altered in view of a patient's current condition, and can continue for any length of time, including the entire subject's lifetime.","For administration of \u03b3-IFN, a volume of about 1 mL of a solid or liquid sublingual formulation that comprises about 100 micrograms of \u03b3-IFN may be used. An exemplary liquid formulation comprises a saline solution containing 45 weight % \u03b2-hydroxypropylcyclodextrin. It would be expected that such a dosage would provide in the range of 30 to 40 micrograms of \u03b3-IFN to the patient's blood. Such sublingual formulations would be held under the patient's tongue for a period of time sufficient to allow some or all of the \u03b3-IFN to be delivered to the patient while held under the patient's tongue. Such administration has not been previously known in the art, in which conventionally, it has been thought that administration of \u03b3-IFN must be by injection, e.g., subcutaneous injection. Subcutaneous injection of \u03b3-IFN is associated with unwanted side effects, including fatigue, headache, night sweats, fever, local pain at the injection site, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and others. The above-described sublingual \u03b3-IFN formulations of the present invention is an aspect of the present invention, which can be of use in accordance with other aspects of the present invention as described herein. In general, however, a wide variety of routes of administration could be employed for \u03b3-IFN in accordance with the present invention, including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,677.","Modulation of transcription factors, receptors and gene expression. In treating any of the diseases, conditions or symptoms disclosed herein, the formula 1 compounds can modulate, i.e., detectably enhance or increase or detectably inhibit or decrease, the expression or a biological activity(ies) of one or more transcription factors or receptors. This can lead to detectable modulation of target gene activity or expression as part of the treatment or amelioration of the disease, condition or symptom. Such modulation can arise from changes in the capacity of a transcription factor or receptor to bind to or form a complex with other natural ligands such as a target DNA sequence(s), another transcription factor(s), a transcription cofactor, a receptor such as a steroid receptor or cell membrane receptor (e.g., a lipid, peptide, protein or glycoprotein receptor such as an interleukin receptor or a growth factor receptor), a receptor cofactor or an enzyme such as a polymerase, kinase, phosphatase or transferase. The effects of formula 1 compounds on these biomolecules can be exerted in immune cells or in non-immune tissue, e.g., cells or tissue adjacent to diseased tissue such as infected or malignant cells. The formula 1 compounds may directly or indirectly modulate the capacity of any of these molecules to transduce signals that are part of normal signal trandsuction processes.","In many of the clinical conditions described herein, e.g., in cancers, infections, acute inflammation, chronic inflammation or autoimmunity, the formula 1 compounds can modulate, e.g., detectably decrease or increase, a biological activity(ies), protein or molecule level or RNA level of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more biomolecules that are involved in establishment, maintenance or progression of a disease, condition or symptom. Such biomolecules include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more of AP-1, a cyclooxygenase such as cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), TNF\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 receptor 1, TNF\u03b1 receptor 2, TNF receptor-associated factor, TNF\u03b2, TNF\u03b2 receptor, MIP-1\u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant-1 (MCP-1), interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3 or \u03b3IFN), IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1 receptor, IL-1\u03b2 receptor, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), IL-5, IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), IL-8, IL-8 receptor (IL-8R), IL-10, IL-10 receptor (IL-10R), IL-12, an IL-12 receptor, (e.g., IL-12R\u03b22), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), AP-1, c-maf, v-maf, mafB, NrI, mafK, mafG, the maf family protein p18, reactive oxygen species, e.g., hydrogen peroxide or superoxide ion (collectively ROS), a 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17\u03b2-HSD) or an 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD), e.g., 11\u03b2-HSD type 1, 11\u03b2-HSD type 2, 17\u03b2-HSD type 1, 17\u03b2-HSD type 2 or 17\u03b2-HSD type 5, a steroid aromatase, e.g., cytochrome P450 aromatase, steroid 5\u03b1-reductase, serum or blood cortisol cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), a prostaglandin, e.g., prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), a leukotriene, e.g., leukotriene B4, inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO), GM-CSF, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted), eotaxin, GATA-3, CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR4, in, e.g., a subject's cell(s) or tissue(s) or in enzyme, tissue or cell-based assays. In these subjects, the levels of other biomolecules, their RNAs or the level of their activity can be detectably modulated include IFN\u03b1, INF\u03b1 receptor, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b4 or a transcription factor such as T-bet is detectably increased. Other biomolecules or their polymorphs or homologs that the formula 1 compounds directly or indirectly modulate include one or more of, e.g., Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).

Methods to identify these molecules and their biological activities have been described, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,248,781, 6,242,253, 6,180,681, 6,174,676, 6,090,561, 6,090,542, 6,074,850, 6,063,583, 6,051,373, 6,024,940, 5,989,810, 5,958,671, 5,925,657, 5,958,671, 5,844,082, 5,837,840, 5,770,581, 5,756,673, and PCT publication Nos. WO 00\/24245, WO 0073453 and WO 97\/39721.","In one aspect, the compounds are used to treat, prevent or to ameliorate conditions or symptoms that are associated with unwanted or expression or activity of one or more of these molecules in conditions such as, e.g., acute inflammation, chronic inflammation or their symptoms, acute allergy, chronic allergy or their symptoms, e.g., allergic rhinitis or acute or chronic asthma, psoriatic arthritis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological dysfunction or their symptoms, e.g., dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, or memory loss conditions, in osteoporosis or in cancer such as breast cancer. The compounds can prevent NF\u03baB from translocating from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and thus can increase the ratio of cytoplasmic NF\u03baB to nuclear NF\u03baB. The formula 1 compounds may inhibit activation of NF\u03baB-mediated transcription while NF\u03baB is bound to target DNA sequences in the nucleus. Alternatively, the formula 1 compounds can activate or enhance the expression of or one or more activity of a transcription factor such as T-bet in, e.g., a subject's cell(s) or tissue(s) or in enzyme or cell-based assays. In this aspect the compounds are used to treat, prevent or to ameliorate conditions or symptoms that are associated with deficient expression or activity of T-bet in conditions such as immune dysfunction in an immunosuppression condition, aging, an infection, a cancer or precancer as described herein or in the cited references.","Thus, in some embodiments, the level or a biological activity of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 or more of COX-2, IL-1\u03b2, TNF\u03b1, TNF\u03b1 receptor 1, TNF\u03b1 receptor 2, TNF receptor-associated factor, MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, IFN\u03b3, IL-4, IL-4R, IL-6, IL-6R, IL-8, IL-8R, IL-10, IL-10R, NF\u03baB, IkB\u03b1, AP-1, GATA-3, 11\u03b2-HSD1, cPLA2, iPLA2, cortisol, ROS, PGE2, PGD2, leukotriene A4, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, iNOS or GM-CSF are optionally measured and they are generally detectably reduced, e.g., RNA or protein levels are reduced by about 10-95% or about 20-95% or more compared to suitable untreated controls. In these embodiments, the level or a biological activity of 4, 5, 6 or more of IFN\u03b1, INF\u03b1 receptor, IL-12, an IL-12 receptor, (e.g., IL-12R\u03b22), PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and T-bet are optionally measured and they are generally detectably increased. In a chronic infection condition, e.g., HIV in humans, autoimmunity, a chronic fungal or parasite infection or in a precancer or cancer condition, e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, the progression of the condition may be slowed over a period of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more years. In these embodiments, the subject's condition becomes more manageable with a reduced incidence or severity of side effects, e.g., a detectable halt, slowing, reversal or decreased incidence of wasting, dementia, CD4 cell count decreases or viral load increases, which tend to occur over time in HIV infected humans or a halt, slowing or reversal of pathogen or precancer or cancer cell replication. The detectable halt, slowing, reversal of the condition or decreased incidence of side effects can be observed as a decrease of about 10% or more, e.g., about a 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or more decline.","These effects are typically observed after administration of an effective amount of a formula 1 compound using, e.g., a method or dose essentially as disclosed herein. The simultaneous reduction of multiple biomolecules provides a method to modulate immune responses by modulating multiple pathways that lead to a common condition such as inflammation. This provides a method to treat or ameliorate, e.g., acute or chronic inflammation, a cancer, an infection or a symptom associated therewith, or to slow the progression of or reduce the severity of these conditions or their symptoms.","Previously described methods can be used to measure the amount, activity or cellular location of various biomolecules such as cytokines or transcription factors. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,107,034, 5,925,657, 5,658,744, 4,016,043 and 3,850,752, S. Szabo et al., 2000 100:655-669, Y. Nakamura et al., 1999 103(2 pt. 1):215-222., R. V. Hoch et al., 1999 84:122-128. These methods can be used to measure the effects of the formula 1 compounds on transcription factors or receptors in cells or tissues that have been exposed to the compounds.","Without wishing to be bound to any theory, the formula 1 compounds may modulate multiple biomolecules in a microenvironment sensitive manner or context. The effects of the compounds can provide a decrease in a particular molecule such as IFN\u03b3 and a decrease in inflammation associated with elevated IFN\u03b3 levels or activity without eliminating beneficial effects of the molecule. This effect arises from decreasing the level or activity of a biomolecule such as IFN\u03b3 in cells that are dysregulated, while allowing normal immune cells to produce sufficient amounts of the same molecule to perform normal immune functions. In locations where the biomolecule is needed for activity, e.g., in lymph nodes or spleen cells, sufficient amounts of the modulated molecule are present to elicit a desired response, while the level of the molecule in cells in circulation decreases. The compounds can increase IL-13, IL-15, IL-17 or IL-18 in conditions where a subject has a deficient Th1 immune response, e.g., in infection or cancer. Conversely, the compounds can decrease IL-13, IL-15 or IL-18 in conditions such as allergy or autoimmune conditions, e.g., multiple sclerosis, where an excess Th1 immune status may prevail.","In general, the formula 1 compounds will detectably decrease the synthesis or one or more biological activity of one or more of these molecules (or other transcription factors or receptors disclosed herein) when such synthesis or activities is associated with the establishment, maintenance, progression or enhanced severity of a clinical condition or symptom disclosed herein. Conversely, the formula 1 compounds will generally detectably increase the synthesis or one or more biological activities of one or more of these molecules (or other transcription factors or receptors disclosed herein) when such synthesis or activity is associated with the treatment, prevention, cure or amelioration of a clinical condition or symptom disclosed herein.","These decreases or increases compared to suitable controls can be relatively small, including changes near the lower limits of delectability for such molecules using known or new assays, e.g., a decrease or increase in the synthesis or biological activity of at least about 2%, about 5%, about 10% or about 20%. Such changes can be modest or relatively large, e.g., at least about a 50% change, at least about a 90% change, or at least about a 200% change, up to about a 5-fold, about a 10-fold, about a 100-fold or greater decrease or increase in the synthesis or biological activity of the affected molecule(s) compared to suitable controls. These changes are typically measured relative to controls that lack a formula 1 compound or that use known agonists or antagonists of one or more relevant molecules. Assays can be based on measuring decreases or increases in, e.g., one or more of protein levels, RNA or mRNA levels, a ligand binding activity, transcription of a target gene(s) and the like. Suitable assay protocols include any suitable polymerase chain reaction assay to measure an RNA or mRNA, any suitable blotting protocol for nucleic acid or for protein such as a Northern or Western blot method or any transcription assay, including DNA footprinting or a gene expression or gene function assay. Typically the formula 1 compounds will effect detectable changes in the synthesis or one or more biological activities in a concentration range of about 0.5\u00d710M to about 3\u00d710M. Exemplary compositions that comprise a formula 1 compound for use in, e.g., in vivo animal assays, in vitro cell or tissue culture assays or in cell free assays, will comprise one or more suitable solvents or vehicles including DMSO, ethanol, water and tissue culture medium, which optionally contains calf, horse or goat serum or another serum.","One or more of these transcription factors, receptors or complexes can be a component in methods when, e.g., they are used with a formula 1 compound in cell-free assays or in tissue culture assays. Formation of these complexes in cells or analysis of the effects of formula 1 compounds on one or more of their biological activities is facilitated by inserting into the cells a DNA construct(s) that expresses one or more of these proteins, e.g., mammalian or yeast cells containing a stable DNA construct or a construct used for transient transfection assays. Methods to perform assays or to induce biological responses in vitro or in vivo using the formula 1 compounds as agonists, antagonists or as reference standards are essentially as described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,080,139, 5,696,133, 5,932,431, 5,932,555, 5,935,968, 5,945,279, 5,945,404, 5,945,410, 5,945,412, 5,945,448, 5,952,319, 5,952,371, 5,955,632, 5,958,710, 5,958,892 and 5,962,443; International Publication Numbers WO 96\/19458, WO 99\/41257 and WO 99\/45930. The complexes or assay systems, that comprise a formula 1 compound and one or more of these molecules are embodiments of the invention, as are the use of these compositions when employed in the practice of any of the assay methods or in any of the clinical treatment methods disclosed herein or in the cited references.","In exemplary applications, invention embodiments include a method comprising contacting a formula 1 compound(s) with a cell(s), whereby the formula 1 compound(s) forms a complex with a steroid hormone receptor or results in the modulation of a biological activity of the steroid hormone receptor or a gene that it regulates. The steroid hormone receptor may be an orphan nuclear hormone receptor or a characterized receptor such as the glucocorticoid receptor, estrogen receptor or the androgen receptor that displays a moderate or high binding affinity for the formula 1 compound(s). In some embodiments, the steroid receptor is a known steroid receptor. Biological effects from interaction of a formula 1 compound and a receptor can lead to interference with the replication or development of a pathogen or the cell(s) itself. For example, expression of HIV transcripts in HIV-infected cells may be altered. The receptor-formula 1 compound complex may directly interfere with LTR-dependent transcription of HIV genes, leading to reduced viral replication. Alternatively, such effects can include the decreased synthesis or biological activity of a protein or gene product that is associated with the establishment, maintenance or progression of a disease condition described herein or in the cited references.","Invention embodiments include compositions comprising a partially purified or a purified complex comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor. Such a steroid receptor(s) may be an orphan steroid receptor or a characterized steroid receptor, where either type binds the formula 1 compound with a moderate or high binding affinity, e.g., less than about 0.5-10\u00d710M, usually less than about 1\u00d710M, or, for higher affinity interactions, less than about 0.01-10\u00d710M. The formula 1 compound(s) may also enhance immune responses such that both immune responses and altered intracellular conditions simultaneously exist to ameliorate one or more of the pathological conditions described herein.","The formula 1 compounds may be used to identify receptors that modulate biological responses, e.g., receptors that participate in effecting enhanced Th1 cytokine synthesis. Invention embodiments include a method, \u201cMethod 1\u201d, which permits the determination of one or more effects of a test compound on a steroid receptor in various biological systems. Generally, the test compound is a formula 1 compound. Such systems include cells containing a DNA construct that constitutively or inducibly expresses a steroid receptor(s) of interest, e.g., SXR, CAR\u03b2, RXR, PXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 or mixtures or dimers thereof, e.g., SXR\/RXR. In other biological systems, the steroid receptor can be under the transcriptional control of a regulatable promoter. Alternatively, the expression another gene such as a steroid-inducible gene, e.g., a steroid-inducible cytochrome P-450. For this method, a source of steroid receptors is generally combined with a means of monitoring them, e.g., by measuring the transcription of a gene regulated by the receptor. Cells that comprise the steroid receptor and optional monitoring means are sometimes referred to herein as the \u201cbiological system.\u201d Sources of steroid receptors include cell lines and cell populations that normally express the steroid receptor of interest and extracts obtained from such cells. Another source for a useful biological system for purposes of this method is tissues from experimental animals that express the receptor.","In one aspect, method 1 allows one to determine one or more effects of a formula 1 compound on a steroid receptor using a method that comprises (a) providing a biological system, e.g., a cell extract, cells or tissue, comprising cells having a plurality of steroid receptors that comprise monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise a steroid receptor, e.g., SXR, CAR-\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, PXR or dimers that comprise one or more of these; (b) activating or inhibiting the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise the steroid receptor by contacting the cells with a steroid receptor (e.g., SXR, CAR-\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 or PXR) agonist or antagonist; (c) removing substantially all of the steroid receptor agonist or antagonist from the cells; (d) determining an activity of the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise the steroid receptor while in an activated state in the absence of agonist or antagonist; (e) exposing the cells to the test compound; (f) determining at least one effect of the test compound on the activity of the plurality of monomers, homodimers or heterodimers that comprise one or more of the steroid receptors while they remain substantially free of agonist or antagonist; and (g) optionally classifying the test compound as an agonist or an antagonist of the steroid receptor, or a neutral compound having little or no detectable effect.","The effects that method 1 can measure includes determining or measuring an effect on a gene whose expression is affected by the steroid receptor. The gene could be a gene associated with a pathological condition such as an infectious agent, an immune disorder such as an inflammation condition or a hyperproliferation condition disclosed herein or in the cited references.","Thus, another aspect of method 1, \u201cmethod 1A\u201d, is determining if a compound not previously known to be a modulator of protein biosynthesis can transcriptionally modulate the expression of a gene that encodes a protein associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of a pathological condition (the \u201ctarget gene\u201d or \u201ctarget protein\u201d). This method comprises: (a) contacting an assay system that comprises eucaryotic cells or a suitable lysate with a formula 1 compound, wherein the eucaryotic cells or suitable lysate comprises one, two or a plurality of steroid receptor proteins and optionally comprises one or more coactivator proteins and a DNA construct comprising operatively linked sequences that comprise (i) a modulatable transcriptional regulatory sequence(s) of the target gene, (ii) a promoter of the gene, and (iii) either the target gene's nucleic acid coding protein region or a coding region for a suitable reporter gene, either of which is capable of expressing the DNA construct's coding region, which is coupled to, and under the control of, the modulatable transcriptional regulatory sequence(s) and the promoter, under conditions such that the formula 1 compound, if capable of acting as a transcriptional modulator of the gene encoding the protein of interest, causes a measurable or detectable signal (e.g., an increased or decreased nucleic or protein expression level compared to a suitable control); (b) quantitatively or qualitatively determining the amount of the signal so produced; and (c) optionally comparing the amount of the signal so determined with the amount of signal detected in the presence of the formula 1 compound with a suitable control, e.g. in the absence of any compound being tested or upon contacting the sample with a known activator or inhibitor of expression of the target gene so as to identify the chemical as one that causes a change in the detectable signal produced by the polypeptide. The method thus permits one to determine if the formula 1 compound specifically transcriptionally modulates expression of the target gene or protein. Suitable steroid receptors and their coactivators are as described herein, e.g., androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, mineralcorticoid receptor, aldosterone receptor, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b4, RXR or CAR\u03b2. Information regarding these receptors has been described, see, e.g., relevant U.S. patents cited herein and PCT publication WO 0025800 and WO 0031286.","In method 1A the assay system may comprise a transformed cell line, primary cells or untransformed cells or a suitable lysate or extract of any of these. Exemplary cell lines include ones derived from human or other mammalian tumors or precancers. The source of such cells may be human or animal, e.g., a mammal such as a primate or a rodent. In some embodiments, the assay system comprises a rodent such as a mouse, transgenic mouse or other transgenic animal (see e.g., PCT publication WO 000602). Measurement of the formula 1 compound's effect on the assay system includes detecting increased or decreased expression of nucleic acid or polypeptide by the target gene in response to the formula 1 compound's presence. Exemplary conditions include conducting the method under conditions suitable for maintaining the cells in tissue culture or under conditions suitable for enzyme assays using cell extracts or lysates, e.g., tissue culture medium or a buffered aqueous solution that is, e.g., a nearly isotonic solution at about 32-38\u00b0 C., a pH of about 6 to about 8, a formula 1 compound concentration of about 1\u00d710M to about 1\u00d710M (including any concentration in any single unit increment of, e.g., 1\u00d710M, e.g., 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M, 1\u00d710M or 1\u00d710M) and contacting the formula 1 compound and the assay system for about 20 minutes to about 72 hours. Detection of a change in expression of the target gene or the reporter gene includes, e.g., detecting (1) changes in gene nucleic acid levels by qualitative or quantitative PCR methods and (2) changes in gene protein levels by enzyme or antibody-based assays such as measuring enzyme activity using a suitable substrate or measuring protein levels, e.g., by ELISA or western blotting.","In conducting method 1A, one typically contacts a sample that contains a predefined number of identical or essentially identical eucaryotic cells, e.g. about 5\u00d710to about 5\u00d710cells, with a predetermined concentration of a compound of formula 1. The eucaryotic cells comprise a DNA construct that is made using conventional molecular biology methods and protocols. The assay system is maintained under conditions such that the formula 1 compound, if capable of acting as a transcriptional modulator of the gene encoding the protein of interest, causes a measurable or detectable signal to be produced by the polypeptide expressed by the reporter gene. Once sufficient time for generation of a detectable response or signal has passed, one can determine the amount of the signal produced. Typically the response or signal is measured quantitatively, but a qualitative measurement can be useful for rapid screening purposes.","For method 1A, one can also optionally compare the detectable signal with the amount of produced signal that (i) one detects in the absence of any formula 1 compound or (ii) when contacting the sample with other chemicals, which identifies the formula 1 compound as a chemical that causes a change in the detectable signal the polypeptide produces. One then typically determines whether the formula 1 compound specifically transcriptionally modulates expression of the gene associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of the pathological condition.","Other aspects of the method 1 and 1A include a screening method comprising separately contacting each of a plurality of identical, essentially identical or different samples, each sample containing a predefined number of such cells with a with a predetermined concentration of each different formula 1 compound to be tested, e.g., wherein the plurality of samples comprises more than about 1\u00d710or more than about 1\u00d710samples or about 0.5-5\u00d710samples. In other aspects one determines the amount of RNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In any of methods 1 or 1A, a formula 1 compound such as any one of those described or named herein may be utilized.","Aspects of the invention include another method, \u201cmethod 2\u201d, which centers on identifying a gene whose expression is modulated by a candidate binding partner for infectious disease therapeutic agents. Typically the binding partner is a steroid receptor, e.g., a monomer, homodimer or heterodimer that comprises SXR, CAR-\u03b2, PXR, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3, PPAR\u03b4 or RXR or a homolog or isoform thereof. The steroid receptor is typically present as a complex that comprises, e.g., the formula 1 compound and the regulated gene's DNARS, which the steroid receptor, or a complex that comprises the steroid receptor, recognizes and specifically binds to. Such complexes can also comprise a transcription factor that binds to the steroid receptor or to nucleic acid sequences adjacent to or near the DNARS. Exemplary transcription factors that may be present include one or more of ARA54, ARA55, ARA70, SRC-1, NF-\u03baB, NFAT, AP1, Ets, p300, CBP, p300\/CBP, p300\/CPB-associated factor, SWI\/SNF and human homologs of SWI\/SNF, CBP, SF-1, RIP140, GRIP1 and Vpr. In general, one provides a first and a second group of cells in vitro or in vivo and contacts the first group of cells with the infectious disease therapeutic agent, but does not contact the second group of cells in vitro or in vivo with the infectious disease therapeutic agent. Recovering RNA from the cells, or generating cDNA derived from the RNA, is accomplished by conventional protocols. Analysis of the RNA, or cDNA derived from the RNA, from the first and the second group of cells identifies differences between them, which one can use to identify a gene whose regulation is modulated by the candidate binding partner for the infectious disease therapeutic agent or any DNARS associated with that gene.","An aspect of method 2 is determining the capacity of a formula 1 compound to modulate, or participate in the modulation of, the transcription of a gene associated with the maintenance or treatment of one or more symptoms of a pathological condition. It is expected that in general, the formula 1 compounds will cause an increase in the transcription of such genes. The pathological condition is typically one associated with an infectious agent, e.g., virus, parasite or bacterium, but can also include an immune condition, e.g., an autoimmune condition or an immune deficiency. The pathological condition may also be an insufficient immune response to an infection or an insufficient response to a hyperproliferation condition or malignancy. Other pathological conditions that one can apply the method to are inflammation conditions.","In some aspects, the formula 1 compounds used in method 2 will be labeled. Such compounds are prepared by conventional methods using standard labels, such as radiolabels, fluorescent labels or other labels as described herein and in the cited references.","An embodiment of method 2 involves analyzing the RNA, or cDNA derived from it, by subtraction hybridization. In this embodiment, the RNA or cDNA obtained from the first and second groups of cells is hybridized and the resulting duplexes are removed. This allows recovery of nucleic acids that encode genes whose transcription is modulated by the candidate binding partner, which is usually a steroid receptor. One can use conventional methods to amplify and obtain nucleic acid and protein sequence information from the nucleic acids recovered by this method. The nucleic acid sequences that are transcriptionally induced or repressed by the formula 1 compound are candidate binding partners.","A transcriptionally induced gene(s) will be enriched in the group 1 cells treated with the formula 1 compound, while any repressed gene(s) will be depleted or absent. In these embodiments, the RNA recovered after removal of duplexes is typically amplified by standard RT-PCR or PCR protocols. These protocols typically use specific sets of random primer pairs, followed by analysis of the amplified nucleic acids by gel electrophoresis. Nucleic acids that are induced by the formula 1 compound will appear as a band(s), usually duplex DNA, that is not present in the control or second set of cells. Nucleic acids that are transcriptionally repressed by the formula 1 compound's binding partner will be depleted or absent in the first group of cells. Once such gene candidates are identified, they can be cloned and expressed and the capacity of the DNARS associated with the gene to form a complex that comprises a candidate binding partner and an optionally labeled formula 1 compound is analyzed by conventional methods, e.g., equilibrium dialysis, affinity chromatography using, e.g., the DNARS immobilized on a column, or coprecipitation of complexes that comprise an optionally labeled DNARS and candidate binding partner using anti-binding partner antibodies. Nucleic acid sequence analysis is usually used to identify regions adjacent to the coding regions of the regulated gene to identify any DNARS associated with the gene. The identity of a DNARS can be established by the binding to the DNARS of complexes that comprise a candidate binding partner, e.g., a steroid receptor, and optionally also comprise a formula 1 compound. The location and identity of the DNARS can be accomplished by DNA footprinting or other methods for detecting binding interactions. The DNARS, the receptor or the formula 1 compound can be labeled in these variations of method 2.","In general, the second group of cells will be identical or essentially identical to the first group of cells. In embodiments (for both methods 1 and 2) where the cells are \u201cessentially identical\u201d, the first or the second group of cells may differ from each other by the presence or absence of a DNA construct(s) that expresses (i) a steroid receptor and\/or (ii) an easily detected protein, e.g., a \u03b2-galactosidase, a peroxidase, a phosphatase, a luciferase or a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, whose transcriptional regulation is usually modulated by a steroid receptor. In these embodiments, the difference between the first and the second group of cells is used to facilitate the analysis of the biological effects of the formula 1 compound and the steroid receptor binding partner. Groups of cells are considered \u201cidentical\u201d if they do not display known or obvious morphological or genetic differences.","Usually, the second group of cells will serve as a control, and they will thus not be exposed to any formula 1 compound before obtaining the RNA or cDNA. But, for some embodiments, one can expose the second group of cells to a known agonist or antagonist of the steroid receptor binding partner. This allows one to compare the potency of the formula 1 compound with the potency of the agonist or antagonist.","In other embodiments, one can modify method 2 by providing a third group of cells, which is optionally used as an untreated control when the second group of cells is treated with a steroid receptor agonist or antagonist. In these embodiments, one will typically compare the effect of the formula 1 compound and the agonist or the antagonist of the expression of a gene or DNA construct. The DNA construct would comprise a promoter or other regulatory sequences that are subject to transcriptional modulation, usually increase transcription, by the formula 1 compound in concert with its binding partner.","The formula 1 compounds can directly or indirectly modulate the activity or synthesis of one or more biological ligands to effect a detectable biological response or activity change. To facilitate the identification of candidate binding partners for the formula 1 compounds, one can use a radiolabeled formula 1 compound that is linked to a support, usually a solid support, as a means to recover the candidate binding partners. The formula 1 compound can be linked to the support through a variable group that is bonded to the formula 1 compound, e.g., at the 2-, 3-, 7-, 11-, 15-, 16- or 17-position of the steroid nucleus. Linking agents are known for such uses and include homobifunctional and heterobifunctional agents, many of which are commercially available. The linker one uses will typically comprise about 2-20 linked atoms. The linked atoms usually comprise mostly carbon, with one, two or three oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atoms that optionally replace one or more carbon or hydrogen atoms. One can use a cDNA expression library that one has made from suitable cells or tissues as a source of candidate binding partners. The cells or tissues can be obtained from a mammalian or a vertebrate host, e.g., human, mouse, bird, primate, or from other sources, e.g., insects (e.g., ), other invertebrates (e.g., yeast, bacteria, sp., sp., sp., ) or other organism groups or species listed herein or in the cited references. Suitable tissues include skin, liver tissue or cells, including hepatocytes and K\u00fcpfer cells, fibrocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells, kidney cells and tissues, brain or other central nervous system cells or tissues, including neurons, astrocytes and glial cells, peripheral nervous system tissues, lung, intestine, placenta, breast, ovary, testes, muscle, including heart or myocyte tissue or cells, white blood cells, including T cells, B cells, bone marrow cells and tissues, lymph tissues or fluids and chondrocytes.","Typically a candidate binding partner that one isolates from a non-human source will have a human homolog that has similar binding properties for the formula 1 compound. Non-human candidate binding partners can thus be used to facilitate recovery of the human homologs, e.g., by preparing antiserum for precipitating the human homolog from a solution that comprises the human homolog or by comparing the sequence of the non-human candidate binding partner with known human gene sequences. Once a source of the candidate binding partner is obtained, it can be contacted with labeled formula 1 compound, usually radiolabeled with, e.g., C or H, and complexes that comprise the labeled formula 1 compound and the candidate binding partner is recovered using, e.g., affinity chromatography or antibody precipitation methods. The recovery of the complex provides a source of at least partially purified candidate binding partner, i.e., the candidate binding partner is enriched, e.g., at least 10-fold enriched, or at least 100-fold enriched, or at least 500-fold enriched, compared to its abundance in the original candidate binding partner source material.","Embodiments of the invention include a composition comprising a partially purified (purified at least about 2-fold to about 10-fold relative to natural sources, e.g., cells or a cell lysate) complex or a purified (purified at least about 20-fold to about 5000-fold relative to natural sources, e.g., cells or a cell lysate) complex (where the partially purified or purified complex is optionally isolated) comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor, a serum steroid-binding protein (e.g., human serum albumin, a1-acid glycoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, androgen binding protein (rat)) or another binding partner, e.g., transcription factor or DNARS. An aspect of these compositions includes a product produced by the process of contacting the partially purified or the purified composition with one or more cells, one or more tissues, plasma or blood.","Other embodiments include a method to modulate a cellular response or to determine a biological activity of a formula 1 compound comprising: (a) contacting the formula 1 compound(s) with a cell or cell population; (b) measuring one or more of (i) a complex between a binding partner and the formula 1 compound, (ii) proliferation of the cell or cell population, (iii) differentiation of the cell or cell population (iv) an activity of a protein kinase C, (v) a level of phosphorylation of a protein kinase C substrate, (vi) transcription of one or more target genes, (vii) inhibition of unwanted cellular responses to certain steroids, e.g., inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced immune suppression or inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced bone loss, (viii) inhibition or modulation of steroid-induced transcription, e.g., increased or decreased expression induced by glucocorticoids or sex steroids or (ix) inhibition of HIV LTR-driven transcription; and (c) optionally comparing the result obtained in step (b) with an appropriate control. Aspects of this embodiment include (i) the method wherein the binding partner is a steroid receptor, a transcription factor or a DNARS, (ii) the method wherein the biological activity determined is a modulating activity of the formula 1 compound for replication or cytopathic effects associated with a retrovirus, a hepatitis virus or a protozoan parasite, (iii) the method wherein the biological activity determined is a modulating activity of the formula 1 compound for replication, cytopathic effects associated with the retrovirus, the hepatitis virus or the protozoan parasite or the biological activity determined is metabolism (assay by H-thymidine uptake or other assay as referenced or described herein) of a cell or cell population comprising NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophages, basophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, fibrocytes, transformed (neoplastic) cells, virus-infected cells, bacteria-infected cells or parasite-infected cells, and (iv) the method wherein the target gene is a virus gene, a bacterial gene, a parasite gene, a gene associated with cancer, e.g., wherein the virus gene is a DNA or an RNA polymerase gene, a reverse transcriptase gene, an envelope gene, a protease gene or a gene associated with viral nucleic acid replication or a viral structural gene.","Another embodiment is a method comprising contacting a complex that comprises a steroid receptor and a formula 1 compound with a transactivator protein, whereby a complex comprising the steroid receptor protein, the formula 1 compound and the transactivator protein forms, wherein the transactivator protein is in (1) a cell or tissue extract (e.g., nuclei, lysate containing nuclei or lysate without nuclei from a cell(s) or tissue(s)), (2) a partially purified or purified cell or tissue extract, (3) a cell(s) in tissue culture or (4) a cell(s) in a subject, where any of (1)-(4) optionally comprises a target gene (native gene or introduced by standard gene manipulation techniques) whose level of expression is optionally assayed after the complex forms. In some of these embodiments, the transactivator protein is partially purified or purified and is in the cell or tissue extract or the partially purified or purified cell or tissue extract. The transactivator protein may be TIF-1, CBP\/P300, TRIP1\/SUG-1, RIP-140, SRC1\u03b1\/P160, or TIF-2\/GRIP-1. In any of these embodiments the complex comprising the steroid receptor protein, the formula 1 compound and the transactivator protein may increase or decrease transcription of the target gene compared to a suitable control (e.g., control under same conditions, but lacking any added compound that corresponds to the formula 1 compound, or where another compound (e.g., a steroid that is known to bind to the steroid receptor) is used as a benchmark or reference standard against which altered target gene expression is measured). In these methods, the target gene may be a pathogen gene (e.g., virus, bacterium, parasite, fungus, yeast) or a gene associated with a pathological condition (autoimmunity, inflammation, hyperproliferation).","The formula 1 compounds are suitable for use in certain described methods that use steroids to modulate biological activities in cells or tissues. For example, a formula 1 compound(s) can be used to selectively interact with specific steroid receptors or steroid orphan receptor, or their subtypes, that are associated with a pathological condition(s) in a subject, essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,668,175. In these applications, the formula 1 compound may act as a ligand for the receptor to modulate abnormal expression of a gene product(s) that correlates with the pathological condition (a steroid hormone responsive disease state). Such genes are normally regulated by steroid hormones. In other applications, one can use the formula 1 compounds to screen for ligands that bind to or detectably affect a biological activity of a steroid receptor or steroid orphan receptor and one or more transcription factors (or cofactors) such as AP-1 and\/or with a DNA sequence(s), essentially as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,720. Similarly, the formula 1 compounds can be used essentially as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,597,693, 5,639,598, 5,780,220, 5,863,733 and 5,869,337 to detectably modulate a biological activity of one of these molecules. In some of these embodiments, the formula 1 compound(s) is labeled to facilitate its use. Suitable labels are known in the art and include radiolabels (e.g., H, C, P, S, I, Tc and other halogen isotopes), fluorescent moieties (e.g., fluorescein, resorufin, Texas Red, rhodamine, BODIPY, arylsulfonate cyanines), chemiluminescent moieties (e.g., acridinium esters), metal chelators, biotin, avadin, peptide tags (e.g., histidine hexamer, a peptide recognized by monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies), covalent crosslinking moieties. One prepares the labeled compounds according to known methods.","Methods suitable to measure the cellular response or biological effects caused by various compounds, e.g., activation, on immune system cells (e.g., NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophage, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, fibrocytes) have been described, e.g., Jakob et al., 1998 161:3042-3049, Pierson et al., 1996 87:180-189, Cash et al., 1994 98:313-318, Monick et al., 1999 162:3005-3012, Rosen et al., 1999 67:1180-1186, Grunfeld et al., 1999 40:245-252, Singh et al., 1998 76:513-519, Chesney et al., 1997 94:6307-6312, Verhasselt et al., 1999 162:2569-2574, Avice et al., 1999 162:2748-2753, Cella et al., 1999 189:821-829, Rutalt et al., 1999 26:232-238, Akbari et al., 1999 189:169-178, Hryhorenko et al., 1998 40:231-240, Fernvik et al., 1999 48:28-35, Cooper et al., 1999 179:738-742, Betsuyaku et al., 1999 103:825-832, Brown et al., 1998 46:308-316, Sibelius et al., 1999 67:1125-1130. The use of formula 1 compounds in such methods are aspects of the invention and they permit, e.g., measurement of the biological effects of formula 1 compounds on, e.g., one or more of (1) the cell's biological activities, (2) genes whose expression is regulated by the formula 1 compound or (3) a steroid receptor. Exemplary biological effects that the formula 1 compounds may exert include one or more of (1) stimulation of ion flux or ion channel activity in one or more immune cell subsets such as one or more of those described herein, (2) binding to one or more ligands such as a steroid receptor and modulation of a biological activity of the receptor, (3) detectably enhanced transcription of one or more genes whose expression is affected by a steroid receptor(s) or other biomolecule whose activity is directly or indirectly affected by the formula 1 compound's presence and (4) detectably decreased transcription of one or more genes whose expression is affected by a steroid receptor(s) or other biomolecule whose activity is directly or indirectly affected by the formula 1 compound's presence.","Embodiments include any of the methods described above, e.g., method 1, wherein the cells or biological system comprises NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophage, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells, synoviocytes, microglial cells, glial cells, fibrocytes or hepatocytes, that optionally comprise a DNA construct that expresses one or two cloned steroid receptors. The method optionally analyzes the effect of a formula 1 compound on the cells compared to controls. Controls include the use of a known agonist or antagonist for the steroid receptor or the comparison of cells exposed to a formula 1 compound with control cells (usually the same cell type as the treated cells) that are not exposed to the formula 1 compound. A response, e.g., activation of the steroid receptor can be measured by known assays compared to controls.","The formula 1 compound will, in some cases modulate (increase or decrease) transcription of one or more genes in the cells. In other cases, the formula 1 compound will enhance lysosome movement in one or more of the subject's NK cells, phagocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, dendritic cells synoviocytes, microglial cells or fibrocytes. Such effects will typically be mediated directly or indirectly through one or more transcription factors or steroid receptors that act to modulate gene transcription, e.g., cause enhanced protein kinase C (a PKC such as PKC\u03b1, PKC\u03b2, PKC\u03b3 or PKC\u03b6) activity in the cells used in the assay, or another effect as disclosed herein.","Other related embodiments are a composition comprising a partially purified or a purified complex comprising a formula 1 compound and a steroid receptor, a serum steroid-binding protein (e.g., human serum albumin, \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, sex hormone-binding globulin, testosterone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, androgen binding protein (rat) or a homolog or isoform of any of these) or another binding partner, e.g., transcription factor or DNARS. An aspect of these compositions includes a product produced by the process of contacting the partially purified or the purified composition with one or more cells, one or more tissues, plasma or blood.","In a related embodiment, a formula 1 compound is used to exert a cytostatic effect on a subject's cells, e.g., mammalian cells, in vitro or in vivo. Typically such cells are lymphoid cells, e.g., T cell populations from, e.g., blood or organs that are rich in lymphoid cells (e.g., spleen, lymph tissue or nodes), or transformed T cell lines. Such activity provides an estimate of the potency of formula 1 compounds to mediate immunological effects, such as enhancing Th1 immune responses or suppressing expression of one or more Th2-associated cytokines. Thus, an invention method comprises (a) contacting a formula 1 compound and lymphoid cells in vitro, (b) determining the degree of cytostasis that the compound exerts to identify a cytostatic compound and (c) optionally administering the cytostatic compound to an immune suppressed subject to determine the effect of the compound on one or more of the subject's immune responses as described herein, e.g., enhanced Th1 cytokine or cell response or decreased Th2-associated cytokine expression. Typically, such methods are conducted using a range of formula 1 compound concentrations and suitable controls, such as a known cytostatic agent or a blank that contains solvent that lacks the formula 1 compound. Inhibition of cell proliferation is measured by standard methods. Methods to measure the cytostatic effects of the compounds includes measuring viable cell numbers in treated and untreated cultures or by measuring DNA synthesis using e.g., H-thymidine incorporation into DNA in treated and untreated cultures. Typical ranges of formula 1 concentrations in the cell growth medium are about 0.1 \u03bcM to about 100 \u03bcM, using about 4-6 different concentrations of compounds with a fixed number of cells (e.g., about 0.4\u00d710to about 5\u00d710). The formula 1 compound is left in contact with the cells in tissue culture for a sufficient time to observe cytostasis, e.g., about 16 hours to about 6 days, typically about 24-72 hours. In these embodiments, one may optionally screen for modulation of a biological activity of a steroid receptor, e.g., activation of PPAR\u03b1, which may be associated with the cytostasis the compound induced.","Other therapeutic and biological applications and activities. The formula 1 compounds are useful to treat autoimmune or metabolic conditions or disorders, or their symptoms, in subjects such as mammals or humans that relate to impaired insulin synthesis or use or that relate to abnormal or pathological lipid or cholesterol metabolism or levels. Such conditions and symptoms include Type 1 diabetes (including Immune-Mediated Diabetes Mellitus and Idiopathic Diabetes Mellitus), Type 2 diabetes (including forms with (1) predominant or profound insulin resistance, (2) predominant insulin deficiency and some insulin resistance and (3) forms intermediate between these), obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In diabetes, the compounds are useful to (1) enhance \u03b2-cell function in the islets of Langerhans (e.g., increase insulin secretion), (2) reduce the rate of islet cell damage, (3) increase insulin receptor levels or activity to increase cell sensitivity to insulin and\/or (4) modulate glucocorticoid receptor activity to decrease insulin resistance in cells that are insulin resistant. The compounds are thus useful to treat, prevent, ameliorate or slow the progression of diabetes or hyperglycemia, or a related symptom or condition, in a subject such as a human or a mammal.","Beneficial effects that can the formula 1 compounds can exert on such related symptoms or conditions include improved glucose tolerance, improved glucose utilization, decreased vascular disease (e.g., decreased severity or progression of microvascular or macrovascular disease, including nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and coronary heart disease), decreased severity or progression of atherosclerosis, decreased severity or progression of an arteriosclerosis condition (e.g., coronary arteriosclerosis, hyperplastic arteriosclerosis, peripheral arteriosclerosis or hypertensive arteriosclerosis), decreased level or activity of inflammatory macrophages (foam cells) in atherosclerotic plaques, decreased severity or progression of diabetic osteoarthropathy, decreased severity or progression of skin lesions, decreased severity or progression of ketosis, decreased generation of autoantibodies against islet cells or decreased expression or levels of one or more of IL-1 (e.g., IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, TNF (e.g., TNF\u03b1), and IFN-\u03b3. In these any of these diseases or conditions, the formula 1 compounds can also modulate, e.g., enhance CAR\u03b2, RXR, PPAR\u03b1 or PPAR\u03b2 levels. As used herein, obesity includes a human with a body mass index of about 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 or greater.","The formula 1 compounds are useful in treating insulin resistance and associated symptoms and conditions. Insulin resistance is typically observed as a diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. This leads to less than the expected biologic effect for a given level of insulin. Insulin resistant subjects or human have a diminished ability to properly metabolize glucose or fatty acids and respond poorly, if at all, to insulin therapy. Manifestations of insulin resistance include insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in liver. Insulin resistance can cause or contribute to polycystic ovarian syndrome, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, hypertension, obesity, atherosclerosis and a variety of other disorders. Insulin resistant individuals can progress to a diabetic state. The compounds can also be used in the treatment or amelioration of one or more condition associated with insulin resistance or glucose intolerance including an increase in plasma triglycerides and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high blood pressure, hyperuricemia, smaller denser low-density lipoprotein particles, and higher circulating levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Such diseases and symptoms have been described, see, e.g., G. M. Reaven, 1998, 9: 387-406, G. M. Reaven, 1995, 75: 473-486 and J. Flier, 1983, 34:145-60.","The compounds can thus be used in diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia conditions to reduce body fat mass, increase muscle mass or to lower one or more of serum or blood low density lipoprotein, triglyceride, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, free fatty acid or very low density lipoprotein compared to a subject that would otherwise be considered normal for one or more of these characteristics. These beneficial effects are typically obtained with little or no effect on serum or blood high density lipoprotein levels. The formula 1 compounds are useful to reduce or slow the rate of myocardial tissue or myocyte damage, e.g., fibrosis, or to enhance cardiac fatty acid metabolism in conditions, such as inflammation, where fatty acid metabolism is depressed or decreased. Elevated cholesterol levels are often associated with a number of other disease states, including coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, carotid artery disease, strokes, cerebral arteriosclerosis, and xanthoma, which the formula 1 compounds can ameliorate or slow the progression or severity of. Abnormal lipid and cholseterol conditions that can be treated include exogenous hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia, polygenic hypercholesterolemia, biliary cirrhosis, familial combined hyperlipidemia, dysbetalipoproteinemia, endogenous hypertriglyceridemia, mixed hypertriglyceridemia and hyperlipidemia or hypertriglycidemia secondary to alcohol consumption, diabetic lipemia, nephrosis or drug treatments, e.g., corticosteroid, estrogen, colestipol, cholestyramine or retinoid treatments. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essenitally as described herein. Where the condition is chronic, the formula 1 compounds will generally be administered to a subject such as a human for a relatively long time period, e.g., for about 3 months to about 10 years or more. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essenitally as described herein. Dosing of the compound can be daily or intermittent using a dosing protocol using dosages as described herein, e.g., about 0.01 to about 20 mg\/kg of a formula 1 compound administered to a subject once or twice per day daily or intermittently. The use of the formula 1 compounds can be combined with other suitable treatments, e.g., diet control or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Simvastatin\u2122, Pravastatin\u2122, Mevastatin\u2122 or Lovastatin\u2122.","The formula 1 compounds are also useful for preventing, slowing the progression of or treating certain chronic conditions in a subject such as a mammal or a human. Chronic conditions include diseases and conditions that arise or develop over a relatively long time period, e.g., over about 3 months to 10 years or more. Such conditions include chronic renal failure, which may result from polycystic kidney disease, from, e.g., an autoimmune condition such as acute or chronic glomerulonephritis, or from diabetes, interstitial nephritis, hypertension and other conditions discussed elsewhere herein. Chronic conditions include chronic pulmonary conditions such as chronic bronchitis, lung fibrosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, emphysema, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which may be treated with a formula 1 compound. These conditions or their symptoms may be mild, moderate or severe. The subject may be suffering from the disease or condition or may be subject to developing the condition, e.g., the subject may display early signs or a predisposition to develop a chronic condition. Such treatment will generally facilitate prevention of the disease, delay the onset or severity of the disease or condition, ameliorate one or more symptoms, e.g., reduce shortness of breath, coughing or dyspnea, or slow progression of the disease or condition. In these and other chronic conditions described herein, the formula 1 compounds will generally be administered to a subject such as a human for a relatively long time period, e.g., for at least about 3 months to about 10 years or more. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds are essenitally as described herein. Dosing of the compound can be daily or intermittent using a dosing protocol using dosages as described herein, e.g., about 0.1 to about 20 mg\/kg of a formula 1 compound administered to a subject once or twice per day daily or intermittently. The use of the formula 1 compounds can be combined with other treatments, e.g., \u03b2-agonists such as metaproterenol or albuterol, or corticosteroids, e.g., prednisone, for asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","The formula 1 compounds can modulate the biological activity of cytokines or interleukins that are associated with various immune deficiency or dysregulation conditions, which may be transient or chronic. They can thus be used to ameliorate, treat or prevent naturally occurring age-related decline in immune function in a subject or immune deficiency or dysregulation resulting from trauma, stress, burns, surgery, autoimmunity or infections as described herein. Such immune deficiency dysregulation may be associated with, e.g., an age-related increase in production of one or more of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 or an age-related decrease in production of one or more of IL-2, IL-3, \u03b3-IFN, GM-CSF or antibodies. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject to detectably decrease production or levels of one or more of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 or to detectably increase production or levels of one or more of IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-12, GM-CSF and \u03b3-IFN. These cytokine changes facilitate normalization of the subject's immune responses. Such normalization can be observed by various means. These means include monitoring appropriate cytokine RNA or protein level(s) in the subject or by measuring biological responses such as restoration or detectable improvement of contact hypersensitivity in a subject with depressed or suboptimal contact hypersensitivity response. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used to enhance or restore a deficient or suboptimal immune response such as contact hypersensitivity response in a subject with a chronic or transient state of immune deficiency or dysregulation. In these embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered using the dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compounds essenitally as described herein. Treatment with the formula 1 compounds is optionally combined with other appropriate treatments or therapies essenitally as described herein, e.g., a antibacterial or antiviral agent(s) is coadministered with a formula 1 compound to treat, prevent or ameliorate an infection in an infected subject or a subject suffering from, e.g., a burn. Methods to measure changes in cytokine levels or contact hypersensitivity are known and can optionally be applied in these embodiments, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,919,465, 5,837,269, 5,827,841, 5,478,566.","The capacity of the formula 1 compounds to modulate immune functions permits their use for treating, preventing, slowing the progression of or alleviating the a symptom(s) of subjects with psychological disorders, metabolic disorders, chronic stress, sleep disorders, conditions associated with sexual senescence, aging, or premature aging. Metabolic disorders include parathyroidism, pseudoparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia and detectable symptoms thereof such as fatigue, constipation, kidney stones and kidney malfunction. Chronic stress and related disorders include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysregulation. In these embodiments, treatment of subjects with a formula 1 compound is optionally combined with other suitable agents such as triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, an insulin-like growth factor or insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3.","Another aspect of the invention provides for the use of a formula 1 compound and a flavonoid, e.g., a naragin flavonoid, to enhance the bioavailability of the formula 1 compound. In these embodiments, the an effective amount of a flavonoid is administered to a subject who is receiving a formula 1 compound. Typically about 1-10 mg of flavonoid per kg of body weight is administered to the subject a flavonoid such as bavachinin A, didymin (isosakuranetin-7-rutinoside or neoponcirin), flavanomarein (isookanine-7-glucoside), flavanone azine, flavanone diacetylhydrazone, flavanone hydrazone, silybin, cirsiliol, silychristin, isosilybin or silandrin. The flavonoid compound is typically administered with the formula 1 compound or a few hours, e.g., about 1, 2 or 3 hours, before the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject.","As noted above, in some embodiments a treatment with a formula 1 compound is combined with a corticosteroid or glucocorticoid. Corticosteroids are used in a number of clinical situations to, e.g., decrease the intensity or frequency of flares or episodes of inflammation or autoimmune reactions in conditions such as acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis, acute or chronic osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, acute or chronic asthma, bronchial asthma, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, type I diabetes, type II diabetes or cachexia. However, many corticosteroids have significant side effects or toxicities that can limit their use or efficacy. The formula 1 compounds are useful to counteract such side effects or toxicities without negating all of the desired therapeutic capacity of the corticosteroid. This allows the continued use, or a modified dosage of the corticosteroid, e.g., an increased dosage, without an intensification of the side effects or toxicities or a decreased corticosteroid dosage. The side-effects or toxicities that can be treated, prevented, ameliorated or reduced include one or more of bone loss, reduced bone growth, enhanced bone resorption, osteoporosis, immunosuppression, increased susceptibility to infection, mood or personality changes, depression, headache, vertigo, high blood pressure or hypertension, muscle weakness, fatigue, nausea, malaise, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, thin or fragile skin, growth suppression in children or preadult subjects, thromboembolism, cataracts, and edema. Dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols for the formula 1 compound would be essentially as described herein. An exemplary dose of formula 1 compound of about 0.5 to about 20 mg\/kg\/day is administered during the period during which a corticosteroid is administered and optionally over a period of about 1 week to about 6 months or more after dosing with the corticosteroid has ended. The corticosteroids are administered essentially using known dosages, routes of administration and dosing protocols, see, e.g., 54edition, 2000, pages 323-2781, ISBN 1-56363-330-2, Medical Economics Co., Inc., Montvale, N.J. However, the dosage of the corticosteroid may optionally be adjusted, e.g., increased about 10% to about 300% above the normal dosage, without a corresponding increase in all of the side effects or toxicities associated with the corticosteroid. Such increases would be made incrementally over a sufficient time period and as appropriate for the subject's clinical condition, e.g., daily corticosteroid dose increases of about 10% to about 20% to a maximum of about 300% over about 2 weeks to about 1 year.","Such corticosteroids include hydrocortisone (cortisol), corticosterone, aldosterone, ACTH, triamcinolone and derivatives such as triamcinolone diacetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide, and triamcinolone acetonide, betamethasone and derivatives such as betamethasone dipropionate, betamethasone benzoate, betamethasone sodium phosphate, betamethasone acetate, and betamethasone valerate, flunisolide, prednisone, fluocinolone and derivatives such as fluocinolone acetonide, diflorasone and derivatives such as diflorasone diacetate, halcinonide, dexamethasone and derivatives such as dexamethasone dipropionate and dexamethasone valerate, desoximetasone (desoxymethasone), diflucortolone and derivatives such as diflucortolone valerate), fluclorolone acetonide, fluocinonide, fluocortolone, fluprednidene, flurandrenolide, clobetasol, clobetasone and derivatives such as clobetasone butyrate, alclometasone, flumethasone, and fluocortolone.","In some applications, the formula 1 compound(s) may directly and\/or indirectly interfere with replication, development or cell to cell transmission of a pathogen such as a virus or a parasite (malaria). Improvement in a subject's clinical condition may arise from a direct effect on an infectious agent or on a malignant cell. Interference with cellular replication can arise from inhibition of one or more enzymes that a parasite or an infected cell uses for normal replication or metabolism, e.g., glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which affects cellular generation of NADPH (see, e.g., Raineri et al., 1970 9: 2233-2243). This effect may contribute to cytostatic effects that some formula 1 compounds can have. Modulation of cellular enzymes expression or activity may also interfere with replication or development of a pathogen, e.g., HIV or malaria parasites or with replication or development of neoplastic cells, e.g., inhibition of angiogenesis. Clinical improvement will also generally result from an enhanced immune response such as an improved Th1 response.","Administration of a formula 1 compound can lead to a decrease in adenosine levels in a subject's tissue(s), e.g., lung or central nervous system tissue. This effect can be used to treat, prevent, ameliorate one or more symptoms of or slow the progression of a disease(s) or clinical condition(s) where a relatively high level of adenosine is a factor in or can contribute to the disease or condition, e.g., in asthma.","Adenosine is associated with the symptoms of bronchial asthma, where it can induce bronchoconstriction or contraction of airway smooth muscle in asthmatic subjects, see, e.g., J. Thorne and K. Broadley, & 149(2 pt. 1):392-399 1994, S. Ali et al., & 37:165-167 1992, Bjorck et al., 145:1087-1091 1992. This effect is not observed in non-asthmatic subjects. In the central nervous system, adenosine can inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and GABA. It can also depress neurotransmission, reduce neuronal firing to induce spinal analgesia and it possesses anxiolytic properties, see, e.g., A. Pelleg and R. Porter, 10:157 1990. In the heart, adenosine suppresses pacemaker activity, slows AV conduction, possesses antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic effects, modulates autonomic control and triggers the synthesis and release of prostaglandins. In addition, adenosine has vasodilatory effects and can modulate vascular tone.","The unwanted effects of excess adenosine can be ameliorated or reduced by administering sufficient amounts of a formula 1 compound to a subject who is subject to developing or who has an unwanted level of adenosine in one or more tissues or organs. In typical embodiments, one will administer about 10 mg\/kg\/day to about 100 mg\/kg\/day of a formula 1 compound to a subject over a period of about 1 week to about 4 months to effect detectable changes in adenosine levels or amelioration in one or more symptoms associated with high adenosine in one or more of the subject's tissues. Such changes may be determined by comparing the subject's adenosine levels before treatment with the formula 1 compound is started. Alternatively, for subjects with symptoms that are consistent with high adenosine levels, the decrease can be inferred by comparing the normal level of adenosine in the target tissue(s) for subjects of the same species and similar age or sex with the level that is observed after treatment. Methods to measure adenosine levels in mammalian tissue are known and can optionally be used in these embodiments, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,351.","In some clinical conditions, the formula 1 compounds can inhibit activated T lymphocytes in vivo, and they can inhibit the expression or biological activity of one or more of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8 or insulin like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) or IL-6 receptor. The compounds are thus useful to treat, prevent or ameliorate conditions where this is a component of pathology. Such conditions include inflammation conditions such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. The compound can thus ameliorate the inflammation, e.g., by inhibiting expression of one or more of TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6, IL-8 or IGF-1R. Also, the compounds can inhibit unwanted T cell activity. They can thus ameliorate one or more psoriasis symptoms such as skin scaling, skin thickening, keratinocyte hyperproliferation, deficient filaggrin expression (B. Baker et al., 1984, 111:702), deficient strateum corneum lipid deposition or they can improve a clinical assessment such as the Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index. The formula 1 compounds can be delivered to a subject with psoriasis using topical or systemic formulations as described herein. Topical formulations include gels, lotions and creams, e.g., as described herein. Daily or intermittent administration of the compound can be used essentially as described herein. The use of the formula 1 compounds is optionally combined with one more current psoriasis treatments, e.g., topical emollients or moisturizers, tars, anthralins, systemic or topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs such as calcitriol, methotrexate, etretinate, acitretin, cyclosporin, FK 506, sulfasalazine, ultraviolet B radiation optionally combined with one or more of a topical corticosteroid, tar, anthralin, emollient or moisturizer or ultraviolet A plus psoralen. Such additional treatments essentially would use known dosages and routes of administration, which are applied, e.g., within a month before, during or within a month after a treatment course with a formula 1 compound.","Other desirable modulation effects of the formula 1 compounds on cells or tissues include (1) inhibition of one or more of bone resorption or calcium release or gp80, gp130, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), osteoclast differentiation factor (RANKL\/ODF), RANKL\/ODF receptor, IL-6 or IL-6 receptor expression or biological activity in, e.g., bone loss or osteoporosis conditions or in osteoclasts, or in cancers such as prostate cancer, metastatic breast cancer or metastatic lung cancer (e.g., with bone metastases), (2) inhibition of osteoclastogenesis or osteoclast development from progenitor cells, (3) enhancement of NF\u03baB inhibition that is mediated by steroid receptors, e.g., enhanced inhibition of estrogen receptor-\u03b1 or estrogen receptor-\u03b2 mediated inhibition of NF\u03baB in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoporosis, (4) enhancement of osteoblastogenesis, osteoblast, bone callus or bone development, e.g., from progenitor cells in bone fractures, depressed bone healing situations (e.g., in a burn patient or in a patient being treated with a glucocorticoid), bone growth or osteoporosis or other bone loss conditions, by, e.g., modulation or enhancement of osteoblast replication or development or modulation or enhancement of the synthesis or biological activity of a transcription factor such as Cbfa1, RUNX2 or AML-3 (5) normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in conditions where there is dysregulation such as in chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic asthma or rheumatoid arthritis (increased cortisol to ACTH ratio), (6) modulation of ligand-gated ion channels in neurons in, e.g., depression, sleep or memory disorders, (8) modulation of G-protein coupled receptors in neurons in, e.g., depression, sleep or memory disorders, (9) modulation, e.g., induction, of the synthesis or biological activity of metabolic enzymes such as a cytochrome (e.g., a CYP enzyme such as CYP1A1, CYP2B1, CYP2b10, CYP4A, CYP7A, CYP7A1, CYP7B, CYP7B1, P450 3A4, P450c17, P450scc, P450c21 or an isozyme, homolog or mutant of any of these) in cells or tissues such as liver cells, neurons, neuron precursor cells, brain, breast, testes or colon, (10) enhancement of collagen synthesis or levels in, e.g., skin in aging or skin damage from, e.g., trauma, thermal injury or solar radiation, (11) inhibition of nitric oxide production in cells or tissue, e.g., in nervous system tissue or in microglial cells in dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, (12) enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin synthesis in hyperglycemia or diabetes conditions, (13) modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity or levels in, e.g., brain tissue or neurons, (e.g., decreased GABA-mediated chloride currents or potentiation of neuronal response to NMDA in the hippocampus) in, e.g., conditions such as a dementia (Alzheimer's Disease), depression, anxiety, schizophrenia or memory loss due to, e.g., aging or another condition described herein, (14) modulating (e.g., enhancing) the expression or activity of a transcription factor(s), or a homolog(s) or isoform(s), such as SET, nerve growth factor inducible protein B, StF-IT, SF-1 in cells or tissues such as nerve cells, neuronal precursor cells or liver cells, (15) inhibition of eosinophil infiltration or reduction IgE levels in allergic responses or in lung or other tissue, (16) modulation, e.g., a decrease, in serum or blood of leptin levels in, e.g., obese subjects such as humans with a body mass index of about 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 or greater, (17) increased corticotropin releasing hormone synthesis or activity in, e.g., elderly subjects such as humans at least about 60 years of age or at least about 70 years of age, (18) enhancement of memory or reduction of memory loss or disorientation in aging or dementias such as Alzheimer's Disease, (20) enhancement of the synthesis or activity of one or more enzymes responsible for thermogenesis, e.g., liver glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or malic enzyme, in subjects such as obese or diabetic humans, (21) modulation, e.g., reduction, of the synthesis or biological activity of the CXCR4 receptor or the CXCL12 chemokine in hyperproliferation conditions such as breast cancers or precancers, (22) modulation of the synthesis or biological activity of one or more of holocytochrome c, cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase, Apaf-1, Bax, procaspase-9, caspase-9, procaspase-3, caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7, e.g., enhanced translocation of these molecules from mitochondria to cytosol or activation of these molecules in the cytosol in cancer precancer cells, cancer cells or cells that mediate autoimmunity, (23) modulation of the synthesis or biological activity of one or more of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2 converting enzyme, IL-6, IL-8, caspase-4 and caspase-5, e.g., decreased activation of these molecules in injured cells or cells subject to injury from, e.g., ischemia or infarction (e.g., vascular, cardiac or cerebral), reperfusion of hypoxic cells or tissue or an inflammation condition such as rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, or another inflammation condition disclosed herein, (24) decrease of the synthesis, biological activity or activation of one or more of phospholipase A2, caspase-1, caspase-3 and procaspase-3 in neurodegeneration disorders or dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, or another neurological condition disclosed herein. The formula 1 compounds can thus be used where one or more of these conditions or their symptoms is present. Methods to measure the synthesis or biological activity of these molecules has been described, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,200,969, 6,187,767, 6,174,901, 6,110,691, 6,083,735, 6,024,940, 5,919,465 and 5,891,924.","The formula 1 compounds can facilitating release of myeloperoxidase from granulated neutrophils. The enzyme generates free hydrogen peroxide. Some of the formula 1 compounds, e.g., compounds with a halogen such as bromine or iodine at, e.g., the 16 position, can be metabolized to provide a source of halogen. In cases where the halogen is released, the released halogen can react with hydrogen peroxide (HO) to generate hypohalogenous acid such as hypobromous acid (HOBr). Exemplary compounds include a halogenated formula 1 compound such as 16-bromoepiandrosterone. Alternatively, a halogen salt, e.g., KBr, NaBr, KI or NaI, can be administered to the subject to provide a source of halogen. The halogen source can be administered to a subject as a component in a formulation that comprises a formula 1 compound or it can be administered separately. Hypohalogenous acid is a potent antimicrobial agent, which may be effective in reducing pathogens in the circulatory system of subjects with a blood cell deficiency who also have a pathogen infection. Hypohalogenous acid that is generated in vivo would provide benefits to such subject as shown by, e.g., a reduced quantitative circulating viral or bacterial culture measurement, without the toxicity that is normally associated with its direct administration to a subject. Biological activities of white blood peroxidase enzymes have been described, see, e.g., M. Saran et al., 1999 26:482-490, W. Wu et al., 2000 105:1455-1463 and Z. Shen et al., 2000 39:5474-5482.","Delayed radiation effects. Invention embodiments include a method to prevent, treat or ameliorate a symptom or condition associated with one or more delayed adverse effect, symptom or condition from radiation exposure in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject, or delivering to the subject's tissues, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound. Radiation exposure may arise from a radiation therapy where exposure is intentional, or it may arise from an accidental exposure.","Radiation therapy (\u201cRT\u201d) can generate a number of early or late delayed-onset conditions or symptoms. Delayed radiation effects are conditions or symptoms that generally arise or become detectable to the subject or to a health care provider at least about 1 month after exposure to radiation. Thus the conditions or symptoms may detectable at about 2 months, about 3 months, about 4 months, about 1 year, about 20 years or more after radiation exposure. For example, transient nervous system symptoms may develop early after RT, but progressive, permanent, often disabling nervous system damage may appear months or years later. The total radiation dose, size of the fractions, duration of RT, and volume of tissue irradiated influence the probability of the injury and its severity. Individual patient and tissue susceptibility to delayed injuries is variable, which factors into the selection of safe and effective radiation doses for RT. Total radiation doses that a subject may receive may comprise single doses or 2, 3, 4, or more doses within a range of about 1 to about 400 Gy, e.g., about 1, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 80, 100, 130, 150, 180, 200, 250, 300, 400 or more Gy. Such doses in a given course of treatment may be the same or different.","In some embodiments, the total radiation dose occurs on a single exposure that occurs in a relatively short time period, e.g., about 1-20 minutes to about 12 hours. In other embodiments, the total dose is delivered to the subject in multiple doses or over a longer time, e.g., over about 2 days to about 12 months or more in multiple doses in, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 or more individual doses. Ameliorating a side effect may comprise detectably slowing the progression of a symptom or condition or detectably reducing the ultimate expected severity of a symptom or condition. The affected condition or symptom may be detectably reduced as determined by the subject or the health care provider. Thus, after administration of a formula 1 compound, the target symptom or condition may be moderately reduced, slightly reduced, essentially nonexistent or subclinical, e.g., present at a low level that is not deemed significant by the subject or the health care provider. Amelioration of one or more conditions or symptoms that can be suitably quantified may be observed as a decrease of about 5% or more, e.g., at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 70%, at least about 80% or at least about 90% in the relative expected or potential severity or extent of the condition or symptom.","For example, in lung pneumonitis, administration of a formula 1 compound can lead to detectably increased oxygen saturation in the subject's blood by about 5% or by about 10% or more, e.g., oxygen saturation can rise from about 83% to about 88%, which would typically be detectable by the subject and the health care provider. Such decreased severity of a condition or symptom may be objectively measured in some instances, e.g., by determining the number or activity of circulating platelets or neutrophils or by evaluation of fever, severity or frequency of diarrhea or blood oxygen saturation levels. For other symptoms or conditions, prevention may be subjectively observed by a significant or detectable improvement in a relevant score, e.g., decreased fever or pain or a decreased need for treatment of fever, pain or inflammation.","Symptoms or conditions of radiation exposure that can be treated also include encephalopathy, myelopathy, nausea, diarrhea, acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, edema, pain, fever, headache, depression, malaise, weakness, hair loss, skin atrophy, skin ulceration, skin lesion, keratosis, telangiectasia, infection, e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal or yeast infection, hypoplasia, atrophy, marrow hypoplasia, hemorrhage, fibrosis, e.g., lung fibrosis, pneumonitis, bone marrow hypoplasia, hemorrhage or cytopenia, e.g., anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, edema, fibrosis or hemorrhage or the need for edema, fibrosis or hemorrhage treatment. Such symptoms or conditions may arise from one or more radiation-damaged tissues or cells, including lymphoid cells, bowel or intestinal epithelium or tissue, bone marrow, testicles, ovaries, brain tissue, spinal cord tissue or skin epithelium.","Exemplary symptoms or conditions associated with late effects of radiation exposure include (1) acute or chronic radiation-induced enteritis or diarrhea, e.g., in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy, (2) pseudomembranous inflammation, (3) perivascular fibrosis, (4) endothelial cell damage or death, e.g., associated with vascular radiation therapy, (5) cardiac tissue inflammation or damage or pericardial disease, e.g., in pediatric or adult patients receiving radiation therapy for a leukemia, thoracic neoplasm or other malignancy, (6) pulmonary tissue inflammation or damage, (7) hematopoietic or marrow cell inflammation or damage, e.g., in wide field radiation therapy, (8) endocrine or thyroid dysfunction, e.g., in thalamic or hypothalamic tumors in pediatric or other patients, (9) decreased growth or decreased bone development or density, e.g., in pediatric patients receiving radiation therapy for a childhood leukemia or other malignancy, (10) central nervous system inflammation or damage, e.g., in pediatric or adult patients receiving radiation therapy for a leukemia (e.g., CNS acute lymphocytic leukemia) or other malignancy, (11) connective tissue damage after radiation therapy, (12) incidence or severity of a secondary leukemia such as acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia and (13) gastric ulceration, bleeding, small bowel obstruction or fistula formation in, e.g., patients receiving radiation therapy to the gastrointestinal tract. These symptoms or conditions are treated or ameliorated using the formula 1 compounds essentially as disclosed herein.","In treating such symptoms or conditions, slowing the progression of a symptom, condition or side effect will detectably reduce the rate at which the condition, symptom or side effect worsens or intensifies. In some embodiments, pronounced slowing of the rate of progression is, e.g., the time needed to progress to an expected or a measurable point, which may be increased by a period of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30 or more days to a period of about 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 or more months.","Radiation-associated brain damage can give rise to acute encephalopathy with symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, somnolence, depression, disorientation, and worsening neurologic signs. The encephalopathy may arise from the first, second or a subsequent radiation fraction, e.g., when high intracranial pressure has not been treated with, e.g., corticosteroids. Late-delayed radiation damage to the brain or nervous system can arise at about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 months to 1, 2, 3 or more years after leukemia prophylaxis in children or after brain tumor prophylaxis or treatment in adults. Symptoms often include pain or headache and progressive dementia without focal signs and adults typically also develop an unsteady gait. Cerebral atrophy appears on CT scans in some cases. Late-delayed damage can arise at about 1 week, about 2 weeks about 2 months or about 1-2 years after irradiation of extracranial tumors or high-dose irradiation of intracranial tumors, e.g., brachytherapy or radiosurgery, although the symptoms are generally more focal. The invention method would be used during the time period when such symptoms would be expected to arise, e.g., commencing at about 1-5 days or about 7-60 days after radiation exposure and ending at about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more years later. Exemplary brachytherapies and unsealed source therapies include prostate I seed implants in prostate conditions such as prostate cancer, Yt conjugated to monoclonal antibodies or in endovascular brachial radiotherapy.","Early-delayed radiation spinal cord myelopathy follows radiation therapy to the spinal cord, neck, upper thorax or lumbar region or and it is often characterized by Lhermitte's sign, i.e., an electric shock-like sensation radiating down the back and into the legs on neck flexion. Late-delayed radiation myelopathy can arise months or years after therapy for extraspinal tumors, e.g., Hodgkin's disease. Other symptoms can include progressive weakness and sensory loss, such as a Brown-S\u00e9quard type, i.e., a proprioceptive sensory loss and weakness on one side of the body and loss of temperature and pain sensation on the other side. Progression times vary, but many human patients suffering from late-delayed radiation spinal cord myelopathy become paraplegic. Late-delayed radiation neuropathy may produce brachial neuropathy, e.g., after treatment for breast or lung cancer. Radiation can also give rise to gliomas, meningiomas, or peripheral nerve sheath tumors at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more years after therapy. The formula 1 compounds will generally be administered at about the time period when these symptoms would be expected to arise, e.g., commencing at about 1-5 days, or about 7-60 days or about 6 or 12 months after radiation exposure and ending at about 3, 4, 6 months later or about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more years later. In some embodiments, the formula 1 compound is administered to the subject on the same day that a planned or accidental radiation exposure occurs and dosing is continued for about 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 or more weeks to about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more years, or for a time as disclosed elsewhere herein.","Early-delayed encephalopathy often arises or is detectable at about 2, 3 or 4 months after radiation therapy. This encephalopathy in adults, is distinguished from worsening or recurrent brain tumor by, e.g., computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The condition in children can occur as a somnolence syndrome, e.g., after whole-brain irradiation for leukemia. The condition in children typically improves spontaneously over several days to weeks. Such encephalopathies can be prevented, delayed in onset, recede more rapidly and\/or be less severe when a formula 1 compound is administered to the subject throughout the period when encephalopathy can arise, e.g., beginning about a week, two weeks or a month before the expected onset of a symptom or condition and ending about a week or month or two months after it would be expected to arise or to resolve.","In some embodiments, a radiation late effect is a symptom or condition that may arise months or years after radiation exposure, treatment with the formula 1 compound can commence shortly, e.g., about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14, 21 or 28 days, after the radiation exposure or after initiation of a radiation treatment. In other embodiments, the invention treatment method can commence after radiation exposure has terminated, e.g., about 1-30 days or about 1-72 months or more after radiation exposure. In these embodiments, the treatment method can be administered over a period of months or years, e.g., about 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 or more months. In some embodiments, dosing of the subject will occur for a period of about 2-12 months or for a period of about 4-6 months. Occasionally, treatment for radiation late effects will commence on the day of or before initiation of a planned radiation treatment, e.g., at about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28 or more days before a planned exposure to radiation of a sufficient dose to a subject that will potentially generate, or is likely to generate, one or more radiation late effects, symptoms or conditions in the subject, e.g., any radiation-associated symptom or condition disclosed herein. In any of these embodiments, dosing of the subject with the formula 1 compound can be on a daily dosing basis or on an intermittent basis, e.g., using a treatment protocol essentially as described herein or in the cited references.","The formula 1 compounds can be used to prevent, ameliorate, slow the progression and\/or reduce the ultimate severity of marrow hypoplasia, hemorrhage, e.g., brainstem hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage or gastric hemorrhage or cytopenia, e.g., a blood cell count about 4-25% or more below the low end of a normal range for the subject, e.g., one or more of anemia (e.g., less than about 4.0\u00d710red cells\/L for adult human females and less than about 4.5\u00d710red cells\/L in adult human males or a hemoglobin level of less than about 12.0 g\/dL in adult human females and less than about 13.5 g\/dL in adult human males), late effect leukopenia (e.g., adult human white blood cell counts less than about 3,800, 4,000 or 4,300 mm; adult human basophil counts less than about 10 or 15 mm; adult human neutrophil counts less than about 1,600, 1,800 or 2,000 mm; human eosinophil level less than about 100, 120 or 150 mm; monocyte level less than about 260 or 300 mm) or late effect thrombocytopenia (e.g., human platelet counts less than about 15,000, 18,000 or 20,000 mm).","In some embodiments, an effective amount of a formula 1 compound is administered to a subject, or delivered to the subject's tissues, wherein the subject has received or has been exposed to a total radiation dose of at least about 0.5 Gy to about 100 Gy or more. The radiation dosage may comprise a single dose or two, three, four, five, six, 10 or more divided doses or subdoses. Thus, in exemplary embodiments, the subject may have received a total radiation dose in ranges of about 0.2-300 Gy, about 0.2-100 Gy, about 0.2-80 Gy 0.2-60 Gy, about 0.2-40 Gy, about 0.2-20 Gy, about 0.2-12 Gy, about 0.2-10 Gy, about 0.2-8 Gy, about 0.2-6 Gy or about 0.2-4 Gy. Subdivided doses may be administered on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more occasions and such doses may be, e.g., about 0.05, 0.1, 0.3., 0.5, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or more Gy per subdose.
