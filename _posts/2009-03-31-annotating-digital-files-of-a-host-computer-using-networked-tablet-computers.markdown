{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The disclosure relates generally to applying annotations to computer files. The disclosure relates more particularly to annotating digital files on a host computer using a peripheral device based on a selected portion of a display of the host.","The approaches described in this section are approaches that could be pursued, but not necessarily approaches that have been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","Despite the widespread use of computers and information technology, some areas of commerce continue to require archaic practices, such as requirements for physical signatures. In response, some organizations, such as the United States Patent & Trademark Office, have relaxed their requirements for handwritten signatures and will accept electronic signatures comprised of typewritten (ASCII) characters. Similarly, electronic commerce is widely performed without use of handwritten signatures or other handwritten information. The Federal Rules of Evidence treat electronic signatures and handwritten signatures equivalently. Nevertheless, a physical signature remains required practice in many commercial fields. For example, real estate transactions are often documented by multiple facsimile transmissions containing handwritten signatures and text, even though legibility may be difficult and there is no convenient way to digitally store signature information.","However, in some cases handwriting and physical signatures are desirable. For example, collaborative document editing and management is sometimes better performed using handwriting rather than a keyboard.","Marking and annotating documents on a computer screen has been difficult or expensive in past practice. Digitizing tablets have been used to enable sketching on computer screens. Typically such digitizing tablets have used sophisticated pressure sensing circuits and materials, but they are not easy for ordinary people to use. Further, relatively few digitizing tablets are deployed in the field and few host computer applications (such as personal computer applications) can accept input from digitizing tablets. One manufacturer offers displays with integrated pen sensors, but these displays are very expensive and not easy to carry. Tablet computers have been offered, but for reasons of price and functionality, have not proved popular.","In an embodiment, a computer-implemented method comprises receiving, at a tablet computer that is coupled to a host computer, image data representing a selected portion of an electronic document;

Overview of Annotating Digital Files of a Host Computer Using a Peripheral Device with a Single User","In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides techniques for annotating digital files of a host computer using a peripheral device. In one embodiment, a single user operates a tablet computer in conjunction with a host computer. In one approach, digital files of a host computer may be annotated using a tablet computer hosting an application that supports using the tablet as an input device for the application to provide stroke data to a document. In a second approach, digital files stored on the tablet computer may be annotated using the tablet computer. In a third approach, digital files on a host computer may be annotated using a tablet computer that operates as an independent device under control of a driver or other host computer application. In a fourth approach, digital files that are stored in an external storage service, rather than in the host computer or in the tablet computer, may be annotated using a tablet computer. In another embodiment, multiple users each having a different separate tablet computer may collaborate to annotate digital documents using networked processes. A particular tablet computer may implement hardware, firmware, other logic, or computer programs to provide any one, all, or a subcombination of the approaches and embodiments described herein.","Operation of an electronic marking system from a single-user perspective is illustrated first with respect to , , and .  illustrates a computer display of a host computer and a tablet display of a tablet computer.  illustrates the displays of  after a user has disconnected the tablet computer from the host computer, and placed an annotation on the tablet display.  illustrates the displays of  after the user has reconnected the tablet computer to the host computer. Referring first to , a system  comprises a computer display  of a host computer that is connected to a tablet  having a tablet display unit . In an embodiment, tablet  comprises a computer peripheral device having the internal elements described further herein in relation to . Alternatively, other kinds of peripheral devices may be used with the techniques herein.","In an embodiment, tablet  comprises a connection  that is configured to couple to an appropriate interface on the host computer. In an embodiment, connection  is a USB connection. USB provides a relatively high-speed serial interface through which images may be received from the host computer and stroke data may be communicated to the host. In an embodiment, connection  is made by a wireless connection, using a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other transmission mechanism.","The host computer hosts an application program that causes generating and displaying a graphical user interface on the host computer. Example application programs include, but are not limited to, a word processor, spreadsheet, e-mail client, video editor, etc. For purposes of illustrating a clear example, , ,  show a graphical display of \u201cOpenOffice.org Writer,\u201d but other applications may be used in other embodiments.","In an embodiment, the application program is configured to enable a user, process or system to select a portion of the display . In an embodiment, portion  of computer display  denotes the selected portion.","In an embodiment, the application program is configured to communicate image data representing the selected portion  of computer display  to the tablet , and in response, the tablet computer reproduces the display of the portion on the tablet display unit . The image data representing the selected portion  may comprise a copy of a bitmap or other graphical image obtained from the graphical user interface of the host computer display . Thus, the same image data is displayed on the tablet display unit corresponding to the selected portion . In one embodiment, the image data may be obtained by the application program performing a call to an application programming interface of an operating system of the host computer to result in copying a portion of display memory.","In an embodiment, only portion  of computer display  is transmitted to tablet ; alternatively, an entire file hosted at computer  may be communicated to the tablet, with additional information identifying the portion . In an embodiment, the portion  is displayed in a manner that occupies substantially all of the available display space of tablet display unit . However, in other embodiments, the portion  may occupy only a part of the available display space of tablet display unit .","In an embodiment, the tablet display unit  is a stroke-sensitive display that can receive and record user input in the form of handwritten strokes using a stylus or other marker or pointing device. A user may provide user input representing one or more annotations to the information shown on tablet display unit , causing data representing the handwritten strokes to be communicated to the host computer, or to other computers. The annotations may be applied while the tablet  is (1) physically coupled to the host computer, as illustrated in , (2) physically uncoupled to the host computer but in communication with the host computer, for example, via a Wi-Fi connection, or (3) not connected to the host computer and not in communication with the host computer.","Referring now to , any wireless or wired links between tablet  and the host computer have been removed (disconnected). Disconnection allows to user to operate tablet  wherever desired, offering the user added convenience and mobility. Memory in tablet  retains the selected portion  of computer display  and a processor and program logic in the tablet causes the tablet display unit  to continue to display the selected portion. The user may annotate tablet display unit  using a stylus with any markings desired. As an example, the user has written the annotation \u201chello, world\u201d on the tablet display unit . A memory in tablet  stores tablet data representing all user input to the tablet.","Referring now to , tablet  is reconnected using connection  to the host computer. In an embodiment, upon reconnection, instructions in the host computer and tablet  cause transferring the user annotations (in this example, data representing \u201chello, world\u201d) written upon tablet  and incorporate the tablet data into portion  of computer display . For example, when a USB connection is used, reconnecting the tablet using connection  can trigger operation of a plug-and-play driver for the connection that causes the host computer to retrieve annotations that were stored in memory of the tablet.","In an embodiment, the tablet data is also incorporated into the file that is displayed by computer display . The annotations may be combined with portion  and stored in a display file in the tablet  for transfer to the host computer. In this example, the phrase \u201chello, world\u201d is reproduced on computer display  in portion  in the same proportions relative to proportions of the original user input that was written on tablet . In an embodiment, the proportion ratio can be adjusted up or down as desired using functions of the application program on the host computer.","Thus, in one approach, the techniques herein comprise receiving, at a tablet display unit that is coupled to a host computer, image data representing a selected portion of a graphical display on a computer display unit of the host computer; displaying the same image data on a stroke-sensitive display of the tablet display unit; receiving user input from the stroke-sensitive display of the tablet display unit and representing handwritten strokes; storing, in a memory of the tablet display unit, a data file based at least upon the user input and the image data. In this way, a computer peripheral device may be used to annotate information that was originally generated at a host computer. Example annotations may include signatures on electronic documents, comments on electronic documents, markings of significant portions or passages in electronic documents, modifications or comments on graphical images, drawings, or plans, etc.","In one particular embodiment, portion  comprises a signature block region of an electronic document such as a contract, proposal, letter, or legal document. Tablet  displays only the signature block in the tablet display unit . A user can sign the electronic document by writing a signature on the stroke-sensitive tablet display unit using a stylus or pen. The signature is communicated back to the host computer and forms part of the electronic document at the host computer.","Using this approach, an inexpensive peripheral device can be used to facilitate signatures and annotations with far more ease and convenience than prior approaches. In particular, reproducing portion  on the tablet display unit  provides context for the signature of the user. The user is not required to look back and forth between the tablet display unit  and the computer display  in an attempt to orient the stylus in the right location to sign the electronic document. Instead, reproducing the portion  on the tablet display unit  enables the user to see the location to be signed or annotated on the peripheral on which the signing or annotating is performed. Further, in an embodiment, the portion  as shown in the tablet display unit  is a reproduction of a bitmap graphic image of the computer display , so that the appearance of the tablet display unit is substantially similar to a portion of the computer display. This approach improves the orientation and comprehension of the user and provides a clear connection between what is being annotated or signed and what is displayed on the host computer.","2. Example Structural and Functional Overview of Tablet","2.1 Example Tablet Computer Arrangement","An example structural overview and functional overview of an embodiment of tablet  is now further described with reference to , , and , B, C, D.  illustrates a tablet computer.  illustrates logic modules of the tablet computer. , B, C, D illustrate various processes of annotating digital files of a host computer using a tablet computer.","Referring first to , in an embodiment, tablet  comprises a tablet display unit  communicatively coupled to a processor  through a display driver . The processor  is further coupled to a memory  and battery , which may include a charging circuit, using bus . Processor  may be coupled to a network interface , such as an Ethernet interface configured to couple to a router, modem, local area network (LAN) equipment, wireless network or lines.","In an embodiment, tablet  omits high-performance non-volatile storage such as disk storage, omits a high-performance processor, display or graphics processor, and has a single serial interface and optionally a network interface. The tablet  may comprise a computer peripheral device that combines a relatively small display and an input device, featuring a stroke-sensitive graphical display, stylus, microcontroller, and NVRAM storage. The device allows an application program to store images to the device for display, and then sends strokes back to the application program when marks are made on its surface.","In an embodiment, tablet display unit  is an electronic ink display. In an embodiment, tablet display unit  is an electrophoretic display, such as VIZPLEX imaging film, manufactured by E*Ink Corporation layered with a backplane from Prime View International.","In an embodiment, touch input sensor  is configured on tablet display unit , and touch input sensor  may cover an area larger than the area of the tablet display unit . In an embodiment, touch input sensor  is a Wacom sensor or touch panel.","In an embodiment, tablet display unit  is a combination of a stroke-sensitive display such as an electronic ink display with a touch-sensitive layer. In an embodiment, tablet display unit  is an electrophoretic display capable of accepting pen-based input, such as VIZPLEX imaging film, manufactured by E*Ink Corporation, combined with a resistive or RF touch panel layered above or below the display.","Memory  contains storage for executable instructions  and user input data . In an embodiment, memory  comprises non-volatile memory, such as flash memory. Executable instructions , the operation of which is further described below with respect to  and , include instructions for an annotation application that accepts and displays user input, and instructions for communicating with a computer connected through connection . Thus, the tablet  may store all the applications for annotation, signature or editing, and documents to be annotated, signed or edited using handwritten strokes on the tablet display unit.","Processor  processes executable instructions  and user input data , and additionally processes instructions and\/or data that may reside on processor . In an embodiment, processor  is a microcontroller, such as a PXA270 XScale processor, manufactured by Marvell Corporation.","In an embodiment, electrical power for tablet display unit , processor , and memory  is supplied through the connection  while the connection is connected to a host computer. For example, the power capabilities of a USB interface may be used to provide power to the tablet .","In an embodiment, tablet  optionally includes a battery  for providing power to active elements of the tablet. In an embodiment, power for recharging the battery  is supplied using the connection .","Referring now to , executable instructions  may comprise a plurality of software modules. In an embodiment, executable instructions  include a local interface module  and a remote interface module . Local interface module  comprises instructions for presenting a user interface on tablet display unit , in which the user interface accepts and displays input supplied with a stylus, pen, or through touch. Remote interface  comprises instructions for communicating with a host computer.","In an embodiment, remote interface  is configured to provide a host application  to the host computer. Host application  permits viewing on the computer display of a display file, and further permits the user to select a graphical region appearing on the computer display that represents a visual portion of the display file viewed on the computer display. In an embodiment, host application  comprises a portable document file (PDF) viewer. In an embodiment, host application  is written in the JAVA programming language. In an embodiment, host application  is written as an Ajax web application. In an embodiment, host application  is written as an Adobe Air application. In various embodiments, connecting tablet  to the host computer using the connection  triggers the tablet to transfer the host application  to the host computer for execution at the host.","In an embodiment, display file  resides in memory  of tablet . In an embodiment, the display file resides on the host computer. In an embodiment, the display file resides on a network accessible to either tablet  or the computer.","In another embodiment, tablet  comprises digital electronic logic in the form of firmware, one or more application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), other logic gates, or a combination thereof to implement the functions that are described herein for executable instructions and the modules and applications shown in , . Thus, there is no requirement to implement the instructions, modules and applications purely in software.","2.2 Operations Using an Application on the Tablet Computer","Tablet computers as shown in ,  may comprise logic configured to cause the tablet computer to operate according to one or more of the processes described herein with reference to , , , and .  illustrates a process of annotating digital files of a host computer using a tablet computer hosting an application that supports using the tablet as an input device for the application to provide stroke data to a document. In the example of operation of tablet  of , activation of the tablet at step  occurs when a connection between the tablet and the host computer is established. At step , the host computer recognizes tablet . In an embodiment, USB plug-and-play recognition techniques are used and the computer recognizes tablet  as a USB Mass Storage Device. In an embodiment, the host computer recognizes tablet  as a WebDAV server.","At step , host application  is downloaded from the tablet  and initiated or executed on the host computer. At step , a document is selected from a filesystem of the host computer. For example, host application  executing in the host computer initiates a file open dialog by calling an appropriate operating system application programming interface (API) call. As a result, a file folder, directory or list is displayed on computer display . In an embodiment, the contents of the folder, directory or list may be displayed on the tablet  using display .","The host application  accepts user input identifying a file stored in the host computer, or in networked storage that is attached to or mounted on the host computer. In response to receiving user input that identifies a particular file, the selected file is displayed on computer display  at step .","At step , a window for user input is displayed on computer display . The window represents a portion or region of the currently displayed document within which the user is permitted to enter stroke data or annotations using the tablet . In an embodiment, the size and position of the window is automatically selected by host application . Optionally, the host application  may call an operating system API call to highlight or identify the window on the computer display  using a colored rectangle, other polygon, highlighting, graying out, a pop-up window, or other display techniques.","As part of step , image data representing the selected region of the computer display  is communicated to the tablet  from the host computer using an image data transfer protocol. In an embodiment, image data is transmitted using Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) as defined in standard 15740 of the International Standards Organization (ISO). In the embodiment of , the host application  automatically communicates a bitmap of the selected region to the tablet.","At step , the tablet  accepts one or more strokes representing user input for the document. User input representing handwritten strokes of one or more signatures, annotations, or other information may be accepted by tablet . Data representing strokes may be captured by the logical elements of tablet  and temporarily stored in local memory. Concurrently, under control of the CPU of the tablet , display  displays the resulting changes made by the user at step .","In an embodiment, when a user writes on the tablet, the tablet displays the strokes at step  and concurrently sends stroke data to the host application  at step  for use in updating the document or for storage in association with the document. The stroke data may be sent as a stream of event data, such as USB user interface (UI) events that are transferred according to USB Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. As a result, the host application  at the host computer can capture stroke data for integration or annotation into a document.","In an embodiment, changes to the file are saved in response to a command of the user. In an embodiment, changes are automatically saved at a periodic interval, and the value of the interval is selected by host application  or selected by the user. In an embodiment, the user may issue a print command to print all or portions of the display file, as a regular print job or as a PDF file, for example.","In an embodiment, tablet  is configured with logic to process connection and disconnection events asynchronously with respect to the process of . For example, during any step in the process of , a user might disconnect the tablet  from the host computer, or might re-connect the tablet after a previous disconnect action. Tablet  may receive a disconnect command or signal using any of several peripheral device protocols. For example, in a USB implementation, a tablet disconnect command may be generated internally automatically in response to a user separating a USB connection of the tablet to the host computer. Functions, behavior or operations of tablet  in response to a disconnect event may vary depending upon the state of the tablet or the step in the process of  at which the disconnect event occurs. For example, in one embodiment, in response to a disconnect event after step  the tablet  may continue to perform step , , but suspend transmission of stroke data at step  or buffer the stroke data that is intended to be transmitted.","Similarly, a reconnection event may occur at any time and the tablet  may be configured to respond to reconnection in different ways depending on internal state. For example, the tablet  may be configured to determine whether local state data indicates whether the host application  has been downloaded to the host computer, and if not, to initiate operation at step . The tablet  may be configured to check whether the stroke data buffer is empty and to transmit all buffered stroke data to the host computer in response to a reconnection event. Thus, in an embodiment, once disconnected from the host computer, control for tablet  returns to step , and the user may then provide offline input that is later transmitted at step  upon reconnection. This option provides the user the ability to prepare a display file with a portion displayed on tablet , and deliver the tablet at a later time and at any location, for a person to view the display file and add an annotation to the display file.","In an embodiment, after reconnection and after step  is performed, at step  the updated document is displayed on the host computer.","Responding to a disconnect event also may include switching a power source of the tablet  to the internal battery.","2.3 Operations Using a Document Stored on the Tablet Computer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","402","404","420","120","120","420"]},"Step  comprises selecting a document that is stored in a filesystem of the tablet . For example, tablet  may comprise logic configured to manage a file storage system within NVRAM or other storage in the tablet. The logic may be configured to display a file open dialog, list, or other user interaction mechanism for displaying available files in the filesystem and receiving user input that selects a particular file. As a result, a user selects and the tablet  identifies a particular document or file, stored in the filesystem within the tablet, for signature or annotation using stroke data.","At step , if the tablet  is connected to the host computer, the selected document is transferred from the tablet to the host computer and displayed on the host computer. Steps , ,  are performed as described above for , resulting in creating and locally storing stroke data representing user input of a signature, annotation, or other information.","Thereafter at step  the document is updated in the tablet filesystem using the stroke data. For example, stroke data or stroke events may be stored in metadata in association with a file so that later retrieval of the same file results in interpreting the metadata and displaying corresponding strokes, annotations or other information in display  of the tablet . For example, if the file is a text document or word processor document, stroke data may be converted into a signature image that is stored within a graphical box in the document, or in metadata associated with the document. Alternatively, the stroke data may be stored directly within the annotated file; for example, if the annotated file is stored in graphical bitmap format, then user input of strokes may be used to directly modify the bitmapped data, resulting in storing a new bitmap file that incorporates the strokes.","After step  is performed, at step  the updated document is transmitted to the host computer. In an embodiment, after step  is performed, at step  the updated document is displayed on the host computer.","In an embodiment, content-based identifiers (CBIs) are used to associate stroke data with document content. As a CBI is a unique traceable identification code for a document, the CBI of the original document could be transferred with the document, and used by tablet  as a \u201ckeycode\u201d to ensure synchronization with the correct document. For example, if the host document were modified while tablet  was offline, an attempted synchronization would reveal a disparity between the document versions. A CBI may be based on a cryptographic hash such as an MD5 hash or SHA-1 hash computed over a file based on the contents of the file, and may serve as a unique identifier for a file, analogous to a file name.","In an embodiment, tablet  may comprise logic implementing a USB storage device protocol. In this embodiment, tablet  can accept an original file as well as the display image. Metadata in the original file enables logic in the tablet  to determine which part of the original document it is displaying, allowing the tablet to carry a document for signature or annotation to another computer. In an embodiment, tablet  carries both a document and an editor application, so that both are available for use on any host computer.","2.4 Annotating a Document Using the Tablet Computer as an Independent Device",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0094","num":"0093"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","402","430","120","120","120"]},"Alternatively, printing a document from the host computer to a specified printer driver, associated with the tablet , may cause the host computer to transfer data to the tablet and to instruct the tablet about the contents of a document to be worked on. In an embodiment, opening an editing application on the host computer may automatically transfer the current document to a tablet  that is connected to the host.","Next at step  a document stored in the filesystem of the host computer is selected, as described above for . Step  is also performed as described for .","At step , the application or a user selects an input window within the selected document, and the input window is displayed on the tablet . In an embodiment, the application program of the host computer that is launched at step  inherently includes a facility that enables a user to select a portion of a graphical user interface display for annotation. In an embodiment, the user then sizes and positions this window as desired. For example, the application program may provide a selection tool that enables a user to select a rectangular region of the display of the application program by dragging a pointing device such as a mouse or trackball. Thus, the host application permits a user to specify a screen region for annotation, and might provide a resizable and positionable rectangle on the host computer screen.","The selected window is transferred to the tablet  as part of step . In an embodiment, in response to a selection signal, such as clicking a mouse button, the host computer application or logic communicates a bitmap of the selected region from the host computer to the tablet. A signal to transfer image data also may comprise moving the rectangle, or altering content of the document shown on the host computer screen.","Thereafter, steps , , ,  are performed as described above for . As a result, the tablet  may operate as an independent peripheral device under host computer control to provide stroke data representing a signature, annotation or other information for a document that is stored on the host computer.","2.5 Annotating a Document Stored in an External File Service and Referenced on the Tablet Computer",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0101","num":"0100"},"figref":["FIG. 4D","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4A"],"b":["400","402","404","440","120","120"]},"The tablet  comprises logic that is configured to provide a file open dialog or other mechanism for displaying a folder, directory, or list of file references to a user, and to receive user input selecting one of the file references. The local filesystem may store a name of each file in association with a file reference and other metadata such as creation date, permissions, size, and file type, any one or more of which may be displayed to the user in the file open dialog. The logic may be configured to prompt a user to select a file reference and to detect and validate user input representing a file selection.","In step , in response to receiving user input selecting a file, the selected document or file is loaded into the host computer using temporary local storage and displayed on the computer display. File retrieval may be based on the CBI, or the tablet  may comprise logic that implements APIs or other processing for NAS, SAN, or other external storage systems so that the tablet can form and transmit one or more protocol-specific requests, such as file open or file lock requests, for the external storage systems.","In a variation, step  may comprise retrieving the external file or document and storing the file or document in local storage of the tablet  rather than on the host computer.","After step , steps , ,  proceed as described above for .","After step , at step , the updated document is displayed on the host computer.","After step , at step , the document is updated in the external filesystem by storing stroke data in the document or in association with the document. For example, the tablet  may pass a CBI or other file reference to the host computer, which the host computer then uses to store an updated copy of the document with stroke data, signatures, annotations or other information in the external storage system. Alternatively, the document may be updated in the tablet  and communicated from the tablet to the external storage system in updated form, or the tablet may communicate metadata comprising the stroke data, signatures, annotations or other information to the external storage system.","3. Overview of Annotating Digital Files of a Host Computer Using Multiple Networked Tablets","3.1 General Overview","Further benefits can be achieved when multiple tablets are connected using a network and share a common display file. Once configured, a set of multiple-user networked tablets permit users to view and sign the common display file. For example, a seller in Los Angeles can sign a sales agreement using a display tablet at or near the same time that a buyer in New York signs the same sales agreement using a display tablet. The sales agreement could be provided by a third party, such as a lender in Boston, who places the original sales agreement on a secure website, the secure website accessed by seller, buyer, and lender using a password.","In an embodiment, a multi-user transaction may be completed as follows. When all users have annotated a common display file and have indicated that it is acceptable as a final version, as further described below, the common display file is considered a completed display file. In a multiple user transaction, each networked tablet that is capable of, or required to, annotate the display file is considered a client. Management of the transaction is performed by an administrator. In an embodiment, a client may also be the administrator; thus management may be performed using a networked tablet.","In an embodiment, each networked tablet includes executable instructions  configured to cause the networked tablet to function as a client that can view and annotate a common display file sent to the networked tablet. In an embodiment, executable instructions  also include instructions configured to cause the client to perform one or more of: (a) saving, sending, or printing one or more versions of the common display file; (b) saving, sending, or printing the completed display file.","In an embodiment, operations such as saving, sending, and printing each may be performed locally with respect to a networked tablet or performed remotely over the network. For example, if authorized by the administrator, a client may save an annotated common display file to storage that is locally connected to the network tablet. For example, the annotated common display file may be stored to a USB flash memory device with administrator authorization. Similarly, with authorization from the administrator, the client may print the annotated common display file using a network printer that is coupled to a local area network in which the tablet participates.","In an embodiment discussed further below, a networked tablet may be configured to act as administrator and manage the transaction among the clients.","In structural configuration, the arrangement of  may be used for a networked tablet , with certain optional modifications as now described. In an embodiment, for ease of portability, network interface  may comprise a wireless interface. In an embodiment, network interface  comprises a wireless interface that conforms to a wireless protocol standard such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) or a variant thereof. In an embodiment, network interface  is configured to communicate using the Bluetooth protocol.","In an embodiment, a networked tablet may comprise a battery  configured to provide electrical power to operate all components of the networked tablet. In an embodiment, networked tablet includes an external power connection configured to connect to an external power source, such as 120\/220V alternating current. Alternatively, the external power connection may be configured for a low-power DC input such as 12 VDC from an external power adapter, or 5 VDC from a USB serial bus connection. In an embodiment, recharging of battery  is provided using power supplied using the external power connection.","In an embodiment, the networked tablet may be configured as a standalone computing device that operates independent of any local computing device. Executable instructions  contained in memory  of the networked may include networking instructions permitting the networked tablet to act either as client or administrator, or both. Operation and features of the networking instructions will be described below with respect to an example network configuration.","3.2 Example Network Configuration: Central Repository at a Server",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0119","num":"0118"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","502","504","506","508","520","502","504","506","508"]},"In an embodiment, an optional server  is coupled to networked tablets , , , , and the server comprises a storage repository for the common display file. In an embodiment, the common display file is maintained on server  using an electronic record authentication product. For example, the ABSOLUTEPROOF product of Surety, LLC and available at the \u201csurety.com\u201d website may be used.","In an embodiment, an optional administrator  is also connected to the network  and acts as the administrator of transactions involving networked tablets. In an embodiment, one of networked tablets , , ,  is the administrator. In an embodiment, server  is the administrator.","In an embodiment, each networked tablet is initialized and authenticated by server  in response to the networked tablet joining the network or joining a group or domain with which documents will be processed. The particular techniques used for a networked tablet to join a network or group, initialize or authenticate are not critical and any of several known group authentication and membership mechanisms may be used. In an embodiment, each networked tablet loads a temporary display file that is retrieved from server . For example, the temporary display file could be a finalized contract in PDF format to be signed by the users of each networked tablets , , , . As another example, the temporary display file could be a version of a contract in a word-processing format, to be edited in its native format by one or more users, prior to or during the exchange of annotations made by the users. In other embodiments, the temporary display file comprises any other set of data suitable for signing, viewing or annotation by a plurality of users of tablets.","As an example, assume that a transaction involves a seller in Los Angeles, a buyer in New York, and a lender in Boston. Referring again to , assume that the seller in Los Angeles operates networked tablet , the buyer in New York operates networked tablet , and the lender in Boston acts as administrator . Further assume that administrator  controls a sales contract file residing on server  that is to serve as an agreement between the buyer and seller. In embodiments, administrator  and server  may occupy the same physical location; however, such co-location is not necessary. A copy of the sales contract file in its original form serves as the temporary display file sent to the clients. A copy of the sales contract file in its original form is maintained on server  as the common display file.","Networked tablets ,  each load the temporary display file. In an embodiment, once a client networked tablet loads the temporary display file, the client networked tablet sends an acknowledgment back to the administrator and awaits notification from the administrator that annotations may be supplied using the tablet display unit  or touch input sensor .","Annotations made on each of networked tablets ,  by the seller in Los Angeles and the buyer in New York are captured as stroke data locally at each of the networked tablets respectively. In an embodiment, the stroke data includes the individual lines that make up the strokes, their corresponding positions on the displayed page or portion, and the identity of the displayed page. In an embodiment, the stroke data includes a time value corresponding to a time at which the tablet captured or received the stroke data. In an embodiment, the sample capture rate may be adjusted; for example, a rate of 20 samples per second may be used while a pen is in contact with tablet display unit  or the pen is used to provide input to touch input sensor .","Each tablet ,  separately sends stroke data over network  to server , which incorporates the stroke data into the common display file. As the common display file is updated, it is retransmitted to the tablets ,  to function as a temporary display file for each networked tablets. Thus, the buyer in New York and the seller in Los Angeles may annotate their displays and view the annotations made in near-real time, nearly simultaneously.","The manner in which an actual transaction is completed has many variations accommodated by suitable agreement of the users, and can be incorporated in various embodiments. For example, in an embodiment, completion is determined by the administrator, and after completion no client may add further annotations to the then-existing common display file on server . In this approach, upon completion, the common display file at the time of completion becomes an authoritative completed display file that memorializes the transaction.","Similarly, in an embodiment, completion may occur a pre-set time applicable to all client networked tablets, in order to prevent one user from attempting to modify the common display file after another user has indicated the transaction is completed. To facilitate this approach, the networked tablets may implement a clock synchronization protocol, such as Network Time Protocol (NTP). In an embodiment, completion may comprise a two-step process in which each client first activates a Stop command to signify the client's termination of input, and after all clients have activated the Stop command, all clients then activate an Accept command to generate the completed display file. Such a process would permit each user to fully review the common display file prior to indicating acceptance.","In an embodiment, timestamp information is stored in the common display file with the stroke data, providing an annotation history timeline on the completed display file. In an embodiment, one or more networked tablets are unable to print or save a common display file, but print or save functions may be permitted for the completed display file.","3.3 Example Network Configuration: Peer-To-Peer","In the example presented above, a network  of tablets uses server  as an authoritative, centralized storage point. Alternatively, other configurations may be used to create a completed display file acceptable to all participants. For example, the set of clients and the administrator may form one of a number of types of peer-to-peer networks, in which stroke data from a client is passed through the peer-to-peer network to all other clients and the administrator. A networked tablet may be both a client and the administrator in the peer-to-peer network. In an embodiment, the peer-to-peer network is configured using Voice over IP (VoIP) clients with networked tablets configurable as both ordinary hosts and supernodes. In an embodiment, the Skype peer-to-peer protocol, or a variant thereof, is used. In an embodiment, the peer-to-peer network is configured using the T.120 Multipoint Data Conferencing and Real Time Communication Protocols or a variant thereof. Alternatively, the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol could be used.","In an embodiment, executable instructions  on each networked tablet permit the networked tablet to exchange data (such as stroke data) in peer-to-peer network comprised of a set of networked tablets. In an embodiment, one of the networked tablets may function as administrator on the peer-to-peer network.","3.4 Example Security Protocols","If desired, executable instructions  on a networked tablet may include security features and protocols sufficient to establish that a particular file represents (1) a completed display file, (2) annotated by a particular set of users, (3) during one or more specified time intervals, (4) (and optionally) while at particular physical locations.","For example, actions originating at each networked tablet may be recorded in a way to establish their occurrence at a certain time and\/or place. Stroke data may be stored in a file, with a cryptographic hash value calculated for the file, with the resulting file and hash data stored by a reputable third-party.","In an embodiment, executable instructions  on a networked tablet include instructions to save stroke data as an XML file. In an embodiment, executable instructions  on a networked tablet include instructions to calculate a cryptographic hash value using the MD5 or SHA1 algorithms.","Similarly, verification that a particular networked tablet was used to create the completed display file may be accomplished by encoding the stroke data for the networked tablet with a cryptographic hash of a unique device identification code for the networked tablet, plus a small disclosed random string. Verification that a particular individual annotated a completed display file may be accomplished through comparison of the stroke data to other captured signatures known to be made by the individual.","Other techniques may be implemented to provide supplementary information used to establish the veracity of a completed display file. Examples of supplementary information include: (1) MAC hardware addresses of the local wireless access points used by the networked tablets; (2) location information of the networked tablets, provided using global positioning system (GPS) location data, or using the local wireless access points; and (3) route traces from the networked tablet's network connection to a known server.","4. Implementation Example\u2014Host Computer Hardware Overview","The approach described herein for simple annotations on personal computers may be implemented on any type of computing platform or architecture. To illustrate an example,  is a block diagram that depicts an example computer system  upon which embodiments of the invention may be implemented. Computer system  includes a bus  or other communication mechanism for communicating information, and a processor  coupled with bus  for processing information. Computer system  also includes a main memory , such as a random access memory (RAM) or other dynamic storage device, coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions to be executed by processor . Main memory  also may be used for storing temporary variables or other intermediate information during execution of instructions to be executed by processor . Computer system  further includes a read only memory (ROM)  or other static storage device coupled to bus  for storing static information and instructions for processor . A storage device , such as a magnetic disk or optical disk, or permanent writeable memory such as a flash-ROM-based device, is provided and coupled to bus  for storing information and instructions.","Computer system  may be coupled using a bus  to a display , such as a cathode ray tube (CRT), for displaying information to a computer user. An input device , including alphanumeric and other keys, is coupled to bus  for communicating information and command selections to processor . Another type of user input device is cursor control , such as a mouse, a trackball, or cursor direction keys for communicating direction information and command selections to processor  and for controlling cursor movement on display . This input device typically has two degrees of freedom in two axes, a first axis (e.g., x) and a second axis (e.g., y), that allows the device to specify positions in a plane.","The invention is related to the use of computer system  for implementing the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention, those techniques are performed by computer system  in response to processor  executing one or more sequences of one or more instructions contained in main memory . Such instructions may be read into main memory  from another computer-readable medium, such as storage device . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in main memory  causes processor  to perform the process steps described herein. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions to implement the invention. Thus, embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software.","The term \u201ccomputer-readable medium\u201d as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing data that causes a computer to operation in a specific manner. In an embodiment implemented using computer system , various computer-readable media are involved, for example, in providing instructions to processor  for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, tangible data storage media such as non-volatile media and volatile media. Non-volatile media includes, for example, optical or magnetic disks, such as storage device . Volatile media includes dynamic memory, such as main memory . Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, or any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, any other optical medium, a RAM, a PROM, and EPROM, a FLASH-EPROM, any other memory chip or memory cartridge, or any other medium from which a computer can read. For example, a computer-readable media includes a flash-memory based device, such as a USB-thumb drive or other mass-storage-class devices.","Various forms of computer-readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to processor  for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer. The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to computer system  can receive the data on the telephone line and use an infra-red transmitter to convert the data to an infra-red signal. An infra-red detector can receive the data carried in the infra-red signal and appropriate circuitry can place the data on bus . Bus  carries the data to main memory , from which processor  retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory  may optionally be stored on storage device  either before or after execution by processor .","Computer system  also includes a communication interface  coupled to bus . Communication interface  provides a two-way data communication coupling to a network link  that is connected to a local network . For example, communication interface  may be an integrated services digital network (ISDN) card or a modem to provide a data communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. As another example, communication interface  may be a local area network (LAN) card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN. Wireless links may also be implemented. In any such implementation, communication interface  sends and receives electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams representing various types of information.","Network link  typically provides data communication through one or more networks to other data devices. For example, network link  may provide a connection through local network  to another host computer  or to data equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) . ISP  in turn provides data communication services through the world wide packet data communication network now commonly referred to as the \u201cInternet\u201d . Local network  and Internet  both use electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals that carry digital data streams.","Computer system  can send messages and receive data, including program code, through the network(s), network link  and communication interface . In the Internet example, a server  might transmit a requested code for an application program through Internet , ISP , local network  and communication interface . The received code may be executed by processor  as it is received, and\/or stored in storage device , or other non-volatile storage for later execution.","In the foregoing specification, embodiments of the invention have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from implementation to implementation.
