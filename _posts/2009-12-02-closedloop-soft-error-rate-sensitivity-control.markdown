title: Closed-loop soft error rate sensitivity control
abstract: Disclosed is a closed-loop feedback system for controlling the soft error rate (SER) due to radiation strikes on electronic circuitry. A variable sensitivity soft error rate detector provides and output corresponding to the soft error rate. This output is supplied to a voltage control. The output of the voltage control is fed back to the sensitivity control of the sensorâ€”thus forming a feedback loop. The output of the voltage control may be the power supply of the soft error rate sensor. The output of the soft error rate sensor may also be used to enable and disable fault tolerant schemes or alert a user.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Modern digital integrated circuits can have internal logic disturbed by radiation in the form of alpha-particle or neutron strikes. A disruption is called a Single Event Upset (SEU). When SEUs occur in storage elements, such as memories, latches, flip-flops, and charge coupled devices, they are persistent. This persistence is particularly troublesome. The rate at which SEUs occur is called the Soft Error Rate (SER). Persistent SEUs in control logic, or state-machines, can lead a circuit into an unwanted state. This can lead to a system failure.","Radiation (e.g., alpha particle and neutron particle) flux changes with the physical environment and location. For example, cosmic radiation levels are correlated with altitude and thus can change significantly on airplane flights. In another example, free neutrons tend to follow the magnetic poles. Thus, neutron flux can vary significantly across the world. Thus, the SER also varies with the physical environment and location of the system or integrated circuit.","An embodiment of the invention may therefore comprise an apparatus, comprising: a soft error rate monitor that produces an indication of a soft error rate occurring in a sensor, said sensor receiving a supply voltage that affects said soft error rate occurring in said sensor; and, a supply voltage control that receives said indication of said soft error rate and sets said supply voltage, said supply voltage control setting said supply voltage to satisfy a criteria soft error rate occurring in said sensor.","An embodiment of the invention may therefore further comprise a method of operating an electronic device, comprising: receiving an indicator of a soft error rate from a sensor, a sensitivity of said sensor being based on an input voltage; and, adjusting said input voltage to change said sensitivity of said sensor in response to changes in said indicator of said soft error rate from said sensor.","An embodiment of the invention may therefore further comprise an apparatus, comprising: a soft error rate sensor, a sensitivity of said soft error rate sensor being based on an input voltage; a voltage regulator that determines said input voltage based on an output of said soft error rate sensor; and, system circuitry receiving a supply voltage corresponding to said input voltage, a system sensitivity to soft errors being based on said supply voltage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","110","111","120","111","120","121","110","121","110","130","110","110","111","120","121","121","110","111","130","120","121","111"]},"In an embodiment, control voltage  is a power supply voltage to radiation sensitive circuitry in sensor . The radiation sensitive circuitry in sensor  becomes less sensitive to radiation  strikes as control voltage  is raised. For example, a range of \u00b15% around a nominal power supply voltage to sensor  can change the sensitivity of sensor  over a range of 2:1. When radiation  levels are low, voltage control  outputs a lower control voltage  to sensor . This makes sensor  more sensitive to radiation . Equilibrium is reached whereby voltage control  (via control voltage ) maintains soft error rate indicator  at roughly a constant value. In another embodiment, equilibrium is reached when voltage control  maintains soft error rate indicator at or below a threshold level.","In an embodiment, soft error rate indicator  corresponds to a rate of soft errors occurring in sensor . Thus, maintaining soft error rate indicator  at the constant value corresponds to maintaining the rate of soft errors occurring in sensor  at a nearly constant value. Likewise, maintain soft error rate indicator  at or below a threshold level corresponds to maintaining the rate of soft errors occurring in sensor  at or below a threshold level.","In an embodiment, control voltage  may be used to control the soft error rate of other circuitry. For example, control voltage  may be used to set a system power supply level. Thus, when sensor  is receiving high levels of radiation , the system power supply level is raised in order to make that system circuitry less sensitive to radiation strikes.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","210","220","250","210","211","220","221","221","210","211","230","210","210"]},"In , system  also receives control voltage . The sensitivity of system  to radiation  is affected by control voltage . In an embodiment, the sensitivity of system  to radiation  for a particular control voltage  level corresponds to the sensitivity of sensor  to radiation . Thus, the soft error rate occurring in system  corresponds (or varies together with) the soft error rate occurring in sensor . Assuming radiation  and radiation  track each other proportionally (i.e., when radiation  doubles, radiation  also doubles), controlling the sensitivity of system  to radiation  with control voltage  can result in a constant soft error rate occurring in system . This constant soft error rate in system  is maintained in spite of changes in the level of radiation  striking system . Thus, a stable (or below a threshold) level of soft errors can be maintained in system  over a range of radiation  levels striking system . In an embodiment, control voltage  is a power supply voltage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","310","320","350","310","311","320","321","321","310","311","330","310","310","330","350","331","331"]},"In , system  includes fault tolerant (FT) control  and fault tolerant block . Fault tolerant control  is coupled to fault tolerant block . Fault tolerant control  receives soft error rate indicator . Based on soft error rate indicator , fault tolerant control  may enable (or turn on) a fault tolerant scheme that uses fault tolerant block . For example, if the closed-loop feedback system is unable to maintain the soft error rate inside of system  at or below a threshold level, then fault tolerant control  may respond by enabling system  to use a fault tolerant scheme to protect against soft errors caused by radiation . Examples of fault tolerant schemes that fault tolerant control  may enable to protect against soft errors caused by radiation  include, but are not limited to: parity algorithms to detect errors; error correcting codes to protect data; redundant circuits; redundant circuits and a voting scheme; and, fault tolerant or fault correcting software algorithms run by system .","Finally, if soft error rate indicator  exceeds a second threshold, system  may shut down or alert a user that the system is being operated out of specification and should not be used. This information may be communicated to the user via an error message or some other type of indicator (e.g., error light).","It should be understood that the aforementioned systems adapt to meet a desired (or required) soft error rate level by using a soft error rate monitor (a.k.a. soft error rate sensor), or other radiation flux sensor, to control hardware and\/or software that affects the soft error rate of a system (or chip). In an embodiment, the soft error rate feedback system can be entirely on one integrated circuit. In another embodiment, one or more parts of the feedback system (or the controlled system) may be on another chip. For example, the control voltage produced by the feedback system may be used by an off-chip system power supply to adjust the power supply to the integrated circuit. In this manner, the voltage control (e.g., , , and ) is off-chip, while the rest of the system (e.g., sensor  and system ) are on the same chip. In another example, the sensor may be on a separate integrated circuit from the other components of the system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","200","300","402","120","111","110","110","130","121"]},"In response to a change in the soft error rate indicator, the sensitivity of the soft error rate sensor is adjusted ().

When soft error rate indicator  falls back below the threshold, fault tolerance control  may turn off a hardware or software based fault tolerance scheme .

The repeating data pattern repeats itself every N shift cycles of serial shift register . The input of serial shift register  receives the repeating data pattern from pattern generator . Error detector  receives the output of serial shift register . Error detector  also receives the repeating data pattern from pattern generator . Because serial shift register  is an integer multiple (M) of the length of the repeating data pattern (i.e., N), if no soft errors occur in serial shift register , the data patterns received at the two inputs to error detector  will match. However, if one or more bits of the repeating data pattern are changed by a radiation strike, error detector  will detect this as a difference between its two inputs. Thus, error detector  can generate an indicator of the soft error rate .","In an embodiment, pattern generator  may be a simple flip-flop that toggles an output (e.g., 10101010). In another embodiment, pattern generator  may implement a linear feedback shift register to produce a more complex repeating pattern.
