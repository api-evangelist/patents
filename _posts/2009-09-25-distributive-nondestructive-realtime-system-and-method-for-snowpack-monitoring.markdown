title: Distributive, non-destructive real-time system and method for snowpack monitoring
abstract: A ground-based system that provides quasi real-time measurement and collection of snow-water equivalent (SWE) data in remote settings is provided. The disclosed invention is significantly less expensive and easier to deploy than current methods and less susceptible to terrain and snow bridging effects. Embodiments of the invention include remote data recovery solutions. Compared to current infrastructure using existing SWE technology, the disclosed invention allows more SWE sites to be installed for similar cost and effort, in a greater variety of terrain; thus, enabling data collection at improved spatial resolutions. The invention integrates a novel computational architecture with new sensor technologies. The invention's computational architecture is based on wireless sensor networks, comprised of programmable, low-cost, low-powered nodes capable of sophisticated sensor control and remote data communication. The invention also includes measuring attenuation of electromagnetic radiation, an approach that is immune to snow bridging and significantly reduces sensor footprints.

Field of Use","These teachings relate generally to a system and method for snow pack monitoring and more particularly to a ground based system that provides real time measurement and collection of snow-water equivalent (SWE) data in remote settings.","2. Description of Prior Art (Background)","The importance of snow water equivalence (SWE) estimation and snowpack studies to science and society is well known. For example, snowpack studies are critical to water planning for agriculture, recreation, cities, military, etc. The importance of snowpack data is emphasized by the fact that SWE data is so fundamental to so many interests that NOAA publishes daily global SWE composites online. As suggested in the literature most snow studies are motivated by the need to estimate basin-wide runoff to provide operational forecasting for snow-affected industries or rivers subject to flooding, or to improve climate forecasting. These applications require knowledge about the spatial distribution of SWE over large spatial scales, often in basins characterized by complex terrain and heterogeneous land cover. Prior research has demonstrated that SWE exhibits extreme variability in space. This variability is a result of influences of and interactions between meteorology (wind speed and direction, radiation), topography (elevation gradients, slope and aspect), and vegetation cover. In temperate landscapes, forest vegetation exerts important controls on snow distribution through its role in intercepting snow, attenuating wind, and altering radiation at the snow surface. Therefore, to obtain accurate SWE profiles of topographically complex areas, especially mountainous terrain, good temporal and spatial resolution is needed, with techniques that are robust to the effects of vegetation cover.","While several approaches exist for measuring and quantitatively characterizing the spatial distribution of SWE, including manual surveys and airborne sensors, continuous, automated ground-based techniques allow for better spatial resolution, more frequent measurement, and are not affected by tree canopies. Emerging approaches exploit various technologies, including gamma ray detection and acoustics, but these are largely still in the development phase and have not been deployed remotely as continuous, unmanned stations. The most prevalent ground-based, continuous method of SWE measurement makes use of snow pillows, which measures now mass by measuring loads on liquid-filled bags (the pillow). In particular, the SNOTEL network run by the NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) relies heavily on snow pillow technology. However, this method is susceptible to the phenomena of snow bridging (a gap forming between the snowpack and the ground). To mitigate (i.e., average out) the snow bridging effect, snow pillows are made large, approximately 50 to 100 square feet on average, and thus contain up to several hundred gallons of liquid, typically antifreeze. This means that snow pillows can only be installed in large, flat areas to accommodate their size, and near roads or well-established trails for transporting the apparatus. Large plate-style snow load sensors with multiple load nodes and associated analytic techniques to correct for snow bridging have been proposed to supplant snow pillows, but this technology is not yet extensively used in practice. The upshot of this is that in addition to inaccuracies due to snow bridging, predominant ground-based SWE measurement technologies do not provide effective resolution at the basin scale, due to their expense and difficulty of deployment.","In the SNOTEL network this is exacerbated by the general reliance on traditional data logging platforms such as the Campbell Scientific CR1000, which are heavy, expensive, and power hungry. Indeed, most long-term continuously monitoring snow stations are located in clearings, representing a biased measurement of SWE. Thus, developing a system to cost effectively collect data to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of SWE monitoring would have important impacts on both the scientific study of snow and social infrastructures dependent on snow. Furthermore, a system that is compact and portable would have the advantage of being deployable in variety of settings including those presently not observable with remote sensing technologies (e.g., snow packs under forest canopies or on sloped terrain). A low cost SWE data collection system would allow more data points to be measured, further improving spatial resolution, and would bring this technology to a broader user base.","In light of the above, there exists a need for a relatively inexpensive and easily deployable sensor platform that can be wirelessly networked, remotely accessed, and is robust to harsh winter environments.","There is also a need for a novel SWE measurement instrument suite and control algorithms suitable for integration with a relatively inexpensive and easily deployable sensor platform that can be wirelessly networked, remotely accessed, and is robust to harsh winter environments.","The foregoing and other problems are overcome, and other advantages are realized, in accordance with the presently preferred embodiments of these teachings.","In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention an apparatus for determining snow-water equivalence for snow pack monitoring is provided. The apparatus includes a wireless mote having a processor; random access memory (RAM); flash memory; and a communicator for wirelessly communicating. The apparatus also includes a gamma ray detector for measuring ambient gamma ray attenuation due to snowpack water content.","The invention is also directed towards a method for distributive snowpack monitoring. The method includes determining a snow water equivalent data package, which includes: measuring in situ snowpack temperature data at a first location; determining if the measured in situ snowpack temperature data exceeds a predetermined temperature threshold; measuring in situ snowpack height data at the first location; and determining if the measured in situ snowpack height data exceeds a predetermined height threshold. If either threshold is exceeded the method measures snowpack in situ microwave attenuation at the first location and determines if the measured snowpack in situ microwave attenuation exceeds a predetermined microwave attenuation threshold. If the microwave attenuation threshold is exceeded the method measures the snowpack in situ gamma ray attenuation at the first location.","In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention an apparatus for determining snow-water equivalence for snow pack monitoring is provided. The apparatus includes a wireless mote having: a processor; random access memory (RAM); flash memory unit(s); and a communicator for wirelessly communicating. The wireless mote also includes a program storage device readable by the mote, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the mote to perform a method for collecting sensor data, managing power requirements, wireless transmitting sensor data, and receiving control data. The apparatus sensors include: at least one gamma ray detector for measuring ambient gamma ray attenuation; a 2.4 GHz microwave source; a 2.4 GHz microwave detector paired with the 2.4 GHz microwave source; a 5.1 GHz microwave source; and a 5.1 GHz microwave detector paired with the 5.1 GHz microwave source.","Referring now to  there is shown a SWE mote based computational and communications platform  that enables instrumentation of environments with greater temporal and spatial resolutions than are presently possible in a relatively non-intrusive manner. It will be appreciated that the SWE platform  shown in  may be more broadly deployed for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications.","As used in this disclosure, the term \u201cmote device\u201d or \u201cmote\u201d (, item ) typically indicates a autonomous or semi-autonomous computing, communication, actuating, and\/or sensing device as described in the mote literature (e.g., Intel Corporation's, or Crossbow Inc.'s mote literature).","Certain embodiments of the mote device(s)  can be fabricated to be relatively small (typically less than several inches in dimension, often a fraction of an inch). Certain embodiments of mote systems(s)  can also be relatively inexpensive to produce, and can be designed to stand up to relatively harsh and\/or external environments.","Many embodiments of mote systems(s) , or simply \u201cmotes\u201d, as described in this disclosure can provide a wide variety of parameter sensing and\/or actuating functionalities. Such parameter sensing may be controlled (and\/or light or display devices actuated) using computer-based sensing, electro-mechanical sensing, magnetic sensing, and\/or other sensing techniques. Certain embodiments of mote device(s) and networks can be located at remote, hostile, external, or inaccessible location(s); and can be wirelessly networked.","Motes  can be programmed with control algorithms for auxiliary circuitry managing activation of sources and sensors, to ensure that energy is expended in an efficient manner, and to dynamically adapt deployments to environmental conditions.","Still referring to  there is shown a pictorial illustration of one embodiment of the present non-destructive real-time system SWE measurement apparatus  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In  there is shown a programmable mote device , equipped with processor A, RAM B and Flash memory C. Optionally, mote  can be augmented with external memory D. Motes also have a communication device  capable of approximately 100 meter communication range, and can support a variety of data retrieval techniques.","It will be appreciated that the invention advantageously incorporates motes  to eliminate the wiring burdens and heavy enclosures often required of traditional data logging mechanisms, and significantly reduces power requirements. As shown in , communication device  may be any suitable communication device which supports other data acquisition and\/or system control. The mote system (, item ) establishes a standard protocol connection, for example, but not limited to, a TCP\/IP connection with another mote system. (See ). This standard protocol allows an easy interface to data storage and visualization applications at the sink. Furthermore, this TCP\/IP connection serves as an actuation channel, for controlling the deployment remotely at the sink, for example to modify sampling rates for power management.","Still referring to  and , the mote network nodes (motes)  communicate with each other via their radio frequency (RF) antennas  (communicators), each with \u02dc100 M range, forming an on-site network . It will be appreciated that any suitable mote communication protocol may be used. All the mote nodes  communicate their data to a distinguished node or data collector designated as the \u201cgateway\u201d  that buffers data on external storage (not shown) and can communicate data long distance to a remote location (i.e. the lab, or ultimate data sink). Communication options include radio modems and cell modems. Cell modem technology is particularly appealing since communication range is effectively unlimited for deployments in cell phone reception areas. Using any suitable modem or communication device at the deployment site and at the data sink communicating via GPRS.","Still referring to , the SWE measurement apparatus (SWEMA)  also includes a support structure B, which may be any suitable support structure. The support structure B supports: mote device ; microwave source A; optionally, a solar cell  for recharging SWEMA  power source, typically, but not limited to, one or more batteries (not shown); ultrasonic transducer  for measuring snow height, ambient air temperature device , and gamma ray detector A.","Still referring to , SWEMA  includes a vertical support structure A. The vertical support structure A supports microwave detectors A, B, and . Vertical support structure A also supports snowpack temperature devices A, B. It will be understood any suitable number of temperature devices may be used. It will be appreciated that the vertical support structure A may be any suitable calibrated or un-calibrated support structure.","SWEMA , as shown in , includes anchoring system . It will be understood that anchoring system  may be any suitable terrain adapted anchoring system.","Optionally, included with SWEMA  is base support C. It will be understood that any suitable base support may be used and that natural ground cover may be used as base support C. Base support C supports a second microwave detector B and a second gamma ray detector B. It will be understood that the microwave sources A, B and microwave detectors A, , and C, may be any suitable microwave source and respective microwave detector.","It will be understood that all measurement devices, sensors, electronic devices, and power sources shown in  are connected, or connectable, to mote device .","In general, the mote device  can be considered a small processor-driven device that can be configured to perform a variety of functions. Many embodiments of mote device(s)  can include a power source, which can be configured to provide power or energy to the mote during its normal operations. Certain embodiments of mote systems(s) , as described in this disclosure for example, can be configured to sense a variety of parameters, actuate a variety of other devices such as (but not limited to) turn on or off a power relay (See ).","Still referring to  and also , there is shown a gamma ray attenuation detector A, E apparatus connectable to the deployed mote station. It will be appreciated that a gamma ray attenuation detector A, B, such as, but not limited to, a Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CZT) gamma ray detector may be used to measure water attenuation of ambient or background radiation.  shows measured water attenuation of gamma energy using all energies between 100 keV to 300 keV.","Still referring to  and also , there is shown the susceptibility of microwave radiation to snowpack accumulation having significant water content. The horizontal scale of  is in days and the vertical scale is in relative attenuation in dB. It will be understood that any suitable microwave band or bands, such as a dual-band system (2.4 GHz and 5.1 GHz) may used in which signal strength is monitored at various heights. In general attenuation rates are expected to be 20-100 dB\/m in these bands depending on snow properties, however measurements with large dynamic range, at various heights and at different frequencies, can be used to solve for SWE and as well as snow structure. Still referring to  there is shown a microwave testing arrangement consisting of a microwave source B placed on the ground support B, a microwave source attached to support B and at least three microwave detectors A, B, and C attached to support A. The microwave sources are operating at 2.4 GHz and at 5.1 GHz).  illustrates that attenuation in both the 2.4 GHz and 5.1 GHz bands are susceptible to winter precipitation high in water content (e.g., from ice storms).","Data retrieval. Referring to  there is shown a pictorial illustration of a distributive wireless sensor network (WSN) , non-destructive real-time system in accordance with the invention shown in . As noted earlier, a mote-based platform as described herein supports a variety of data acquisition and retrieval techniques. The simplest is data logging, and subsequent retrieval over Ethernet connection with a laptop carried to the deployment site. However, off-the-shelf motes typically have only 1 MB flash memory available for data logging, which is generally not sufficient for a full season of SWE operation. It will be appreciated therefore, that the current invention employs a lightweight data muting option .","Still referring to , for purposes of this disclosure data muling is defined as a site visitor carries a mule mote  with a program that automatically downloads data via a communications link  to the mule  when the mule mote  is in radio transceiver range of the deployed mote system . This data retrieval option exploits native features of WSNs that are designed to dynamically integrate new mote nodes into their network . Since the weight of a mote is negligible, this approach allows more frequent site visits. It will be understood that the mule mote  can be hand carried or affixed to a suitable remote controlled platform such as but not limited to unmanned aerial drones or remote terrain vehicles (not shown). It will be appreciated that the data muling option described herein can be used in practice for SWE measurements without data loss. For example, measurement data from approximately 1-hour sampling intervals over a month is suitably sized for on-mote flash memory.","Still referring to , it should be appreciated that the mote  may be suitably augmented with flash memory (, D). It will be further appreciated that the invention's low cost features of the individual stations  allow more stations  to be deployed to obtain better spatial resolution; and wireless networking  allow multiple sites in a given area to cooperate in routing data to a single gateway  for communication to the sink. Such an area can be any suitable number of acres, yielding an efficient technique for fine-grained monitoring at the basin scale.","Still referring to , it will also be appreciated that the mule mote or gateway node  can be augmented with on-site massive flash memory storage (2 GB) for buffering an entire season's worth of data, as a backup in case remote reporting via cell or radio modem fails or is not possible.","Still referring to  and , data can also be mirrored within the WSN , meaning that mode deployments  can cooperate to data synchronize and log data redundantly to mitigate volatility of individual mote deployments.","Still referring to  and , where  shows a flow chart illustrating one method for power conservation for the invention shown in . It will be appreciated that gamma ray detection device(s) A,B, such as the CZT device, is the most accurate in terms of SWE measurements and least susceptible to inclusions in the snowpack (e.g., ice lenses, air\/water pockets). However, as noted, due to the gamma ray detection device power requirements it is not, in terms of power consumption, feasible for this device to be utilized continually, therefore, a feature of the invention employs a multi-parameter, multi-tiered, adaptive sampling method as shown in  to optimize a balance of measurement accuracy and energy usage. The sampling of a particular sensor is conditional on previous and current values found on other sensors. In the present invention, the sensors having the least energy draw (i.e., ultrasound) are the least accurate in determining SWE (i.e., only snow pack depth is measured). However, the ultrasonic depth sensor A would be capable of capturing a new snow event. Conversely, the \u2018best\u2019 SWE (i.e., CZT) also requires a relatively large amount of energy. Also, temperature sensors (, B) (, ) within the snow pack may be utilized to detect melt conditions . That is, these simple and low energy modalities can run at higher sampling intervals and be used to trigger subsequent sensors that would provide new information (See ). For example, should a snow fall be detected via depth change (cost of \u02dc5 mA) the invention will trigger a microwave measurement (, ) (cost of \u02dc50 mA). Should the snow fall be very dry (i.e., little water content) there will be very little variation in signal strength (, ) However, snow events high in water content will show significant changes in microwave signal strength. Such measurements will then be used to trigger a CZT or gamma ray measurement (cost of \u02dc500 mA) (, ). Sampling rates, change thresholds (e.g., temperature, height, attenuation) may be correlated with available power. In other words, sampling rates may be higher and\/or thresholds lower if more power is available, e.g., batteries are fully charged. It will be appreciated that this multi-tiered, event-driven approach can be readily implemented upon resource-constrained motes running TinyOS.","Still referring to  and also to  there is shown a circuit schematic illustrating one circuit  for power conservation for the invention shown in . To efficiently regulate the power source to the required voltage levels for each component of the system, dual DC-DC buck converters ,  are used. The buck converters ,  convert the 12 VDCsource down to 3.3 VDC, schematically represented as power source , to power the mote  and the Ultrasonic depth sensor, and 5 VDC to power the load cell. It will be appreciated that the converters may be any suitable converters and that the load cell may be any suitable load. If the SWEMA  is programmed to take readings from the sensors hourly then there is substantial time between readings when the sensors are not in use. By utilizing the output pins on the mote  I\/O, a digital trigger on a mote can be provide a signal to switch  a relay A,A. Switching the relay A,A powers down the 12-to-5V buck converter  when the load cell  is not required to be in use. Another relay A, A also allows the Ultrasonic Load  to be powered down by creating an open circuit. It will be appreciated that powering down the 12 to 5V buck converter  and turning off the Ultrasonic sensor load , conserves otherwise wasted power which is important when dealing with a remote systems and limited battery life. It will be appreciated that any suitable energy optional energy harvesting devices may be used (e.g., photovoltaic technology) (e.g., , ) to extend battery life.","It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Thus, various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances that fall within the scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The subject matter which is regarded as the invention is particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the claims at the conclusion of the specification.
