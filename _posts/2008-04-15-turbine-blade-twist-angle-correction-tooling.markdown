Davis, Thomas P. Cap, and Paul Balko (U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/082,864); and \u201cMETHOD FOR DEVELOPING A REPAIR PROCESS TO CORRECT A DEFORMED GAS TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENT\u201d by inventors Garrett Kernozicky, Ephraim C. Davis, and Thomas P. Cap (U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/082,865). All of these applications are incorporated herein by this reference.","The present invention relates to turbine blade repair procedures and tooling. In particular, the present invention relates to turbine blade twist angle correction tooling.","A gas turbine engine commonly includes a fan, a compressor, a combustor, a turbine, and an exhaust nozzle. During engine operation, working medium gases, for example air, are drawn into and compressed in the compressor. The compressed air is channeled to the combustor where fuel is added to the air and the air\/fuel mixture is ignited. The products of combustion are discharged to the turbine section, which extracts work from these products to produce useful thrust to power, for example, an aircraft in flight.","The compressor and turbine commonly include alternating stages of rotor blades and stator vanes. Compressor and turbine blades and vanes often include complex, contoured airfoil geometries designed to optimally interact with the working medium gas passing through the engine. One common feature of airfoil geometries is the blade twist angle. The twist angle is the angular displacement of the airfoil about a spanwise axis, such as the stacking axis, from the root to the tip of the airfoil. During normal engine operation, the blade twist angle feature, which is a critical characteristic of gas turbine engine blades, decreases due to thermo-mechanical cycling and aerodynamic loading of the blades. The twist angle must be restored to the original manufactured condition during engine overhaul prior to returning the blade to service.","Turbine blade twist correction is commonly accomplished by clamping the blade root in a fixture and manually applying a load to the tip of the blade using, for example a wrench configured to clamp the blade tip. An operator twists the blade using the wrench, measures the blade twist angle, and repeats the twisting procedure until the correct twist angle is reached. Because the operator can only estimate how much force to apply each time, this approach often requires many iterations to achieve the desired twist angle. This results in a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly process. This approach can also result in over-twist due to applying excessive force.","Therefore, improved tools and methods for correcting blade twist angle are needed.","The present invention includes a wrench for correcting the twist angle of a turbine blade, which wrench includes an adaptor configured to engage a tip of the blade, a socket drive configured to engage the adaptor, a first handle connected to a first side of the socket drive, a second handle connected to a second side of the socket drive, and a torque gauge configured to measure a load applied to the blade.","Embodiments of the present invention also include a repair apparatus for correcting the twist angle of a turbine blade, which apparatus includes a base plate, a fixture connected to the base plate and configured to engage the root of the blade, a twist angle gauge connected to the base plate and configured to measure the twist angle of the blade, and a wrench configured to apply a measured load to a tip of the blade.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIGS. 1A and 1B","FIG. 1A"],"b":["10","12","14","16","18","20","10","16","10","10","12","12","10","14","12","16","10","14","18","18","20","10","22","10","16","24","16","14","18","22","20","22","10","10","10","22","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 3B","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["30","22","10","30","32","34","36","38","32","32","34","32","12","10","34","34","34","34","34","34","12","10","34","34","34","34","36","32","22","10","36","36","36","36","36","32","36","36","10","36","36","10","36","10","36","10","18","10","22","38","18","10","10","22","38","18","10"],"i":["a","b ","c","a","b ","c ","a","b ","a ","b","a ","b ","b","b "]},"The repair apparatus  shown in  may be used to correct twist angle  of blade .

Embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus including a twist angle correction wrench configured to apply a measured load to correct the twist angle of turbine blades. Providing operators a device that indicates the load delivered to the blade under repair reduces the number of iterations, if any, necessary to repair the blade twist angle, and substantially reduces the risk of blade over-twisting due to applying excessive force. Turbine blade repairs employing embodiments of the present invention therefore reduce repair time and cost, and simultaneously improve repair quality.","Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A and 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A and 3B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
