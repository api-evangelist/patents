{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This patent application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60\/778,713, filed Mar. 3, 2006, teachings of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.","Synuclein-gamma (SNCG) plays an oncogenic role in carcinogenesis and is highly expressed in advanced and metastatic carcinomas. SNCG interacts with BubR1, a mitotic checkpoint kinase, resulting in inhibition of mitotic checkpoint control upon spindle damage and in resistance to anticancer drugs such as nocodazole and paclitaxel. SNCG is also a chaperone protein in the (Hsp)-based multiprotein chaperone complex for stimulation of ligand-dependent estrogen receptor (ER)-\u03b1 signaling and stimulates hormone-responsive tumorigenesis. The present invention provides peptides comprising at least one ankyrin repeat-like motif or a portion thereof or a mimetic thereof which interact with SNCG and reduce SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and SNCG-mediated tumorigenesis. The present invention also provides cell lines stably transfected to express these peptides, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides, portions thereof or mimetics thereof and methods for their use in potentiating cancer treatments and inhibiting tumorigenesis and cancer cell proliferation.","Breast cancer development and progression involve the abnormality of multiple genes through genetic and epigenetic alterations. By conducting differential DNA sequencing and in situ hybridization, the aberrant expression of synuclein-gamma (SNCG) (Lavedan et al. Hum Genet. 1998 103:106-112), also referred to as Breast Cancer Specific Gene 1 (breast cancerSG1)(Ji et al. Cancer Res. 1997 57:759-764), has been linked to the disease progression of breast cancer.","SNCG along with synuclein-alpha (SNCA) and synuclein-beta (SNCB) belong to a family of intrinsically disordered proteins (Uversky, V. N. Protein Sci. 2002 11:739-756). Intrinsically disordered proteins are partially or completely unfolded under physiological or non-denaturing conditions. Although often traditionally described as \u201crandom coil,\u201d many studies have shown disordered proteins to possess significant nonrandom structure, usually in the form of residual secondary structure (Elierzer et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2001 307:1061-1073; Yao et al. Biochemistry 2001 40:3561-3571) and hydrophobic clustering (Choy et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003 125:11988-11992). The recent recognition that intrinsically disordered proteins are more common than previously thought and can play important biological roles has challenged the traditional protein structure-function paradigm, which holds that polypeptide chains require compact, globular structure in order to function (Wright, P. E. and Dyson, H. J J. Mol. Biol. 1999 293:321-331; Tompa, P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002 27:527-533; Uversky et al. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005 18:434-384).","SNCG mRNA and protein are not expressed in normal breast tissue or tissues with benign breast diseases but are abundantly expressed in a high percentage of invasive and metastatic breast carcinomas (Ji et al. Cancer Res. 1997 57:759-764; Bruening et al. Cancer 2000 88:2154-2163; Wu et al. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2003 12:920-925). A series of in vitro and in vivo functional studies have demonstrated that SNCG expression significantly stimulates proliferation (Liu et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000 62:99-107; Lu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277:31364-31372; Jiang et al. Cancer Res. 2004 64:4539-4546; Jiang et al. Cancer Res. 2003 63:3899-3903), invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells (Jia et al. Cancer Res. 1999 59:742-747).","SNCG has been shown to interact with BubR1, a mitotic checkpoint kinase required for the prevention of cell mitotic divisions following severe cell damage or mutation (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599). The interaction of SNCG with BubR1 inhibits mitotic checkpoint control upon spindle damage and confers cellular resistance to anti-microtubule drugs such as nocodazole (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599).","Nocodazole, a very commonly used inhibitor of microtubule assembly, experiences much reduced efficacy in SNCG-overexpressing MCF7 breast cancer cells, which is attributed to the SNCG-BubR1 interaction (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599). The inhibitory effects of SNCG on checkpoint function are reduced when the cellular expression level of BubR1 is increased by ectopic over-expression (Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35). Additional evidence shows that the interaction of BubR1 with CENP-E, which is critically required for mitotic checkpoint signaling, is impaired in the presence of SNCG, thereby suggesting that SNCG may inhibit BubR1 function by interfering with the BubR1 CENP-E interaction (Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35). Taken together, these results suggest that BubR1 is a cellular target of natively unfolded SNCG, and the interaction of SNCG-BubR1 may represent a novel mechanism for inactivation of the mitotic checkpoint (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599; Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35).","Currently, microtubule inhibitors are used as first-line chemotherapeutic agents to treat patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (Valero et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998 16:3362-3368; Chan et al. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999 17:2341-2354). However, response rates to this class of drugs vary significantly. These microtubule-disrupting agents are believed to arrest cells in mitosis by triggering mitotic checkpoint activation, resulting in cells arrested in the mitotic phase without entering anaphase (Blajeski et al. J. Clin. Invest. 2002 110:91-99). Prolonged treatments with these agents lead to cell death by apoptosis (Shin et al. Cancer Cell 2003 4:483-497). Since the working mechanism of anti-microtubule drugs relies heavily on the normal function of the mitotic checkpoint machinery in which BubR1 is a critical component (Shin et al. Cancer Cell 2003 4:483-497), the inhibitory effect of SNCG on BubR1 function may be related to the induced resistance of breast cancer cells to microtubule inhibitors after exogenous expression of SNCG (Pan et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277:35050-35060).","SNCG has also been disclosed to be a chaperone protein in the heat shock protein (Hsp)-based multiprotein complex for stimulation of ligand-dependent estrogen receptor (ER)-(signaling and stimulates hormone-responsive mammary and ovarian tumorigenesis (Jiang et al. Cancer Research 2004 64:4539-4546).","The ankyrin repeat, a 33 residue sequence motif, is one of the most frequently observed amino acid motifs in protein databases (Mosavi et al. Protein Science 2004 13:1435-1448). Twenty-four copies of this repeat are contained within the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin, hence its name. However, ankyrin repeats have been found in many proteins with a wide range of different functions.","SNCA, a protein with 55.9% sequence homology to SNCG, has been shown in a yeast two hybrid screen and in neurons to interact with synphilin-1, a protein containing several protein-protein interaction domains, such as ankyrin-like repeats and a coiled-coil domain (Engelender et al. Nat. Genet. 1999 22:110-114).","The present invention provides peptides or portions thereof, compositions, mimetics of these peptides or portions thereof or compositions, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising these peptides or portions thereof, compositions, or mimetics of these peptides or portions thereof or compositions, and methods for use of these peptides or portions thereof, compositions and pharmaceutical compositions which interact with SNCG and reduce SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibit SNCG-mediated tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation.","An aspect of the present invention relates to a peptide comprising at least one ankyrin repeat-like motif or a portion thereof or mimetic thereof which interacts with SNCG and reduces SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibits SNCG-mediated tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation.

Preferred anticancer drugs used in this method are microtubule inhibitors and hormonal anticancer therapies.","The oncogenic protein synuclein-gamma (SNCG) belongs to a family of intrinsically disordered proteins that have a wide range of significance in living systems. However, their structural and functional characteristics are still poorly understood (Uversky, V. N. Protein Sci. 2002 11:739-756; Tompa, P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002 27:527-533; Uversky et al. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005 18:343-384; Uversky, V. N. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002 269:2-12; Romero et al. Appl. Bioinformatics 2004 3:105-113; Iakoucheva et al. J. Mol. Biol. 2002 323:573-584). Other members of this neuronal protein synuclein family include synuclein-\u03b1 (SNCA) and synuclein-\u03b2 (SNCB) (Clayton, D. F. and George, J. M. Trends Neurosci. 1998 21:249-254). The exogenous expression of synuclein-gamma (SNCG) in breast cancer cells has been linked to stimulated proliferation, increased cell invasion and metastasis, and resistance to anticancer drugs, particularly anti-microtubule chemotherapy (Liu et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000 62:99-107; Lu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277:31364-31372; Jiang et al. Cancer Res. 2004 64:4539-4546; Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35; Gupta et al. Oncogene 2002 22:7593-7599). SNCG mRNA and protein are not expressed in normal breast tissue or tissues with benign breast diseases but are abundantly expressed in a high percentage of invasive and metastatic breast carcinomas (Ji et al. Cancer Res. 1997 57:759-764; Bruening et al. Cancer 2000 88:2154-2163; Wu et al. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2003 12:920-925). A recent report of the prominent expression of SNCG in 8 different types of human cancers, including liver, esophageal, colon, gastric, lung, prostate, cervical and breast cancer (Liu et al. Cancer Res. 2005 65:7635-7643) is indicative of SNCG expression status having a broad effect in cancer metastasis and patient responses to anti-cancer drugs in many types of cancer.","One of the molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic functions of SNCG is its interaction with BubR1 and the consequential inhibition of BubR1-mediated mitotic checkpoint functions (Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35; Gupta et al. Oncogene 2002 22:7593-7599). Additional evidence shows that the interaction of BubR1 with CENP-E, which is critically required for mitotic checkpoint signaling, is impaired in the presence of SNCG, thereby suggesting that SNCG may inhibit BubR1 function by interfering with the BubR1 CENP-E interaction (Inaba et al. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005 94:25-35).","SNCG is also a chaperone protein in the (Hsp)-based multiprotein chaperone complex for stimulation of ligand-dependent estrogen receptor (ER)-\u03b1 signaling and stimulates hormone-responsive tumorigenesis (Jiang et al. Cancer Research 2004 64:4539-4546).","The inventors have now identified a synthetic peptide based on a single ankyrin repeat-like motif which associates with SNCG and interferes with the SNCG-BubR1 interaction. The peptide overrides the inhibitory effects of elevated SNCG on anti-microtubule drugs and results in restored anti-microtubule drug mediated mitotic arrest. Given the ability of this peptide to associate with SNCG, it is reasonable to expect that the peptide can also inhibit SNCG stimulation of ER-\u03b1 signaling and hormone responsive tumorigenesis as well as drug resistance to estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen.","To the best of the inventors' knowledge, this is the first disclosure of a single ankyrin repeat-like motif interacting with any protein and\/or producing a biological effect and\/or leading to a phenotypic change in a cell. In this synthetic peptide KGNSALHVASQHGHLGCIQTLVRYGANVTMQNHG (SEQ ID NO:1), referred to herein as the ANK peptide, nine conserved ankyrin repeat residues (Gly-2, Leu-6, His-7, Ala-9, Gly-13, His-14, Leu-21, Gly-25, and Ala-26) are included.","The interaction of SNCG with the ANK peptide was examined by various biophysical and cell biological approaches.","Experiments were first performed to confirm the previous observation (Uversky, V. N. Protein Sci. 2002 11:739-756) that SNCG is intrinsically disordered. The H-N HSQC spectrum of native SNCG was characterized by narrow linewidths and limited H chemical shift dispersion (). This is indicative of conformational averaging within a rapidly interconverting ensemble and demonstrates that SNCG is intrinsically disordered. The far-UV CD spectrum of SNCG was characteristic of an intrinsically disordered polypeptide chain as well, as evidenced by the absence of bands in the 210-230 nm region and an intensive minima at approximately 196 nm (See ). Upon interaction, far UV CD showed that SNCG undergoes no significant conformational changes and remains disordered. This contrasts to the coupled binding and folding that has often been observed for intrinsically disordered proteins (Dyson, H. J and Wright, P. E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002 12:54-60). The SNCG-ANK interaction is similar to the calmodulin-binding fragment of caldesmon (CaD136), which binds a single calmodulin molecule with relatively high affinity while undergoing only very moderate folding (Permyakov et al.

These calmodulin studies and our SNCG findings represent a newly recognized class of intrinsically disordered proteins that are able to bind their ligands while remaining disordered and affirm the biological relevance of intrinsic disorder.","Titration of SNCG with the ANK peptide also gave rise to far-UV spectra characteristic of an unfolded protein () and produced no significant changes in calculated secondary structure.

This is an intriguing observation considering that SNCG is intrinsically disordered. Recently, it has been reported that another intrinsically disordered protein, CaD136, possesses some residual structure which was suggested to be responsible for the relatively asymmetric environment of tryptophan residues in this protein (Permyakov et al. Proteins 2003 53:855-862).","Addition of the ANK peptide resulted in a pronounced blue shift in \u03bb(See ). By plotting fluorescence changes versus concentration of ANK peptide, a dissociation constant (K) value of approximately 100 \u03bcM was estimated. To understand the molecular mechanism of the SNCG-ANK interaction, the method of parametric dependencies was applied (See ). It has been demonstrated that the dependence I(\u03bb)=f(I\u03bb)) is linear for the all-or-none transition between two different conformations, whereas the non-linearity of this function reflects the sequential character of structural transformations, with each linear portion describing the individual all-or-none transition.  shows that Iversus Tplot has at least three linear regions, suggesting a complex mechanism of ANK peptide binding to SNCG involving at least three distinct stages.","The pronounced blue shift in the emission spectra, reflecting the normalization of tyrosine fluorescence, upon addition of the ANK peptide, can be attributed to the distortion in the residual SNCG structure induced by ANK peptide binding. The lone tyrosine residue of SNCG is located near the N-terminus (Tyr-39), suggesting that the ANK binding site is either located in this region or a region that can directly impact the N-terminus. The C-terminal region of SNCG is believed to interact with BubR1 (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599). Since this region is not conserved with SNCA, it is believed that ANK binding may occur at the N-terminal or central region of SNCG. While not being bound to any theory, it is possible that the C-terminal region is in close proximity to the N-terminal region despite the absence of regular folded structure, explaining the fluorescence results and the apparent disruption of the SNCG-BubR1 interaction. In SNCA, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement NMR experiments have shown that there are similar long-range residual tertiary contacts involving the charged C-terminal region and the middle section of the protein (Dedmon et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005 127:476-477; Ohshima et al. Cancer Lett. 2000 158:141-150). Results described herein are indicative of key functional segments in intrinsically disordered proteins having certain spatial relationships despite the lack of regular folded structure.","ANS fluorescence was also utilized to study the conformational properties of SNCG and the SNCG-ANK peptide interaction (See ). Changes in ANS fluorescence intensity are frequently used to monitor formation of partially folded intermediates during protein unfolding and refolding (Semisotnov et al. Biopolymers 1991 31:119-128), as well as to analyze the hydrophobic surfaces of proteins (Stryer, L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965 13:482-495). The interaction of ANS with solvent-exposed hydrophobic clusters is accompanied by a considerable increase in the dye fluorescence intensity and a pronounced blue shift of the fluorescence maximum.  shows that SNCG did not interact with ANS, confirming that this protein is intrinsically disordered and does not possess large solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches that are typical of folded conformations. The addition of ANK peptide induced significant changes in ANS fluorescence properties, including a dramatic increase in the fluorescence intensity and a blue shift in \u03bb. This suggests that the ANK peptide can effectively interact with ANS. Importantly, formation of the SNCG-ANK complex is accompanied by an approximate 20% decrease in ANS fluorescence intensity of only peptide which is affected by the presence of SNCG, confirming the interaction between SNCG and ANK peptide.","Kinetics of the SNCG-ANK interaction were determined. Using immobilized ANK peptide and a GST-SNCG analyte, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) demonstrated binding of SNCG to the ANK peptide.  shows sensograms measured at several GST-SNCG concentrations. Sensograms were deconvoluted globally, using a simultaneous fit for both association (k, Ms) and dissociation (k, s). Global fits were obtained for the two-phase reaction (conformation change) model with rate constants of k(2.59\u00d710Ms), k(0.014 s), K(3.32\u00d710Ms), k(8.02\u00d710s). Overall, the apparent Kwas found to be 73.4 \u03bcM for the GST-SNCG-ANK peptide interaction. This data is in good accord with the values obtained from the fluorescence experiment where ANK peptide was titrated in SNCG. There was no significant decrease in analyte binding capacity to ANK for the duration of the experiments and the active ANK peptide surfaces were very stable. No binding was observed when GST was used as the analyte, thus confirming that SNCG was responsible for the observed interaction between GST-SNCG and ANK peptide.","Isothermal titration calorimetry was also used to thermodynamically characterize the SNCG-ANK interaction (See ). Because the thermodynamic properties of an interaction often reflect its structural characteristics, it was interesting to note an endothermic phase followed by an exothermic phase. The thermodynamics of the peptide titration in GST-SNCG solution exhibited excellent agreement with ideal binding (see ), indicating the presence of one high affinity and multiple low affinity sequential binding sites. The heat of dilution was measured by titrating ANK peptide in buffer alone. This was generally small and subtracted from each binding titration curve. A measured K=70\u00b15 \u03bcM and \u0394H=2.174\u00b10.2 kcal\/mol for the first binding site and in the several fold lower affinity range for other sequential binding sites were observed. These results were in very good agreement with SPR and fluorescence analysis, validating the observed interaction in solution as well as in the immobilized form.","ANK peptide interference with SNCG-BubR1 association in vivo was examined in a stable breast cancer cell line MCF7 expressing SNCG (MCF7-SNCG) and a control SNCG negative cell line (MCF7-Neo). Microinjection efficiency and viability were excellent when cells were injected with goat IgG as a control, demonstrating that background effects of microinjection and antibody were minimal in both cell lines. Significant numbers of cells survived after treatment with the ANK peptide by microinjection in both cell lines. After microinjection, cells were treated with 0.5 \u03bcM nocodazole for 24 hours and the fraction of mitotically arrested cells was counted. As shown in , when the cells without ANK injection were treated with nocodazole, MCF7-Neo cells exhibited a significantly higher degree of mitotic arrest as compared to MCF7-SNCG cells. In contrast, injection of the ANK peptide into MCF7-SNCG cells significantly (p<0.05) increased the level of mitotically arrested cells to a level comparable to that in MCF7-Neo cells (See , grey bars). These results are indicative of ANK peptide functioning as a SNCG inhibitor.","To further examine the utility of the ANK peptide as a therapeutic tool against SNCG-caused drug resistance, this peptide was expressed in breast cancer cells. ANK peptide nucleotide sequences were cloned into pEGFP-C2 vector (pEGFP-ANK), and ANK peptide was expressed as a fusion protein with its amino-terminal linked to EGFP protein. Plasmids pEGFP-ANK and pEGFP were separately transfected into cells. Western blotting using anti-GFP antibody showed specific signals of EGFP as a 33 kDa protein and EGFP-ANK as approximately a 37 kDa fusion protein (See ). The intracellular localization of EGFP-ANK was demonstrated by green fluorescent signals to be co-localized with SNCG in the cytoplasm.","MCF7-SNCG cells were also transfected with pEGFP-ANK, fixed on a cover slip permeabilized and probed with anti-SNCG and anti-GFP antibodies to observe co-localization. Fluorescent cells were visualized using an \u00d7100 objective (oil) on an inverted confocal microscope (Leica). See . Co-localization is indicative of both proteins existing in close proximity in the same cellular compartment and provides indirect evidence of protein-protein association.","In vivo binding of ANK to SNCG was examined in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments (See ). MCF7-SNCG (lanes 3 & 4) cells were transfected with pEGFP-ANK (lane 3 of ) or the control vector pEGFP (lane 4 of ). In this experiment, MCF7-neo cells were included as negative controls (lanes 1 & 2). Two days after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and IP with anti-SNCG antibody was conducted. The presence of EGFP-ANK in SNCG IP complexes obtained from different transfected cells was detected by western blot using anti-GFP antibody. The membrane was subsequently reprobed with anti-SNCG antibody to demonstrate equal amounts of SNCG in IP complexes of MCF7-SNCG cell lysates. The upper panel in  shows that when anti-SNCG IP complexes were probed with GFP antibody, only EGFP-ANK but not EGFP alone is found to co-precipitate with SNCG (lane 3) in MCF7-SNCG cells. EGFP-ANK was also not in the IP complexes of neo cells. The lower panel shows the immunoblotting of anti-SNCG and anti-GFP in total cell lysates. Thus,  provides further evidence that SNCG is capable of immunoprecipitating EGFP-ANK.","Accordingly, the results of the co-IP experiments depicted in  clearly demonstrate the direct intracellular binding of ANK peptide to SNCG.","BubR1 has been identified as a cellular target of SNCG through yeast two-hybrid and co-IP (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:2593-7599). The binding of SNCG to BubR1 is believed to result in compromised mitotic checkpoint function as demonstrated by increased resistance of cancer cells to anti-microtubule drugs. Experiments were performed to determine whether the binding of ANK to SNCG would directly affect SNCG interaction with BubR1. In these experiments COS7 cells were transfected with pCS2BubR1, pCI-SNCG, pEGFP-ANK or the control vector PEGFP at equal molar ratios. Two days post transfection, cells were harvested for IP with anti-SNCG antibody. The presence of the myc-tagged BubR1 in IP complexes was detected by western blot using anti-Myc antibody. The membrane was then sequentially probed with anti-GFP antibody and followed with anti-SNCG antibody. The left panel in  shows that when anti-SNCG IP complexes were probed with myc antibody, the myc-BubR1 was found to co-precipitate with SNCG in the absence of EGFPANK and myc-BubR1 signal was not detected in the IP complex of cells expressing the ANK peptide. In contrast, anti-GFP antibody only detected the GFP signal in the IP complex obtained from cells expressing EGFP-ANK and not from cells expressing GFP only. The right panel of  shows the results of western blots using total cell lysates, demonstrating similar expression levels of these proteins. These results clearly indicate that the binding of ANK peptide to SNCG interrupted the interaction of SNCG with BubR1.","To further demonstrate the function of the ANK peptide in restoring the impaired mitotic checkpoint control in SNCG expressing cells, MCF7-neo, MCF7-SNCG and T47D cells were transfected with pEGFP-ANK or the control vector PEGFP. Two days after transfection, cells were exposed to paclitaxel for 18 hours and numbers of mitotic arrested and apoptotic cells were counted after DAPI staining. Expression of EGFP-ANK in neo cells did not significantly alter the mitotic index or the percentage of apoptotic cells. However, expression of this peptide in SNCG cells consistently caused an approximate 2-fold increase in the number of mitotic arrested cells and a 5-fold increase in apoptotic cell populations (). These cells were also probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Hand the mitotic index was calculated according to the proportion of the number of Hstained EGFP positive cells to total EGFP positive cells (). This result corroborated with increases in sensitivity to paclitaxel by over-expressing EGFP-ANK in MCF7-SNCG and T47D cells shown by DAPI stained cells. Similar results were achieved using flow cytometric analysis of EGFP-ANK containing MCF7-SNCG cells treated with 0.5 \u03bcM paclitaxel. Cell cycle analysis of MCF7-SNCG cells transfected with EGFP-ANK revealed almost a four-fold increase in apoptotic\/dead cell population in comparison to cells transfected with the control vector pEGFP (). Furthermore, anti-phospho-Hstaining showed a 3,5-fold increase in positive phosphorylated histones in comparison with MCF7-SNCG cells not containing EGFP-ANK (). Taken together these results confirmed the finding that overexpression of EGFP-ANK improves the sensitivity of MCF7 breast cancer cells to anti-microtubule drug treatment.","Exemplary deletion peptides of EGFP-ANK were designed based on a molecular model of ANK peptide (SEQ ID NO:1) generated using the online web server swissmodel with the extension expasy.org\/ of the world wide web.

MCF7-neo and MCF7-SNCG clones were transfected with pEGFP-ANK deletion peptide P8, P12, P13 or P18 plasmids or the control plasmid pEGFP by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche). Two days after transfection, cells were lysed and co-IP was performed, and results were analyzed using western blotting by anti-EGFP and anti-SNCG antibodies. SNCG was identified to interact with EGFP-ANK deletion peptide P12, residues 2-13 of ANK peptide: GNSALHVASQHG (SEQ ID NO:2), and P8, residues 25-32 of ANK peptide: GANVTMQN (SEQ ID NO:5).","Carrier tagged ANK peptide fragments were applied directly and in liposomes to release SNCG-mediated drug resistance. For these experiments, GYGRKKRRQRRR (TAT) tagged GNSALHVASQHG (P12) (SEQ ID NO:30), GYGRKKRRQRRR (TAT) tagged GANVTMQN (P8) (SEQ ID NO:31) and a control peptide GYGRKKRRQRRR (TAT CTL; SEQ ID NO:29) were chemically synthesized. Each peptide contained FITC on its N-terminal end. These peptides were dissolved in 2% DMSO in PBS (pH 7.3) and applied directly on the Petri dish containing cancer cells (T47D) at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Active internalization of peptide was observed using fluorescent microscopy and was quantified using flow cytometry. Three independent experiments were performed with duplicates of each condition.  demonstrates the amount of carrier tagged ANK peptides permeabilized by the cancer cells. A similar experiment was also performed to assess release of SNCG-mediated drug resistance in the presence of paclitaxel.  shows a significant amount of paclitaxel-induced cell killing in the T47D cells in the presence of P12 peptide as compared to T47D cells in the presence of TAG CTL peptide.","Similar experiments were performed using liposome encapsulated P12 and P8 peptides with FITC on their N-terminal ends. For the liposome (100-200 nm size) formulation, 67 mg of palmitoyl-oleyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 4.83 mg of cholesterol were mixed and then dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. The mixture was dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. Dried lipids were rehydrated using P8 or P12 peptide (1 mg\/ml) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing sodium cholate (53.75 mg) by vigorous vortexing of the mixture overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Aqueous solutions of P8 or P12 peptide were then dialysed extensively in PBS to remove the sodium cholate molecules. These liposomes were applied directly on T47D cells to observe internalization of P8 or P12 peptide and cell killing in the presence of paclitaxel.  shows active internalization of liposome-encapsulated P8 or P12 peptides as observed by microscopy. The green cells positive for peptide internalization were counted from five different views under a fluorescent microscope, averaged and presented in the bar graph ().","Accordingly, these experiments demonstrate for the first time a single ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide interacting with a protein. As shown herein, the 34-amino acid ANK peptide, design of which was based on the conserved residues of a single ankyrin repeat-like motif, binds to the native SNCG intracellularly prohibiting the interaction of SNCG with BubR1 and thereby releasing the inhibitory effect of SNCG on BubR1-mediated mitotic checkpoint function. BubR1 can prevent the uncontrolled cell division observed in highly infiltrating breast cancers and therefore, is a desired target for controlling these cancers. Cells not expressing BubR1 are able to override mitotic checkpoint controls and continue to progress through cell cycle (Taylor, S. S, and McKeon, F. Cell 1997 89:727-735). This is a very important inhibitory activity as various types of cancers have mitotic checkpoint defects which in some cases are believed to be caused by silencing of BubR1 through mutations (Ohshima et al. Cancer Lett. 2000 158:141-150). Since BubR1 is a critical component of the mitotic checkpoint control, it is believed to be a cellular target of oncogenic proteins such as SNCG that induce tumor progression. Given that the SNCG-BubR1 interaction is the demonstrated leading factor that overrides the effect of antimicrotubule drugs such as nocodazole (Gupta et al. Oncogene 2003 22:7593-7599), minimization of this interaction is desired. The observed ANK peptide binding with SNCG, and the resultant competition with the SNCG-BubR1 interaction in vitro and in vivo identified by the inventors herein provides a novel means by which sensitivity of cancer cells to anti-microtubule drugs can be increased. The ability of this peptide to associate with SNCG is also indicative of its ability to inhibit SNCG stimulation of ER-\u03b1 signaling and hormone responsive tumorigenesis as well as drug resistance to estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen.","In addition to the above-described in vitro and in vivo assays, efficacy of the peptides of the present invention to potentiate efficacy of anticancer drugs can be confirmed in a mouse model. In these experiments, cells such as MCF7-SNCG or T47D cells are suspended in buffered saline (10,000-20,000 cells) stably overexpressing EGFP-ANK and injected into the abdominal mammary-gland area of 5-6-week old female athymic nude mice (N=5) implanted with a0.25 mg estrogen pellet. Control mice receive an equal number of cells containing only EGFP. Measurement of tumor size (three-dimensional measurements (in millimeters)) is carried out at weekly intervals using an electronic caliper. When the tumor reaches 4-5 mm in size, both groups of mice are administered intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel (Sigma) at a dose of 600 \u03bcg\/mouse (1.5 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl) for two weeks. Post-treatment mice are sacrificed, tumor sizes are measured and histopathology of tumors is performed.","The ability of ANK association with SNCG to alleviate hormone responsive tumorigenesis can be confirmed in, for example, SNCG positive breast cancer cells. For these experiments, the association of SNCG and ER-\u03b1 is first established. This can be done by transfecting MCF12A cells with pCI-SNCG, performing co-IP using an anti-SNCG antibody, and looking for ER-\u03b1 pull down via western blotting. This experiment is then repeated in the presence of EGFP-ANK peptide to assess the inhibition of SNCG association with ER-\u03b1. Further to this, experiments are performed to assess cell killing in MCF12A cells in the presence and absence of estrogen. MCF12A cells are co-transfected with pCI-SNCG and EGFP-ANK peptide. Control cells receive only pCI-SNCG. Cells are grown in the presence and absence of estrogen and treated with tamoxifen (2 \u03bcM) for 24 hours. Cell death in these cultures is then estimated using flow cytometry and microscopy as described herein.","The present invention thus relates to synthetic peptides comprising at least one ankyrin repeat-like motif or a portion thereof or mimetic thereof which interact with SNCG to reduce SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or to inhibit tumorigenesis and\/or proliferation of cancer cells. The prominent expression of SNCG in multiple types of human cancers is indicative of these peptides or a portion thereof or a mimetic thereof having a broad effect in cancer metastasis and patient responses to anti-cancer drugs in many types of cancer.","The consensus sequence of the 33 residue ankyrin repeat contains a number of \u201csignature\u201d residues that define the shape of the repeat (Mosavi et al.

Likewise, substitutions among the polar aliphatic neutral amino acids, serine, threonine, methionine, asparagine and glutamine could possibly be made. Substitutions among the charged acidic amino acids, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, could possibly be made, as could substitutions among the charged basic amino acids, lysine and arginine. Substitutions among the aromatic amino acids, including phenylalanine, histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine would also likely be possible.

In these compositions Z is linked to Y and\/or Q is linked to Y-Z via any acceptable binding means and selected based upon selection of Z or Q. Examples of acceptable binding means include, but are in no way limited to, covalent binding, noncovalent binding, hydrogen binding, antibody-antigen recognition and ligand binding. In compositions with the formula Y-Z or Q-Y-Z, Y comprises at least one ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide or a portion thereof or mimetic thereof; Z comprises a compound linked to Y that enhances the performance of Y; and in embodiments comprising Q, Q may be identical to Z or different from Z and also enhances performance of the compound Q-Y-Z.","Exemplary Z or Q compounds include, but are not limited to, a targeting agent, a second agent for treatment of cancer, an agent which enhances solubility, absorption, distribution, half-life, bioavailability, stability, activity and\/or efficacy, or an agent which reduces toxicity or side effects of the compound. By targeting agent it is meant to include agents which direct the composition to the tumor as well as agents which enhance or increase entry of the composition into the tumor cell itself.","Exemplary targeting agents of Z and\/or Q include, but are in no way limited to, antibodies and active fragments thereof such as, for example, Fab fragments, peptides, hormones, vitamins, lectins, saccharides, carbohydrates and other ligands that have affinity for cells of interest and\/or aid in transport into cells of interest.

The NGR peptide binds an aminopeptidase (CD13) isoform expressed in tumor blood vessels. Peptides containing the Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) motif, including both linear GNGRG and disulfide-bridged CNGRC, have been disclosed to be useful for delivering various viral particles and anti-tumor compounds, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, apoptotic peptides, cytokines, cytotoxic drugs, proapoptotic peptides, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), to tumor blood vessels (Ellerby et al.

Exemplary CPPs include Tat PTD derived from the HIV Tat protein, Antennapedia (also known as Antp or penetratin), VP22 (a herpes virus protein), model amphipathic peptide (MAP), transportan, transportan-10, KALA, and Pep-1.","Further, vector molecules such as lytic peptides, pH-sensitive polymers or swellable dendritic polymers can be attached to Y of the Y-Z or Q-Y-Z compositions of the present invention as a targeting agent to enhance endosomal escape if internalization is via endocytosis (Torchilin and Lukyanov (2003) Drug Discovery Today 8(6): 259-266).","Many of these targeting agents are commercially available and can be readily linked to Y of the Y-Z or Q-Y-Z compositions of the present invention.","By \u201cmimetic\u201d, as used herein, it is meant to be inclusive of peptides, which may be recombinant, and peptidomimetics, as well as small organic molecules, which exhibit similar or enhanced interaction with SNCG and reduction of SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibition of tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation as compared to the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides of the present invention. These include peptide variants which comprise conservative amino acid substitutions relative to the sequences of the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides exemplified herein and peptide variants which have a high percentage of sequence identity with the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides exemplified herein. By high percentage of sequence identity it is meant a peptide which shares at least 60%, more preferably at least 65%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, and more preferably at least 99% sequence identity with ANK peptide or an exemplified ank-like peptide or portion thereof. For peptides sharing sequence identity with a portion of the ANK peptide or the exemplary ank-like peptides exemplified herein, it is preferred that a higher sequence identity be shared with either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the peptide. Variant peptides can be aligned with the reference peptide or portion thereof to assess percentage sequence identity in accordance with any of the well-known techniques for alignment. For example, a variant peptide greater in length than a reference peptide is aligned with the reference peptide using any well known technique for alignment and percentage sequence identity is calculated over the length of the reference peptide, notwithstanding any additional amino acids of the variant peptide, which may extend beyond the length of the reference peptide. A variant peptide shorter in length than the reference peptide is aligned with the reference peptide at the region of shared homology, i.e. the C terminus, N terminus or the central region of the reference peptide.","Preferred variants include, but are not limited to, peptides comprising one or more D amino acids, which are equally effective but less susceptible to degradation in vivo, and cyclic peptides. Cyclic peptides can be circularized by various means including but not limited to peptide bonds, lactam rings, depsicyclic terminal residues (i.e. a disulfide bond) and\/or N-terminal to C-terminal head-to-tail cyclization.","The stability of ANK peptides and variants thereof of the present invention can also be enhanced by modifications to the peptide or variant including, but not limited to, acetylation, glycosylation, amidation, and\/or addition of unnatural amino acids such as \u03b2-amino and \u03b1-trifluoromethyl amino acids to the ANK peptide or variant thereof.","As used herein, the term \u201cpeptidomimetic\u201d is intended to include peptide analogs that serve as appropriate substitutes for the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides, in interacting with SNCG and reducing SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibiting tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation. The peptidomimetic must possess not only similar chemical properties, e.g. affinity to SNCG, but also efficacy and function. That is, a peptidomimetic exhibits function(s) of an ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide, without restriction of structure. Peptidomimetics of the present invention, i.e. analogs of an ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide, include amino acid residues or other moieties which provide the functional characteristics described herein. Peptidomimetics and methods for their preparation and use are described in Morgan et al. 1989, \u201cApproaches to the discovery of non-peptide ligands for peptide receptors and peptidases,\u201d In Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry (Vuirick, F. J. ed), Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 243-253.","Mimetics of the present invention may be designed to have a similar structural shape to ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides but have enhanced activities. For example, conformationally restricted moieties such as a tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety may be substituted for a phenylalanine, while histidine bioisoteres may be substituted for histidine to decrease first pass clearance by biliary excretion. Peptidomimetics of the present invention may also comprise peptide backbone modifications. Analogues containing amide bond surrogates are frequently used to study aspects of peptide structure and function including, but not limited to, rotational freedom in the backbone, intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bond patterns, modifications to local and total polarity and hydrophobicity, and oral bioavailability. Examples of isosteric amide bond mimics include, but are not limited to, \u03c8[CHS], \u03c8[CHNH], \u03c8[CSNH], \u03c8[NHCO], \u03c8[COCH] and \u03c8[(E) or (Z)CH\u2550CH].","Identification of the activity of the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides also permits molecular modeling based on these peptides for design, and subsequent synthesis, of small organic molecules that interact with SNCG and reduce SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibit tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation. These small organic molecules mimic the structure and activity of the ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides. However, instead of comprising amino acids, these small organic molecules comprise bioisosteres thereof, substituents or groups that have chemical or physical similarities, and exhibit broadly similar biological activities.","Bioisosterism is a lead modification approach used by those skilled in the art of drug design and shown to be useful in attenuating toxicity and modifying activity of a lead compound such as the ANK peptide of SEQ ID NO:1, other ankyrin repeat-like motif peptides of SEQ ID NO: 8, 9, 10 or 11, of the ankyrin consensus peptide depicted in Table 3 and referred to therein as the ankyrin repeat.","Bioisosteric approaches are discussed in detail in standard reference texts such as The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action (Silverman, R B, Academic Press, Inc. 1992 San Diego, Calif., pages 19-23). Classical bioisosteres comprise chemical groups with the same number of valence electrons but which may have a different number of atoms. Thus, for example, classical bioisosteres with univalent atoms and groups include, but are not limited to: CH, NH, OH, F and Cl; Cl, PHand SH; Br and i-Pr; and I and t-Bu. Classical bioisosteres with bivalent atoms and groups include, but are not limited to: \u2014CH\u2014 and NH; O, S, and Se; and COCH, CONHR, COR and COSR. Classical bioisosteres with trivalent atoms and groups include, but are not limited to: CH\u2550 and N\u2550; and P\u2550 and As\u2550. Classical bioisosteres with tetravalent atoms include, but are not limited to: C and Si; and \u2550C\u2550, \u2550N\u2550and \u2550P\u2550. Classical bioisosteres with ring equivalents include, but are not limited to: benzene and thiophene; benzene and pyridine; and tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, cyclopentane and pyrrolidine. Nonclassical bioisosteres still produce a similar biological activity, but do not have the same number of atoms and do not fit the electronic and steric rules of classical isosteres.

Methods of formulation for such pharmaceutical compositions are well known in the art and taught in standard reference texts such as , Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may comprise a single peptide or portion thereof, a Y-Z or Q-Y-Z composition, or a mimetic of these which interacts with SNCG and reduces SNCG-mediated resistance to treatment with anticancer drugs and\/or inhibits tumorigenesis and\/or cancer cell proliferation. These pharmaceutical compositions may be administered alone or in combination with a second anticancer drug or agent. For example, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising an ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide or portion thereof or mimetic thereof, can be administered to a subject in combination with a microtubule inhibitor. Microtubule inhibitors, also referred to as anti-microtubule drugs, such as, but not limited to vinca alkaloids and taxanes, are cytotoxic agents that inhibit cell growth by disrupting microtubules, thereby preventing cell division. Microtubule inhibitors are often used as first line chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of metastatic cancers. Exemplary microtubule inhibitors include, but are not limited to, nocodazole, paclitaxel, colchicine, dolastatin 15, podophyllotoxin, rhizoxin, vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine and vinorelbine (Navelbine). Examples of commercially available taxanes include TAXOL (paclitaxel, Bristol-Myers Squibb), TAXOTERE (docetaxel, Sanofi-Aventis) and ABRAXANE (a reformulated nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel, Abraxis BioScience). There are also anti-microtubule drugs currently in clinical development. Examples of taxanes in clinical trials for breast cancer include MAC-321 (Wyeth, Phase II), TOCOSOL\u00ae paclitaxel (Schering, Phase III) and TAXOPREXIN DHA-paclitaxel (Protarga, Phase III). Further, new taxanes, such as ABRAXANE involve new delivery methods that remove the need for traditional chemical solvents; they are anticipated to make significant inroads due to fewer side effects than traditional taxanes. There are also several approved combination treatments (for example, TAXOL-GEMZAR for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and HERCEPTIN-TAXOTERE as a first-line therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer) that include anti-microtubule drugs.","Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention comprising an ankyrin repeat-like motif peptide or portion thereof or mimetic thereof, can be administered to a subject in combination with a hormonal cancer treatment. Exemplary hormonal cancer treatments include, but are not limited to, selective estrogen response modifiers (SERMs) such as tamoxifen, raloxifene (EVISTA (Eli Lilly)), and toremifene (FARESTON (Orion Pharmaceutical)), and estrogen receptor downregulators (ERDs), such as fulvestrant (FASLODEX (Astra-Zeneca).","A preferred formulation for use in pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is complexing the peptide or mimetic thereof or Y-Z or Q-Y-Z composition with a lipid. Also preferred as a formulation is encapsulation of the peptide or mimetic thereof or Y-Z or Q-Y-Z composition or mimetic thereof in a phospholipid vesicle such as, but not limited to, a liposome. Liposomes containing the peptide or mimetic thereof or Y-Z or Q-Y-Z composition or mimetic thereof of the present invention can be prepared in accordance with any of the well known methods such as described by Epstein et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82: 3688-3692 (1985)), Hwang et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77: 4030-4034 (1980)), EP 52,322, EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; EP 142,641; Japanese Pat. Appl. 83-118008, and EP 102,324, as well as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Preferred liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 10 mol. percent cholesterol, preferably in a range of 10 to 40 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for optimal peptide therapy. However, as will be understood by those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, phospholipid vesicles other than liposomes can also be used.","Micelles, nanoparticles, injectable polymer implants, gels and other hydrophilic systems, as well as microemulsions currently used or in development as delivery vehicles for peptides can also be used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention.","Any of these formulations of pharmaceutical compositions may further comprise a targeting agent such as described herein for use in Y-Z or Q-Y-Z composition. When used in this embodiment, the targeting agent is preferably attached to the delivery vehicle (e.g. liposomes, micelles, nanoparticles, injectable polymer implants, gels or other hydrophilic systems).","Another preferred formulation for pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention contains a peptide comprising one or more D amino acids and an aqueous vehicle suitable for intravenous or oral administration. Intravenous formulations expected to be useful as pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The vehicle can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and oils (e.g., vegetable oil). The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion, and by the use of surfactants.","Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In some cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition.

Because of the relatively large amount required in this experiment, GST-SNCG, which expresses at least 2 times better than SNCG, was used. A control using GST as the analyte was performed to verify that it did not interact with the peptide. The changes in the refractive index at the sensor chip surface with respect to time are scaled in resonance units (RU). For proteins, every 1000 RU corresponds to a surface mass change of \u02dc1 ng\/mm. All experiments were performed at 25\u00b0 C. using research grade carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5) sensor chips (Biacore Inc.). Bulk refractive index changes, non-specific binding, and instrument drift were corrected for by on-line subtraction (response over active surface less response over reference surface). Prior to all analyses the GST-SNCG and ANK peptide preparations were dialyzed against the running buffer to minimize bulk effects. Blank analyte injections (running buffer only) were subtracted from the specific binding isotherms to further minimize instrument noise. Results are shown in .","For the affinity binding experiments, active flow cells of approximately 5000 RU ANK peptide (288 \u03bcg\/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were immobilized using the ligand thiolcoupling kit (Biacore, Inc.) and running buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% (v\/v) P20 surfactant, pH 7.4). For kinetic binding experiments, active flow cells of approximately 300 RU ANK peptide were immobilized in a similar manner. For reference flow cells, the surfaces were activated and blocked in a similar manner but in the absence of any ligand addition. In all cases the analyte binding measurements were performed using running buffer 2 (running buffer 1 plus 0.1% P20 surfactant). Following each binding interaction, surfaces were regenerated using running buffer 1 containing 20 mM \u03b5-ACA\/1 M NaCl\/0.1% P20 surfactant. Typical parameters for each cycle of the affinity and kinetic binding methods were as follows: 60 \u03bcL of analyte (with 600 seconds of dissociation) at 10 \u03bcL\/minute, 10\u00d760 \u03bcL of regeneration at 20 \u03bcL\/minute, 250 \u03bcL of running buffer at 10 \u03bcL\/minute. Data was analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.1 software (Biacore Inc.). The data was analyzed globally, using a simultaneous fit for both association (k, Ms) and dissociation (k, s). The KD (M) value was calculated as k\/k.","Titration calorimetry measurements were performed with a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, Mass.). The protein solution for ITC was dialyzed extensively overnight against 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The peptide solution was prepared by diluting with the buffer used for the protein dialysis. Injections (6 \u03bcl\u00d750) of peptide (400 \u03bcM) were done by means of a rotating stirrer-syringe to the reaction cell, containing 1.43 ml of the 50 \u03bcM protein solution. The heat of dilution was determined to be negligible in separate titrations of the ligand into the buffer solution. Calorimetric data analysis was carried out with ORIGIN 5.0 software (MicroCal).

In initial experiments ANK peptide (5, 10 or 100 \u03bcM) was microinjected. In all further experiment to date, ANK peptide (10 \u03bcM), together with goat IgG (1 mg\/ml) and fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC, 5 mg\/ml; Molecular Probes) into the MCF7-SNCG or MCF7-Neo cells under a 40\u00d7 magnification of phase contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) using a pressure injection system (Femtojet, Eppendorf). To exclude the possibility that microinjection might affect cell cycle and proliferation, MCF7-Neo and MCF7-SNCG were microinjected with goat IgG as a control. Injections were done at a constant flow setup by varying the injection pressure Pc between 40-70 units. The microscope stage was kept at 37\u00b0 C. using thermal control device (Tempcontrol-37-2 Digital). Approximately 25-30 cells were microinjected in each experiment (n=3).

After permeabilization with 0.2% TritonX-100 in PBS, the fixed cells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for overnight at 4\u00b0 C. To detect goat IgG which is an injection marker, the cells were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG secondary antibodies (1:500; Molecular Probes) in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, the cover slips containing the immunolabeled cells were treated with 40 \u03bcM DAPI for 10 minutes before washing and mounting with an antifade mounting medium (Biomeda Gel mount, Electron Microscopy Sciences).

Cell lysate containing 2 mg of protein was precleared with 100 \u03bcl of protein A sepharose (50% slurry) for 10 minute at 4\u00b0 C. and then incubated with 10 \u03bcg of goat anti-SNCG antibody at 4\u00b0 C. for 3 hours. Thirty microliters of protein A sepharose was then added to the lysate and the mixture was diluted with equal volume of 2\u00d7IP buffer IP buffer [1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA pH 8.0] containing protease inhibitor cocktail. The mixture was further incubated at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. After centrifugation, the sepharose beads were resuspended in TB buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH. 7.0). After 10 washes by TB buffer, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer by boiling. Proteins in supernatants were separated by SDSPAGE, and analyzed by western blotting with 1:100 dilution of a goat anti-SNCG polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-10698, 1:200 dilution) and subsequently probed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-9996, 1:500 dilution).

Results are shown in .","Cells (MCF7-SNCG transfected with EGFP-ANK or EGFP control vector) grown on 13-mm round-glass coverslips inserted in wells of 24 well-culture plates were untreated or treated with anti-microtubule drug paclitaxel (TAXOL) at 0.5 \u03bcM concentration for 36 hours. Thereafter cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 minutes at \u221220\u00b0 C. and then stained with 1 \u03bcg\/ml of DAPI. For each sample, 200-300 cells randomly chosen from 5 different views under a Nikon fluorescent microscope were scored for interphase, mitotic, or apoptotic based upon nuclei morphology. Available bar graph () shows that the expression of EGFP-ANK disrupts the SNCG-mediated inhibition of mitotic checkpoint function. The data shown were derived from three separate transfections.","Deletion peptides of EGFP-ANK were designed based on a molecular model of ANK peptide generated using an online webserver swissmodel with the extension expasy.org\/. Deletion peptides designed were amplified by PCR, followed by directional cloning into the EcoR I site of EGFP\u2014C2 to produce EGFP-ANK deletion peptides. The resulting plasmid PEGFP-ANK was sequenced to verify the correct inframe ligation and right orientation of the peptide. Cytoplasmic expression of EGFP-ANK deletion peptide was confirmed by green fluorescent signals in cells transfected with pEGFP-ANK deletion peptides. The correct molecular mass of EGFP-ANK was verified by western blotting with anti-GFP antibody.","Deletion peptide sequences followed by primers designed for cloning are depicted below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0145","num":"0144"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1","tabstyle":"monospace"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"245pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"133pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["P13",{},{}]},{"entry":["CACCTTGGATGCATACAGACCTTGGTTAGATATGGAGCATGA","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200317)"]},{"entry":["\u2003H\u2003\u2003L\u2003\u2003G\u2003\u2003C\u2003\u2003I\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003T\u2003\u2003L\u2003\u2003V\u2003\u2003R\u2003\u2003Y\u2003\u2003G\u2003\u2003A\u2003\u2003*","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20034)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P13for\u2003-\u2003CACCTTGGATGCATACAG","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200318)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P13rev\u2003-\u2003TCATGCTCCATATCTAACC","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200319)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["P18",{}]},{"entry":["CTTCACGTAGCCTCACAGCATGGCCACCTTGGATGCATACAGACCTTGGTTAGATGA","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200320)"]},{"entry":["\u2003L\u2003\u2003H\u2003\u2003V\u2003\u2003A\u2003\u2003S\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003H\u2003\u2003G\u2003\u2003H\u2003\u2003L\u2003\u2003G\u2003\u2003C\u2003\u2003I\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003T\u2003\u2003L\u2003\u2003V\u2003\u2003R\u2003\u2003*","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20033)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P18for\u2003-\u2003CTTCACGTAGCCTCACAGC","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200321)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P18rev\u2003-\u2003TCATCTAACCAAGGTCTG","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200322)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["P12",{}]},{"entry":["GGCAACAGTGCCCTTCACGTAGCCTCACAGCATGGCTGA","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200323)"]},{"entry":["\u2003G\u2003\u2003N\u2003\u2003S\u2003\u2003A\u2003\u2003L\u2003\u2003H\u2003\u2003V\u2003\u2003A\u2003\u2003S\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003H\u2003\u2003G\u2003\u2003*","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20032)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P12for\u2003-\u2003CTTCACGTAGCCTCACAGC","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200324)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P12rev\u2003-\u2003TCAGCCATGCTGTGAGGC","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200325)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["P8",{}]},{"entry":["GGAGCAAATGTCACCATGCAGAACTGA","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200326)"]},{"entry":["\u2003G\u2003\u2003A\u2003\u2003N\u2003\u2003V\u2003\u2003T\u2003\u2003M\u2003\u2003Q\u2003\u2003N\u2003\u2003*","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u20035)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P8for\u2003-\u2003aattGGAGCAAATGTCACCATGCAGAACTGA","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200327)"]},{"entry":{}},{"entry":["Primer\u2003P8rev\u2003-\u2003aattTCAGTTCTGCATGGTGACATTTGCTCC","(SEQ\u2003ID\u2003NO:\u200328)"]}]}}}},"br":{}},"T47D, MCF7-neo and MCF7-SNCG clones were transfected with pEGFP-ANK plasmid or the control plasmid PEGFP by FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche (Indianapolis, Ind.).
