{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD","DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to network computing, more particularly, to systems and methods for cloud computing related networks, services and products.","The advent of cloud-based computing architectures has opened new possibilities for the rapid and scalable deployment of virtual Web stores, media outlets, and other on-line sites or services. In general, a cloud-based architecture deploys a set of hosted resources such as processors, operating systems, software and other components that can be combined or strung together to form virtual machines. A user or customer can request the instantiation of a virtual machine or set of machines from those resources from a central server or management system to perform intended tasks or applications. For example, a user may wish to set up and instantiate a virtual server from the cloud to create a storefront to market products or services on a temporary basis, for instance, to sell tickets to an upcoming sports or musical performance. The user can lease or subscribe to the set of resources needed to build and run the set of instantiated virtual machines on a comparatively short-term basis, such as hours or days, for their intended application.","Currently, cloud-based computing architectures are supported by dedicated servers used solely to operate the clouds. These dedicated servers utilize unitary cloud management schemes in order to instantiate virtual machines in the cloud. As such, these architectures lack flexibility in selecting different cloud management schemes to instantiate virtual machines or communicate with the virtual machines. Likewise, these architectures lack the ability to migrate virtual machines to clouds which utilize different cloud management schemes.","For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present teachings are described by referring mainly to exemplary embodiments thereof. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to, and can be implemented in, all types of information and systems, and that any such variations do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present teachings. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying figures, which illustrate specific embodiments. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present teachings. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present teachings is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.","Embodiments of the present teachings relate to systems and methods for flexible management of a cloud computing environment. More particularly, embodiments relate to platforms and techniques in which a cloud management system can support one or more clouds regardless of the cloud management scheme utilized in the cloud.","According to embodiments, to manage and instantiate the virtual machines regardless of the cloud management scheme of clouds, the cloud management system can be configured to utilize an abstraction library. The abstraction library can be configured to abstract out the differences between different cloud management schemes. The abstraction library can be configured to include a record of the different formats utilized by the cloud management schemes in order to allow communication, control, instantiation, and management of the virtual machines. Additionally, the abstraction library can be configured to include commands and software instructions to convent and to configure the format of one cloud management scheme to another cloud management scheme.","According to embodiments, the abstraction library can be implemented as any type of software library accessible by the cloud management system, management tools of the cloud management system, and other systems and application programs. The cloud management system can be configured to maintain the abstraction library in a repository or storage.","According to embodiments, the cloud management system can be configured to utilize the abstraction library to perform various processes associated with the virtual machines regardless of the cloud management scheme of the virtual machine. The cloud management system can be configured to format and to convert virtual machines to the cloud management scheme of the cloud in which the virtual machine will be instantiated. Likewise, the cloud management system can be configured to utilize the abstraction library to enable communication with virtual machines that are formated according to a different cloud management scheme than the communication.","By supporting clouds regardless of the infrastructure and cloud management scheme, the cloud management system can create, manage, and support the clouds on any type of computing resources. Likewise, the cloud management system can support virtual machines and clouds of different cloud management schemes. Thus, the cloud management system can provide flexibility and efficiency to any cloud computing environment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106"]},"As shown for example in , the collection of computing resources supporting the dedicated cloud  can comprise a set of resource servers  configured to deliver computing resources and components needed to instantiate a virtual machine, process, or other resource. For example, one group of resource servers can host and serve an operating system or components thereof to deliver to and instantiate a virtual machine. Another group of resource servers can accept requests to host computing cycles or processor time, to supply a defined level of processing power for a virtual machine. A further group of resource servers can host and serve applications to load on an instantiation of a virtual machine, such as an email client, a browser application, a messaging application, or other applications or software. Other types of resource servers are possible.","In embodiments, in addition to supporting the dedicated cloud , the cloud management system  can be configured to support the ad-hoc cloud . The ad-hoc cloud  can be composed of a variety of computing resources that may not be dedicated to a cloud but can have available computing resources to contribute to the ad-hoc cloud . For example, a corporation or university can have a large number of computing resources that support a variety of process (email, websites, individual user computing, and the like). The corporation or university can utilize the available excess computing resources to support an ad-hoc cloud, such as ad-hoc cloud .","In embodiments, as shown in , the ad-hoc cloud  can be supported by a number of computing systems . For example, the computing systems  can include a variety of systems such as a set of servers  and  and standalone user computing systems  and . The computing systems  can include hardware resources, such as processors, memory, network hardware, storage devices, and the like, and software resources, such as operating systems (OS), application programs, and the like.","In embodiments, the entire set of resource servers  or other hardware or software resources used to support the cloud  and the computing systems  used to support the cloud  can be managed by the cloud management system . The cloud management system  can comprise a dedicated or centralized server and\/or other software, hardware, and network tools that communicate via one or more networks  and networks , such as the Internet or other public or private network, with all sets of resource servers  to manage the cloud  and with computing systems  to manage the cloud  and their operation.","In embodiments, to manage the clouds  and , the cloud management system  can be configured identify the computing resources of the set of resource servers  and computing systems . The cloud management system  can be configured to include a network management agent that is capable of querying the set of resource servers  and computing systems  to determine the hardware and software resources. Likewise, the cloud management system  can be configured to communicate with external network management systems and\/or resources monitoring agents executing on the set of resource servers  and computing systems  in order to determine the hardware and software resources of the set of resource servers  and computing systems .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can be configured to identify both the hardware and software resources of the set of resource servers  and computing systems  and which of those resources are available for use in the cloud. The cloud management system  can be configured to identify the hardware resources such as type and amount of processing power, type and amount of memory, type and amount of storage, type and amount of network bandwidth and the like, of the set of resource servers  and computing systems . Likewise, the cloud management system can be configured to identify the software resources, such as type of OS, application programs, and the like, of the set of resource servers  and computing systems .","In embodiments, once the computing resources have been identified, the cloud management system  can be configured to store an identification of the available resources in an inventory  in a repository . The repository  can be any type of structure configured to store information, such as a database. The repository  can be maintained in a computer readable storage device or medium whether local to or remote from the cloud management system .","In embodiments, the inventory  can be configured to include information that identifies the set of resource server  and computing systems  and information identifying the computing resources available. The sets of resource servers  and each system in the computing systems  can be identified by unique identifiers such as, for instance, Internet Protocol (P) addresses or other addresses. In the inventory , the cloud management system  can associate, with each unique identifier, the computing resources available on that computing system.","In embodiments, to instantiate a new set of virtual machines, a requester can transmit an instantiation request to the cloud management system . The instantiation request can include the specifications for the set of virtual machines. The specifications can include the particular type of virtual machine they wish to invoke for their intended application. A requester can, for instance, make a request to instantiate a set of virtual machines configured for email, messaging or other applications from the cloud  and\/or . The specifications can also include the type and\/or amount of computing resources required. For example, the instantiation request can specify an amount of processing power or input\/output (I\/O) throughput the user wishes to be available to each instance of the virtual machine or other resources.","In embodiments, the requester's instantiation request can specify a variety of other specifications defining the configuration and operation of the set of virtual machines to be invoked. The instantiation request, for example, can specify a defined period of time for which the instantiated machine or process is needed. The period of time can be, for example, an hour, a day, or other increment of time. In embodiments, the requester's instantiation request can specify the instantiation of a set of virtual machines or processes on a task basis, rather than for a predetermined amount of time. For instance, a requester could request resources until a software update is completed. The requester can also, for instance, specify a service level agreement (SLA) acceptable for their application. One skilled in the art will realize that the requester's request can likewise include combinations of the foregoing exemplary specifications, and others.","In embodiments, the instantiation request can be received and processed by the cloud management system , which identifies the type of virtual machine, process, or other resource being requested from the specifications. The cloud management system  can then identify the collection of computing resources necessary to instantiate that machine or resource. For example, the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources can for example comprise virtual transaction servers used to support Web storefronts, or other transaction sites.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can be configured to utilize the specifications from the instantiation request and the inventory  of available computing resources to determine which cloud resources to devote to the requester's virtual machines to maximize the computing resources of the clouds  and\/or  and meet the requester's specifications. For example, the cloud management system  can select a group of servers in the set of resource servers  and\/or computing system in the computing systems  that match or best match the instantiation request for each component needed to build the virtual machine or other resource.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can maintain a set of \u201cvirtual groups,\u201d and assign the set of resource servers  and computing systems  to different \u201cvirtual groups\u201d. The \u201cvirtual groups\u201d can be based on the particular usage (type of virtual machine, application of the virtual machine, function of the virtual machine, and the like) of the members in the groups. For example, the cloud management system  can set up a \u201cvirtual group\u201d for web servers. The cloud management system  can classify the computing resources for the web server \u201cvirtual group\u201d based on which computing resources are best suited for web servers. As members of the web server \u201cvirtual group\u201d request use of the cloud, the cloud management system  can assign the available computing resources classified in the web server \u201cvirtual group\u201d to the members. Likewise, the \u201cvirtual groups\u201d can be based on the specifications of the computing resources (type and amount of computing resources). For example, the cloud management system  can create a \u201cvirtual group\u201d for high power computing users. The cloud management system  can assign resources to this group that can adequately support computing intensive virtual machines. As members of the high power \u201cvirtual group\u201d request use of the cloud, the cloud management system  can assign the available computing resources classified in the high power \u201cvirtual group\u201d to the members. The cloud management system  can maintain the virtual groups in a group record  in repository .","When the request to instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources has been received and the necessary resources to build that machine or resource have been identified, the cloud management system  can communicate with one or more set of resource servers  and\/or computing systems  to locate resources to supply the required components. The cloud management system  can select providers from the diverse set of resource servers  and\/or computing systems  to assemble the various components needed to build the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. It may be noted that in some embodiments, permanent storage such as hard disk arrays may not be included or located within the set of resource servers  and the computing resources  available to the cloud management system , because the set of instantiated virtual machines or other resources may be intended to operate on a purely transient or temporary basis. In embodiments, other hardware, software or other resources not strictly located or hosted in the cloud can be leveraged as needed. For example, other software services that are provided outside of the clouds  and  and hosted by third parties can be invoked by in-cloud virtual machines. For further example, other non-cloud hardware and\/or storage services can be utilized as an extension to the clouds  and , either on an on-demand or subscribed or decided basis.","With the specification and resources identified, the cloud management system  can extract and build the set of virtual machines or other resources on a dynamic or on-demand basis. For example, one set of resource servers  or computing systems  can respond to an instantiation request for a given quantity of processor cycles with an offer to deliver that computational power immediately and guaranteed for the next hour. A further set of resource servers  or computing systems  can offer to immediately supply communication bandwidth, for example on a guaranteed minimum or best-efforts basis. In other embodiments, the set of virtual machines or other resources can be built on a batch basis or at a particular future time. For example, a set of resource servers  and\/or computing systems  can respond to a request for instantiation at a programmed time with an offer to deliver the specified quantity of processor cycles within a specific amount of time, such as the next 12 hours.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can then coordinate the integration of the completed group of servers from the set of resource servers  and\/or computing systems from the computing systems , to build and launch the requested set of virtual machines or other resources. The cloud management system  can track the combined group of servers selected from the set of resource servers , computing systems from the computing systems , or other distributed resources that are dynamically or temporarily combined, to produce and manage the requested virtual machine population or other resources.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can then set up and launch the initiation process for the virtual machines, processes, or other resources to be delivered from the cloud. The cloud management system  can for instance transmit an instantiation command or instruction to the group of servers in set of resource servers  and\/or computing system in the computing systems . The cloud management system  can receive a confirmation message back from each participating server in a set of resource servers  and\/or computing system in the computing systems  indicating a status regarding the provisioning of their respective resources. Various sets of resource servers can confirm, for example, the availability of a dedicated amount of processor cycles, amounts of electronic memory, communications bandwidth, or applications or other software prepared to be served.","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can maintain a VM record  of each virtual machine instantiated in the clouds  and . Each virtual machine can be assigned an instantiated machine ID that can be stored in the VM record , or other record or image of the instantiated population. Additionally, the cloud management system  can store the duration of each virtual machine and the collection of resources utilized by each virtual machine in the VM record  and\/or inventory . The cloud management system  can maintain the VM record  in the repository .","In embodiments, the cloud management system  can further store, track and manage a requester's identity and associated set of rights or entitlements to software, hardware, and other resources. Each requester that populates a set of virtual machines in the cloud can have specific rights and resources assigned and made available to them. The cloud management system  can track and configure specific actions that a requester can perform, such as provision a set of virtual machines with software applications or other resources, configure a set of virtual machines to desired specifications, submit jobs to the set of virtual machines or other host, manage other requesters of the virtual machines or other resources, and other privileges or actions. The cloud management system  can further generate records of the usage of instantiated virtual machines to permit tracking, billing, and auditing of the services consumed by the requester. In embodiments, the cloud management system  can for example meter the usage and\/or duration of the virtual machines, to generate subscription billing records for a requester that has launched those machines. Other billing or value arrangements are possible.","The cloud management system  can configure each virtual machine to be made available to requester and\/or users of the one or more networks  and\/or  via a browser interface, or other interface or mechanism. Each instantiated virtual machine can communicate with the cloud management system  and the underlying registered set of resource servers  and\/or computing systems  via a standard Web application programming interface (API), or via other calls or interfaces. The instantiated virtual machines can likewise communicate with each other, as well as other sites, servers, locations, and resources available via the Internet or other public or private networks, whether within a given cloud  or  or between clouds.","It may be noted that while a browser interface or other front-end can be used to view and operate the instantiated virtual machines from a client or terminal, the processing, memory, communications, storage, and other hardware as well as software resources required to be combined to build the virtual machines or other resources are all hosted remotely in the clouds  and . In embodiments, the virtual machines or other resources may not depend on or require the requester's own on-premise hardware or other resources. In embodiments, a requester can therefore request and instantiate a set of virtual machines or other resources on a purely off-premise basis, for instance to build and launch a virtual storefront or other application.","Because the cloud management system  in one regard specifies, builds, operates and manages the virtual machines on a logical level, the requester can request and receive different sets of virtual machines and other resources on a real-time or near real-time basis, without a need to specify or install any particular hardware. The requester's virtual machines, processes, or other resources can be scaled up or down immediately or virtually immediately on an on-demand basis, if desired. In embodiments, the various sets of computing resources that are accessed by the cloud management system  to support the virtual machines or processes can change or be substituted, over time. The type and operating characteristics of the virtual machines can nevertheless remain constant or virtually constant, since instances are assembled from abstracted resources that can be selected and maintained from diverse sources based on uniform specifications.","In terms of network management of the virtual machines that have been successfully configured and instantiated, the cloud management system  can perform various network management tasks including security, maintenance, and metering for billing or subscription purposes. The cloud management system  of a given cloud  or  can, for example, install or terminate applications or appliances on individual machines. The cloud management system  can monitor operating virtual machines to detect any virus or other rogue process on individual machines, and for instance terminate the infected application or vial machine. The cloud management system  can likewise manage the virtual machines or other resources on a collective basis, for instance, to push or deliver a software upgrade to all active virtual machines. Other management processes are possible. Likewise, the cloud management system  can be configured to communicate with external network management systems to coordinate the network management functions and processes.","In embodiments, more than one set of virtual machines can be instantiated in a given cloud at the same, overlapping or successive times. The cloud management system  can, in such implementations, build, launch and manage multiple sets of virtual machines based on the same or different underlying set of resource servers  or computing systems , with populations of different sets of virtual machines such as may be requested by different requesters. The cloud management system  can institute and enforce security protocols in the clouds  and  hosting multiple sets of virtual machines. Each of the individual sets of virtual machines can be hosted in a respective partition or sub-cloud of the resources of the clouds  and\/or . The cloud management system  of a cloud can for example deploy services specific to isolated or defined sub-clouds, or isolate individual workloads\/processes within the cloud to a specific sub-cloud. The subdivision of the clouds  and\/or  into distinct transient sub-clouds or other sub-components which have assured security and isolation features can assist in establishing multiple requesters or a multi-tenant cloud arrangement. In a multiple requesters scenario, each of the multiple requesters can use the cloud platform as a common utility while retaining the assurance that their information is secure from other requesters of the overall cloud system. In further embodiments, sub-clouds can nevertheless be configured to share resources, if desired.","In embodiments, the instantiated virtual machines supported by the cloud  can also interact with instantiated virtual machines or processes generated in the cloud  or other clouds and vice versa. The cloud management system  of clouds  and  can interface with the cloud management system of other clouds, to coordinate those domains and operate the clouds and\/or virtual machines or processes on a combined basis.","As described above, the cloud management system  can instantiate and manage the virtual machines instantiated in the clouds  and . In embodiments, the instantiation and management of virtual machines can be performed by virtual machine (VM) managers separate from the cloud management system . The cloud management system  can be configured to communicate with the separate VM managers in order to provide the VM managers with the computing resources available in the clouds  and . The cloud management system  can be configured to communicate and cooperate with the VM managers regardless of the cloud management scheme used by the VM managers.","In the foregoing and other embodiments, the requester making an instantiation request or otherwise accessing or utilizing the cloud network can be a person, customer, subscriber, administrator, corporation, organization, or other entity. In embodiments, the requester can be or include another virtual machine, application or process. In further embodiments, multiple requesters and\/or entities can share the use of a set of virtual machines or other resources.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","102","104","106","200","102","104","106","102","104","106","104","106"]},"As shown in , the cloud management system  can be coupled to a network  to communicate with the set of resource servers  and coupled to the network  to communicate with computing systems  to provide management services for the dedicated cloud  and the ad-hoc cloud .
