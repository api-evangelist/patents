{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent loss, and may be defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium. An insurer is a company that sells insurance. An insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount, called the premium, to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage. Adding personal property items to an insurance policy is a manual and time consuming process and is often neglected by the owner of the items.","A home inventory of personal property items is useful in conjunction with insuring those items. A user may have a handwritten inventory, but this may be destroyed in a loss that also destroys the items. The user may store the inventory in a difficult to access location, such as a safe deposit box, which makes updating the inventory burdensome. Maintaining a home inventory is a time consuming process and therefore many people do not maintain a home inventory or keep a home inventory up to date. This may leave some of their personal property items unprotected by insurance.","Information may be received regarding one or more items purchased or otherwise acquired by a user, and the item(s) may be added to an electronic home inventory maintained in storage by an institution system and the item(s) may be added to an insurance policy issued by the institution system.","In an implementation, the institution system may receive information about the item(s) from the merchant who sold the item(s), an appraiser, the user (e.g., who provides information by a website, by providing a receipt, etc.), from a barcode that is provided on the receipt associated with the purchase from the merchant, by a barcode generated by the user (e.g., using data from the receipt and other information from the user), and\/or via data from a financial card transaction directed to the purchase of the item(s).","In an implementation, the user may be provided with a listing of the items that they have purchased or otherwise acquired using the data provided to the institution system, and can select which items are to be included in the home inventory and which items are to be added to an insurance policy.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"105"},"A user  and an associated user computing device  are shown, along with a merchant  and a financial card issuer . The user  may make a purchase from the merchant  using a financial card  and insure item(s) associated with the purchase with the institution system . The institution system  may also generate an inventory of the items purchased as a home inventory and store the home inventory in storage, such as storage  or one more data sources . In an implementation, the home inventory of the user  may be associated in storage (e.g., in a database) of the institution system  with the insurance policy of the user  that insures the items in the home inventory.","The financial card issuer  may issue the financial card  and\/or process transactions associated with the financial card . The financial card issuer  may be an entity that provides services pertaining to aspects and behaviors of financial cards. It is contemplated that the institution system  may handle such aspects and\/or behaviors of financial cards using a financial card processor  for example, and that the financial card issuer  may not be used.","The financial card  may be a credit card or a prepaid credit card, for example. A credit card is a system of payment in which money is not removed from the user's account after every transaction. The financial card issuer , which may be an entity associated with the institution system  or a third party, lends money to the user  to be paid to the merchant . A prepaid credit card (referred to herein as a \u201cprepaid card\u201d) is not really a credit card, as no credit is offered by the financial card issuer . The user  spends money which has been \u201cstored\u201d via a prior deposit by the user  or someone else, such as a parent or employer. However, it carries a credit card brand (e.g., Visa or MasterCard) and can be used in similar ways. After obtaining a prepaid card, the user  loads it with any amount of money and then uses the prepaid card to spend the money. In addition to a credit card or a prepaid card, the financial card  may be any type of payment device such as a debit card, a stored value card, a department store credit card, a mobile device, an RFID (radio-frequency identification) device, or a near-field communications device, for example.","The user  may use the financial card  to make a purchase at the merchant . As described further herein, the institution system  may receive and analyze transaction data associated with the purchase. The institution system  may send a notice to the user , e.g. via email, instant messaging, telephone, facsimile, mail, SMS (short message service), MMS (multimedia messaging service), a proprietary application residing on the user computing device , etc., asking if the user  would like to add the item(s) to a home inventory and\/or obtain insurance coverage for the item(s) pertaining to the purchase. The notice may request the user send a photo of the item(s) or documentation pertaining to the item(s) to the institution system . The notice may be sent to a computing device associated with the user , such as the user computing device .","As described further herein, information may be received at the institution system  regarding one or more items purchased (or otherwise acquired) by the user , and the item(s) may be added to an electronic home inventory (e.g., maintained in storage by the institution system ) and the item(s) may be added to an insurance policy (e.g., a homeowner's insurance policy or rider to the policy issued by the institution system ). In an implementation, the institution system  may receive information about the item(s) from the merchant  who sold the item(s), an appraiser, the user  (e.g., who provides information by a website, by providing a receipt, etc.), from a barcode that is provided on the receipt associated with the purchase from the merchant , by a barcode generated by the user  (e.g., using data from the receipt and other information from the user ), and\/or via data (e.g., level 3 credit card data, etc.) from a financial card  transaction directed to the purchase of the item(s). The user  may be provided with a listing of the items that they have purchased or acquired using the data provided to the institution system , and can select which items are to be included in the home inventory and which items are to be added to an insurance policy.","The institution system  may include a user interface module , an insurance engine , an inventory engine , and a data source access engine . The user interface module  may generate and format one or more pages of content  as a unified graphical presentation that may be provided to the user computing device  as an output from the insurance engine  and\/or the inventory engine . In an implementation, the page(s) of content  may be provided to the user computing device  via a secure website  associated with the institution system .","In an implementation, instead of hosting the website , the institution system  may comprise a conventional application server hosting a proprietary online service accessible only by a private network. In any event, the institution system  may have appropriate security mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized third parties from intercepting the user's information.","The user  may be an individual who owns an insurance product (also may be referred to herein as a policy) or other account that may be provided by or held by the institution associated with the institution system . The user  may provide data to the institution system  via the user computing device . The user computing device  may be a handheld computing device such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) or a mobile phone, for example, or any type of personal computer (PC). The user computing device  and the institution system  may be connected over a network. The user  may communicate with the institution system  by way of a communications network such as an intranet, the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless fidelity (WiFi) network, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a cellular network, a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) network, and the like. An example user computing device is described with respect to . The user  may also communicate with the institution system  by phone, email, instant message, text message, web chat, facsimile, mail, and the like.","The merchant  may be any entity that may sell an item to the user . The user , as well as the institution system  and the financial card issuer , may be in communication with the merchant  via a communications network. During the authorization of a transaction, the merchant  may send data associated with the purchase, such as amount, merchant name, merchant category code (MCC), and financial card number, for example, to the financial card issuer  in an authorization message for verification and processing. An MCC is a number assigned to a business and is used to classify the business by the type of goods or services it provides. In an implementation, the authorization message may comprise additional data such as an itemized listing of the purchased items.","The institution system  may have the ability to interact with information that may be maintained and\/or provided by the merchant , e.g., information pertaining to purchases made by the user . Additionally, the financial card issuer  and the user  may be in communication with the institution system  via a communications network.","In an implementation, the user  may have a barcode processor  which may comprise any type of device that can read a barcode on a receipt or an item, generate a barcode for a receipt or an item, and\/or transmit a barcode to the user computing device  or the institution system . The barcode may contain information about items purchased or otherwise acquired by the user , as described further herein.","In an implementation, the user  may provide photo(s) or documentation to the institution system  about the item(s) purchased that they would like to add to a home inventory and\/or insure. The user  may use an image generator, comprising a scanner for example, to generate a digital image of the item(s), receipt, proof of purchase, or other documentation. It is contemplated that any device that is capable of generating a digital image may be used to make the digital image(s). Additional devices that may be used in the generation of a digital image include a digital camera, a photocopier, a fax machine, and the like, for example.","The user  may transmit the digital image to the institution system  via the user computing device . The institution system  may use the digital image to generate or update a home inventory of the user  and\/or generate or revise a premium quote for insuring the item(s) purchased by the user  or finalize insurance for the item(s). If a digital image is received, the insurance engine  may use any known image processing software or other application(s) to obtain the data from the digital image. The data may be used in the generation and\/or updating of a home inventory and a premium quote. Alternatively, the user  may provide the photo, receipt, proof of purchase, or other documentation about the item(s) to the institution system  by any other electronic or physical techniques.","As described further herein, the insurance engine  may receive the transaction data pertaining to the purchase (or data relating to items that have been acquired by the user ), which may include a receipt, a proof of purchase, and\/or other documentation, and generate a premium quote using a premium generator . The premium generator  may use any techniques(s) for generating a premium quote for insuring the item(s). The premium generator  may use data retrieved from data source(s)  by a data source access engine . Additionally, the premium generator  may request and receive information pertaining to the item(s) from the user  and\/or the merchant . This information may be used in generation of the premium quote. After retrieving or otherwise receiving the data from the various sources, the premium generator  may use tools, applications, and aggregators, for example, to generate a premium quote for insurance of the item(s). The premium quote may be provided to the user , who may accept the premium quote.","The insurance engine  may comprise an insurance processor  that may receive and analyze transaction data as described herein. The insurance processor  may also send a request to the user  requesting instructions regarding insuring items the user may have purchased with the financial card  or otherwise acquired. The insurance processor  may receive instructions from the user  and act on the instructions accordingly.","The inventory engine  may receive the transaction data pertaining to the purchase (or data relating to items that have been acquired by the user ), request instructions from the user  as to whether the items are to be added to a home inventory, and\/or generate a home inventory or update an existing home inventory comprising a listing of the items purchased and\/or indicated by the user  to be included in the home inventory.","As described further herein, the inventory engine  may comprise an inventory generator  that may generate and maintain a home inventory (e.g., an inventory list of the items), as described further herein. The home inventory may comprise items purchased by the user  with the financial card , as well as items that the user may add to the inventory list, e.g., via the website . The inventory generator  may use data retrieved from data source(s)  by a data source access engine . Additionally, the inventory generator  may request and receive information pertaining to the item(s) from the user  and\/or the merchant . This information may be used in generation or updating of the home inventory. After retrieving or otherwise receiving the data from the various sources, the inventory generator  may use tools, applications, and aggregators, for example, to generate a home inventory of the item(s). The home inventory may be provided to the user , who may review and revise the home inventory in an implementation.","The inventory engine  may comprise an inventory processor  that may receive and analyze transaction data as described herein. The inventory processor  may also send a request to the user  requesting instructions regarding adding items the user  may have purchased with the financial card  or otherwise acquired by the user  to the home inventory. The inventory processor  may receive instructions from the user  and act on the instructions accordingly. The inventory processor  may store the home inventory in storage  or the data source(s) .","Because the home inventory is maintained by the institution system  and is electronically accessible by the user , the home inventory is secure, readily available, and can be updated by the user  and\/or the institution system . The home inventory provides legible, comprehensive item listings for insurance claim settlements in the event of a loss of the items. For example, the home inventory could be made accessible immediately to a claims adjuster in the event of a loss. The home inventory would be current, legible, and immediately available to begin the settlement process. The home inventory may be continuously updated and maintained to provide the most current information about items of the user .","The insurance engine  and the inventory engine  have access to data, files, and documents pertaining to the user  as well as any other data, files, and documents that are currently stored by the institution system  as well as external data, files, and documents and that may be useful in generating premium quotes, writing insurance policies, and generating and maintaining inventory lists such as home inventories.","The institution system  has the ability to retrieve information from one or more data sources  via a data source access engine . Data pertaining to the user , the user's home inventory, the user's insurance policies, and\/or the user account(s) may be retrieved from data source(s)  and\/or external data sources. The retrieved data may be stored centrally, perhaps in storage . Other information may be provided to the institution system  from the user  and\/or the merchant .","Data source(s)  may contain data, metadata, email, files, and\/or documents that the institution system  maintains pertaining to the user , such as personal data such as name, physical address, email address, etc., home inventory data such as listings of items and data associated with item (e.g., item purchase price, item acquisition date, merchant or other entity item acquired from, where the item is placed in the user's house, etc.), insurance policy data such as items covered, premiums, and coverage amounts and limits, as well as other account information. The institution system  may access this information when generating premium quotes, writing insurance policies, or maintaining inventory lists, for example.","A user access system may be communicatively coupled to the insurance engine  and the inventory engine  and may be configured to send machine-readable instructions to the insurance engine  and the inventory engine . As mentioned above, the institution system  may provide a unified graphical presentation output. The unified graphical presentation may be transmitted to the user access system. In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation may be combined with other materials and transmitted to the user . In an implementation, the unified graphical presentation is received by the user access system and transmitted directly to the user  without the inclusion of any other materials.","The user access system may be implemented as a web server in an implementation. The user access system, through the use of any suitable interactive web technology, provides an interactive experience to the user  through which access to insurance and inventory data and status and related data can be accomplished. The user  may enter information into the web pages via a web browser on the user computing device . Any technology that provides interactivity through a web browser is considered to be within the scope of the present discussion and may include, without limitation, Hyper-Text Mark-Up Language (HTML), Dynamic HTML (DHTML), JavaScript, and Ajax.","The institution system  may include any combination of systems and subsystems such as electronic devices including, but not limited to, computers, servers, databases, or the like. The electronic devices may include any combination of hardware components such as processors, databases, storage drives, registers, cache, random access memory (RAM) chips, data buses, or the like and\/or software components such as operating systems, database management applications, or the like.","The institution system  may comprise one or more computing devices . The computing device(s)  may have one or more processors , storage  (e.g., storage devices, memory, etc.), and software modules . The computing device(s) , including its processor(s) , storage , and software modules , may be used in the performance of the techniques and operations described herein.","Examples of software modules  may include modules that may be used in conjunction with generating a premium quote and sending the premium quote to the user , issuing an insurance policy, maintaining a home inventory (e.g., an inventory list), generating web page content for display, and receiving instructions from the user , for example. While specific functionality is described herein as occurring with respect to specific modules, the functionality may likewise be performed by more, fewer, or other modules. An example computing device and its components are described in more detail with respect to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","185","175","220","185","105"]},"In an implementation, the institution system  may obtain item data for the purchase, e.g., by contacting the merchant  associated with the purchase and\/or by contacting the user . In an implementation, the institution system  may request from the user  and\/or the merchant  a list of the particular items that were purchased and their associated purchase prices and other information such as purchase date and a description of the item. Alternatively or additionally, the institution system  may ask the user  for a copy (e.g., via facsimile or digital image sent by email or via a website) of the receipt associated with the purchase, and may use the receipt to identify the particular items that were purchased and their associated purchase prices and other information.","Thus, the institution system  may receive information about the item(s) from the merchant  who sold the item(s), an appraiser, the user , from a barcode provided on a receipt provided by the merchant , by a user generated barcode (e.g., using data from the receipt and other information from the user ), and\/or via financial card data (e.g., level 3 credit card data) from a financial card transaction directed to the purchase of the item(s).","In one example, the user  may provide a receipt to a barcode processor , which parses the individual items on the receipt and presents a user interface to the user  so the user  can select which items are to be added to a home inventory and\/or an insurance policy. Data pertaining to the selected items may be communicated to the institution system , and may be added to a home inventory and\/or insurance policy as requested by the user .","At , the institution system  may receive the receipt, proof of purchase, and\/or other documentation. Using the receipt, proof of purchase, and\/or other documentation, the institution system  may identify the items and may generate a home inventory of the items of the user  (e.g., an electronic home contents inventory) at , and may store the home inventory and the data contained therein in storage associated with the institution system .","In an implementation, the home inventory may be provided to the user  or may be accessible to the user at , e.g. via a website  associated with the institution system . The home inventory may be provided to the user  listed by subject matter (e.g., jewelry, electronics, etc.), by room in the house (e.g., living room, dining room, etc.), or by any other characteristic(s) or user-selectable criteria.","At , the user  may revise the home inventory, e.g., by making additions, deletions, or other changes, and may add notes to the home inventory, such as notes pertaining to the items on the list of items in the home inventory. The user  may also indicate the location (e.g., the room of the house) of one or more items. The institution system  may store the revisions and\/or the revised home inventory at .","In an implementation, the user  may be provided with a list of their items using the data provided to the institution system  and can choose which items are to be included in the home inventory and which items are to be added to an insurance policy.","Based on a variety of factors pertaining to the item and\/or the user, at , the institution system  may generate a premium quote to insure one or more items on the home inventory (e.g., by adding the item(s) to a rider to an existing homeowner's or renter's insurance policy or by issuing a new or revised insurance policy to cover the item(s)) and send the premium quote to the user  via any electronic or physical delivery technique(s). For generation of the premium quote, the institution system  may request and receive additional information pertaining to the user  and\/or the item(s) from the user , the merchant , an appraiser, and\/or the manufacturer of the item(s), for example. The premium quote may be for monetary reimbursement, replacement, or repair of the item(s) in the event of a loss. The user  may accept the premium quote at , and the institution system  may insure the item(s) at .","In an implementation, the user  may choose to opt out so that information about the item(s) purchased will not be provided to the user  for a home inventory and\/or insurance because the purchase may be a gift for someone or the user  may not want another person to learn about the purchase. In an implementation, the user  may choose a notification mode (e.g., by email, by phone, by mail, etc.) and notification time and may choose the items they are to be notified about (or not notified about) with respect to a home inventory and\/or insurance.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","185","189","185","189","105","320","330","105"]},"In an implementation, the institution system  may have access to the transaction data because of a relationship the institution system  has with the financial card issuer . Alternatively or additionally, the institution system  may scrape the transaction data from a website associated with the financial card , provided the institution system  has the appropriate credentials and\/or authorization, e.g., provided by the user , the financial card issuer , etc.","From time to time, such as periodically (e.g., the first day of each month, the closing date of the financial card billing cycle, etc.), the institution system  may analyze the transaction data associated with the purchases during the period of time against one or more predetermined criteria, and generate a list of the purchases made with the financial card  that meet the predetermined criteria. The list may be provided to the user . A request may be provided to the user  to indicate if they would like to add the item(s) associated with any of the purchases to a home inventory and if they would like to obtain insurance coverage on the item(s) associated with any of the purchases on the list. The user  may indicate which, if any, of the purchases on the list have one or more associated items that they would like to insure. The user  may provide the indication to the institution system  electronically or physically.","At , the institution system  may analyze the transaction data associated with the purchase against one or more predetermined criteria. If the predetermined criteria are met, then the institution system  may contact the user  at  and ask the user  if they would like to add the items to an inventory and\/or if they would like insurance coverage on the item(s) associated with the purchase e.g., by adding the item(s) to an existing insurance policy or purchasing a new insurance policy for the item(s). The institution system  may contact the user  via a website, facsimile, phone, email, instant message, text message, web chat, and the like. The user  may accept or decline the offer to add the items to an inventory and\/or insure the item(s). Upon the user  accepting, the institution system  may add the item(s) to an inventory and\/or existing insurance policy of the user  or a new insurance policy at .","At some point, in an implementation, at , the user  may provide one or more photos of the item(s) and\/or documentation pertaining to the item(s) to the institution system  to provide further evidence or information about the item(s) to the institution system .
