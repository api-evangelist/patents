No. 11\/677,029 filed Feb. 20, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,750,116, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/774,446, filed Feb. 18, 2006; the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","This application includes a sequence listing as a text file, named 1000-00912US_ST25 created Apr. 19, 2010. The material contained in this text file is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.","Among the barriers to successful cancer therapy is the development of drug resistance by tumors. Drug resistance can be mediated by many mechanisms. Of the cell-based mechanisms, ATP-driven xenobiotic efflux of drugs is mediated by P-glycoprotein (also referred to herein as \u201cP-gp\u201d), the product of the mdrl gene. P-gp is found on a variety of normal tissues, including endothelium and biliary duct cells. P-gp is a member of a large family of ATP-binding cassette proteins, many of which are responsible for removal of toxic substances to the extracellular space.","P-gp recognizes and removes molecules which share characteristics including hydrophobic structures and large ring systems. Many drugs used in the treatment of cancer are P-gp substrates. Thus, one mechanism of cell-based resistance is drug export by P-gp. Such resistance can be conferred by mutation of P-gp to increase the affinity of P-gp for the drug molecule, by increasing the rate of transporter function, and\/or by increasing the number of P-gp transporters per cell. The latter mechanism is most often mediated by gene amplification. To overcome P-gp mediated resistance, inhibitors of P-gp can be used. However, the efficacy of such inhibitors can be limited due to mutation of the P-gp transporter and\/or gene amplification resulting in increased wild-type or mutant P-gp transporters at the cell surface. Administration of P-gp inhibitors also can be associated with toxicity in patients.","Therefore, the development of drugs that can circumvent P-gp-mediated drug resistance could have significant clinical benefit.","The present invention provides methods of treating a patient that has a drug resistant cancer, such as a tumor, hematologic disease or cell proliferative disorder. In one aspect, a method is provided for treating drug-resistant cancer cells in a patient in need of such treatment. The method includes evaluating whether the patient has a drug-resistant cancer, and if the patient has a drug-resistant cancer, administering to the patient an effective amount of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate of the formula:\n\nL-(LU-D)\u2003\u2003I\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof","wherein,","L- is a Ligand unit;","LU is a Linker unit;","p is an integer from 1 to about 20; and","-D is a Drug unit.","The patient can be monitored to determine the status of the cancer following administration of the Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate. In some embodiments, the Drug unit is MMAF or a cytotoxic derivative thereof, wherein the Drug unit kills or inhibits the proliferation of the cancer cells.","The Ligand unit can be an antibody or a non-antibody molecule. Suitable antibodies include, for example, monoclonal antibodies, such as chimeric, humanized or human antibodies or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit comprises an antigen-binding region that binds to a target antigen. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is an antibody or antibody fragment such as AC10, BR96, 1F6 or 2F2. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a humanized or chimeric derivative of an antibody such as AC10, BR96, 1F6 or 2F2. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is a growth inhibitory antibody.","In some embodiments, the Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate induces cell death. In some embodiments, the Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate induces apoptosis.","In some embodiments, about 2 to about 8 Linker-Drug units are conjugated to the Ligand unit. In other embodiments, 2 to 6 or 2 to 4 Linker-Drug units are conjugated to the Ligand unit.","In some embodiments, the Linker unit has the formula:\n\n-A-W\u2014Y\u2014\n","wherein:","-A- is a Stretcher unit;","a is 0 or 1;","each \u2014W\u2014 is independently an Amino Acid unit;","w is independently an integer ranging from 0 to 12;","\u2014Y\u2014 is a Spacer unit; and","y is 0, 1 or 2.","The number of Amino Acid units, w, can be, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12, and the like.

In some embodiments, the cancer is a solid tumor. In some embodiments, the cancer is a hematological cancer. In some embodiments, the cancer is a cell proliferative disorder. In some embodiments, the cancer is breast, ovarian, stomach, endometrial, salivary gland, lung, kidney, colon, colorectal, thyroid, pancreatic, prostate or bladder cancer. In some embodiments, cells of a cancer, a tumor or a cell proliferative disorder are contacted with a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate.","The present invention provides methods of treating a patient that has a relapsed or refractory cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor. The invention is based on the surprising and unexpected discovery that certain auristatins are effective for treating drug resistant cancers, cell proliferative disorder and tumors. (Unless otherwise indicated by context, the term cancer, as used herein, refers to cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor. Similarly, cancer cells refer to cells of a cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor, unless otherwise indicated by context.) The auristatin derivatives accumulate in drug resistant cells. As used herein, a \u201cdrug resistant\u201d or \u201crefractory\u201d cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor refers to a refractory cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor which cells exhibit reduced cytotoxicity to a drug that is a substrate for the MDR1 (P-glycoprotein or P-gp) transporter enzyme due to P-gp expression or overexpression, as compared to a comparable, sensitive cells.","Also provided are methods of treating refractory cancer cells in a patient in need of such treatment (e.g., a mammal such as a human) by administering an effective amount of an auristatin. As used herein, \u201crefractory\u201d cancer cells and \u201cdrug resistant\u201d cancer cells refer to cells that have elevated levels of P-gp transport enzymes on the cell surface, that are determined to express elevated levels of P-gp enzyme by standard methods, and\/or that exhibit reduced cytotoxicity to drugs that are substrates for MDR1 (P-gp), as compared with equivalent cancer cells otherwise typically deemed sensitive to such drugs. Examples of refractory cancer cells which may be treated include, but are not limited to, adenocarcinoma cells derived from adrenal, kidney, liver, small intestine, and colon tissue; pancreatic cancer cells, carcinoid cells, chronic myelogenous leukemia cells in blast crisis, non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, neuroblastoma cells, pheochromocytoma cells, multiple myeloma cells, adult acute lymphocytic leukemia cells, adult acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cells, nodular poorly differentiated lymphoma cells, ocular melanoma cells, skin melanoma cells, uterine melanoma cells, breast cancer cells and ovarian cancer cells, and metastatic cells (see also infra).","In some embodiments, the auristatin derivative is MMAF (N-methylvaline-valine-dolaisoleuine-dolaproine-phenylalanine) or a derivative thereof. MMAF can be as potent against drug-resistant cell lines as against the parental strains. This difference in potency is due to the zwitterionic charge on MMAF. The charged nature of MMAF allows it to escape recognition and transport by the efflux transporter P-gp and allow it to remain in the cell. Therefore, MMAF and zwitterionic derivatives thereof accumulate to higher intracellular concentrations and result in cell death. In one aspect, the drug is not a good substrate for P-gp. In another aspect, the drug is a poor substrate for P-gp.","In one aspect, a method of treating drug-resistant cancer cells is provided. In one embodiment, the method comprises administering to a patient an effective amount of MMAF or a derivative thereof to the patient having drug-resistant cancer cells. The drug is typically administered as a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate or a Drug-Linker conjugate. In some embodiments, the conjugate is an antibody or antibody fragment drug conjugate.","In another embodiment, the method includes (a) evaluating the patient to determine if the patient has a refractory or drug resistant cancer; (b) administering an effective amount of MMAF or a derivative thereof to the patient; and (c) monitoring the patient to determine the status of the cancer. The drug is typically administered as a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate or a Drug-Linker conjugate, such as an antibody drug conjugate.","In one aspect, a Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugate is provided having Formula I:\n\nL-(LU-D)\u2003\u2003I\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof","wherein,","L- is a Ligand unit;","LU is a Linker unit;","p is an integer from 1 to about 20; and","-D is a Drug unit having the Formula D:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0141","num":"0140"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00014","num":"00014"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00014","he":"24.05mm","wi":"114.64mm","file":"US08512707-20130820-C00014.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein, independently at each location:","Ris selected from H and C-Calkyl;","Ris selected from H, C-Calkyl, C-Ccarbocycle, aryl, C-Calkyl-aryl, C-Calkyl-(C-Ccarbocycle), C-Cheterocycle and C-Calkyl-(C-Cheterocycle);","Ris selected from H, C-Calkyl, C-Ccarbocycle, aryl, C-Calkyl-aryl, C-Calkyl-(C-Ccarbocycle), C-Cheterocycle and C-Calkyl-(C-Cheterocycle);","Ris selected from H and methyl;","or Rand Rjointly form a carbocyclic ring and have the formula \u2014(CRR)\u2014 wherein Rand Rare independently selected from H, C-Calkyl and C-Ccarbocycle and n1 is selected from 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6;","Ris selected from H and C-Calkyl;","Ris selected from H, C-Calkyl, C-Ccarbocycle, aryl, C-Calkyl-aryl, C-Calkyl-(C-Ccarbocycle), C-Cheterocycle and C-Calkyl-(C-Cheterocycle);","each Ris independently selected from H, OH, C-Calkyl, C-Ccarbocycle and O\u2014(C-Calkyl);","Ris selected from H and C-Calkyl;","Ris selected from aryl and C-Cheterocycle;","Z is O;","Ris selected from H or Me","wherein the Linker unit can be present or absent.","In some embodiments, the Drug unit has a zwitterionic charge, or is metabolized inside the cell to form a zwitterionic compound.","In another aspect, a Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugate is provided having Formula IIa:\n\nL-(LU-D)\u2003\u2003IIa\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof,","wherein,","L- is a Ligand unit;","LU is a Linker unit;","p is an integer from 1 to about 20; and","-D is a Drug unit having the Formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0164","num":"0163"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00015","num":"00015"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00015","he":"32.77mm","wi":"109.73mm","file":"US08512707-20130820-C00015.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein R\u2550H or Me; and","wherein the Linker unit can be present or absent.","In some embodiments, the Drug unit has a zwitterionic charge, or is metabolized inside the cell to form a zwitterionic compound.","In another aspect, a Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugate is provided having Formula IIb:\n\nL-(LU-D)\u2003\u2003IIb\n","or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof,","wherein,","L- is a Ligand unit;","LU is a Linker unit;","p is an integer from 1 to about 20; and","-D is a Drug unit having the Formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0175","num":"0174"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00016","num":"00016"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00016","he":"25.40mm","wi":"111.34mm","file":"US08512707-20130820-C00016.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein the Linker unit can be present or absent.","In any of the above examples, the drug loading is represented by p, the average number of drug molecules per Ligand unit (e.g., an antibody drug conjugate or ADC). Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drugs (D) per Ligand unit (e.g., an antibody). In some embodiments, p is 2, 4, 6 or 8. The average number of drugs per Ligand unit in preparation of conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy, ELISA assay, and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate or a Drug-Linker conjugate in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances, separation, purification, and characterization of homogeneous Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates or Drug-Linker conjugates, where p is a certain value from Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates with other drug loadings, may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.","For some Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates, where the Ligand unit is an antibody or antibody fragment, p is determined by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example, where the attachment is a cysteine thiol, as in the exemplary embodiments above, an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups, or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. In some embodiments, p is 2, 4, 6 or 8.","Typically, fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain, for example, many lysine residues that do not react with the drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine-reactive linker reagent. Generally, antibodies do not contain many, if any, free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds of the invention exist as disulfide bridges (e.g., interchain or intrachain) and can be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol (DTT). Additionally, the antibody can be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading (drug\/antibody ratio) of an ADC\u2032 may be controlled in several different manners, including: (i) limiting the molar excess of drug-linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody, (ii) limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature, and (iii) partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.","It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug-linker intermediate, or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent, then the resulting product is a mixture of Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to a Ligand. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by dual ELISA antibody assay, specific for a Ligand and specific for the drug. Individual Drug-Linker-Ligand molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy, and separated by HPLC, e.g., hydrophobic interaction chromatography (\u201cEffect of drug loading on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of an anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate\u201d, Hamblett et al, Abstract No. 624, American Association for Cancer Research, 2004, Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, Volume 45, March 2004; and \u201cControlling the Location of Drug Attachment in Antibody-Drug Conjugates\u201d, Alley et al, Abstract No. 627, American Association for Cancer Research; 2004 Annual Meeting, Mar. 27-31, 2004, Proceedings of the AACR, Volume 45, March 2004). Thus, a homogeneous Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.","The Ligand unit (L-) includes within its scope any unit of a Ligand (L) that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor, antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target-cell population. In one aspect, the Ligand unit acts to deliver the Drug unit to the particular target cell population with which the Ligand unit reacts. Such Ligands include, but are not limited to, large molecular weight proteins such as, for example, full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, smaller molecular weight proteins, polypeptide or peptides, lectins, glycoproteins, non-peptides, vitamins, nutrient-transport molecules (such as, but not limited to, transferrin), or any other cell binding molecule or substance.","A Ligand unit can form a bond to a Linker unit (e.g., a Stretcher unit, an Amino Acid unit, and\/or a Spacer Unit) or to a Drug Unit. For example, a Ligand unit can form a bond to a Linker unit via a heteroatom of the Ligand. Heteroatoms that may be present on a Ligand unit include, for example, sulfur (e.g., from a sulfhydryl group of a Ligand), oxygen (e.g., from a carbonyl, carboxyl or hydroxyl group of a Ligand) and nitrogen (e.g., from a primary or secondary amino group of a Ligand). These heteroatoms can be present on the Ligand in the Ligand's natural state, for example a naturally-occurring antibody, or can be introduced into the Ligand via chemical modification.","In one embodiment, a Ligand unit has a sulfhydryl group and the Ligand unit bonds to the Linker unit via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom.","In yet another aspect, the Ligand unit has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The Ligand unit bonds to the Linker unit via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl S-acetylthioacetate (SATA) and 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride (Traut's Reagent).","In another embodiment, the Ligand unit can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The Ligand unit bonds to the Linker Unit, such as a Stretcher Unit, via the sulfhydryl group's sulfur atom.","In yet another embodiment, the Ligand unit can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be oxidized to provide an aldehyde (\u2014CHO) group (see, e.g., Laguzza et al., 1989, J. Med. Chem. 32(3):548-55). The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a reactive site on a Stretcher. Reactive sites on a Stretcher that can react with a carbonyl group on a Ligand unit include, but are not limited to, hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Other protocols for the modification of proteins for the attachment or association of Drug units are described in Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Protein Science, vol. 2, John Wiley & Sons (2002), incorporated herein by reference.","In yet other embodiments, the Ligand unit can be linked to a Linker unit or a Drug unit at an amino and\/or carboxy terminus.","Useful non-immunoreactive protein, polypeptide, or peptide Ligands include, but are not limited to, transferrin, epidermal growth factors (\u201cEGF\u201d), bombesin, gastrin, gastrin-releasing peptide, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-2, IL-6, transforming growth factors (\u201cTGF\u201d), such as TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2, vaccinia growth factor (\u201cVGF\u201d), insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.","In some embodiments, the Ligand unit is an antibody or antibody fragment. Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to a target antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). For example, for the production of polyclonal antibodies, various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof, including, but not limited to, rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species, including, but not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete) adjuvant, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanins, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (bacille Calmette-Guerin) and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.","Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant of a target antigen (e.g., a cancer cell antigen, a protein, a peptide, a carbohydrate, a chemical, nucleic acid, or fragments thereof). A monoclonal antibody (mAb) to a target antigen can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally described by K\u00f6hler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256, 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4: 72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al., 1985, Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Monoclonal antibodies also can be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991, Nature 352:624-628) and Marks et al. (1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581-597), for example. The antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class, including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, and IgD, and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.","Useful monoclonal antibodies include, but are not limited to, human monoclonal antibodies, humanized monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, or chimeric (e.g., human-mouse or other species) monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art (see, e.g., Teng et al., 1983, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80, 7308-7312; Kozbor et al., 1983, Immunology Today 4, 72-79; and Olsson et al., 1982, Meth. Enzymol. 92, 3-16).","The antibody can also be a multispecific antibody, such as a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Milstein et al., 1983, Nature 305:537-539). Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, these hybridomas (quadromas) produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules. Procedures are disclosed in International Publication No. WO 93\/08829, and in Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10:3655-3659 (1991).","According to a different approach, antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities (antibody-antigen combining sites) are fused to an immunoglobulin constant domain sequence(s). The fusion can be with one or more immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domains (e.g., hinge, C1, C2, C3, and\/or C4 regions), or at least part of the hinge, C2, C3, and\/or C4 regions. In some embodiments, the first heavy-chain constant region (C1) containing the site necessary for light chain binding is present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and, if desired, the immunoglobulin light chain, are inserted into separate expression vectors, and are co-transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is, however, possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.","In an embodiment of this approach, the bispecific antibodies have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm, and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pair (providing a second binding specificity) in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations, as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation (e.g., International Publication No. WO 94\/04690; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","For further details for generating bispecific antibodies see, for example, Suresh et al., 1986, Methods in Enzymology 121:210; Rodrigues et al., 1993, J. Immunology 151:6954-6961; Carter et al., 1992, Bio\/Technology 10:163-167; Carter et al., 1995, J. Hematotherapy 4:463-470; and Merchant et al., 1998, Nature Biotechnology 16:677-681. Using such techniques, bispecific antibodies can be prepared for use in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.","Bifunctional antibodies are also described in European Patent Publication No. EP 0 105 360. As disclosed in this reference, hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically, i.e., by cell fusion techniques, or chemically, especially with cross-linking agents or disulfide-bridge forming reagents, and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof. Methods for obtaining such hybrid antibodies are disclosed for example, in International Publication WO 83\/03679, and European Patent Publication No. EP 0 217 577, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.","Additionally, recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies, comprising both human and non-human portions, which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques, are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species, such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. (See, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Boss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.) Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. (See, e.g., Queen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art, for example using methods described in International Publication No. WO 87\/02671; European Patent Publication No. 0 184 187; European Patent Publication No. 0 171 496; European Patent Publication No. 173 494; International Publication No. WO 86\/01533; U.S. Pat.

Immunol. 141:4053-4060; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable and can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes, but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a target polypeptide. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar (1995, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93). For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,569,825; 5,661,016; and 5,545,806; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from, for example, Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.).","Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as \u201cguided selection.\u201d In this approach a selected non-human monoclonal antibody, e.g., a mouse antibody, is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. See, e.g., Jespers et al., 1994, Biotechnology 12:899-903. Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art, including phage display libraries (see, e.g., Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol. 222:581; Quan, M. P. and Carter, P., 2002, \u201cThe rise of monoclonal antibodies as therapeutics,\u201d In Anti-IgE and Allergic Disease, Jardieu, P. M. and Fick Jr., R. B, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y., Chapter 20, pp. 427-469).","The antibody can be a functionally active fragment, derivative or analog (as further discussed infra) of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a cancer cell antigen, or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard, \u201cfunctionally active\u201d means that the fragment, derivative or analog is able to elicit anti-anti-idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment, derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically, in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C-terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen, synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art (e.g., the BIA core assay) (see, e.g., Kabat et al., 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md.; Kabat E et al., 1980, J. Immunology 125(3):961-969).","In some embodiments, the antibody fragment is an Fv, Fab, Fab\u2032 or an F(ab\u2032). Other useful antibodies are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies, single chain antibodies (SCAs) (e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778; Bird, 1988, Science 242:423-42; Huston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; and Ward et al., 1989, Nature 334:544-54), a minibody, a diabody, a triabody, a tetrabody, a dsFv, an sc-Fv-Fc, an (scFv), a fragment produced by a Fab expression library, an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody, or multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s).","In other embodiments, the antibody is a fusion protein of an antibody, or a functionally active fragment thereof, for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond (e.g., a peptide bond), at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein (or portion thereof, preferably at least 10, 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein) that is not the antibody. Preferably, the antibody or fragment thereof is covalently linked to the other protein at the C-terminus of the constant domain.","Antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example, but not by way of limitation, the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified, e.g., by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting\/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein, etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques, including, but not limited to, specific chemical cleavage, acetylation, formylation, metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin, etc. Additionally, the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.","The antibodies can have modifications (e.g., substitutions, deletions or additions) in amino acid residues that interact with Fc receptors. In particular, the antibodies can have modifications in amino acid residues identified as involved in the interaction between the anti-Fc domain and the FcRn receptor (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 97\/34631, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).","Antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. The nucleotide sequence encoding antibodies immunospecific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained, e.g., from the GenBank database or a database like, in literature publications, or by routine cloning and sequencing.","Antibodies that may be useful in the treatment of cancer include, but are not limited to, antibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAA), such as an antigen expressed on a cancer cell, a cell of a cell proliferative disorder or a tumor cell. Tumor-associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non-cancerous cells. Such tumor-associated antigens are known in the art, and can be prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art.","Virtually any target protein can be targeted by an antibody, including any target protein which expression is correlated with expression on cells of a cancer, cell proliferative disorder or tumor.

Such peptide bonds can be prepared, for example, according to the liquid phase synthesis method (see E. Schr\u00f6der and K. L\u00fcbke, \u201cThe Peptides\u201d, volume 1, pp 76-136, 1965, Academic Press) that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. General methods for preparing auristatins are described in the following: U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,483; U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,588; Pettit et al., 1989, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111:5463-5465; Pettit et al., 1998, Anti-Cancer Drug Design 13:243-277; and Pettit et al., 1996, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5:859-863. More specifically, MMAF and its derivatives can be synthesized as described in International Patent Publication WO2005081711 (the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein).","Methods of determining whether an agent exerts a cytostatic or cytotoxic effect on a cell are known. Illustrative examples of such methods for Drug-Linker-Ligand Conjugate(s) such as an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) are described infra. Generally, the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of an ADC can be measured by: exposing mammalian cells expressing a target protein of the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium; culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days; and measuring cell viability. Cell-based in vitro assays can be used to measure viability (proliferation), cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis (caspase activation) of the ADC of the invention.","For determining whether an ADC exerts a cytostatic effect, a thymidine incorporation assay may be used. For example, cancer cells expressing a target antigen at a density of 5,000 cells\/well of a 96-well plated can be cultured for a 72-hour period and exposed to 0.5 \u03bcCi of H-thymidine during the final 8 hours of the 72-hour period. The incorporation of H-thymidine into cells of the culture is measured in the presence and absence of the ADC.","For determining cytotoxicity, necrosis or apoptosis (programmed cell death) can be measured. Necrosis is typically accompanied by increased permeability of the plasma membrane; swelling of the cell, and rupture of the plasma membrane. Apoptosis is typically characterized by membrane blebbing, condensation of cytoplasm, and the activation of endogenous endonucleases. Determination of any of these effects on cancer cells indicates that an ADC is useful in the treatment of cancers.","Cell viability can be measured by determining in a cell the uptake of a dye such as neutral red, trypan blue, or ALAMAR\u2122 blue (see, e.g., Page et al., 1993, Intl. J. Oncology 3:473-476). In such an assay, the cells are incubated in media containing the dye, the cells are washed, and the remaining dye, reflecting cellular uptake of the dye, is measured spectrophotometrically. The protein-binding dye sulforhodamine B (SRB) can also be used to measure cytoxicity (Skehan et al., 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:1107-12).","Alternatively, a tetrazolium salt, such as MTT, is used in a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation by detecting living, but not dead, cells (see, e.g., Mosmann, 1983, J. Immunol. Methods 65:55-63).","Apoptosis can be quantitated by measuring, for example, DNA fragmentation. Commercial photometric methods for the quantitative in vitro determination of DNA fragmentation are available. Examples of such assays, including TUNEL (which detects incorporation of labeled nucleotides in fragmented DNA) and ELISA-based assays, are described in Biochemica, 1999, no. 2, pp. 34-37 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).","Apoptosis can also be determined by measuring morphological changes in a cell. For example, as with necrosis, loss of plasma membrane integrity can be determined by measuring uptake of certain dyes (e.g., a fluorescent dye such as, for example, acridine orange or ethidium bromide). A method for measuring apoptotic cell number has been described by Duke and Cohen, Current Protocols in Immunology (Coligan et al. eds., 1992, pp. 3.17.1-3.17.16). Cells also can be labeled with a DNA dye (e.g., acridine orange, ethidium bromide, or propidium iodide) and the cells observed for chromatin condensation and margination along the inner nuclear membrane. Other morphological changes that can be measured to determine apoptosis include, e.g., cytoplasmic condensation, increased membrane blebbing, and cellular shrinkage.","The presence of apoptotic cells can be measured in both the attached and \u201cfloating\u201d compartments of the cultures. For example, both compartments can be collected by removing the supernatant, trypsinizing the attached cells, combining the preparations following a centrifugation wash step (e.g., 10 minutes at 2000 rpm), and detecting apoptosis (e.g., by measuring DNA fragmentation). (See, e.g., Piazza et al., 1995, Cancer Research 55:3110-16.)","The effects of ADCs can be tested or validated in animal models. A number of established animal models of cancers are known to the skilled artisan, any of which can be used to assay the efficacy of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate, such as an ADC. Non-limiting examples of such models are described infra. Moreover, small animal models to examine the in vivo efficacies of ADCs can be created by implanting human tumor cell lines into appropriate immunodeficient rodent strains, e.g., athymic nude mice or SCID mice.","In another aspect, compositions are provided that include an effective amount of a Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate(s) or a Drug-Linker conjugate(s), with or without a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. For convenience, the Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugate or a Drug-Linker conjugate can be referred to as a Conjugate. The compositions are suitable for veterinary or human administration.","The compositions can be in any form that allows for the composition to be administered to a patient. For example, the composition can be in the form of a liquid or solid. Typical routes of administration include, without limitation, oral, topical, parenteral, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, ocular, and intra-tumor. Parenteral administration includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In one aspect, the compositions are administered parenterally. In yet another aspect, the compositions are administered intravenously.","Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated so as to allow the Conjugate to be bioavailable upon administration of the composition to a patient. Compositions can take the form of one or more dosage units, where for example, a tablet can be a single dosage unit, and a container of a Conjugate in aerosol form can hold a plurality of dosage units.","Materials used in preparing the pharmaceutical compositions can be non-toxic in the amounts used. It will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art that the optimal dosage of the active ingredient(s) in the pharmaceutical composition will depend on a variety of factors. Relevant factors include, without limitation, the type of animal (e.g., human), the particular form of the Conjugate, the manner of administration, and the composition employed.","The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle can be particulate, so that the compositions are, for example, in tablet or powder form. The carrier(s) can be liquid, with the compositions being, for example, an oral syrup or injectable liquid.","When intended for oral administration, the composition is preferably in solid or liquid form, where semi-solid, semi-liquid, suspension and gel forms are included within the forms considered herein as either solid or liquid.","As a solid composition for oral administration, the composition can be formulated into a powder, granule, compressed tablet, pill, capsule, chewing gum, wafer or the like form. Such a solid composition typically contains one or more inert diluents. In addition, one or more of the following can be present: binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, or gelatin; excipients such as starch, lactose or dextrins, disintegrating agents such as alginic acid, sodium alginate, Primogel, corn starch and the like; lubricants such as magnesium stearate or Sterotex; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin, a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate or orange flavoring, and a coloring agent.","When the composition is in the form of a capsule, e.g., a gelatin capsule, it can contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as polyethylene glycol, cyclodextrin or a fatty oil.","The composition can be in the form of a liquid, e.g., an elixir, syrup, solution, emulsion or suspension. In a composition for administration by injection, one or more of a surfactant, preservative, wetting agent, dispersing agent, suspending agent, buffer, stabilizer and isotonic agent can also be included. The liquid can be useful for oral administration or for delivery by injection. When intended for oral administration, a composition can comprise one or more of a sweetening agent, preservatives, dye\/colorant and flavor enhancer.","The liquid compositions, whether they are solutions, suspensions or other like form, can also include one or more of the following: sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, such as physiological saline, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride, fixed oils such as synthetic mono or digylcerides which can serve as the solvent or suspending medium, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, cyclodextrin, propylene glycol or other solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl paraben; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, amino acids, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. A parenteral composition can be enclosed in ampoule, a disposable syringe or a multiple-dose vial made of glass, plastic or other material. Physiological saline is an exemplary adjuvant. An injectable composition is preferably sterile.","The amount of the Conjugate that is effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the compositions will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances.","The compositions comprise an effective amount of a Conjugate such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Typically, this amount is at least about 0.01% of a Conjugate by weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the compositions are prepared so that a parenteral dosage unit contains from about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the Conjugate. When intended for oral administration, this amount can be varied to range from about 0.1% to about 80% by weight of the composition. In one aspect, oral compositions can comprise from about 4% to about 50% of the Conjugate by weight of the composition.","Generally, the dosage of a Conjugate administered to a patient is typically about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 2000 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight. In one embodiment, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.01 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight; in another embodiment, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 250 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight. In yet another embodiment, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 20 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight. In other embodiments, the dosage administered is between about 0.1 mg'kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg or about 1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight.","For intravenous administration, the composition can comprise from about 0.01 to about 100 mg of a Conjugate per kg of the animal's body weight. In one aspect, the composition can include from about 1 to about 100 mg of the Conjugate per kg of the animal's body weight. In some embodiments, the amount administered will be in the range from about 0.1 to about 25 mg\/kg of body weight of the Conjugate. In yet another embodiment, the dosage administered to a patient is between about 0.1 mg\/kg and about 20 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight. In other embodiments, the dosage administered is between about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 20 mg\/kg, about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 1 mg\/kg to about 15 mg\/kg, about 0.1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg, about 0.5 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg or about 1 mg\/kg to about 10 mg\/kg of the animal's body weight.","The Conjugates or compositions can be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.). Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a Conjugate or composition. In certain embodiments, more than one Conjugate or composition is administered to a patient.","In specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer one or more Conjugates or compositions locally to the area in need of treatment. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery; topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery; by injection; by means of a catheter; by means of a suppository; or by means of an implant, the implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of a cancer, tumor or neoplastic or pre-neoplastic tissue. In another embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of manifestation of disease.","In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce one or more Conjugates or compositions into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.","In yet another embodiment, the Conjugates or compositions can be delivered in a controlled release system, such as, but not limited to, a pump or various polymeric materials. In yet another embodiment, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of the Conjugates or compositions, e.g., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled-release systems discussed in the review by Langer (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990)) can be used.","The term \u201ccarrier\u201d refers to a diluent, adjuvant or excipient, with which a Conjugate is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water, including aqueous solutions, and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The carriers can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, when administered to a patient, the Conjugate or compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is an exemplary carrier when the Conjugates are administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.","In an embodiment, the Conjugates are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to animals, particularly human beings. Typically, the carriers or vehicles for intravenous administration are sterile isotonic aqueous buffer solutions. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally comprise a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Conjugate is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the Conjugate is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.","Whether in solid or liquid form, the compositions can include a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of cancer, an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease.","The Drug-Linker-Ligand conjugates are useful for treating cancer, in particular, drug resistant or refractory cancers, in a patient. In some embodiments, the patient has a refractory or drug-resistant cancer, where the patient has failed at least one prior treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent.","In some embodiments, drug resistance can be determined by obtaining a sample from a patient and determining P-gp protein and\/mRNA levels. See, e.g., Zhan et al., 1997, Blood. 89(10):3795-800. In other embodiments, P-gp levels can be determined using a fluorescent dye or radioactive label(s). See, e.g., Homolya et al., 1993, J. Biol.

In some embodiments, the Ligand unit binds to the tumor cell, cancer cell, or a cell of a cell proliferative disorder, wherein the Ligand unit binds to a target protein expressed on the cell. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit binds to a tumor cell antigen, a cancer cell antigen or an antigen of a cell proliferative disorder, which is on the surface of the cell, wherein the Ligand unit binds to a target protein expressed on the cell. In some embodiments, the Ligand unit binds to a tumor cell antigen, a cancer cell antigen or an antigen of a cell of cell proliferative disorder, which is an extracellular matrix protein associated with the cell, wherein the Ligand unit binds to a target protein expressed on the cell. In other embodiments, the Ligand unit binds to an antigen of bystander cell, wherein the bystander cell is associated with the cancer, tumor or cell proliferative disorder.","The specificity of the Ligand unit for a particular tumor cell or cancer cell can be useful for determining those tumors or cancers that are most effectively treated. For example, conjugates having a BR96 Ligand unit can be useful for treating antigen positive carcinomas including those of the lung, breast, colon, ovaries, and pancreas. Conjugates having an anti-CD30 or an anti-CD20 Ligand unit can be useful for treating hematologic malignancies.","Other particular types of cancers that can be treated include, but are not limited to, refractory or drug resistant forms of carcinomas, lymphomas, blastomas, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphoid malignancies, and other cancers, cell proliferative disorders and tumors.

general toxicity of these compounds. In some embodiments, the Linker units can stabilize the Conjugates in blood, yet are cleavable by cancer-specific, tumor-specific or cell proliferative disorder-specific proteases within the cell, thereby liberating the Drug intracellularly.","In some embodiments, methods for treating refractory cancers are provided that include administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a Conjugate (e.g., a Drug-Linker-Ligand unit or a Drug-Linker unit) and a chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the chemotherapeutic agent is that to which treatment of the cancer has not been found to be refractory. In another embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent is that to which the treatment of cancer has been found to be refractory. The Conjugates can be administered to a patient who has also undergone surgery as treatment for the cancer. In one embodiment, the additional method of treatment is radiation therapy.","In a specific embodiment, the Conjugate is administered concurrently with the chemotherapeutic agent or with radiation therapy. In another specific embodiment, the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation therapy is administered prior or subsequent to administration of a Conjugate, in one aspect at least an hour, five hours, 12 hours, a day, a week, a month, in further aspects several months (e.g., up to three months), prior or subsequent to administration of a Conjugate.","A chemotherapeutic agent can be administered over a series of sessions. Any one or a combination of the chemotherapeutic agents listed below can be administered. With respect to radiation, any radiation therapy protocol can be used depending upon the type of cancer to be treated. For example, but not by way of limitation, x-ray radiation can be administered; in particular, high-energy megavoltage (radiation of greater that 1 MeV energy) can be used for deep tumors, and electron beam and orthovoltage x-ray radiation can be used for skin cancers. Gamma-ray emitting radioisotopes, such as radioactive isotopes of radium, cobalt and other elements, can also be administered.","Additionally, methods of treatment of cancer with a Conjugate are provided as an alternative to chemotherapy or radiation therapy where the chemotherapy or the radiation therapy has proven or can prove too toxic, e.g., results in unacceptable or unbearable side effects, for the patient being treated. The patient being treated can, optionally, be treated with another cancer treatment such as surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy, depending on which treatment is found to be acceptable or bearable.","The Conjugates also can be used in an in vitro or ex vivo fashion, such as for the treatment of certain cancers, including, but not limited to, leukemias and lymphomas, such treatment involving autologous stem cell transplants. This can involve a multi-step process in which the animal's autologous hematopoietic stem cells are harvested and purged of cancer cells, the animal's remaining bone-marrow cell population is then eradicated via the administration of a high dose of a Conjugate with or without accompanying high dose radiation therapy, and the stem cell graft is infused back into the animal. Supportive care is then provided while bone marrow function is restored and the animal recovers.","Methods for treating drug resistant cancer include administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a Conjugate and optionally another therapeutic agent that is an anti-cancer agent. Suitable anticancer agents include, but are not limited to, methotrexate, taxol, L-asparaginase, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, hydroxyurea, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, nitrosoureas, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitomycin C, dacarbazine, procarbizine, topotecan, nitrogen mustards, cytoxan, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, doxifluridine, and ratitrexed, BCNU, irinotecan, a camptothecin, bleomycin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, daunorubicin, dactinomycin, plicamycin, mitoxantrone, asparaginase, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel.","In one aspect, the anti-cancer agent includes, but is not limited to, one or more of the following drugs.","Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and CYTOXAN\u00ae cyclosphosphamide; alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan, improsulfan, piposulfan and treosulfan; decarbazine; aziridines such as benzodopa, carboquone, meturedopa, and uredopa; ethylenimines and methylamelamines including altretamine, triethylenemelamine, trietylenephosphoramide, triethiylenethiophosphoramide and trimethylolomelamine; TLK 286 (TELCYTA\u2122); acetogenins (especially bullatacin and bullatacinone); delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol, MARINOL\u00ae); beta-lapachone; lapachol; colchicines; betulinic acid; a camptothecin (including the synthetic analogue topotecan (HYCAMTIN\u00ae), CPT-11 (irinotecan, CAMPTOSAR\u00ae), acetylcamptothecin, scopolectin, and 9-aminocamptothecin); bryostatin; callystatin; CC-1065 (including its adozelesin, carzelesin and bizelesin synthetic analogues); podophyllotoxin; podophyllinic acid; teniposide; cryptophycins (particularly cryptophycin 1 and cryptophycin 8); a dolastatin; duocarmycin (including the synthetic analogues, KW-2189 and CB1-TM1); eleutherobin; pancratistatin; a sarcodictyin; spongistatin; nitrogen mustards such as chlorambucil, chlornaphazine, cholophosphamide, estramustine, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, mechlorethamine oxide hydrochloride, melphalan, novembichin, phenesterine, prednimustine, trofosfamide or uracil mustard; nitrosureas such as carmustine, chlorozotocin, fotemustine, lomustine, nimustine, and ranimnustine; bisphosphonates such as clodronate; antibiotics such as the enediyne antibiotics (e.g., calicheamicin, especially calicheamicin gamma1I and calicheamicin omegaI1 (see, e.g., Agnew, 1994, Chem.

The cytotoxicity of MMAF increased to some extent in the presence of verapamil. In contrast, the toxicity of doxorubicin markedly increased in the presence of verapamil. As shown above, when MMAF was introduced as an ADC (cBR96-vcMMAF or mOKT9-vcMMAF), its toxicity was only marginally enhanced in the presence of verapamil.","In summary, this study demonstrates that MMAF is a poor substrate for the P-gp transporter. Antibody drug conjugates carrying vc-MMAF molecules are capable of selectively targeting and killing P-gp overexpressing cell lines (drug resistant) as well as parental cell lines. This effect is independent of antigen system and represents a new method for eradicating drug resistant tumors in patients.","MMAF is an antimitotic auristatin derivative with a charged C-terminal phenylalanine residue that attenuates its cytotoxic activity, most likely due to impaired intracellular access. In vitro cytotoxicity studies indicated that mAb-maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl-MMAF (mAb-L1-MMAF) conjugates showed >2,200-fold more anti-proliferative activity than free MMAF on a large panel of CD30 positive hematologic cell lines. MMAF ADCs induced complete and partial regressions of established xenograft tumors at well tolerated doses. To further optimize the ADC, several linker variants were generated in which various components within the L1 linker were either altered or deleted. One of the linkers contained a non-cleavable maleimidocaproyl (L4) spacer between the drug and the mAb. cAC10-L4-MMAF was approximately as potent in vitro as AC10-L1-MMAF against a large panel of cell lines, and was equally potent in vivo. AC10-L4-MMAF was tolerated at >3 times the MTD of AC10-L1-MMAF. LC\/MS studies indicated that drug released from AC10-L4-MMAF was the cysteine-L4-MMAF adduct, which likely arises from mAb degradation within the lysosomes of target cells. This linker technology appears to be ideally suited for drugs that are both relatively cell-impermeable and tolerant of substitution with amino acids.","Procedures and Materials","General.","Unless otherwise noted, materials were obtained from commercial suppliers in the highest purity grade available and used without further purifications.

Phenylalanine-2-chlorotrityl resin was purchased from Novabiochem. The phenylalanine loading level of the resin was determined (0.55 mmol\/gram) by extensive acylation with Fmoc-Cl followed by spectrophotometric Fmoc-quantitation assay. Solid phase synthesis was performed in plastic syringes (National Scientific Company) fitted with a filter cut out of fritware PE medium grade porous sheet (Scienceware). A Burrell Wrist Action\u00ae shaker (Burrell Scientific, Pittsburg, Pa.) was used for agitation. All solid-phase yields reported are based upon the initial phenylalanine substitution level of the resin and constitute a mass balance of isolated pure material from support, unless otherwise stated.

This drug has previously displayed ICvalues in the range of 1-5 nM on hematologic cell lines (Doronina et al., supra; Law et al., supra), and was designed for mAb-based targeted delivery using peptide based linkers appended to the N-terminal methylvaline residue (Doronina et al., supra; Francisco et al., supra). The synthesis of MMAE proceeded through a solution-phase route involving the coupling of the amino-protected N-terminal trimer to the C-terminal dimer. Due to the convergent nature of the process, it was possible to produce a large number of auristatins with varied solubilities, potencies and pharmacokinetic properties. One molecule that emerged was MMAF-OMe (), a C-terminal phenylalanine containing auristatin that remains one of the most potent drugs isolated so far (Table 8). MMAF-OMe is a prodrug of MMAF (), with the potential of having facilitated intracellular uptake due to the presence of a neutral C-terminus. In addition, intracellular ester hydrolysis of MMAF-OMe should rapidly generate MMAF, a C-terminally charged molecule expected to have impaired membrane translocation capabilities. Therefore, MMAF was synthesized using solid phase synthetic methodology, and as expected was much less potent than MMAE on all cell lines tested (Table 8). In addition, the maximum tolerated dose in mice of MMAF (>16 mg\/kg) was much higher than MMAE (1 mg\/kg). Thus, MMAF was of great interest for targeted delivery, since the free drug had attenuated potency, lower toxicity, and much higher aqueous solubility compared to MMAE. Facilitated intracellular transport was expected to greatly enhance its activity.","Conjugates of MMAF were produced using the maleimidocaproyl-Val-Cit-PABC linker (L1, ) as described earlier for MMAE (Doronina et al., supra; Francisco et al., supra). The mAbs used were BR96 (Trail et al., 1993, supra) and AC10 (Francisco et al., supra), chimeric IgG1 mAbs that bind to the LeY antigen on human carcinomas and the CD30 antigen on hematologic malignancies, respectively. Initial studies were undertaken with conjugates that had 8 drugs\/mAb. More recent data demonstrating improved pharmacokinetic and toxicologic properties of conjugates having lower drug loadings (Hamblett et al., supra) prompted investigation of the activities of conjugates with fewer drugs\/mAb. These were obtained through carefully controlled mAb disulfide reduction with limiting amounts of dithiothreitol (DTT) sufficient to produce an average of 4 thiol groups\/mAb.

The resulting distributions of species were as previously described (Sun et al., supra).

Cells were exposed to the ADCs continuously for 96 h, and the cytotoxic effects, as determined by Alamar Blue conversion, were compared to those of free MMAF. On a molar basis, the cAC10-L1-MMAF(the subscript indicating an average of four MMAF molecules per antibody molecule) was an average of >2,200-fold more potent than free MMAF, and was active on all the CD30-positive cell lines tested. The effects were immunologically specific, since WSU-NHL cells, which do not express detectable levels of the CD30 antigen, were unaffected by the conjugate. Limited studies were also undertaken with the cAC10-L1-MMAF-OMebased conjugates, and it was found that they displayed ICvalues on Karpas 299 (0.04 nM) and L540cy (0.11 nM) cells that were comparable to those of cAC10-L1-MMAF(Table 9). This is consistent with the assumption stated earlier that the active form of MMAF-OMe is the free acid MMAF.","Further studies were undertaken with MMAF and the cBR96-L1-MMAF conjugate on a LeY positive human small cell lung carcinoma cell line (H69), and its P-glycoprotein overexpres sing counterpart H69\/LX4 (Reeve et al., supra). The results were compared to doxorubicin and cBR96-L1-doxorubicin, a previously described conjugate with 8 doxorubicin molecules\/mAb (Trail et al., 1993, supra; Trail et al., 1997, Cancer Res. 57:100-5). H69\/LX-4 cells were approximately 100-times less sensitive to doxorubicin compared to the parental cell (), while there was only a 3-fold difference with MMAF (FIG. B). This trend extended to the conjugates, in that the drug resistant cell line was refractory to BR96-L1-doxorubicin (), but quite sensitive to the corresponding MMAF conjugate (). These results have been confirmed on several MDR positive cell lines (data not shown), in which it has been found that MMAF and MMAF-based immunoconjugates circumvent common forms of the MDR phenotype.","Linker Technologies.","The linker joining the drug to the mAb carrier plays a significant role in conjugate potency (Wu et al., 2005, Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1137-46; Trail et al., 1997, supra; Chari et al., 1992, Cancer Res. 52:127-31; Hamann et al., 2005a, Bioconjug. Chem. 16:346-53; Hamann et al., 2005b, Bioconjug. Chem. 16:354-60). Peptide linker technology was applied to MMAF, based on its successful application with MMAE (Doronina et al., supra; Hamblett et al., supra; Law et al., supra; Francisco et al., supra; Sun et al., supra), and other drug classes (Dubowchik et al., 1999, Pharmacol. Ther. 83:67-123; Dubowchik et al., 1998, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:3341-6; Dubowchik et al., 2002, supra; Dubowchik et al., 1998, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:3347-52).","To expand the understanding of the role that the linker plays in drug release and cytotoxicity, truncated linker-MMAF derivatives were prepared lacking the p-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (PABC) self-immolative group (L2, ), the peptide (L3), and both the peptide and the PABC group (L4). The resulting modified drugs were attached to cAC10, forming ADCs with approximately 4 drugs\/mAb. As expected from earlier work with related doxorubicin ADCs (Dubowchik et al. (1999), supra; Dubowchik et al., 1998, supra; Dubowchik et al., 2002, supra; Dubowchik et al., 1998, supra), cAC10-L2-MMAFwas devoid of activity on Karpas 299 cells (Table 9). In contrast, both cAC10-L3-MMAF and cAC10-L4-MMAF were highly active, and were as active as the full-length construct (cAC10-L1-MMAF). ADCs with truncated linkers (L2, L3, and L4) were not substrates for human cathepsin B, which was an important design element in forming the original proteolytically cleavable linker technology for doxorubicin ((Dubowchik et al., 1999, supra; Dubowchik et al., 1998, supra; Dubowchik et al., 2002, supra; Dubowchik et al., 1998, supra). The effects of the truncated linkers were drug-dependent, in that cAC10-L4-MMAE had no cytotoxic activity above 50 nM (1000 ng\/mL) on Karpas 299 cells.","The results prompted testing of cAC10-L4-MMAFon the broad panel of hematologic cell lines shown in Table 9. The conjugate was active against all CD30 positive cell lines tested, and had approximately half the activity of cAC10-L1-MMAF. In addition, the effects were immunologically specific, as CD30 negative SU-NHL cells were not affected by cAC10-L4-MMAF. Thus, MMAF can be attached to cAC10 through linkers not designed for proteolytic cleavage, without significant loss in potency.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0420","num":"0419"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00012","num":"00012"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 9"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"In Vitro Cytotoxicity of cAC10-MMAF ADCs and Free MMAF"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"112pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"IC(nM)"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"cAC10-L1-","cAC10-L4-",{}]},{"entry":["Cell Line","Tumor Type","MMAF","MMAF","MMAF"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Karpas 299","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma","0.057","0.059","119"]},{"entry":["SUP-M2","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma","0.023","0.024","79.7"]},{"entry":["SU-DHL-1","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma","0.007","0.045","34.7"]},{"entry":["SR-786","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma","0.01","0.016","38.1"]},{"entry":["DEL","Anaplastic large cell lymphoma","0.038","0.046","69"]},{"entry":["HH","Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma","0.016","0.022","30.7"]},{"entry":["L540cy","Hodgkin's disease","0.06","0.085","70.4"]},{"entry":["HDLM-2","Hodgkin's disease","0.08","0.21","66"]},{"entry":["L428","Hodgkin's disease","0.021","0.058","68"]},{"entry":["KMH-2","Hodgkin's disease","0.009","0.068","45.4"]},{"entry":["RPMI 6666","Hodgkin's disease","0.091","0.18","164"]},{"entry":["WSU-NHL","Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, CD30","No effect","No effect","60.3"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"147pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Mean (all lines)","0.034","0.066","70.4"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00005"},"sup":"b"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00006"},"sup":"c"}}]}}]}}},"To determine what drug-related molecule might be released from the conjugate, a C-phenylalanine substituted L4-MMAF was synthesized and conjugated to cAC10. C-, C-, and a 1:1 mixture of C- and C-cAC10-L4-MMAF were then incubated in lysosomal extracts of L540cy cells. Low molecular weight products were separated from proteins and were analyzed by LC\/MS. The identification of released drugs was based on the 6 mass unit shifts between the C and C derivatives of the drug. After inspection of mass spectra for such shifts, the only detectable drug related molecule that was found was the cysteine adduct of maleimidocaproyl-MMAF (). To confirm this, a sample of cysteine-L4-MMAF was synthesized, and was shown to have the same elution and LC\/MS profile as the drug released from the cAC10-L4-MMAFADC. The mAb is the likely source for cysteine in cysteine-L4-MMAF, since this was the residue to which the drug was attached. Thus, drug release takes place through mAb degradation.","Maximum Tolerated Doses.","The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) of the cAC10-MMAF conjugates were determined in BALB\/c mice and in Sprague-Dawley rats, and are defined as the highest dose that did not induce more than 20% weight loss, distress, or overt toxicities in any of the animals. This dose was generally within 20% of doses where such events took place. cAC10-L1-MMAFhas an MTD of 50 mg\/kg in mice and 15 mg\/kg in rats. The corresponding cAC10-L4-MMAFADC was much less toxic, having MTDs in mice and rats of more than 150 mg\/kg (the highest dose tested, which resulted in no apparent toxicity) and 90 mg\/kg in rats, respectively. This result indicates that the method by which the drug is attached to the mAb can affect ADC tolerability, and the ADC lacking the peptide spacer within the linker was much less toxic than the peptide-based ADC.","Immunohistochemical Analyses.","Studies were undertaken to determine if cAC10-L1-MMAFlocalized into subcutaneous Karpas 299 tumors in nude mice. Animals were injected intravenously with cAC10-L1-MMAFor cBR96-L1-MMAFat 10 mg antibody component\/kg body weight. Tumors were removed 24 h later and frozen sections were evaluated for the presence of the mAb and drug components using immunohistochemistry with biotinylated anti-human-Fc and anti-MMAF mAbs as secondary antibodies respectively. The results showed that cAC10-L1-MMAFaccumulated much more efficiently within Karpas 299 tumors compared to the cBR96 non-binding control ADC. Both the mAb and drug moieties were detected throughout the tumor, indicating that the ADC was delivered as an intact molecule.","Additional studies were undertaken to determine the effects of ADC localization on apoptosis. The results showed that there were significant levels of fragmented DNA in tumors of animals that received cAC10-L1-MMAF. This was established by TUNEL analysis, which measured bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into fragmented DNA. A non-binding control ADC did not induce nearly this level of fragmentation, which was consistent with the localization data.","In Vivo Therapy Studies.","The therapeutic effects of the ADCs were determined in nude mice with subcutaneous or disseminated Karpas 299 tumors. In animals with subcutaneous tumors, significant antitumor effects were obtained with a single injection of either cAC10-L1-MMAFor cAC10-L4-MMAF, which were indistinguishably potent and active (). Nearly all animals that received single ADC injections at 2 mg antibody component\/kg body weight were cured. In lowering the dose to 1 mg\/kg, efficacy for both ADCs, dropped off in an apparently equal manner. At this dose, there were still 2 of 6 and 3 of 6 animals cured with the cAC10-L1-MMAFand cAC10-L4-MMAFADCs, respectively.","In order to establish disseminated tumors, Karpas 299 cells were injected intravenously, and allowed to distribute and become established before therapy was initiated 9 days later. In the absence of any treatment, all of the animals succumbed to disseminated disease by day 45. A single administration with either cAC10-L1-MMAFor cAC10-L4-MMAFwas sufficient to cure most of the animals, with a slight dose response between 0.8 mg\/kg and 8 mg\/kg. The differences between the L1 and L4 linkers were not significant in this tumor model. One of the noteworthy findings in this experiment was the level of specificity. The non-binding control ADCs, cBR96-L1-MMAFand cBR96-L1-MMAFwere inactive, even at 8 mg\/kg, which is 10-times the effective dose of the corresponding cAC10 ADCs. Thus, the MMAF conjugates exhibit pronounced activity at very well tolerated doses, and are highly immunologically specific. Furthermore, the therapeutic window of cAC10-L4-MMAFis measurably greater than that of cAC10-L1-MMAF, indicating that the linker technology plays a critical role in the design of effective ADCs that can be safely administered.","Discussion","ADCs comprised of MMAF have distinct properties as compared with those composed of other drugs. The activities of MMAF are potentiated an average of 2,200 fold when the drug is attached through the L1 linker to cAC10, a mAb that is efficiently taken up within the lysosomes of target cells (Table 9). This study describes the activity of cAC10-L4-MMAF, an ADC that has no built-in provision for drug release. Purified human enzymes that were tested were unable to facilitate release of MMAF or any identifiable MMAF fragments, yet cAC10-L4-MMAFis highly potent, both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of drug release may involve degradation of the mAb, based on the identification of the cysteine adduct of L4-MMAF.","The data in Table 10 also demonstrate that the various linkers within the MMAF ADC family provide a range of cytotoxic activities. The fact that cAC10-L2-MMAFwas inactive suggests that the released agent from the L2-MMAF ADC is highly attenuated in activity. The cAC10-L4-MMAFwas used for further work rather than cAC10-L3-MMAF, since the PABC group in the L3 linker is hydrophobic and apparently unnecessary for activity.","The objective of the study with various linkers was to determine if the mode of drug release could affect ADC therapeutic index. cAC10-L4-MMAFdiffered from cAC10-L1-MMAFby an average of only 2-fold on a large panel of hematologic cell lines (Table 9) in spite of the fact that L1 linker cleavage is quite facile through enzymes such as cathepsin B, while drug release through the L4 linker requires antibody degradation. This observation provided the basis for in vivo experiments, since it was anticipated that the different pathways required for drug elimination could strongly influence the therapeutic windows of the ADCs. Indeed, it was found that cAC10-L4-MMAFwas tolerated at significantly higher doses in rodents than cAC10-L1-MMAF, but was equally efficacious in vivo. These results reported herein suggest that the therapeutic window is increased by at least 3-fold through the L4 linker system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0430","num":"0429"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00013","num":"00013"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 10"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Drug-Linker Combinations"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},{},"IC(ng\/mL) in"]},{"entry":[{},"Conjugate","Target Antigen","Karpas 299 cells"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L1-MMAF","CD30","1.2"]},{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L2-MMAF","CD30",">1500"]},{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L3-MMAF","CD30","2.2"]},{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L4-MMAF","CD30","2.6"]},{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L1-MMAE","CD30","3.6"]},{"entry":[{},"cAC10-L4-MMAE","CD30",">1000"]},{"entry":[{},"cBR96-L1-MMAF","Lewis Y",">1000"]},{"entry":[{},"cBR96-L4-MMAF","Lewis Y",">1000"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"left","id":"FOO-00007"},"sup":"a"}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"Hybridoma S2C6, secreting native monoclonal antibody S2C6, was deposited on May 25, 1999, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassass, Va. 20110-2209, under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedures, and assigned accession number PTA-110.","The present invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.

The antibody disclosed herein can be of any class (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, and IgA), or subclass (e.g., IgG, IgG, IgG, IgG, IgAand IgA) of immunoglobulin molecule. The antibody can be derived from any species. In one aspect, the antibody is of human, murine, or rabbit origin. In another aspect, the antibody is polyclonal, monoclonal, bispecific, multispecific, human, humanized or a chimeric antibody, or an epitope-binding fragment of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to a target antigen.","The term \u201cmonoclonal antibody\u201d as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally-occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site.","Monoclonal antibodies specifically include \u201cchimeric\u201d antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and\/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, that exhibit the desired biological activity (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855). For example, a chimeric antibody may be derived from the variable region from a mouse antibody and the constant region from a human antibody.","An \u201cantibody fragment\u201d refers to a portion of an intact antibody, typically comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab\u2032, F(ab\u2032), and Fv fragments; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules; an scFv; an IgG \u0394C2, a minibody, a diabody, a triabody, a tetrabody, a dsFv; an sc-Fv-Fc; an (scFv); a fragment produced by a Fab expression library; an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s).","An \u201cintact\u201d antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CO and heavy chain constant domains, C1, C2 and C3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid sequence variants thereof.","The term \u201cpolypeptide\u201d refers to a polymer of amino acids and its equivalent and does not refer to a specific length of a product; thus, \u201cpeptides\u201d and \u201cproteins\u201d are included within the definition of a polypeptide. Also included within the definition of polypeptides are \u201cantibodies\u201d as defined herein. A \u201cpolypeptide region\u201d refers to a segment of a polypeptide, which segment may contain, for example, one or more domains or motifs (e.g., a polypeptide region of an antibody can contain, for example, one or more CDRs). The term \u201cfragment\u201d refers to a portion of a polypeptide typically having at least 20 contiguous or at least 50 contiguous amino acids of the polypeptide. A \u201cderivative\u201d includes a polypeptide or fragment thereof having conservative amino acid substitutions relative to a second polypeptide; or a polypeptide or fragment thereof that is modified by covalent attachment of a second molecule such as, e.g., by attachment of a heterologous polypeptide, or by glycosylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and the like. Further included within the definition of \u201cpolypeptide\u201d is, for example, a polypeptide containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (e.g., unnatural amino acids and the like), polypeptides with unsubstituted linkages, as well as other modifications known in the art, both naturally and non-naturally occurring.","A \u201cnative sequence\u201d polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide (e.g., a tumor-associated antigen) derived from nature. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus, a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of naturally-occurring human polypeptide, murine polypeptide, or polypeptide from any other mammalian species.","The term \u201camino acid sequence variant\u201d refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that differ to some extent from a native sequence polypeptide. Ordinarily, an amino acid sequence variant will possess at least about 70% homology with at least one domain of a native polypeptide, or with at least one domain of a native protein, and preferably, it will be at least about 80%, more preferably, at least about 90% homologous with such protein or domain. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions, deletions, and\/or insertions at certain positions within the amino acid sequence of the native amino acid sequence.","The terms \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cpercent identity,\u201d in the context of two or more nucleic acids or polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence. To determine the percent identity, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino or nucleic acid sequence). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity=# of identical positions\/total # of positions (e.g., overlapping positions)\u00d7100). In certain embodiments, the two sequences are the same length.","The term \u201csubstantially identical,\u201d in the context of two nucleic acids or polypeptides, refers to two or more sequences or subsequences that have at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, or at least 65% identity; typically at least 70% or at least 75% identity; more typically at least 80% or at least 85% identity; and even more typically at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 98% identity (as determined using one of the methods set forth infra).","\u201cSimilarity\u201d or \u201cpercent similarity\u201d in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same or conservatively substituted when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the methods set forth infra. By way of example, a first amino acid sequence can be considered similar to a second amino acid sequence when the first amino acid sequence is at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, or even 95% identical, or conservatively substituted, to the second amino acid sequence when compared to an equal number of amino acids as the number contained in the first sequence, or when compared to an alignment of polypeptides that has been aligned by a computer similarity program known in the art (see infra).","The terms \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d or \u201csubstantially similar,\u201d in the context of polypeptide sequences, indicates that a polypeptide region has a sequence with at least 70%, typically at least 80%, more typically at least 85%, and even more typically at least 90% or at least 95% sequence similarity to a reference sequence. For example, a polypeptide is substantially similar to a second polypeptide, for example, where the two peptides differ by one or more conservative substitutions.","The determination of percent identity or percent similarity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, 1990, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5877. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al., 1990, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12, to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid encoding a protein of interest. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3, to identify amino acid sequences homologous to a protein of interest. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402. Alternatively, PSI-Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules (Id.). When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, and PSI-Blast programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. (See, e.g., National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website.) Another preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, CABIOS (1989). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used. Additional algorithms for sequence analysis are known in the art and include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti, 1994, Comput. Appl. Biosci. 10:3-5; and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444-8. Within FASTA, ktup is a control option that sets the sensitivity and speed of the search. If ktup=2, similar regions in the two sequences being compared are found by looking at pairs of aligned residues; if ktup=1, single aligned amino acids are examined. ktup can be set to 2 or 1 for protein sequences, or from 1 to 6 for DNA sequences. The default if ktup is not specified is 2 for proteins and 6 for DNA. For a further description of FASTA parameters, see, e.g., NCBI website.","Alternatively, protein sequence alignment may be carried out using the CLUSTAL W algorithm, as described by Higgins et al., 1996, Methods Enzymol. 266:383-402.","The term \u201cdiabodies\u201d refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain (V) connected to a variable light domain (V) in the same polypeptide chain. By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 0 404 097; WO 93\/11161; and Hollinger et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448.","\u201cHumanized\u201d forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the molecule, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In some embodiments, the molecule will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of molecule as determined by the Lowry method, or to more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. An \u201cisolated molecule\u201d (e.g., an antibody) includes the molecule in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the molecules's natural environment will not be present.

To the extent the drug may prevent growth and\/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and\/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and\/or determining the response rate (RR).","The term \u201cbioavailability\u201d refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood\/plasma levels) of a given amount of drug administered to a patient.

Thus, an isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in a cell where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location that differs from its location in the natural cell.","The expression \u201ccontrol sequences\u201d refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.","A nucleic acid is \u201coperably linked\u201d when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA encoding a polypeptide where the polypeptide is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide. A promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence. A ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \u201coperably linked\u201d means that the nucleic acid sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous to be operably linked. Linking can be accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers can be used in accordance with conventional practice.","As used herein, the expressions \u201ccell,\u201d \u201ccell line,\u201d and \u201ccell culture\u201d are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny.

It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.","The term \u201calkyl\u201d refers to a C-Chydrocarbon containing normal, secondary, tertiary or cyclic carbon atoms.

P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984), McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (\u2212) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (\u2212) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms \u201cracemic mixture\u201d and \u201cracemate\u201d refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.","Examples of a \u201cpatient\u201d include, but are not limited to, a human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, pig, goat, cow, horse, dog, cat, bird and fowl.
