title: System and method for a virtual soft handover in a high data rate network based on data transmission information
abstract: A Virtual Soft Handover (VSHO) process for high data rate (HDR) applications is disclosed that considers the total number packets remaining to be transmitted prior to initiating the VSHO. An HDR mobile terminal maintains data transmission information relating to an amount of data to be transmitted during a data transfer in progress during a data session. The data transmission information may include, for example, the total packet size of a data transmission and the data transmission status (i.e., the number of packets remaining to be transmitted). The decision of whether to perform a VSHO is made according to the data transmission information. In one embodiment, a VSHO may be deactivated when the number of packets remaining to be transmitted is less than a certain threshold. In other embodiments, a VSHO may not be performed if the total packet size is smaller than a certain threshold.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to high data rate cellular networks, and specifically to performing handovers within high data rate cellular networks.","2. Description of Related Art","High Data Rate (HDR) is a technology originally developed for dedicated packet data applications to meet the increasing demand for wireless Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity with high spectral efficiency. Voice transmissions require low data rates, but maintain stringent delay and jitter requirements. Packet data transmissions, on the other hand, typically require bursty high data rates, with less stringent delay and jitter requirements. The HDR principle is to separate high-speed data completely from the voice network, so that the packet data requirements can be fulfilled optimally and independently.","Within an HDR cellular network, such as a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) 2000 network, an HDR base station, whether a stand-alone node or integrated within a voice base station, operates on a 1.25 MHZ carrier that is allocated for packet data only. The HDR base station further employs a single shared, time division multiplexed (TDM) forward link, where only a single terminal is served at any instance. The forward link throughput rate is shared by all HDR mobile terminals. A mobile terminal selects a serving sector (or cell) of the base station by pointing its Data Rate Control (DRC) to the sector and requesting a forward data rate according to the channel condition (i.e., based on the Carrier to Interference (C\/I) ratio of the channel). A multi-user scheduler at the HDR base station is responsible for granting actual data rates to each mobile terminal. The multi-user scheduler within the HDR base station \u201cfairly\u201d distributes the throughput rate for all mobile terminals pointing their DRC's on the same sector.","When a mobile terminal connects to an HDR base station, both the mobile station and the HDR base station maintain an Active set of pilots. The pilots within the Active set represent the sectors currently serving the mobile terminal. Each sector currently serving the mobile terminal has a forward traffic channel, a reverse traffic channel and a Medium Access Control Channel assigned to the mobile terminal. Based on the C\/I ratio measurements for each sector currently serving the mobile terminal, the mobile terminal can point it's DRC to the serving sector with the best radio channel conditions in order to obtain a potentially higher data rate. The process of changing the serving sector that the mobile terminal points it's DRC towards is termed a Virtual Soft Handover (VSHO). The VSHO process involves signal exchanges within the HDR base station and between the mobile terminal and the HDR base station, and typically requires redundant Abis interface traffic for the two serving sectors during the VSHO. The VSHO process is especially advantageous when the total number of packets remaining to be transmitted over the air interface to the mobile terminal is significantly large as compared with the signaling and redundant Abis interface traffic necessitated by the VSHO process. However, performing a VSHO for only a small number of packets is an inefficient use of network resources. Therefore, what is needed is a VSHO process that considers the total number of packets remaining to be transmitted before initiating the VSHO.","The present invention provides a Virtual Soft Handover (VSHO) process for high data rate (HDR) applications that considers the total number packets remaining to be transmitted prior to initiating the VSHO. An HDR mobile terminal maintains data transmission information relating to an amount of data to be transmitted during a data transfer in progress during a data session. The decision of whether to perform a VSHO is made according to the data transmission information. As an example, the data transmission information may include the total data length (e.g., the total number of data packets) of a data transfer. In one embodiment, a VSHO may be deactivated when the number of packets remaining to be transmitted is less than a certain threshold. Alternatively, the data transmission information may include the data transmission status (i.e., the number of packets remaining to be transmitted). In other embodiments, a VSHO may not be performed if the total packet size is smaller than a certain threshold.","Advantageously, by considering the packet transmission status in addition to the channel conditions prior to initiating a VSHO, inefficient use of radio resources may be avoided. In addition, the VSHO process of the present invention may reduce congestion, improve interference and improve customer satisfaction for the network operator. Furthermore, the VSHO process of the present invention may improve a user's total data throughput and reduce the user's cost.","The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the exemplary embodiments. However, it should be understood that these embodiments provide only a few examples of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general, statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily delimit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover, some statements may apply to some inventive features, but not to others.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00019","num":"00019"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","120","120","115","130","100","120","115","110","120"]},"An HDR mobile terminal  may be a DO mobile terminal or a dual mode mobile terminal capable of utilizing both voice services and data services. To engage in a data session, the HDR mobile terminal  connects to a DO carrier  to use the DO high-speed data service. The data session is controlled by a Packet Data Service Node (PDSN) , which routes all data packets between the HDR mobile terminal  and the Internet . The PDSN  has a direct connection to a Base Station Controller (BSC)  of the HDR base station . The BSC  is connected to the HDR base station  via an Abis interface interface . In addition, the BSC  is responsible for operation, maintenance and administration of the HDR base station , speech coding, rate adaptation and handling of the radio resources. It should be understood that the BSC  may be a separate node or may be co-located with one or more HDR base stations .","Each HDR base station  is shown serving three sectors  (or cells). However, it should be understood that each HDR base station  may serve only a single cell (referred to as an omni cell). For each sector  (or cell), the HDR base station  further employs a single shared, time division multiplexed (TDM) forward link, where only a single HDR mobile terminal  is served at any instance. The forward link throughput rate is shared by all HDR mobile terminals . An HDR mobile terminal  selects a serving sector  (or cell) of the HDR base station  for a data session by pointing its Data Rate Control (DRC) towards the sector  and requesting a forward data rate according to the channel conditions (i.e., based on the Carrier to Interference (C\/I) ratio of the channel). A multi-user scheduler at the HDR base station  is responsible for granting actual data rates to each HDR mobile terminal . The multi-user scheduler within the HDR base station  \u201cfairly\u201d distributes the throughput rate for all HDR mobile terminals  pointing their DRC's towards the same sector .","When a mobile terminal  connects to an HDR base station , both the mobile station  and the HDR base station  maintain an active set of pilots. The pilots within the active set represent the sectors  currently serving the mobile terminal . It should be understood that the sectors  within the active set may be served by the same or different HDR base stations . Each sector  currently serving the mobile terminal  has a forward traffic channel, a reverse traffic channel and a Medium Access Control Channel assigned to the mobile terminal . Periodically, the mobile terminal  measures the Carrier to Interference (C\/I) ratio of each serving sector , and points it's DRC to the serving sector  with the best radio  channel conditions in order to obtain a potentially higher data rate.","The process of changing the serving sector  that the HDR mobile terminal  points it's DRC towards is termed a Virtual Soft Handover (VSHO) in the CDMA 2000 network.","However, it should be understood that the VSHO of the CDMA 2000 network is similar to the cell selection used in CDMA and WCDMA networks, and therefore, the VSHO process described herein applies equally to CDMA and WCDMA networks and any other type of network using a similar handover procedure where the mobile terminal makes the handover or cell selection decision. As discussed above, the VSHO process involves signal exchanges within the HDR base station  and between the HDR mobile terminal  and the HDR base station , and typically requires redundant Abis interface  traffic for the two serving sectors  during the VSHO. Therefore, the VSHO process is an inefficient use of network resources when the total number of packets remaining to be transmitted over the air interface to the HDR mobile terminal  is small.","Referring now to  of the drawings, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, in order to utilize data transmission information, such as the total data length or data transmission status (i.e., the number of packets remaining to be transmitted), when deciding whether to perform a VSHO, an Application Agent  is included within the HDR mobile terminal . The Application Agent  bridges the control interoperation between HDR air interface logic  within the HDR mobile terminal  and various internal Applications , such as a Web Browser (HTTP) client application. The Application Agent  may be implemented as a combination of one or more of hardware, software and\/or firmware. Although control information is routed through the Application Agent , all data is routed directly between the HDR air interface logic  and the Application . The HDR air interface logic  may include, for example, a transceiver and logic for formatting data sent over the air interface between the HDR mobile terminal  and the HDR network . Likewise, the HDR network  includes HDR air interface logic  for formatting and transmitting data over the air interface to the HDR mobile terminal .","On the network side, Applications , such as an HTTP server, may be resident in different Application platforms . A Web Browser  within the HDR mobile terminal  may access a particular HTTP server  by sending a request through the Application Agent  to the HDR air interface logic . Once a physical connection (illustrated by solid lines) is established, data can be downloaded from the HTTP server  to the Web Browser , as is logically illustrated by dotted lines. Such data may include one or more web pages of a web site.","Most web browsers currently provide the capability to indicate the downloading status when browsing a web site. As an example, after the Web Browser  in the HDR Access Terminal  sends an HTTP GET request to the HTTP server , the total data length (i.e., total number of data packets) may be sent to the Web Browser  in addition to the requested data. Furthermore, during the transmission of the data, the HTTP server  may send data information, such as the amount of data (i.e., number of data packets) included in each transmission. Typically, the total length and data information is received at the Web Browser  through an Application Programming Interface (API) (not shown) of the Web Browser . In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the total data length and data information is transmitted from the Web Browser  to the Application Agent  for use in making VSHO decisions.","A more detailed explanation of a data session incorporating the Application Agent  functionality is illustrated in the signaling diagram of  of the drawings. Initially, all of the necessary signaling between the HDR air interface logic  and  of both the HDR mobile terminal  and the HDR network , respectively, are performed to setup a data session (step ). Such signaling is well-known in the art, and may include, for example, the HDR mobile terminal  pointing it's DRC towards a sector of the HDR network , the HDR mobile terminal  requesting a forward data rate and the HDR network  granting a data rate to the HDR mobile terminal . Once the data session is established, the HDR air interface logic  initiates the Application Agent  to interface with the Application  involved in the data session (step ). At this point, the Application Agent  activates a data transmission information service by instructing the Application  to report all data length information to the Application Agent  (step ).","Thereafter, a physical radio connection between the HDR air interfaces  and  of the HDR mobile terminal  and HDR network , respectively, is established (step ) and a peer connection is setup between the Application (client)  in the HDR mobile terminal  and the desired Application (server)  on the network side (step ). When the client Application  requests a data transmission (e.g., by sending an HTTP GET request) from the server Application , the client Application  also requests the total length of the data (step ). The data transmission request is also sent to the Application Agent  (step ) to notify the Application Agent  of the data transfer in progress.","In response to the data transmission request, the server Application  transmits the total data length to the client Application  (step ). Due to the activation of the data transmission information service, the client Application  passes the total data length to the Application Agent  (step ) for later use in ascertaining whether to perform a VSHO. During the data transfer, the server Application  may also transmit data information, such as the amount of data being sent with each transmission, to the client Application  (step ). Periodically, or upon the reception of each data packet, the client Application  transmits the data information to the Application Agent  (step ) for use in the VSHO process described hereinbelow in connection with .","The operation of the Application Agent  will now be explained in more detail with reference to the state diagram of FIG. . The Inactive state  is the initial state of the Application Agent . The Application Agent  enters the Idle state  after the HDR radio connection is established for a data session. Once a data transfer request is initiated by an Application within the HDR mobile terminal, the Application Agent  transitions to the Active state . During the Active state , the Application Agent  discerns data transmission information from the data information and total data length sent by the Application to assist in the VSHO process. Once the data transfer is complete, or if the data transfer is interrupted, the Application Agent  reverts back to the Idle state . However, if the HDR connection is abnormally interrupted, the Application Agent  bypasses the Idle state  and reverts back to the Inactive state . At the end of the data session, the Application Agent  returns to the Inactive state .","Turning now to , there is illustrated a functional block diagram of an HDR mobile terminal implementing the VSHO process of the present invention. As described above in connection with , the Application  passes the total data length and data information to the Application Agent  during the data transfer process. A counter  is shown connected to the Application Agent  to count the number of data packets received. In one embodiment, the counter  may be initialized with the total data length and decremented each time the Application Agent  receives new data information. In another embodiment, the counter  may be incremented with each new received data information, and the Application Agent  may contain logic for determining the total amount of data remaining to be transmitted to the HDR mobile terminal .","The HDR mobile terminal  is also shown to include measurement logic , which is responsible for measuring radio information, such as the Carrier to Interference (C\/I) ratio, for the sectors within the Active set of pilots. It should be understood that other measurements of the radio channel conditions may be used instead of the C\/I ratio discussed herein. Each time the measurement logic  measures the C\/I ratio, the radio measurement information is passed to VSHO logic  within the HDR mobile terminal . The VSHO logic  is responsible for determining whether a VSHO should be performed based on the radio measurement information. The VSHO logic  considers the C\/I ratio of each sector within the Active set of pilots to determine whether a higher data rate may be able to be obtained from a sector not having the HDR mobile terminal's DRC pointed towards it.","In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the VSHO logic  also receives data transmission information (i.e., the total number of packets and the number of packets remaining to be transmitted) from the Application Agent . Therefore, the VSHO logic  makes the decision of whether to perform a VSHO according to the total number of packets, number of packets remaining for transmission and the radio channel conditions (C\/I measurement information). It should be understood that the data transmission information may include any information related to the amount of data involved in the data transfer process, and is not limited to any of the specifically listed examples.","To make the decision, the VSHO logic  may use one or more thresholds  stored within a memory within the HDR mobile terminal . For example, one threshold  may set the minimum total data length required before a VSHO may be performed. Another threshold  may set the minimum amount of remaining data required for performing a VSHO. It should be understood that different thresholds  may be used depending upon the implementation by the HDR mobile terminal  or the network provider. It should further be understood that the threshold(s)  may be included within the HDR mobile terminal  or downloaded to the HDR mobile terminal  from the HDR network.","Referring now to  of the drawings, there is illustrated exemplary steps for implementing the VSHO process during a data session in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. As described above in connection with , if an HDR radio connection has not yet been established (step ), the Application Agent is in the Inactive state (step ). However, once the HDR radio connection is established (step ), the Application Agent enters the Idle state (step ). Thereafter, if a data transfer request is sent by the client Application (step ), the Application Agent transitions to the Active state for the duration of the data transfer process (step ).","While in the Active state, the HDR mobile terminal may make radio (C\/I) measurements (step ). If the radio measurement information indicates that a VSHO is needed (step ), and the data transfer is still in progress when the radio measurements are complete (step ), the Application Agent reports the data transmission information (step ) for use in determining whether to initiate the VSHO (steps  and ). However, if the data transfer has been completed (step ), the VSHO is performed (step ) based only on the radio measurement information.","The VSHO decision process is described in more detail with reference to FIG. . If the radio measurement information indicates that a VSHO is needed during a data session (step ), the data transmission information may be used in a number of different ways to determine whether to perform the VSHO. For example, in one embodiment, if the data transmission information includes at least the total data length, the VSHO may be performed (step ) only if the total data length is less than a threshold (step ). Therefore, VSHO's are not performed (step ) when the total data length of a data transfer is small as compared to the signaling and redundant Abis interface traffic necessitated by the VSHO process.","Alternatively, in another embodiment, if the data transmission information includes at least the data transmission status, such as the number of data packets remaining to be transmitted, the VSHO may be performed (step ) only if the number of remaining data packets is less than a threshold (step ). Therefore, the VSHO is not performed (step ) when the data transfer is near the end. In still another alternative embodiment, if the data transmission information includes both the total data length and the data transmission status, the VSHO is performed (step ) only when the total data length is less than a first threshold (step ), and the number of remaining packets is less than a second threshold (step ). Therefore, the VSHO is not performed (step ) when the total data length of a data transfer is small and the data transfer itself is near the end.","As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the present application can be modified and varied over a wide range of applications. Accordingly, the scope of patented subject matter should not be limited to any of the specific exemplary teachings discussed, but is instead defined by the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The disclosed invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, which show important sample embodiments of the invention and which are incorporated in the specification hereof by reference, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00011","num":"00011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
