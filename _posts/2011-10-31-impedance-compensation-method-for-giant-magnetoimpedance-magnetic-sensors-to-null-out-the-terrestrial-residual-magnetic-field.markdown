title: Impedance compensation method for giant magneto-impedance magnetic sensors to null out the terrestrial residual magnetic field
abstract: The invention is a method, described with the appropriate auxiliary electronic circuitry, for compensating the effect of the earth's magnetic field on Giant Magneto-Impedance magnetic sensors. The method as taught is an alternate way of cancelling out the effect of the very large residual earth's magnetic field using an impedance-tuning circuit (i.e. electrical compensation) rather than the usual magnetic type of compensation.

Small diameter amorphous metal wires (called fibers, because of their small cross-sectional area) give the strongest Giant Magneto-Impedance effect.","Extremely sensitive magnetic sensors can be constructed with these fibers and they are presently being used (for example) for micro-magnetic recording heads, magnetic anomaly detection, robotic and automotive control, and industrial and environmental measurement. To be effective, however, magnetic sensors need to compensate for the earth's residual magnetic field, (also referred to as the geo-field or static geo-field), which can be as large as +\/\u221260,000 nanoTesla (nT). If a sensor is trying to measure only 1 nT or less, then it is obvious that the electronics of the sensor will \u201cuse up\u201d the vast majority of its dynamic range responding to the large static geo-field, with little dynamic headroom left to measure much smaller, dynamic fields.","Referring to  there is illustrated a typical magnetic sensor  using a Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber . This sensor design represents one approach of several that is useful in displaying a magnetic field reading based on the magnetic field impressed upon the fiber . As is shown, there is a Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber  connected to a radio frequency signal source . The magnetic field (H) is impressed upon the fiber , as is the field from the bias coil  that is used to bias the fiber response in the linear, most sensitive region. The fiber  is connected to the input of an amplifier  and filter circuit  that has an output voltage that depends on the fiber's impedance. This is often implemented with operational amplifiers. At the output is an analog to digital converter  which digitizes the output voltage of the gain stage. The circuit design of magnetic sensor  illustrates that voltage is allowed to swing the entire range of the earth's geo-field (+\/\u221260,000 nT) and illustrates the penalty in dynamic range that occurs from allowing the geo-field to overwhelm the sensor.","The analog to digital converter  has twenty bits of resolution, but the least significant bit represents 100 pT, or 0.1 nanoTesla, which will almost certainly get overwhelmed by system noise and will not be resolvable. The least significant bit will toggle between \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d and will not be usable. As a rule of thumb, the three least significant bits in an analog to digital converter can often be regarded as \u201cdown in the noise.\u201d It is generally desirable (if at all possible) to place the dynamic range of a measured signal into the upper half of the analog to digital converter range to reduce quantization noise effects. This technique has been used in \u201cfloating point analog to digital converters\u201d and is mentioned here as an illustration to show the dynamic range problems created by the static geo-field.","There are other kinds of magnetic sensors designs in addition to sensor  illustrated in . Many of these magnetic sensor designs use a Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber to control the resonant frequency of an oscillator. The oscillator must be stable enough to resolve the magnetic field measurement without drifting so much that any magnetic change to be measured (\u201cDelta H\u201d) is overwhelmed by the drift itself (See Hagerty, U.S. Pat. No. 7,405,559, Low-Power GMI Magnetic Detector That Utilizes a Crystal-Controlled Oscillator\u201d). For any magnetic sensor, however, the same problem (i.e., dynamic range saturation) arises when confronted by the large static geo-field.","Referring to  there is illustrated an alternate magnetic sensor design  that includes geo-field nulling coils  for each axis fiber  (one each for the three axes) on the circuit board that are used to null out the earth's residual magnetic field. These geo-field nulling coils  are used instead of providing a separate Helmholtz coil, which would increase the size of the sensor assembly to approximately 2\u2033 in diameter. Each geo-field nulling coil  is driven by a digital to analog converter . The digital to analog converter  receives instructions from the microcontroller . Although nulling the earth's residual magnetic field is achieved through this design, there is a penalty. The penalty is a large, 3 dimensional magnetic device (about the size of a small sugar cube) wrapped around each axis fiber , putting a serious limitation on the amount of miniaturization possible with such a sensor. Manufacturing such a geo-field nulling coil  would be labor-intensive and expensive.","Where situations exist when separate geo-field nulling coils  are not an option due to limitations in size and costs, then an alternative geo-field nulling method for magnetic sensors is needed based on impedance compensation rather than magnetic compensation to cancel out undesired static offsets.","It is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide a method for magnetic sensors to compensate for the earth's residual magnetic field.","This object is accomplished through the use of an impedance compensation method implemented with auxiliary electronic circuitry comprising a highly integrated impedance matching network that automatically nulls out the impedance change of a Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber that is caused by the geo-field.","The present invention teaches a method for use with a highly integrated impedance matching network that automatically nulls out the impedance change of the Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber  that is caused by the geo-field. The impedance matching is implemented with integrated circuitry electrically coupled as a modification component to a standard GMI magnetic sensor  (not shown but analogous to sensor  in ). The impedance matching is performed in a manner very similar to the way an automatic antenna tuning unit matches an output amplifier stage's impedance to a given, unknown complex antenna load. Antenna tuning unit technology is now common and extremely well-developed. For example, a Pi-Network impedance matching circuit well known in the art of radio systems comprises two shunt variable capacitors Cand Cseparated by a variable series inductor L. In the SGC manufactured SG-230 automatic antenna tuner, twenty six total network-selection relays can be switched in various combinations to give a network with sixty four values of input shunt C, thirty two values of output shunt Cand up to two hundred fifty six values of series L. Relays are used because of the high-power energy in the antenna system. The present invention uses a similar matching network, however, the relays are replaced with low-capacitance, solid-state switches as illustrated below. The desired components of Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber impedance matching network  are switched in or out of a general purpose tuning circuit  described below.","The implementation of a Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber impedance matching network  is simpler than implementing typical antenna tuning unit technology, because instead of impedance matching an unknown antenna load the tuning circuit  is impedance matching a well characterized Giant Magneto-Impedance fiber  whose reactive response to the static geo-field is accurately documented and measured a priori by the manufacturer.","Referring to  there is illustrated a series of steps representing an impedance compensation method  for nulling the geo-field in a Giant Magneto-Impedance sensor . The first step  is to install a Giant Magneto-Impedance magnetic sensor  in an environment that shields the sensor  from the earth's residual magnetic field. In a preferred embodiment, the Giant Magneto-Impedance magnetic sensor  is installed in a mu-metal shield can (not shown), with the sensor's electronic connections accessible in order to obtain an output reading from the sensor . Shield cans made of mu-metal are well known in the magnetic sensor art and are used to block out the effects of magnetic fields. The sensor output is recorded in the zero (shielded) geo-field environment . At this point in the method, the impedance matching network  is not active. The GMI magnetic sensor  is then placed in its intended operating environment  where the geo-field can affect the sensor . The sensor output is recorded in the normal (unshielded) geo-field environment . A determination is then made of the nature of the GMI fiber reactance as resistive, capacitive, or inductive . In a preferred embodiment, a phase detector is used to make the determination. In the next step , based on the nature of the GMI fiber reactance, the appropriate series and parallel combinations of resistors, inductors and capacitors are switched on in the impedance matching network  to affect an equal but opposite compensating impedance upon the GMI fiber . This compensating impedance is equal to the difference between the GMI magnetic sensor output in a zero geo-field and the GMI magnetic sensor output in the actual geo-field. The impedance matching network  compensates for the geo-field impedance on the GMI fiber  essentially nulling the geo-field effect. Once the compensation occurs, the GMI magnetic sensor output is the same as when the sensor  was in a zero geo-field environment. Nulling out the impedance change caused by the geo-field places the response of the GMI magnetic sensor electronics in a condition where the sensor's remaining dynamic range to a small measured field can be better processed. From this point forward, magnetic field disturbances can be measured by the GMI magnetic sensor  as they occur.","Referring to  there is illustrated a diagram of a tuning circuit  referred to above for use in an impedance matching network  that can implement the above described impedance compensation method . An integrated microcontroller  manages the tuning process and switches in the appropriate components of the tuning circuit  according to established algorithms. Automatic antenna tuners utilize phase detectors during the matching process. In the present invention an integrated, ultra-low power phase detector  is switched into the GMI fiber circuit to measure and determine whether the reactance of the added geo-field has been equalized out. In all cases, the phase detector  should read the same after compensation as it did when the \u201czero geo-field\u201d measurement was performed.","The complexity of the impedance matching network will depend on the type of reactance the GMI fiber  exhibits in the geo-field (as determined by the phase detector ), as well as the magnitude of the impedance excursion under the geo-field. If (in the simplest case) the GMI fiber is only resistive and never becomes reactive in the geo-field, the microcontroller  switches in the appropriate combination of series and parallel resistors of the tuning circuit  such that the tuning circuit  consists of a digitally-controlled potentiometer, thereby restoring the resistance of the GMI fiber  to the resistance it exhibited in the zero geo-field environment.","If the GMI fiber reactance in the geo-field is inductive, then the microcontroller  switches in the appropriate combination of series and parallel capacitors (and possibly resistors) of the tuning circuit  such that the tuning circuit  nulls out the inductive reactance. The process of capacitor switching, where different combinations of capacitance are switched in and out to tune an electronic circuit is known in the art and is implemented on the microcontroller  according to established algorithms, using the available information from the manufacturer's impedance measurements on the GMI fiber . Integrated capacitors can be manufactured with high precision with a microscopic \u201cfootprint,\u201d suitable for the ultra-low power application described here. Surface-mount capacitors are readily available and are extremely small. In an alternative embodiment, another means of adjusting the tuning circuit capacitance is to use a varactor diode. However, these require a variable direct current voltage that must be included in the circuitry in such a way as to avoid disturbing the normal operation of the GMI fiber.","If GMI fiber reactance in the geo-field is capacitive, then the microcontroller  switches in the appropriate combination of series and parallel inductors (and possible resistors) of the tuning circuit  such that the tuning circuit  nulls out the capacitive reactance. The process of inductor switching, where different combinations of inductance are switched in and out to tune an electronic circuit is known in the art and is implemented on the microcontroller  according to established algorithms, using the available information from the manufacturer's impedance measurements on the GMI fiber. Surface-mount inductors are extremely small and can be switched in. Other new techniques for miniaturizing inductors using ultra-flat planar structures (i.e., thin metal coils deposited on insulating sheets or substrates) are available.","The advantages of the present invention, an impedance compensation method of nulling the geo-field in a Giant Magneto-Impedance magnetic sensor, over the prior art is the elimination of the large three dimensional magnetic compensation coil, which is expensive and labor-intensive to manufacture, thereby allowing miniaturization of the magnetic sensor. The present invention leverages algorithms, circuits, and techniques of field-proven, well-defined automatic antenna matching units on an ultra-low power (no more than milli-watts), miniaturized scale. The control algorithms of the microprocessor in the impedance matching network can be custom-tailored to the type of impedance changes that occur for manufacturer's specific fiber composition, making it less complex than that in an antenna tuner (which has to essentially match an unknown reactive load that can have large excursions). There is a great deal of suitability of incorporating the impedance matching network, control circuitry and switching components into an application-specific integrated circuit. Fabrication techniques for manufacturing ultra-low-profile, miniaturized planar inductors (including etching metal films on thin dielectric sheets) are becoming more practical for this purpose. The manufacturing is easier for capacitors and resistors. There is a lower cost to manufacture a matching network due to the use of readily-available, general-purpose RF components. Because there is no geo-field compensation magnetic coil wrapped around the fiber it is now fully exposed to the environment and therefore its capture sensitivity is preserved.","In light of the above, it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following description of the preferred embodiments and to the drawings, wherein corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings and wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
