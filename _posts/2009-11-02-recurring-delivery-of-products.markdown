title: Recurring delivery of products
abstract: Technologies are described herein for providing recurring delivery of products to a customer on a periodic basis. A customer creates a recurring delivery list that specifies a particular delivery slot indicating when orders are to be delivered. The customer adds products to the recurring delivery list, specifying a quantity and frequency of delivery for each product. Orders are periodically generated from the customer's recurring delivery list for delivery on the next occurrence of the specified delivery slot. The products included in each order are based on the frequency of delivery and a last delivery date for each product in the recurring delivery list. If the customer makes changes to the recurring delivery list, those changes may also be applied to any pending orders generated from the list.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Many types of products may be purchased online for delivery directly to a customer, including grocery items and other consumables. Delivery of consumable products may present special challenges to online merchants of such products. For instance, these types of products may be perishable or have a limited shelf life, requiring different inventory control, delivery, and other logistic processes for these types of products. Challenges may also be presented to a customer that orders consumable products from an online merchant. For instance, the customer may need to repeatedly place orders for the same consumable products on a regular basis, and the customer may have to track the shipment of the products to arrange to be present at delivery in order to ensure that perishable goods do not spoil.","Some online merchant systems may provide customers the ability to place standing orders for delivery of consumable products on a recurring basis, such as every week or every month. However, these systems may be limited in their flexibility for allowing modifications of the recurring orders or for allowing the addition of one-time or specialty products to an order. Further, the customer may not be able to schedule the recurring orders for the same time and day of each week or month, thereby making it difficult for the customer to arrange to be present at the delivery of perishable goods or other consumables.","It is with respect to these and other considerations that the disclosure made herein is presented.","The following detailed description is directed to technologies for providing recurring delivery of products to a customer on a periodic basis, without requiring the customer repeatedly place orders for the products. According to embodiments, a customer may create a recurring deliver list that specifies a list of products for recurring delivery in a merchant system. The recurring delivery list identifies each product to be delivered on a recurring basis, as well as a quantity and frequency of delivery for each. For instance, a customer may request delivery of one bunch of bananas every week and two gallons of milk every two weeks.","The customer may also specify a particular delivery slot when the recurring orders are to be delivered. The delivery slot specifies the day and time for the delivery of the recurring orders. For example, the customer may specify a particular time period on a particular day of the week, such as 7:00-8:00 AM on Tuesdays or 1:00-2:00 PM on Thursdays. In one embodiment, the customer may be able to specify a delivery slot that is designated as \u201cunattended.\u201d An unattended delivery is one in which the customer need not be present during the delivery of the products, such as pre-dawn on Mondays.","The merchant system may periodically generate an order from the customer's recurring delivery list for delivery on the next occurrence of the specified delivery slot. For example, the merchant system may check the frequency of delivery of each product identified in the recurring delivery list along with a last delivery date for that product to determine if the product should be included in a generated order. If so, then the quantity of the product specified in the recurring delivery list is added to the order.","In one embodiment, the order may be generated in advance of the scheduled delivery of the order so that the order remains pending for a period of time before delivery. For example, the merchant system may generate orders for weekly delivery seven days in advance. Moreover, any changes made to the recurring delivery list may be applied to any pending orders generated from the list. These changes may include changes to the quantity or frequency of delivery of products identified in the list, or the suspension of delivery of a particular product for a specified period of time or indefinitely.","Because the customer may specify a particular delivery slot for the delivery of the orders generated from the recurring delivery list, including unattended delivery slots, the customer is able to precisely manage the delivery schedule, thus avoiding many of the challenges presented by the delivery of perishable goods or other consumables. In addition, because the orders generated from the recurring delivery list remain pending for a period of time in advance of delivery, the customer has the flexibility to add specialty products or one-time products to the currently pending order, while any changes made by the customer to the recurring delivery list during the period of pendency will be reflected in the pending order as well.","It should be appreciated that the subject matter presented herein may be implemented as computer process, a computer-controlled apparatus, a computing system, or an article of manufacture, such as a computer-readable storage medium. These and various other features will become apparent from a reading of the following disclosure and a review of the associated drawings.","While the subject matter described herein is presented in the general context of program modules that execute on one or more computing devices, those skilled in the art will recognize that other implementations may be performed in combination with other types of program modules. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, components, data structures, and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced on or in conjunction with other computer system configurations beyond those described below, including multiprocessor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, minicomputers, mainframe computers, handheld computers, personal digital assistants, cellular telephone devices, special-purposed hardware devices, network appliances, and the like.

The merchant system  may include a number of application servers  that provide various application services to the customer computer  over the network . The customer  may use a client application program executing on the customer computer , such as a web browser, to access and utilize the services provided by the application servers  across the network . Alternatively, the customer computer  may utilize any number of communication methods known in the art to communicate with the merchant system  and\/or the application servers  across the network , including proprietary client-server architectures, e-mail, short message service (\u201cSMS\u201d) messaging, or other messaging technologies, and the like.","The application servers  may execute a number of modules in order to provide the services to the customer computer . The modules may execute on a single application server  or in parallel across multiple application servers in the merchant system . In addition, each module may consist of a number of subcomponents executing on different application servers  or other computing devices in the merchant system . The modules may be implemented as software, hardware, or any combination of the two.","According to one embodiment, a recurring delivery module  executes on the application servers . The recurring delivery module  provides services to the customer computer  that allow the customer  to select products for recurring delivery, specify a quantity and frequency of delivery for each product, specify a delivery address, specify a delivery slot for the delivery of the products, and specify a payment method for the delivery. The customer  may make these selections through a user interface (\u201cUI\u201d) presented by the recurring delivery module  to the customer at the customer computer , as will be described below in regard to . The recurring delivery module  may present the UI to the customer  by sending a series of web pages to be rendered by a browser application executing on the customer computer , for example. Alternatively, the recurring delivery module  may receive the selections from the customer computer  by means of a messaging technology, such as SMS messaging or e-mail, or through a number of application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) exposed by the recurring delivery module. It will be appreciated that any number of methods and technologies may be utilized that allow the recurring delivery module  to receive these selections and other input data from the customer , and it is intended that all such methods and technologies be included within the scope of this application.","The recurring delivery module  may store the customer's selections of products for recurring delivery in a recurring delivery list . The recurring delivery list  may be a data structure that stores the identity of the selected products as well as the parameters for the products' recurring delivery, as will be described in more detail below in regard to . The recurring delivery list  may be stored in a data storage system , such as a database server, that is accessible by the application servers  and other components of the merchant system . In a further embodiment, the recurring delivery module  provides services to the customer computer  that allow the customer  to manage the product selections and other parameters in the recurring delivery list , such as changing the quantity and\/or frequency of delivery of a product or suspending the delivery of a product for a specified period or indefinitely. The customer  may manage the recurring delivery list  through a UI presented by the recurring delivery module  to the customer at the customer computer , as will be described below in regard to , or through some other method or technology implemented by the recurring delivery module.","As will be described in more detail below, the recurring delivery module  periodically generates an order  for the delivery of one or more products identified in the recurring delivery list , according to the parameters contained therein. In one embodiment, the recurring delivery module  utilizes an order module  executing on the application servers  to generate the orders. The order module  may be part of an existing order processing system within the merchant system , or the order module may be provided by an order processing system separate from the merchant system. The order module  in turn may create an order  in the data storage system  for the delivery of the products desired by the customer . The order  identifies the products to be delivered to the customer as well as the parameters for delivery of the products, as will be described in more detail below in regard to . The order module  may further provide services to the recurring delivery module  or directly to the customer computer  via the network  that allow the order  to be modified or canceled once it has been generated.","Once the order  is generated, it is made available to an order fulfillment system  for processing and delivery to the customer . The order fulfillment system  may consist of a variety of components, including, but not limited to, an order processing component, a billing component, an inventory control component, an order picking component, a delivery scheduling component, and other logistics and control systems. All of the components that make up the order fulfillment system  may be included in the merchant system , or some or all of the components may be provided by external providers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIGS. 2 and 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["126","126","102","126","202","124","126","204","102","120","102","126","126","102"]},"The recurring delivery list  may contain a delivery address  for the delivery of the selected products. In one embodiment, the delivery address  is an identifier of a shipping address maintained in the profile data for the customer . In other embodiments, the delivery address may contain a specific street address of a location where delivery is to take place.","The recurring delivery list  also contains a delivery slot  identifying when the delivery of orders generated from the recurring delivery list should occur. The delivery slot  may be an identifier of one of a number of predetermined periods of time within a recurring delivery cycle that may be scheduled for delivery. For example, if the recurring delivery module  generates an order from the recurring delivery list  on a weekly basis, i.e. a weekly delivery cycle, the predetermined periods may consist of a range of times, such as 7:00-8:00 AM, on a particular day of the week, such as Tuesday. For a monthly delivery cycle, then the predetermined periods may similarly be a range of times, such as 7:00-8:00 AM, on a particular day of the month, such as the 23day. It will be appreciated that for recurring delivery cycles other than weekly or monthly, the predetermined periods may differ from those described herein. In a further embodiment, the predetermined periods may be target times for delivery, such as 7:15 AM, instead of the range of times described above. In all cases, the predetermined periods of time within the recurring delivery cycle may be selected to allow the merchant flexibility in scheduling delivery of orders, while ensuring that the customer  may easily arrange to be present at the specified delivery time.","In one embodiment, the delivery slot  may specify a predetermined period of time designated as an \u201cunattended\u201d delivery slot. An unattended delivery slot is a period of time for delivery where the customer  need not be present when the delivery occurs. For example, the customer  may be able to schedule unattended delivery of the orders generated from the recurring delivery list  for pre-dawn on Tuesdays, or from 3:00-6:00 PM on Thursdays. Unattended delivery slots may be broader periods of time than the \u201cattended\u201d delivery slots described above, providing the merchant greater flexibility in scheduling delivery of orders to the customer. The unattended delivery slots may also provide additional flexibility to the customer  by not requiring that the customer be present during delivery, but ensuring that the customer's products will be delivered by a particular day and time.","It will be appreciated that certain products may not be eligible for unattended delivery, such as items requiring a verification of age by delivery personnel before relinquishing the products to the customer . In one embodiment, the recurring delivery module  may alert the customer  when ineligible products are added to a recurring delivery list  specifying an unattended delivery slot. In other embodiments, the recurring delivery module  or the order fulfillment system  may implement other contingency procedures for the ineligible products.","The recurring delivery list  may further contain a payment method  for orders generated from the recurring delivery list. In one embodiment, the payment method  is an identifier of a particular method of payment maintained in the profile data for the customer . In other embodiments, the payment method  may contain credit card information, checking account information, or other information describing a method of payment for the generated orders.","According to embodiments, the recurring delivery list  further contains one or more list items A-C (also referred to herein as list item ) identifying the products added to the recurring delivery list. Each list item  may contain a product stock-keeping unit (\u201cSKU\u201d)  that uniquely identifies the product selected by the customer . The list item  also contains a quantity  indicating the number of the product to be delivered in each generated order that includes the selected product.","In addition, the list item  contains a frequency of delivery  and a last delivery date  for the selected product. The frequency of delivery  may be a multiple of the recurring delivery cycle described above. For example, for a weekly delivery cycle, the frequency of delivery  may specify a number of weeks that should occur between successive deliveries of the selected product. The last delivery date  may specify the date that the selected product was last scheduled for delivery in an order generated from the recurring delivery list . In one embodiment, the recurring delivery module  utilizes the frequency of delivery  and the last delivery date  of each list item  to identify the products that are to be included in the orders generated from the recurring delivery list , as will be described in more detail below in regard to .","In a further embodiment, the list item  also contains a paused-to date . As described above in regard to , the recurring delivery module  may allow the customer  to suspend the delivery of a product for a specified period of time or indefinitely. The recurring delivery module  may utilize the paused-to date  to indicate that delivery of the selected product is currently suspended, or \u201cpaused,\u201d until the date specified by the paused-to date . It will be appreciated that the paused-to date  may contain a specific, pre-defined date value to indicate that delivery of the selected product is suspended indefinitely. It will be further appreciated that the recurring delivery list  may contain additional data elements beyond those shown in  and described above that may be utilized by the recurring delivery module  to provide recurring delivery of products to the customer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["132","126","132","132","302","124","130","140","120","132","202","204","126","202","126","204","132","102","120","132","206","210","126","140"]},"The order  may also contain a date and time for delivery  for the order.

According to one embodiment, the list of products is received from the customer  through a user interface  presented to the customer at the customer computer , as described above in regard to . The customer  may utilize the user interface  to specify one or more products to add to the recurring delivery list , along with a quantity  and frequency of delivery  for each.","In another embodiment, the recurring delivery module  generates a suggested list of products by analyzing profile data maintained for the customer  in the merchant system . For example, the recurring delivery module  may utilize the purchase history of the customer  along with other profile information, such as age, gender, income level, interests, search history, etc., to select products that should be delivered to the customer on a recurring basis. The recurring delivery module  may further couple this information with data identifying the number of people in the customer's household and\/or information regarding the shelf life of the selected products to determine an appropriate quantity  and frequency of delivery  for each product. This automatic generation of the list of products may be performed when the recurring delivery list  is initially created by the customer , for example.","In a further embodiment, the recurring delivery module  may retrieve the list of products to add to the recurring delivery list  from an existing order of the customer . For example, after placing a traditional order in the merchant system , the customer  may be given the option to add some or all of the products in the order to their recurring delivery list . If the customer  selects the option to add the products from the order to the recurring delivery list , the recurring delivery module  may add a list item  to the recurring delivery list for each product in the order. The recurring delivery module  may then present the user interface  to the customer  to allow the customer to change the quantity  and\/or frequency of delivery  of each newly added product, as described above in regard to .","The recurring delivery module  may also receive a specification of a delivery slot  for the recurring delivery list . The specification of the delivery slot  may also be received from the customer  through a user interface  presented to the customer at the customer computer , as described above in regard to . As described above in regard to , the delivery slot  may be an identifier of one of a number of predetermined periods of time within the recurring delivery cycle that may be scheduled for delivery. In one embodiment, the specification of the delivery slot  may further include a designation of an unattended-type delivery or an attended-type delivery, as further described above in regard to .","It will be appreciated that the recurring delivery module  may receive the list of products to add to the recurring delivery list  and the specification of a delivery slot  from sources other than those described herein. Upon receiving the list of products and the delivery slot , the recurring delivery module  may create the recurring delivery list  in the data storage system  with the specified delivery slot and a list item  for each of the products. The quantity  and frequency of delivery  for each list item  are also established from the received values.","From operation , the routine  proceeds to operation , where the recurring delivery module  periodically generates an order  from the recurring delivery list . As described above in regard to , the recurring delivery module  may use services provided by the order module  to generate the order . The period of generation of the orders  may depend on the recurring delivery cycle. For example, for a weekly delivery cycle, the recurring delivery module  may generate an order  from the recurring delivery list  each calendar week. The order  may be generated with a date and time for delivery  corresponding to the next occurrence of the delivery slot  specified in the recurring delivery list . In addition, the recurring delivery module  may generate the order  from the recurring delivery list  in advance of the date and time for delivery , so that the order remains pending for a period of time before delivery. In one embodiment, the recurring delivery module  may generate orders  seven days in advance for a weekly delivery cycle.","The routine  proceeds from operation  to operation , where the recurring delivery module  creates order items  for the generated order  from the list items  in the recurring delivery list . The recurring delivery module  may utilize the frequency of delivery  and the last delivery date  of each list item  to determine which products to include in the order . For example, if the frequency of delivery  of a list item  specifies that a product is to be delivered every two weeks, and the last delivery date  of the list item indicates that the item was delivered at least two weeks prior to the date and time for delivery  of the generated order , then an order item  is added to the order with the product SKU  and quantity  from the corresponding list item. In a further embodiment, the recurring delivery module  also checks the paused-to date  of the list item  to ensure that the delivery of the product has not been paused by the customer  before adding the order item  to the order .","From operation , the routine  proceeds to operation , where the products specified in the order items  of the generated order  are delivered to the customer effectively on the date and time for delivery  of the order. As described above in regard to , the delivery of the order  may be performed by an order fulfillment system  within the merchant system . The order fulfillment system  may be required to perform additional processing because of the automatic nature of the orders  generated from the recurring delivery list . For example, the order fulfillment system  may be required to substitute equivalent products for products included in the order  that are out of stock or discontinued. The substitution of equivalent items may be an option selected by the customer , either globally for the recurring delivery list  or on a list item  by list item basis. The substitution of equivalent items for products that are discontinued may be made in both the pending order  as well as the recurring delivery list .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0086","num":"0085"},"figref":["FIG. 13","FIG. 12"],"b":["1300","126","132","1300","124","1300","120","124","132","126","304","126","132"]},"The routine  begins at operation , where the recurring delivery module  receives the changes made to the recurring delivery list .

If the recurring delivery module  determines there is not a currently pending order , the routine  ends.","If the recurring delivery module  determines there is a currently pending order  generated from the recurring delivery list , the routine  proceeds to operation , where the recurring delivery module  applies the changes made to the recurring delivery list  to pending order . For example, changes made to the quantity  of a list item  in the recurring delivery list  may also be made to the quantity  of any corresponding order item  in the order . Or, if changes made to the frequency of delivery  of a list item  indicate that the product identified by the list item is no longer scheduled for delivery on the date and time of delivery  of the pending order , then the order item  corresponding to the list item may be removed from the pending order.","It will be appreciated that the recurring delivery module  may similarly apply other changes made to the recurring delivery list  or the list items  to the corresponding pending order  or order items . It will be further appreciated that the recurring delivery module  may selectively apply some changes made to the recurring delivery list  to the pending order , while not applying others changes made to the recurring delivery list. For example, if the customer  changes the delivery slot  specified for the recurring delivery list , the recurring delivery module  may apply the change to future orders  generated from the recurring delivery list, while leaving the date and time for delivery  of the currently pending order unchanged.
