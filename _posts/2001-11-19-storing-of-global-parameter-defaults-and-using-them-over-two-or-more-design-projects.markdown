No. 10\/033,027, entitled \u201cPROGRAMMABLE MICROCONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE,\u201d filed on Oct. 22, 2001, and with inventor Warren Snyder is hereby incorporated by reference.","The invention relates generally to the field of circuit design applications, more particularly to a system and method for selecting and storing global parameters.","It is often useful to utilize circuit design application software to layout and plan new integrated circuits. This circuit design application software is typically configured to aide the user in keeping track of resource requirements of particular modules. Furthermore, circuit design application software also allows users to assign circuit resources to particular modules.","However, circuit design software applications typically have minimal graphical support. They usually are not capable of supplying the user with a graphical display representing a current status of the layout of the resources on a chip. Chip designers are typically required to manually and textually track their layout decisions with minimal graphical support.","Furthermore, selection of global parameters such as clock speed, phase locked loop mode, and the like were set by manually writing application programming interfaces to provide these settings and parameters. The process of writing application programming interfaces is often times error-prone and requires knowledge of many low level technical requirements and requires many manual steps. For example, users typically need to find register information on the data sheet for particular hardware elements in order to properly set the register. In addition, since the global parameters effect many elements within the hardware, the application programming interfaces can become very long and complex. Moreover, once written, the global parameter settings are applicable only to the project for which they were developed. In order to establish the global parameters for another project, they have to be manually reprogrammed.","It is useful to provide a circuit designer with a circuit design application software that allows the viewing, selection, and storage of global parameter values through a simplified user interface. For example, being able to graphically display the current global parameter values and possible global parameter values would be useful. Further, being able to graphically select a global parameter value from the possible global parameter values would also be beneficial. Further, being able to store a set of default global parameter settings which can be recalled and associated with different projects would be beneficial.","A system and method are described for graphically displaying global resources and their associated parameter values and applying them over multiple design projects. The system and method also provide a graphical interface which displays the possible parameter values of an associated global resource. This graphical interface utilizes a pop up menu for viewing the possible parameter values and the selection of the current parameter value. The system and method also provide tracking and updating of the hardware resources which utilize the parameter values of the global resources. Further, the system also allows the storage of these parameters values of the global resources. By storing these parameter values of the global resources, these parameter values can be set as default global settings. These default global settings can be readily recalled and associated with different projects without manual entry of the parameter values. Therefore, a set of predefined and saved global parameter defaults can be associated with multiple projects by merely causing a name associated with the default global parameters to be associated with the new project.","In one embodiment, the global parameters can be presented on a display screen in a tabular form with parameter name and the associated default or current setting shown next to the parameter name. The user can change the value of the parameter by selecting the displayed value with a cursor control device. A pop up window can then be used to select a new value. The values selected in the tabular display are then applied to the user's integrated circuit design. Alternate integer entry is provided for numeric inputs. Direct number entry or spinner control with min\/max checking is allowed, e.g., 24V1=24 MHz\/N and 24V2=24 V1\/N. Storage of these values for global resources allows different projects to adopt the same default global settings. In effect, the default global parameter settings can be given a name and then associated with various projects without the user having to separately enter (or remember) each setting value. An on-screen selection can be used to recall the default global settings and then apply them to a particular project.","More specifically, in a design system for programming integrated circuits, an embodiment of the present invention is drawn to a method of processing global design parameters comprising: a) displaying, in tabular form, a list of global design parameters and respective global design parameter values associated therewith for a first design project; b) in response to a user selection of a selected global design parameter, displaying a window comprising a plurality of possible values for the selected global design parameter; c) in response to a user selection of a selected value of the possible values, assigning the selected global design parameter to the selected value; d) saving the selected global design parameter; and applying said global design parameters and parameter values to a second design project.","Embodiments include the above and further comprising: selecting the selected global design parameter; and selecting the selected value wherein the selectings are performed using a cursor control device.","Embodiments include the above and further comprising: updating a memory resident database comprising the global design parameters and associated values; and propagating the global design parameters and associated values across a user circuit design for an integrated circuit to be programmed.","Embodiments include the above and wherein the integrated circuit to be programmed is a programmable microcontroller circuit and wherein the window comprises a pop-up list.","Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and illustrated by way of example of the principles of the invention.","Specific reference is made in detail to the embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The system  allows the global resources and their associated parameter values to be viewed and modified.

The video processor  is configured to display the global resources, the parameter values of the global resources, and the menu displaying the possible parameter values for a global resource.","The global resource database  tracks data stored within the specific locations of the various hardware resources which are affected by individual global resources. In one embodiment, the resource global resource database  tracks the locations of specific registers relating to hardware resources for maintaining the correct global resource parameter value associated with a specific hardware resource.","The global resource menu  generates graphical information which displays a global resources window. This global resources window includes the display of the global resources and the associated parameter values. In one embodiment, the information can be presented in a tabular form. The global resource menu  also generates graphical information which displays a pop up menu that shows the possible parameter values associated with a specific global resource. In one embodiment, the global resource menu  is configured to provide the possible parameter values associated with the specific global resource and provide shading or highlighting of one of the possible parameter values prior to selection by a user.","Alternate integer entry is provided for numeric inputs. Direct number entry or spinner control with min\/max checking is allowed, e.g., 24V1=24 MHz\/N and 24V2=24 V1\/N.","The global resource parameter selector  accepts the specific global resource parameter value in response to the graphical information from the global resource menu . Further, the global resource parameter selector  communicates with the global resource database  and records this specific global resource parameter value in the appropriate registers of the hardware resources. Further, the global resource parameter selector  also provides the ability to store multiple selected parameter values as the default global settings. The default global settings can then be recalled and associated with various other design projects without the user having to separately enter or select each parameter value.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 2A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 1"],"b":["210","110"]},"In Block , a global resources window is graphically displayed. The global resources window includes a graphical display of the global resources and their associated parameter values. A global resource may include CPU clock speed, phase lock loop mode, sleep timer, analog power, clock divider ratio, and the like.

This is performed, in one implementation, by user control. In one embodiment, the highlight or selection of the global resource parameter value is in response to the user input interface  (FIG. ).","In Block , the possible parameter values of the global resource corresponding with the highlighted global resource parameter value are graphically displayed in a display screen, e.g., a pop up menu. The possible parameter values displayed on the pop up menu depend on the associated global resource. For example, the possible parameter values for the global resource \u201cphase locked loop mode\u201d is either \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d. Another example, the possible parameter values for the global resource \u201cCPU clock speed\u201d can be a variety of numerical values and is not limited to an on or off function. Alternate integer entry is provided for numeric inputs. Direct number entry or spinner control with min\/max checking is allowed, e.g., 24V1=24 MHz\/N and 24V2=24 V1\/N.","Further, in the Block , a selection of a current parameter value for the associated global resource from one of the possible parameter values also occurs. After the current parameter value is selected, the current parameter value is propagated to all hardware resources with the help of the global resource database .","In Block , the information within the global resource database  is updated with the current parameter values of the associated corresponding global resources.","In Block , current global parameter values are stored as the default global settings.

For instance, the user can assign a name to the set of saved global parameters, e.g., \u201cDefault_Set.\u201d","At step  of , the user then starts or recalls a second design project. At step , the user can recall the saved set of default global parameters, e.g., \u201cDefault_Set,\u201d and apply them to the second design project thereby avoiding the problem of defining a new set of global parameters for the second design project.
