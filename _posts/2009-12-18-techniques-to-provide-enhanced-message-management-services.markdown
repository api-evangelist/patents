{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, have become highly capable communication devices in recent years. In addition to the wide array of processing capabilities such as digital assistant (PDA) features, including word processing, spreadsheets, synchronization of information (e.g., email) with a desktop computer, and so forth, mobile computing devices also typically include wireless communications capabilities to provide features, such as mobile telephony, mobile email access, web browsing, and content (e.g., video and radio) reception. Exemplary wireless communications technologies include cellular, satellite, and mobile data networking technologies.","Providing such a wide array of functionality in a single device results in increased power requirements. As the amount of power required to provide the ever increasing array of capabilities continues to increase, conservation of power becomes an important consideration. As a result, it is desirable to adapt the power consumption of a mobile computing device, when possible, to conserve power. It is with respect to these and other reasons that techniques to improve management of operating parameters for a mobile computing device are needed.","Various embodiments are generally directed to techniques to provide enhanced message management services for a mobile computing device, such as a smart phone, for example. Some embodiments are particularly directed to techniques to provide enhanced message management services to control message communication based on communication parameters and transmission quality. This may enhance behavior and performance for various hardware and\/or software components of the mobile computing device, such as power conservation, for example.","As a mobile computing device changes locations so does its corresponding operating environment. This may significantly affect wireless communications for radios implemented by a mobile computing device. For example, a mobile computing device may experience lower transmission quality, or even lose connection, as it moves away from a wireless resource, such as a fixed wireless access point or cellular base station. In some cases, obstacles may move within a given operating environment for a stationary mobile computing device, thereby also affecting wireless transmission characteristics. When a mobile computing device experiences lower transmission quality as a result of changes in an operating environment, an amount of bandwidth available to communicate information from the mobile computing device suffers as well. At the same time, many applications, services and features implemented by a mobile computing device are increasingly designed for larger bandwidth channels. For instance, a mobile computing device may send messages with larger audio, video or image files as attachments. As a result, when a mobile computing device attempts to send a message with larger attachments through an operating environment providing lower transmission rates, there may be significant impact on device performance. For example, a radio module or wireless transceiver may consume more power thereby shortening battery life. In another example, a radio module or wireless transceiver may consume more processing cycles or memory resources thereby affecting other applications or services provided by a mobile computing device.","To solve these and other problems, a mobile computing device may implement one or more enhanced message management services to manage communication of messages based on transmission characteristics of an operating environment. In one embodiment, for example, a mobile computing device may include, among other elements, a radio module operative to establish a wireless communication channel with a wireless resource, such as a fixed wireless access point or cellular base station or Node B. The mobile computing device may further include a message manager communicatively coupled to the radio module. The message manager may be arranged to receive a message size parameter for a message. The message and\/or message size parameter may be generated from a messaging application, such as an email application, for example. The message manager may determine a first time parameter representing a length of time needed to communicate the message based on an available bandwidth parameter. The available bandwidth parameter may be received from a radio manager, or derived from information received from the radio manager. The message manager may determine a second time parameter representing a length of time available to communicate the message based on an available power parameter. The power parameter may be received from a power manager, or derived from information received from the power manager. The message manager may then generate and send a transmit control directive to the radio module indicating whether to communicate the message over the wireless communication channel based on the first and second time parameters.","The message manager may automatically generate a transmit control directive using a set of rules in a rules database, or generate a transmit control directive by soliciting user commands via a user interface and input device for the mobile computing device. Additionally or alternatively, the message manager may attempt to modify one or more communication parameters in an attempt to reduce power consumption at a cost of reduced transmission quality, or vice-versa.","Various embodiments may comprise one or more elements. An element may comprise any structure arranged to perform certain operations. Each element may be implemented as hardware, software, or any combination thereof, as desired for a given set of design parameters or performance constraints. Although an embodiment may be described with a limited number of elements, nodes or modules in a certain topology by way of example, the embodiment may include other combinations of elements, nodes or modules in alternate arrangements as desired for a given implementation. It is worthy to note that any reference to \u201cone embodiment\u201d or \u201can embodiment\u201d means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase \u201cin one embodiment\u201d in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. It should also be understood that the use of the term control to refer to data and\/or signals throughout the application can refer to data flowing in any direction as control and\/or status data or signals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","1","130","1","110","102","103","104","105","106","108","112","114","106","107","108","109"],"i":["m ","n"]},"In some embodiments, one or more interfaces may employ various techniques to exchange information between the elements of the mobile computing device . For example, an interface may activate and\/or detect activated signal lines. Such signal lines may be dedicated to particular signals. Alternatively, an interface may generate data messages to be transmitted across various connections. Exemplary connections may include a parallel interface, a serial interface, a bus interface, and\/or a data network.","In various embodiments, the mobile computing device  may be generally configured to support or provide cellular voice communication, wireless data communication and computing capabilities. The mobile computing device  may be implemented as a combination handheld computer and mobile telephone, sometimes referred to as a smart phone. Examples of smart phones include, for example, Palm\u00ae products such as the Palm Pre\u2122, Palm Pixi\u2122 and Palm Treo\u2122 line of smart phones. Although some embodiments may be described with the mobile computing device  implemented as a smart phone by way of example, it may be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example, the mobile computing device  may comprise, or be implemented as, any type of wireless device, mobile station, or portable computing device with a self-contained power source (e.g., battery) such as a laptop computer, ultra-laptop computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, combination cellular telephone\/PDA, mobile unit, subscriber station, user terminal, portable computer, handheld computer, palmtop computer, wearable computer, media player, pager, messaging device, data communication device, and so forth. Additional details for a mobile computing device may be described in more detail with reference to .","The processor  may comprise a general purpose processor, a communications processor or an application specific processor arranged to provide general or specific computing capabilities for the communications system . For example, the processor  may perform operations associated with higher layer protocols and applications. For instance, the processor  may be implemented as a host processor to provide various user applications, such as telephony, text messaging, email, web browsing, word processing, video signal display, and so forth. In addition, the processor  may provide one or more functional utilities that are available to various protocols, operations, and\/or applications. Examples of such utilities include operating systems, device drivers, user interface functionality, and so forth.","The memory  may comprise computer-readable media such as volatile or non-volatile memory units arranged to store programs and data for execution by the processor . As depicted in , the memory  may store a message manager  in the form of executable program instructions, code or data. Additionally or alternatively, the memory  may also store a messaging application , and\/or a user interface  in the form of executable program instructions, code or data. The processor  may retrieve and execute the program instructions, code or data from the memory  to adaptively control one or more operational parameters for the mobile computing device , such as operation and\/or communication parameters of the radio module . Although the message manager , the messaging application  and the user interface  are described as part of the memory  for execution by the processor , it may be appreciated that the message manager , the messaging application  and\/or the user interface  may be stored and executed by other memory and processing resources available to the mobile computing device , such as a radio or communications processor and accompanying memory implemented by the radio module . Further, although the message manager , the messaging application  and the user interface  are depicted as software executed by a processor, it may be appreciated that some or all of these elements may be implemented in hardware as well using one or more integrated circuits, for example. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","The radio module  may comprise one or more radios or wireless transceivers, each having various radio elements, including a radio processor, one or more transceivers, amplifiers, filters, switches, and so forth. The radio module  may communicate with remote devices across different types of wireless links utilizing various wireless wide area network (WWAN) communications techniques. For example, the radio module  may communicate across wireless links provided by one or more cellular radiotelephone systems. Examples of cellular radiotelephone systems may include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, GSM systems, North American Digital Cellular (NADC) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Extended-TDMA (E-TDMA) systems, Narrowband Advanced Mobile Phone Service (NAMPS) systems, third generation (3G) systems such as Wide-band CDMA (WCDMA), CDMA-2000, Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) systems, and so forth. The radio module  (or additional radio modules) may also communicate across data networking links provided by one or more cellular radiotelephone systems. Examples of cellular radiotelephone systems offering data communications services may include GSM with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) systems (GSM\/GPRS), CDMA\/1xRTT systems, Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE) systems, Evolution Data Only or Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO) systems, Evolution For Data and Voice (EV-DV) systems, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) systems, High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), and so forth. The embodiments, however, are not limited to these examples.","In some cases, the radio module  may additionally or alternatively communicate across various non-cellular communications links, such as a wireless local area network (WLAN). The radio module  may be arranged to provide voice and\/or data communications functionality in accordance with different types of wireless network systems or protocols. Examples of suitable wireless network systems offering data communication services may include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.xx series of protocols, such as the IEEE 802.11a\/b\/g\/n series of standard protocols and variants (also referred to as \u201cWiFi\u201d), the IEEE 802.16 series of standard protocols and variants (also referred to as \u201cWiMAX\u201d), the IEEE 802.20 series of standard protocols and variants, and so forth.","The mobile computing device  may also utilize different types of shorter range wireless systems, or wireless personal area networks (WPAN) such as a Bluetooth system operating in accordance with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) series of protocols, including Bluetooth Specification versions v1.0, v1.1, v1.2, v1.0, v2.0, v2.1, v3.0 with Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) (as well as one or more Bluetooth Profiles) and any revisions, progeny and variants, and so forth. Other examples may include systems using infrared techniques or near-field communication techniques and protocols, such as electro-magnetic induction (EMI) techniques. An example of EMI techniques may include passive or active radio-frequency identification (RFID) protocols and devices.","It may be appreciated that the radio module  may utilize different communications elements (e.g., radio processors, transceivers, etc.) to implement different communications techniques. Furthermore, the radio module  may support multiple communications techniques by implementing multiple sets of corresponding radio equipment. For example, the radio module  may support GSM communications using a first transceiver, IEEE 802.xx (e.g., 802.11) communications using a second transceiver, Bluetooth communications using a third transceiver, and so forth. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","The radio module  may have a radio manager  arranged to control some or all of the operations for the radio module . For instance, the radio manager  may cause one or more radios implemented by the radio module  to periodically or continuously scan wireless shared media, such as one or more portions of the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum. The radio module  may implement a scanning algorithm to perform various scanning operations for radio energy. Radio energy may refer to RF energy used by a radio or wireless transceiver for communicating information, rather than spurious energy received from various electronic devices, such as a microwave, monitor, television, and so forth. For example, the radio module  and\/or the radio manager  may measure a received radio signal strength, received signal strength (RSS) or received signal strength indication (RSSI) from nearby wireless resources (collectively referred to herein as \u201cRSSI\u201d). An RSSI is typically a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal in arbitrary units. The RSSI may provide an indication of how much information may be communicated between devices. Typically a lower RSSI implies lower information rates or quality, while a higher RSSI implies higher information rates or quality.","The scanning operations may include scanning for radio energy of a given RSSI in the appropriate bands or sub-bands of the RF spectrum allocated to the one or more transceivers or radios implemented by the radio module . For example, the radio module  may scan for various radio signals --received from various wireless resources --. The wireless resources --may utilize a radio module implementing the same or similar communication techniques as implemented for the radio module . The radio module  may perform the scanning operations using a scan list to scan various sets of frequencies. The radio module  may perform scanning operations for any number of reasons, such as establishing, managing or terminating a voice communication session or a data communication session, performing hand-off operations when the mobile computing device  is moving between wireless resources (e.g., -, -), switching communication channels for the same wireless resource (e.g., -) due to bandwidth or quality issues, and so forth.","The radio manager  may use the information collected during scanning operations to measure or estimate available bandwidth for the wireless communication channel based on one or more communication parameters. In general, digital bandwidth, network bandwidth or just bandwidth is a measure of available or consumed data communication resources expressed in bits per second (bit\/s) or multiples of it (e.g., kbit\/s, Mbit\/s etc). Bandwidth may refer to bandwidth capacity or available bandwidth in bit\/s, which typically means the net bit rate, channel capacity or the maximum throughput of a logical or physical communication path in a digital communication system. The radio manager  may collect or measure various characteristics of an RF channel to estimate an available bandwidth for the RF channel. This measurement may also include previous samples, such as previously consumed bandwidth corresponding to an average data rate of successful data transfer through a communication path, sometimes referred to as \u201cthroughput\u201d or \u201cgoodput.\u201d The radio manager  may use prospective or historical information about the RF channel to generate an available bandwidth parameter for one or more radios of the radio module .","It is worthy to note that although the radio manager  is shown implemented as part of the radio module  in the depicted embodiment, it may be appreciated that the radio manager  may be implemented in other parts of the mobile computing device , such as the processor  and memory , for example. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","The power module  may be arranged to provide power for the mobile computing device . In one embodiment, the power module  may comprise a power supply (or power supply unit) and the power manager . The power supply may be arranged to provide electrical power to the various elements of the mobile computing device , and include a power distribution system as well as primary and\/or secondary sources of energy. The primary source may include AC line voltage converted to a well-regulated lower-voltage DC for electronic devices (e.g., using a transformer or power converter). The secondary source may include a portable power source, such as a battery, that provides lower-voltage DC as well. The battery may comprise rechargeable and\/or non-rechargeable types of batteries.","The power manager  may manage various operations for the power supply and\/or the mobile computing device , such as increasing or decreasing an amount of power provided to a given set of elements for the mobile computing device , or placing a given set of elements in various power consumption modes. The power manager  may also be arranged to measure an amount of remaining power capacity available from the power supply, and generate an available power parameter. The available power parameter may represent, for example, a discharge rate having a unit of amperes (A), milliampere (mA), ampere-hour (Ah), milliampere-hour (mAh), or milliampere second (mAs), or some other measurable power unit. In one embodiment, the available power parameter may vary as a function of radio signal conditions of a given RF operating environment. For example, better RF conditions typically consume less transmit power, and therefore a radio from the radio module  may transmit at a lower power level. As a result, x mA of a battery is able to last longer. By way of contrast, under worse RF conditions, the same x mA of battery may last for a shorter period of time since the radio has to transmit at higher power level. In one embodiment, for example, the power manager  may exchange information with the radio manager  to factor in radio signal conditions when determining an available power parameter for the power supply of the power module .","The wireless resources --may comprise any wireless device, fixed or mobile, utilizing a radio module implementing the same or similar communication techniques as implemented for the radio module . Examples of wireless resources --may include without limitation a wireless access point for a WLAN such as an 802.11 or 802.16 system, a base station or node B for a WWAN such as a cellular radiotelephone system, a wireless gateway for an enterprise network, a peer device such as another mobile computing device , and so forth.","In general operation, the radio module  may receive radio signals from one or more wireless resources --, such as a wireless access point or base station. In one embodiment, for example, the radio manager  may be operative to collect one or more samples for the one or more wireless resources --based on the received radio signals. The sample may be some measurable characteristic of the one or more wireless resources, such as a RSSI value and\/or SNR value derived from the received radio signals of the one or more wireless resources, a number of wireless resources --derived from the received radio signals, a communication protocol used by one or more wireless resources --, an application program used by one or more wireless resources --, a parameter or control directive received from one or more wireless resources --, and so forth. Other measurable characteristics for the wireless resources --may be collected as well. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","The message manager  may implement one or more enhanced message management techniques to manage communication of messages from the message application  by the radio module  based on transmission characteristics of a given operating environment for the mobile computing device . For instance, the message manager  may receive various inputs from other elements of the mobile computing device , such as message size, available bandwidth and available power. The message manager  may use this information to determine whether a message and\/or message attachment is too large or will consume too much power relative to available bandwidth of a wireless communication channel established by the radio module . The message manager  may automatically generate a transmit control directive using a set of rules in a rules database, or generate a transmit control directive by soliciting user commands via a user interface and input device for the mobile computing device. The message manager  may send the transmit control directive to the radio module  to control transmission of the message and\/or message attachment.","Additionally or alternatively, the message manager  may attempt to modify one or more communication parameters of the radio module  in an attempt to reduce power consumption at a cost of reduced transmission quality, or vice-versa. Examples of communication parameters may include without limitation a network scanning threshold parameter, a radio-frequency channel parameter, an access point parameter, a rate selection parameter, a frame size parameter, an aggregation size parameter, a packet retry limit parameter, a protocol parameter, a radio parameter, modulation and coding scheme (MCS), acknowledgement parameter, media access control (MAC) layer parameter, physical (PHY) layer parameter, and any other communication parameters affecting operations for a radio implemented by the mobile computing device . The embodiments are not limited in this context.","Additionally or alternatively, the message manager  may attempt to modify one or more operational parameters of the mobile computing device  in an attempt to reduce power consumption at a cost of reduced transmission quality, or vice-versa. For instance, the message manager  may instruct the message application  to reduce attachment file size, thereby reducing the overall message size for a message. In another example, the message manager  may instruct a digital camera to reduce image quality for captured images or streaming audio\/visual (AV) information.","The messaging application  may comprise any one of several messaging applications arranged to communicate various types of messages in a variety of formats. Examples for the messaging application  may comprise without limitation a telephone application such as a cellular telephone application, a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) application, and so forth. Examples for the messaging application  may further comprise a voicemail application, a facsimile application, a video teleconferencing application, an instant messaging (IM) application, an email application, a short messaging service (SMS) application, a multimedia messaging service (MMS) application, and so forth. The messaging applications may be representative of a particular kind of transport, enabling handling of messages of particular types and formats for the particular application. It is to be understood that the embodiments are not limited in this regard and that the messaging application  may include any other type of messaging or communications application which is consistent with the described embodiments. It also is to be appreciated that the mobile computing device  may implement other types of applications in addition to messaging application  which are consistent with the described embodiments.","In addition to generating a message, such as an email message, the messaging application  may also provide for attaching additional information to a message. The additional information is typically referred to as an \u201cattachment.\u201d An attachment may include any discrete set of information, such as an audio file, a video file, an AV file, an image, a document, another message, an application, and any other digital files. In general operation, a user may use the messaging application  to generate a message and attach a digital file to the message, thereby forming a complete message unit having a measurable message size. As used herein, the term \u201cmessage size\u201d may refer to both a message and any attachments for the message, although in some cases may refer only to a message or attachments. The embodiments are not limited in this context.","The user interface  may comprise any user interface or graphic user interface (GUI) suitable for use with the mobile computing device . The user interface  may comprise a stand-alone application or part of another application, such as an operating system. The user interface  may be arranged to receive information from the message manager  and\/or the messaging application , and generate a user interface message for display on a digital display of the mobile computing device . The user interface message may have the received information in the form of a text string, such as \u201cThis message will take 15 minutes to transmit\u201d or \u201cThis message will consume 15 out of 20 minutes of available power.\u201d The user interface message may also contain various user interface elements, such as radio buttons or menu choices, to receive user commands via a suitable input device (e.g., a touch screen, thumb board, keypad, trackball, scroll wheel, and so forth).","As the mobile computing device  changes locations so does its corresponding operating environment. This may significantly affect wireless communications for one or more radios implemented by the radio module  of the mobile computing device . For example, a radio may experience lower transmission quality, or even lose connection, as it moves away from a wireless resource --, such as a fixed wireless access point or cellular base station. In some cases, the mobile computing device  may remain stationary, and obstacles may move within a given operating environment for the stationary mobile computing device, thereby also affecting wireless transmission characteristics. This phenomenon may be further described with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["200","200","110","200","220","1","220","1","130","1","130","1","110","220","1","200","210","110","220","1","220","2","210"],"i":["r ","r ","n","n ","r "]},"Assume the location granularity is selected as one of the geographical regions -, - in the operating environment . The radio manager  may collect resource information for all wireless resources --within, or accessible from, a given geographic region. This may include wireless resources for a current geographic region or a neighbor geographic region accessible from a location of the mobile computing device . For example, as the mobile computing device  enters communication range for geographic region - as indicated by position , the radio manager  may begin detecting communications signals from one or more of the wireless resources -, - and -. Similarly, as the mobile computing device  enters communication range for geographic region - as indicated by position , the radio manager  may begin detecting communications signals from one or more of the wireless resources - to -.","As the mobile computing device  traverses a particular geographic region along path , the radio detector  may perform periodic, aperiodic, on-demand or continuous measurements of the wireless RF environment to collect information about each wireless resource --within each geographic region --. For example, the radio manager  may collect one or more samples for the one or more wireless resources --based on the received radio signals. The samples may be some measurable characteristic of the one or more wireless resources, such as a RSSI value, a number or count of wireless resources --, a communication protocol used by one or more wireless resources --, an application program used by one or more wireless resources --, a parameter or control directive received from one or more wireless resources --, and so forth. The radio manager  and\/or the message manager  may use the samples to estimate available bandwidth for a wireless communication channel within a given geographic region --where the mobile computing device  is currently located.","As shown in , the operating environment  has two geographic regions -, -. Each of the geographic regions -, - contains a certain number of wireless resources --. For instance, the geographic region - contains the wireless resources -, - and -, while the geographic region - contains the wireless resources -, -, -, -, -, -, -, - and -. As can be readily discerned, the geographic region - has a lower number of wireless resources --than the geographic region - (e.g., 3 versus 9), and therefore the geographic region - has a lower network density relative to the geographic region -, which has a higher network density. As such, the transmission quality when the mobile computing device  is within the geographic region - may vary considerably from the transmission quality when the mobile computing device  is operating within the geographic region -.","This may be particularly exacerbated when the mobile computing device  is located between the geographic regions , - as indicated by position . At position  the radios of the radio module  may have little or no signal reception from any of the wireless resources --since the mobile computing device  is outside transmission envelopes of any nearby wireless resources --, such as the wireless resources -, - and -. If the messaging application  generates a message with a particularly large attachment, and there is insufficient bandwidth and\/or power to transmit the message and attachment, the power supply for the power module  may be significantly reduced or drained in repeated attempts to transmit the message to a wireless resource --","In various embodiments, the message manager  may implement one or more enhanced message management techniques to manage communication of messages from the message application  by the radio module  based on transmission characteristics of a given operating environment  (e.g., geographic regions --) for the mobile computing device . In one embodiment, for example, the radio module  may establish a wireless communication channel with a wireless resource --. The wireless resource --may comprise, for example, a fixed wireless access point for a WLAN or cellular base station or Node B for a cellular radiotelephone system of a WMAN or WWAN.","The message manager  may receive a message size parameter for a message from the messaging application . The message manager  may determine a first time parameter representing a length of time needed to communicate the message based on an available bandwidth parameter. In one embodiment, for example, the available bandwidth parameter may be calculated and sent from the radio manager  to the message manager  over a suitable interface. In one embodiment, for example, the message manager  may receive raw information about the RF channel, and may calculate an available bandwidth parameter itself using the information received from the radio manager . The latter case may be particularly desirable when installing the message manager  on a mobile computing device having a legacy radio module. In either case, the message manager  may use an available bandwidth parameter and determine a first time parameter.","By way of example, assume the radio module  includes a cellular radiotelephone system radio compliant with an Evolution-Data Optimized or Evolution-Day Only (EVDO) 3Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2) telecommunications standard, and capable of interface speeds of approximately 2.4 Mbit\/s on a forward link (e.g., base station to mobile) and 1.8 Mbit\/s on a reverse link (mobile to base station). Further assume that the mobile computing device  is in at a location where the EVDO compliant radio may achieve an approximate bandwidth of 1 Mbit\/s. In this case, a message size of 1 megabyte (MB) will take approximately 8 seconds to transmit, 10 MB will take approximately 2 minutes to transmit, and 100 MB will take approximately 13 minutes to transmit.","The message manager  may determine a second time parameter representing a length of time available to communicate the message based on an available power parameter. The available power parameter may be received from the power manager , or derived by the message manager  from information received from the power manager . The message manager  may use the message size received from the messaging application  and the available power parameter received from the power manager  to calculate a second time parameter using standard discharge rate algorithms for a battery.","The message manager  may generate and send a transmit control directive to the radio module  indicating whether to communicate a message over a wireless communication channel based on first and second time parameters. The message manager  may automatically generate a transmit control directive using a set of rules in a rules database, or generate a transmit control directive by soliciting user commands via a user interface and input device for the mobile computing device .","In one embodiment, for example, the message manager  may compare the first and second time parameters to obtain a time difference, and automatically send the transmit control directive to the radio module  indicating to delay communicating the message over the wireless communication channel when the time difference is less than a threshold value. For example, assume the first time parameter for a message size of 100 MB at an available bandwidth of 1 Mbit\/s is 13 minutes, and if the second time parameter for the power module  is 15 minutes, then the time difference of 2 minutes may be compared to a threshold parameter. If the threshold parameter is set for 10 minutes, for example, then the message manager  may generate and send a transmit control directive to the radio module  with control information instructing the EVDO compliant radio to delay communicating the message over the wireless communication channel. The delay interval may be a time based delay (e.g., wait 10 minutes), a location based delay (e.g., wait for change in location of the mobile computing device ), a bandwidth based delay (e.g., wait until available bandwidth is 1.8 Mbit\/s), a permanent delay (e.g., wait for explicit instructions to send), and any other desired delay interval.","In one embodiment, the message manager  may compare first and second time parameters to obtain a time difference, and automatically send a transmit control directive to the radio module indicating to communicate the message over the wireless communication channel when the time difference is greater than a threshold value. For example, assume the first time parameter for a message size of 10 MB at an available bandwidth of 1 Mbit\/s is 2 minutes, and if the second time parameter for the power module  is 15 minutes, then the time difference of 13 minutes may be compared to a threshold parameter. If the threshold parameter is set for 10 minutes, for example, then the message manager  may generate and send a transmit control directive to the radio module  with control information instructing the EVDO compliant radio to immediately begin communicate the message over the wireless communication channel.","As an addition, or alternative, to the message manager  automatically generating a transmit control directive using a set of rules in a rules database, the message manager  may generate a transmit control directive by soliciting user commands via the user interface  and an input device for the mobile computing device . In one embodiment, for example, the message manager  may compare first and second time parameters to obtain a time difference, and generate a user interface message or information for a user interface message indicating the time difference. The message manager  may send the user interface message or information for a user interface message to the user interface  for subsequent display on a digital display of the mobile computing device . The user interface  may receive a user command signal in response to the user interface message, such as selection of a GUI button on a touch screen display, and forward to the message manager . The message manager  may generate and send a transmit control directive to the radio module  indicating whether to communicate the message over the wireless communication channel based on the user command signal. In this manner, a user of the mobile computing device  may control a trade-off between priority in sending a message and battery life.","As an addition, or alternative, to a discrete transmit or no transmit state, the message manager  may have logic that attempts to modify various communication parameters in an attempt to reduce power consumption at a cost of reduced transmission quality, or vice-versa. In one embodiment, for example, the message manager  may compare first and second time parameters to obtain a time difference, and attempt to modify a communication parameter for the radio module  to increase the time difference.","A radio for the radio module  may have various communication parameters set that affect operation of the radio. Examples of communication parameters may include without limitation a network scanning threshold parameter, a radio-frequency channel parameter, an access point parameter, a rate selection parameter, a frame size parameter, an aggregation size parameter, a packet retry limit parameter, a protocol parameter, a radio parameter, modulation and coding scheme (MCS), acknowledgement parameter, media access control (MAC) layer parameter, physical (PHY) layer parameter, and any other communication parameters affecting operations for a radio implemented by the radio module  of the mobile computing device . Typically the communication parameters are set based on a protocol or application. For instance, the modulation used to communicate with a given mobile is typically determined by the mobile itself. It listens to the traffic on the channel, and depending on the receive signal strength along with the perceived multi-path and fading conditions, makes its best guess as to what data-rate it can sustain while maintaining a reasonable frame error rate of 1-2%. It then communicates this information back to the serving sector in the form of an integer between 1 and 12 on a Digital Rate Control (DRC) channel. Implementing a different modulation technique may affect data rates. For example, DRC values for an EVDO compliant radio may include a DRC Index of 1, which has a data rate of 38.4 kbit\/s using Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of \u221212 decibels (dB). A DRC Index of 10, however, has a data rate of 1228.8 kbit\/s using 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) at an SNR of 3.8 dB. Consequently, changing modulation techniques may change data rates at the expense of other factors (e.g., frame error rate).","The message manager  may attempt to modify various communication parameters for a radio of the radio module  in an attempt to reduce power consumption at a cost of reduced transmission quality, or vice-versa. The message manager  may then send a transmit control directive to the radio module  indicating to communicate the message over a wireless communication channel using a modified communication parameter.","As an addition, or alternative, to the message manager  automatically generating a transmit control directive using a modified communication parameter, the message manager  may generate a transmit control directive by soliciting user commands via the user interface  and an input device for the mobile computing device . In one embodiment, for example, the message manager  may compare first and second time parameters to obtain a time difference. The message manager  may generate a user interface message or information for a user interface message indicating the time difference and a modified time difference based on modifying one or more communication parameters. The user interface  may generate and\/or display the user interface message, and receive a user command signal in response to the user interface message. The user interface  may forward to the response to the message manager , which then generates and sends the transmit control directive to the radio module  indicating to communicate the message over the wireless communication channel with a modified communication parameter based on the user command signal.","Operations for the above embodiments may be further described with reference to the following figures and accompanying examples.
