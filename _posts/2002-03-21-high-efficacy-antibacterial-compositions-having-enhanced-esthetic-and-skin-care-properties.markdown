No. 60\/279,949, filed Mar. 29, 2001.","The present invention relates to antibacterial compositions, like personal care compositions, having high antibacterial effectiveness and excellent esthetic properties, such as foam generation, foam stability, and a capability of imparting skin care properties to cleansed skin. More particularly, the present invention relates to antibacterial compositions comprising an antibacterial agent, a surfactant, a hydrotrope, a hydric solvent, esthetics-enhancing ingredients, and optional skin care ingredients, and that provide a substantial reduction, e.g., greater than 99%, in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria populations within one minute.","Antibacterial personal care compositions are known in the art. Especially useful are antibacterial cleansing compositions, which typically are used to cleanse the skin and to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms present on the skin, especially the hands, arms, and face of the user.","Antibacterial compositions are used, for example, in the health care industry, food service industry, meat processing industry, and in the private sector by individual consumers. The wide-spread use of antibacterial compositions indicates the importance consumers place on controlling bacteria and other microorganism populations on skin. It is important, however, that antibacterial compositions provide a substantial and broad spectrum reduction in microorganism populations quickly and without problems associated with toxicity and skin irritation.","In particular, antibacterial cleansing compositions typically contain an active antibacterial agent, a surfactant, and various other ingredients, for example, dyes, fragrances, pH adjusters, thickeners, and the like, in an aqueous carrier. Several different classes of antibacterial agents have been used in antibacterial cleansing compositions. Examples of antibacterial agents include a bisguanidine (e.g., chlorhexidine digluconate), diphenyl compounds, benzyl alcohols, trihalocarbanilides, quaternary ammonium compounds, ethoxylated phenols, and phenolic compounds, such as halo-substituted phenolic compounds, like PCMX (i.e., p-chloro-m-xylenol) and triclosan (i.e., 2,4,4\u2032-tri-chloro-2\u2032hydroxy-diphenylether). Present-day antimicrobial compositions based on such antibacterial agents exhibit a wide range of antibacterial activity, ranging from low to high, depending on the microorganism to be controlled and the particular antibacterial composition.","Most commercial antibacterial compositions, however, generally offer a low to moderate antibacterial activity. Antibacterial activity is assessed against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including both Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms. The log reduction, or alternatively the percent reduction, in bacterial populations provided by the antibacterial composition correlates to antibacterial activity. A log reduction of 3-5 is most preferred, a 1-3 reduction is preferred, whereas a log reduction of less than 1 is least preferred, for a particular contact time, generally ranging from 15 seconds to 5 minutes. Thus, a highly preferred antibacterial composition exhibits a 3-5 log reduction against a broad spectrum of micro-organisms in a short contact time. Prior disclosures illustrate attempts to provide such antibacterial compositions, which, to date, do not provide the rapid, broad range control of microorganisms desired by consumers.","It should be noted that high log reductions have been achieved at pH values of 4 and 9, but such log reductions are attributed at least in part to these relatively extreme pH values. Compositions having such pH values can irritate the skin and other surfaces, and, therefore, typically are avoided. It has been difficult to impossible to achieve a high log reduction using an antibacterial composition having a neutral pH of about 5 to about 8, and especially about 6 to about 8.","However, highly efficacious antibacterial compositions suffer in comparison to regular (i.e., nonantibacterial) personal care compositions with respect to acceptable consumer properties, especially foam characteristics and imparting skin care properties, such as skin conditioning. It also is difficult to provide phase stable, highly efficacious antibacterial compositions having consumer-acceptable esthetics. Further, present-day antibacterial personal care compositions do not provide an effective antibacterial activity, especially against pathogenic Gram negative bacteria. Thus, a need exists for phase stable, efficacious antibacterial personal care compositions containing skin care ingredients, and that further are consumer acceptable.","An example of patents and published applications disclosing compositions comprising triclosan, surfactants, solvents, chelating agents, thickeners, buffering agents, and water is WO 98\/01110. WO 98\/01110 is directed to reducing skin irritation by employing a reduced amount of surfactant.","Fendler et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,635,462 discloses compositions comprising PCMX and selected surfactants. The compositions disclosed therein are devoid of anionic surfactants and nonionic surfactants.","WO 97\/46218 and WO 96\/06152 disclose compositions based on triclosan, organic acids or salts, hydrotropes, and hydric solvents.","EP 0 505 935 discloses compositions containing PCMX in combination with nonionic and anionic surfactants, particularly nonionic block copolymer surfactants.","WO 95\/32705 discloses a mild surfactant combination that can be combined with antibacterial compounds, like triclosan.","WO 95\/09605 discloses antibacterial compositions containing anionic surfactants and alkyl-polyglycoside surfactants.","WO 98\/55096 discloses antimicrobial wipes having a porous sheet impregnated with an antibacterial composition containing an active antimicrobial agent, an anionic surfactant, an acid, and water, wherein the composition has a pH of about 3.0 to about 6.0.","Glenn, Jr. et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,948 discloses a stress stable, lathering skin cleansing composition containing about one to 30 parts lipid skin moisturizing agents.","Beerse et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,968,539; 6,106,851; and 6,113,933 disclose antibacterial compositions having a pH of about 3 to about 6. The compositions contain an antibacterial agent, an anionic surfactant, and a proton donor.","N. A. Allawala et al., . Ed., Vol. XLII, no. 5, pp. 267-275, (1953) discusses the antibacterial activity of active antibacterial agents in combination with surfactants.","A. G. Mitchell, ., Vol. 16, pp. 533-537, (1964) discloses compositions containing PCMX and a nonionic surfactant that exhibit antibacterial activity. The compositions disclosed in the Mitchell publication exhibit antibacterial activity in at least 47 minutes contact time, thus the compositions are not highly effective.","Prior disclosures have not addressed the issue of providing an antibacterial composition that (a) affords an effective, fast, and broad spectrum control of bacteria at a neutral pH of about 5 to about 8, and especially at about 6 to about 8, (b) is phase stable, (c) exhibits excellent esthetic properties, such as a stable, copious foam generation, and (d) imparts skin care properties to cleansed skin. In addition to the above, prior disclosures also have not addressed providing a composition of sufficiently low viscosity for use with a self-foaming pump.","An efficacious antibacterial composition has been difficult to achieve because of the properties of the antibacterial agents and the effects of a surfactant, a hydrotrope, and a hydric solvent on an antibacterial agent. One such efficacious antibacterial composition is discussed in Taylor et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,261, incorporated herein by reference. This patent discloses a highly efficacious antibacterial composition against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, and containing a high percent (at least 25%) saturation of a phenolic antibacterial agent. The positive effects of a higher percent of saturation of antibacterial agent is fully discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,261.","A need now exists for an antibacterial composition that is highly efficacious against a broad spectrum of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in a short time period, wherein the antibacterial activity is attributed primarily, or solely, to the presence of the active antibacterial agent in the composition, and has consumer-acceptable esthetic properties with respect to phase stability, feel, foam generation and stability, and imparting skin care properties. The present invention is directed to such efficacious and esthetically pleasing antibacterial compositions.","The development of such compositions is difficult because of factors such as a) the need for a high antimicrobial efficacy even in the presence of esthetic enhancing and skin care additives, b) the need to maintain a relatively high % saturation of the antibacterial agent, and c) the difficulty in formulating a high-foaming composition in the presence of significant amounts of a hydrotrope and hydric solvent. Unlike present-day commercial compositions and compositions disclosed in the prior art, the variety, type, and amounts of esthetic enhancing and skin care additives that can be incorporated in the present compositions are varied and unexpected, and a high percent saturation of antibacterial agent can be maintained.","In addition, antibacterial composition viscosity also is critical for particular applications. For example, a preferred method of using the composition is with a self-foaming pump. If the viscosity of the composition is too high (e.g., greater than about 50 centipoise), the composition cannot be pumped through a preferred foaming device. Finally, foam generation and stability also are important for consumer acceptability. Compositions of the present invention exhibit excellent viscosity, enhanced foam volume, creaminess, and slip during human use tests. This is especially important for application of the antibacterial composition to dry hands through a foaming pump, followed by about 30 seconds lathering, and completed by rinsing with water. This type of application provides the highest antibacterial effect.","The present invention is directed to antibacterial compositions that provide a substantial reduction in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in less than about one minute. More particularly, the present invention is directed to antimicrobial compositions containing an active antibacterial agent, a surfactant, and water, in addition to ingredients such as emollients, humectants, and foam stabilizers to impart esthetics to the composition and skin care properties to cleansed skin. The antibacterial agent is present in the composition in an amount of at least 25% of saturation, when measured at room temperature. The present antimicrobial compositions are phase stable, and can be designed to have a viscosity suitable for a variety of end uses, including a composition for use with a self-foaming pump and a composition that is applied to the skin neat, lathered to cleanse the skin and kill bacteria, followed by rinsing from the skin.","Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide an antibacterial composition, wherein the composition comprises:","(a) about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight, of an antimicrobial agent;","(b) about 0.1% to about 40%, by weight, of a surfactant selected from the group consisting of an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, an ampholytic surfactant, and mixtures thereof;","(c) about 1% to about 40%, by weight, of a hydrotrope;","(d) about 1% to about 25%, by weight, of a water-soluble hydric solvent; and","(e) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a skin care agent;","(f) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a foam stabilizer;","(g) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a humectant; and","(h) water,","wherein the composition contains at least one of (e), (f), and (g), and wherein the antimicrobial agent is present in the composition in an amount of at least 25% of saturation concentration, when measured at room temperature.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an antibacterial composition that exhibits a log reduction against Gram positive bacteria (i.e., ) of at least 2 after 30 seconds of contact.","Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide an antibacterial composition that exhibits a log reduction against Gram negative bacteria (i.e., ) of at least 2.5 after 30 seconds of contact.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an antibacterial composition that exhibits a substantial log reduction against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and has a pH of about 5 to about 8.","A present antibacterial composition is phase stable, and typically has a viscosity of about 0.1 to about 50 centipoise (cp). However, in the presence of an optional thickener, the viscosity can be up to about 10,000. The present compositions also exhibit excellent esthetic properties, such as foam height and foam stability. The present compositions further impart skin conditioning and improved skin feel to cleansed skin. These improved esthetic and skin care properties are unexpected in antibacterial compositions because skin care and esthetic ingredients are difficult to incorporate into antibacterial compositions, and especially difficult to incorporate without adversely affecting the antibacterial efficacy of the composition.","Another aspect of the present invention is to provide consumer products based on an antibacterial composition of the present invention, for example, a skin cleanser, a body splash, a surgical scrub, a wound care agent, a hand sanitizer gel, a disinfectant, a mouth wash, a pet shampoo, a hard surface sanitizer, and the like. The present compositions can be applied, then either rinsed off, wiped off, or allowed to remain on the skin.","A further aspect of the present invention is to provide a method of reducing the Gram positive and\/or Gram negative bacteria populations on animal tissue, including human tissue, by contacting the tissue, like the dermis, with a composition of the present invention for a sufficient time, such as about 15 seconds to 5 minutes, to reduce the bacteria level to a desired level.","The above and other novel aspects and advantages of the present invention are illustrated in the following, nonlimiting detailed description of the preferred embodiments.","Personal care products incorporating an active antibacterial agent have been known for many years. Since the introduction of antibacterial personal care products, many claims have been made that such products provide antibacterial properties. However, to be most effective, an antibacterial composition should provide a high log reduction against a broad spectrum of organisms in as short a contact time as possible.","The antibacterial composition also should exhibit excellent esthetic properties and impart skin care properties in order to achieve consumer acceptance. The features of antibacterial efficacy, esthetics, and skin care often are competing, wherein enhancing one feature is detrimental to the other. The present invention is directed to antibacterial compositions that unexpectedly exhibit all of these features.","As presently formulated, most commercial liquid antibacterial soap compositions provide a poor to marginal time kill efficacy, i.e., rate of killing bacteria. Table 1 summarizes the kill efficacy of commercial products, each of which contains about 0.2% to 0.3%, by weight, triclosan (an antibacterial agent).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Time Kill Efficacy of Commercial Liquid Hand Soaps"},{"entry":"(log reduction after 1 minute contact time)"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{},"Gram","Gram","Gram"]},{"entry":[{},{},"positive","negative","negative"]},{"entry":[{},"Product",{"i":"S. aureus"},{"i":"E.

For example, note that Commercial Product D of Table 1, referred to as a \u201cmoisturizing antimicrobial\u201d product is ineffective versus in a time-kill test. The present invention, therefore, is directed to antibacterial compositions having an exceptionally high broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy, as measured by a rapid kill of bacteria (i.e., time kill), which is to be distinguished from persistent kill, and that provides consumer-acceptable esthetic properties.","The present antibacterial compositions provide significantly improved time kill efficacy compared to prior compositions. The basis of this improved time kill is the discovery that the antimicrobial efficacy of an active agent can be correlated to the rate at which the agent has access to an active site on the microbe. The driving force that determines the rate of agent transport to the site of action is the difference in chemical potential between the site at which the agent acts and the external aqueous phase. Alternatively stated, the microbicidal activity of an active agent is proportional to its thermodynamic activity in the external phase. Accordingly, thermodynamic activity, as opposed to concentration, is the more important variable with respect to antimicrobial efficacy. Thermodynamic activity is conveniently correlated to the percent saturation of the active antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase of the composition. This feature is discussed fully in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,621, incorporated herein by reference.","The present compositions are antibacterial compositions having an improved effectiveness against both Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, that exhibit a rapid bacteria kill, that exhibit excellent esthetics, and that impart skin conditioning and improved feel to cleansed skin. As illustrated in the following embodiments, an antibacterial composition of the present invention comprises: (a) about 0.001% to about 10%, by weight, of an antibacterial agent; (b) about 0.1% to about 40%, by weight, of a surfactant; (c) about 1% to about 40%, by weight, of a hydrotrope; (d) about 1% to about 25%, by weight, of a hydric solvent; (e) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a skin care agent; (f) 0% to about 2%, by weight, of a foam stabilizer; (g) 0% to about 5%, by weight, of a humectant; and (h) water, wherein the composition contains at least one of (e), (f), and (g).","The compositions have a percent saturation of antibacterial agent in the continuous aqueous phase of at least about 25%, when measured at room temperature. The compositions exhibit a log reduction against Gram positive bacteria of at least about 2 after 30 seconds contact. The compositions exhibit a log reduction against Gram negative bacteria of at least about 2.5 after 30 seconds contact. The compositions also exhibit excellent composition esthetics, e.g., foam characteristics, and viscosity. The compositions further impart skin conditioning properties and improved feel to cleansed skin.","Embodiments of the present invention comprise (a) an active antibacterial agent, (b) a surfactant, (c) a hydrotrope, (d) a hydric solvent, (e) at least one of a skin care agent, a foam stabilizer, and a humectant, and (f) water. The presence of a hydric solvent, hydrotrope, skin care agent, foam stabilizer, and humectant do not adversely affect the antimicrobial properties of the composition. The compositions are phase stable, and exhibit excellent esthetic properties, such as foam generation and stability, and impart excellent skin conditioning properties and skin feel. The compositions can further include additional optional ingredients disclosed hereafter, such as thickeners, preservatives, pH adjusters, dyes, and perfumes.","In particular, the present invention is directed to antibacterial compositions, especially for use in personal care, but also suitable as disinfectants, surgical scrubs, hospital hand wash products, hand sanitizer gels, wound care agents, and the like. The present compositions comprise about 0.001% to about 10% of a phenolic antibacterial agent, preferably triclosan or PCMX, dissolved in an aqueous vehicle and further containing a surfactant, solvent, hydrotrope, and at least one of a skin care agent, foam stabilizer, and humectant. The surfactant, solvents, and hydrotropes are present in amounts such that the percent saturation of the phenolic antibacterial agent in the composition is at least 25%, preferably greater than about 50%, and most preferably greater than about 95% (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,261). The foam stabilizing, skin care, and humectant additives are selected from compounds including, but not limited to, polymers, protein derivatives, silicone derivatives, ethoxylated derivatives, long-chain fatty materials, and lipid-like materials. The present compositions exhibit new and unexpected properties, like mildness, skin after-feel, foaming properties, and other properties required, or at least desired, by consumers.","As demonstrated in more detail hereafter, a preferred embodiment contains, by weight, about 0.3% to about 1.0% triclosan, about 5% to about 15% dipropylene glycol, about 10% to about 40% sodium xylene sulfonate, about 0.5% to about 5% ammonium lauryl sulfate, 0% to about 5% cocamidopropyl betaine, and one or more of 0% to about 3% sodium PCA, 0% to about 0.5% cetyl or cetearyl alcohol, 0% to about 0.5% polyquaternium-10, 0% to about 5% glycerin, and 0% to about 1% aloe.","A. Antibacterial Agent","An antibacterial agent is present in a composition of the present invention in an amount of about 0.001% to about 10%, and preferably about 0.01% to about 5%, by weight of the composition. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the antibacterial agent is present in an amount of about 0.05% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition.","The antibacterial compositions can be ready to use compositions, which typically contain 0.001% to about 2%, preferably 0.01% to about 1.5%, and most preferably about 0.05% to about 1%, of an antibacterial agent, by weight of the composition. The antibacterial compositions also can be formulated as concentrates that are diluted before use with one to about 100 parts water to provide an end use composition. The concentrated compositions typically contain greater than about 0.1% and up to about 10%, by weight, of the antibacterial agent. Applications also are envisioned wherein the end use composition contains greater than 2%, by weight, of the antibacterial agent.","As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,107,261, the absolute amount of antibacterial agent present in the composition is not as important as the amount of available antibacterial agent in the composition. The amount of available antibacterial agent in the composition is related to the identity and amount of In ingredients in the composition.","To achieve the desired bacteria kill in a short contact time, like 15 to 60 seconds, the composition contains an amount of antibacterial agent that is at least about 25%, and preferably at least about 50%, of the saturation concentration of the antibacterial agent in the composition, when measured at room temperature. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the composition is at least 75%, and more preferably about 95% to 100%, saturated with the antibacterial agent. The method of determining percent saturation of antibacterial agent in the composition is disclosed hereafter.","The antimicrobial agents useful in the present invention are phenolic compounds exemplified by the following classes of compounds:\n\n(a) 2-Hydroxydiphenyl Compounds \n\n\nwherein Y is chlorine or bromine, Z is SOH, NO, or C-Calkyl, r is 0 to 3, o is 0 to 3, p is 0 or 1, m is 0 or 1, and n is 0 or 1.\n","In preferred embodiments, Y is chlorine or bromine, m is 0, n is 0 or 1, o is 1 or 2, r is 1 or 2, and p is 0.","In especially preferred embodiments, Y is chlorine, m is 0, n is 0, o is 1, r is 2, and p is 0.","A particularly useful 2-hydroxydiphenyl compound has the structure: \n\n\nhaving the adopted name, triclosan, and available commercially under the tradename IRGASAN DP300, from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp., Greensboro, N.C.

Other diphenyl compounds are listed in WO 98\/55096, incorporated herein by reference.\n","B. Surfactant","In addition to the antibacterial agent, a present antimicrobial composition also contains a surfactant. The surfactant is present in an amount of about 0.1% to about 40%, and preferably about 0.3% to about 20%, by weight, of the composition. To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the antibacterial composition contains about 0.5% to about 15%, by weight, of the surfactant.","Ready-to-use compositions typically contain about 0.1% to about 10%, preferably about 0.3% to about 5%, and most preferably, 0.5% to about 3%, by weight, of the composition. Concentrated compositions suitable for dilution typically contain greater than about 5%, by weight, of a surfactant.","The amount of surfactant present in the composition is related to the amount and identity of the antibacterial agent in the composition and to the identity of the surfactant. The amount of surfactant is determined such that the percent saturation of the antibacterial agent in the composition is at least about 50%, preferably at least about 75%, and most preferably at least about 95% up to 100%.","The surfactant can be an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or a compatible mixture of surfactants. The surfactant also can be an ampholytic or amphoteric surfactant, which have anionic or cationic properties depending upon the pH of the composition.","The antibacterial compositions, therefore, can contain any anionic surfactant having a hydrophobic moiety, such as a carbon chain including about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, and particularly about 12 to about 20 carbon atoms, and further has a hydrophilic moiety, such as sulfate, sulfonate, carbonate, phosphate, or carboxylate. Often, the hydrophobic carbon chain is etherified, such as with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide, to impart a particular physical property, such as increased water solubility or reduced surface tension to the anionic surfactant.","Therefore, suitable anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, compounds in the classes known as alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl ether sulfonates, sulfate esters of an alkylphenoxy polyoxyethylene ethanol, alpha-olefin sulfonates, beta-alkoxy alkane sulfonates, alkylaryl sulfonates, alkyl monoglyceride sulfates, alkyl monoglyceride sulfonates, alkyl carbonates, alkyl ether carboxylates, fatty acids, sulfosuccinates, sarcosinates, octoxynol or nonoxynol phosphates, taurates, fatty taurides, fatty acid amide polyoxyethylene sulfates, isethionates, or mixtures thereof. Additional anionic surfactants are listed in McCutcheon's Emulsifiers and Detergents, 1993 Annuals, (hereafter McCutcheon's), McCutcheon Division, MC Publishing Co., Glen Rock, N.J., pp. 263-266, incorporated herein by reference. Numerous other anionic surfactants, and classes of anionic surfactants, are disclosed in Laughlin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,929,678, incorporated herein by reference.","Examples of anionic surfactants include a C-Calkyl sulfate, a C-Cfatty acid salt, a C-Calkyl ether sulfate having one or two moles of ethoxylation, a C-Calkamine oxide, a C-Calkyl sarcosinate, a C-Csulfoacetate, a C-Csulfosuccinate, a C-Calkyl diphenyl oxide disulfonate, a C-Calkyl carboxylate, a C-Calpha-olefin sulfonate, a methyl ester sulfonate, and mixtures thereof. The C-Calkyl group contains eight to sixteen carbon atoms, and can be straight chain (e.g., lauryl) or branched (e.g., 2-ethylhexyl). The cation of the anionic surfactant can be an alkali metal (preferably sodium or potassium), ammonium, C-Calkylammonium (mono-, di-, tri), or C-Calkanolammonium (mono-, di-, tri-).

the preparation and testing of the examples:","a) Determination of Rapid Germicidal (Time Kill) Activity of Antibacterial Products. The activity of antibacterial compositions was measured by the time-kill method, whereby the survival of challenged organisms exposed to an antibacterial test composition is determined as a function of time. In this test, a diluted aliquot of the composition is brought into contact with a known population of test bacteria for a specified time period at a specified temperature. The test composition is neutralized at the end of the time period, which arrests the antibacterial activity of the composition. The percent or, alternatively, log reduction from the original bacterial population is calculated. In general, the time kill method is known to those skilled in the art.","The composition can be tested at any concentration from 0-100%. The choice of which concentration to use is at the discretion of the investigator, and suitable concentrations are readily determined by those skilled in the art. For example, viscous samples usually are tested at 50% dilution, whereas nonviscous samples are not diluted. The test sample is placed in a sterile 250 mL beaker equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and the sample volume is brought to 100 mL, if needed, with sterile, deionized water. All testing is performed in triplicate, the results are combined, and the average log reduction is reported.","The choice of contact time period also is at the discretion of the investigator. Any contact time period can be chosen. Typical contact times range from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, with 30 seconds and 1 minute being typical contact times. The contact temperature also can be any temperature, typically room temperature, or about 25 degrees Celsius.","The bacterial suspension, or test inoculum, is prepared by growing a bacterial culture on any appropriate solid media (e.g., agar). The bacterial population then is washed from the agar with sterile physiological saline, and the population of the bacterial suspension is adjusted to about 108 colony forming units per mL (cfu\/mL).","The table below lists the test bacterial cultures used in the following tests and includes the name of the bacteria, the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) identification number, and the abbreviation of the name of the organism used hereafter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0129","num":"0128"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"84pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"77pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Organism Name","ATCC #","Abbreviation"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},{"i":"Staphylococcus aureus"},"\u20026538","Sa"]},{"entry":[{},{"i":"Escherichia coli"},"11229","Ec"]},{"entry":[{},{"i":"Serratia marcescens"},"14756","Sm"]},{"entry":[{},{"i":"Klebsiella pneumoniae"},"10031","Kp"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0129"},"i":["Staphylococcus aureus ","Escherichia coli ","Serratia marcescens ","Serratia marcescens ","Federal Register"]},"The beaker containing the test composition is placed in a water bath (if constant temperature is desired), or placed on a magnetic stirrer (if ambient laboratory temperature is desired). The sample then is inoculated with 1.0 mL of the test bacterial suspension. The inoculum is stirred with the test composition for the predetermined contact time. When the contact time expires, 1.0 mL of the test composition\/bacteria mixture is transferred into 9.0 mL of Tryptone-Histidine-Tween Neutralizer Solution (THT). Decimal dilutions to a countable range then are made. The dilutions can differ for different organisms. Selected dilutions are plated in triplicate on TSA+ plates (TSA+ if Trypitcase Soy Agar with Lecithin and Polysorbate 80). The plates then are incubated for 25\u00b12 hours, and the colonies are counted for the number of survivors, and the percent or log reduction is calculated. The control count (numbers control) is determined by conducting the procedure as described above with the exception that THT is used in place of the test composition. The plate counts are converted to cfu\/mL for the numbers control and samples, respectively, by standard microbiological methods.

This screening test was used to determine whether the test composition would be tested further.","c) Foam Property Screening. The foam properties and end use performance enhancement of the compositions was determined by the following two methods:","1) Bottle Shake Foam Test. This test was performed by inverting bottles containing test compositions and timing the persistence of the foam head. In a typical test, eight to ten compositions (each contained in a capped, 1L, French square bottle) are tested as a set. Each set includes a control which has the same base formula as the others, but does not contain any performance-enhancing additives. The set of samples first is allowed to equilibrate at a common temperature (usually about 25\u00b0 C.). The bottles then are arranged in a row and inverted five times each, all within about 1 minute. The bottles then are allowed to stand for about 1 to 3 hours, and the time of foam collapse (as judged by an opening in the foam head equal to about 2.5 cm) is recorded. The foam collapse times are compared to the control and summarized as shown in the table below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0137","num":"0136"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"98pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Foam Rating",{}]},{"entry":["(Bottle or Pump Test)","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["+ + +","Bottle Foam stable for several days"]},{"entry":["+ +","Foam persisted longer than the test"]},{"entry":[{},"time"]},{"entry":["+","Foam persisted longer than control"]},{"entry":[{},"sample, but less than total test time"]},{"entry":["0","Foam collapsed at the same time as"]},{"entry":[{},"control"]},{"entry":["\u2212","Foam collapsed sooner than control"]},{"entry":["\u2212 \u2212","Foam collapsed almost immediately"]},{"entry":["NT","Not tested"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"2) Pump Foam Test. Because a preferred route of application is use of a self-foaming pump, this test assesses stability of test sample foam ejected from this type of pump. The self-foaming pump used in this test is manufactured by Air-spray International B.V., Alkmaar, Holland (model Airspray 1.65 ml TT Pump with EVA(PIB) liner). This test was performed by ejecting one pump stroke of foam on a precleaned watch glass (100 mm, Corning Glass Works, #9985) and observing the time of foam collapse. In a typical test, 8 to 10 samples (each contained in a plastic bottle equipped with a foaming pump) are tested as a set. As in the Bottle Foam Test, each set includes a control which has the same base formula as the others, but does not contain any performance-enhancing additives. The set of samples first is allowed to equilibrate at a common temperature (usually about 25\u00b0 C.). The pumps\/bottles and corresponding watch glasses are arranged in two parallel rows. The pumps are primed with three strokes just prior to the test. One pump-stroke of foam is ejected onto the corresponding watch glass of each sample, all within about 1 minute. The foam samples then are allowed to stand for about 1 to 3 hours, and the time of foam collapse (as judged by circle of bubbles about 5 mm or less) is recorded. The foam collapse times are compared to the control and summarized as shown in the table above.","d) Preparation of Samples. The preparation of all samples involved equipment and procedures normally employed in formula development laboratories. All percents were by weight based on the active level of each ingredient.","e) Summary formula descriptions in example tables. A typical table entry for a test composition is \u201c0.6TCS\/5DPG\/15SXS\/1.5ALS\/0.5CAPB\/0.2-PVPKS15.\u201d This entry is defined as 0.6% triclosan (TCS), 5% dipropylene glycol (DPG), 15% sodium xylene sulfonate (SXS), 1.5% ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), 0.5% cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB), 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer (PVP K-15), and the remainder of the formula is water (typically with 0.2%, by total weight, of a citrate\/phosphate buffer designed to provide a pH of about 6).","f) Preparation of saturated solutions of TCS in water. A four-liter flask was equipped with a 3-inch magnetic stir bar and charged with approximately 7.5 grams (g) TCS and 3 liters (L) of water. The flask then was placed in a water bath, stirred, and heated (40-45\u00b0 C.) for at least 8 hours. The flask containing the resulting TCS\/water suspension was removed from the water bath, and the warm suspension filtered through a Coors #32-H porcelain Buchner funnel equipped with Whatman #40 (5.5 cm) filter paper. The filtering assembly was attached to a two-liter vacuum filter flask, and filtration was conducted in batches. The filtrate then was transferred to another four-liter flask and allowed to cool. Typically, fine needles of TCS crystals formed after the filtrate was stored at room temperature for a few days.","For some time-kill studies, the TCS solution was refiltered at room temperature before use in the study. For other time-kill studies, a small amount of crystalline TCS was allowed to remain in the test container to ensure saturation in the event of a temperature change. It was assumed that TCS crystals present in the time-kill test vessel would not affect test results because crystalline TCS is unavailable to act on the bacteria (i.e., is not solubilized).","To determine the concentration of TCS in the water solutions, filtered samples (in triplicate) were analyzed by HPLC. The apparatus used to filter the solutions was a Whatman AUTOVIAL\u00ae, with 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE membrane and glass microfiber prefilter, cat. No. AV125UORG. TCS concentrations were calculated using a linear regression line fit (Microsoft EXCEL\u00ae software) to TCS\/IPA standards included on the same HPLC run.","The following examples demonstrate that the new and unexpected results achieved by the present invention are attributed (in part) to a selection of esthetic enhancing and skin care additives which maintain a phase-stable system, do not hinder antibacterial activity, and contribute to composition performance and esthetics.","Phase stability and foam performance attributed to polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) polymer additives\u2014The compositions in this example demonstrate the phase stability and performance observed during testing of compositions containing PVP polymer additives.

Performance Tests (Broad Spectrum Efficacy)\u2014The following embodiment of the present invention was tested:\n\n","Time kill tests were performed to compare Composition A of the present invention to several commercially available Health Care Personnel Hand Wash products (i.e., HCPHW-E, F, G, H. I, J) and to several commercially available retail antibacterial hand wash products. Three nonmedicated retail liquid hand soaps also were tested for comparison. The tests evaluated efficacy against a broad spectrum of twenty-four different microorganisms. Test organisms were selected to represent both transient and resident organisms, Gram negative bacteria (such as ), and Gram positive bacteria (such as , and ). The compositions were tested with sampling taking place at 30 seconds and 1 minute.","The test organisms represented a broad spectrum of both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms commonly associated with nosocomial infections. For the health care products, five additional test organisms were added as a result of a health care survey, including several antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. The following Time Kill Summary charts summarize bacterial kill results for Composition A vs. several Health care Personnel Hand wash Products.","The Time Kill Summary charts summarize data for both Health care Personnel Hand washes and retail liquid hand soaps, and includes a number of organisms of the total tested that were reduced by greater than 3, 2, or 1 log within 30 seconds. Antimicrobial potential can be classified based on a product's ability to reduce the number of organisms in logarithms. A product that is unable to achieve a 1 log reduction shows minimal activity against that specific organism. A one log reduction is considered moderate activity, whereas a greater than 2 or 3 log reduction is considered strong antibacterial activity in vitro.","The summarized results demonstrate a significantly superior efficacy for Composition A versus the twenty-four test organisms (30 second time-kill). Composition A performed significantly better than each of the commercially available Health Care Personnel Hand Wash products tested (i.e., HCPHW-E through J) at reducing the number and type of microorganisms encountered in health care settings. Further, compared to the leading liquid hand soaps and health care products, Composition A was superior at reducing more types of test organisms by greater than 3 logs within 30 seconds. Composition A reduced 19 of 24 organisms tested by greater than 3 log units within 30 seconds. The closest comparative composition, HCPHW-I, reduced 16 of 24 organisms greater than 3 log units. The remaining comparative compositions showed moderate to minimal antimicrobial activity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0180","num":"0180"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00021","num":"00021"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"336pt","align":"center"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Time

method to determine the effectiveness of antibacterial cleansing products. The following embodiment of the present invention was tested using this method:\n\n","The in-use antibacterial efficacy of Composition B was determined by a health care personnel hand wash study. The study was performed according to the current revision of ASTM E-1174-00, incorporated herein by reference. The revision to the test method provides procedures to assure adequate rapid neutralization of the antimicrobial in the hand wash formulation. A neutralizer was incorporated at both sampling points. The study is designed to measure the reduction of transient microbial flora following routine hand washing with an antibacterial product. In this study, a broth culture of ATCCwas used as an artificial contaminant bacteria on the hands. Activity was measured by comparing the microbial counts of the marker organism removed after a single use of the test composition to the baseline number, i.e., the number of organisms recovered from contaminated, unwashed hands. Additional comparisons were made following the tenth wash of a multiple wash procedure.","Prior to each of the eleven washes, the hands were artificially contaminated with . In addition to testing Composition B, HCPHW-I also was included in the study. A sufficient number of subjects fulfilling the study criteria were preenrolled to ensure the required number of subjects (45), 30 for Composition B and 15 for HCPHW-I. During a one-week wash out period, the subjects refrained from using antimicrobial-containing products. On the test day, subjects' hands were contaminated with and a baseline sampling was performed. Following washing with the test composition, and following treatments 1 and 10, the subjects' hands were sampled for a post-treatment count. The sampling fluid was enumerated for recovery of . Results from the Health Care Personnel Hand Wash study were evaluated by comparing bacteria counts recovered from the hands following product treatment vs. the baseline counts. The bacteria counts were converted into logcounts. The log counts of each subject's left and right hand were averaged.

When compared to HCPHW-I, Composition B performed significantly better with respect to reducing the concentration of the marker organism after one wash, and was equally effective following the tenth wash. The demonstrated log reductions illustrate that the present compositions are effective as Health Care Personnel Hand wash products.","Repeat Application Soap Chamber Test\u2014A soap chamber irritation test was performed to determine the mildness of Composition A vs. several commercially available Health Care Personnel Hand Wash products. The tests showed that: (a) all test compositions were significantly less irritating than the positive control, i.e., a dilute solution of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), and (b) ranking products from highest irritation potential to lowest is: SLS>HCPHW-E>HCPHW-H>HCPHW-G>HCPHW-F>Composition A>Negative Control.","Methodology","Twelve male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 65, who were in good health, were enrolled in the test. Dilute solutions of all test compositions were made each day of patching. Patches were totally occlusive chambers, 12 mm in diameter, applied to the volar forearm for a total of six days. Expert visual gradings, using a four-point scale for erythema, scaling, and fissuring were used as the objective measure of observation for this study. Grading was performed at baseline (i.e., when panelists were enrolled), 30 minutes after patch removal on days one to six, and at 24 hours on days one to six. A maximum for each tested characteristic was established as a \u201c3\u201d score.","Summary","The rating for the commercially available hand wash products, from highest irritation potential to the lowest, was: Positive Control>HCPHW-E>HCPHW-H>HCPHW-G>HCPHW-F>Composition A>Negative Control. Significant differences were noted overall between HCPHW-E and HCPHW-H, compared to HCPHW-G, HCPHW-F, and Composition A.

It is expected that a health care worker would have a greater exposure over an extended time period to a hand wash than the general public. Accordingly, this test was designed to mimic the population demographics and hand wash patterns likely to be encountered in a health care setting. HCPHW-E was selected based on its prior acceptance in the health care industry as being an efficacious and mild health care personnel hand wash.","Methodology","The study demographics were selected to mimic a population cross section encountered in a health care setting. Thirty-eight volunteers, who were in good general health, participated in the study. The panel included nine volunteers with clinically assessed \u201cdry skin,\u201d and twenty-nine volunteers with clinically assessed \u201cnormal skin.\u201d These determinations were made by an expert grader following a two-week preconditioning period during which all volunteers washed with a commercially available mild skin care soap bar and discontinued the use of all topically applied moisturizers, creams, lotions, and antibacterial products. Each panelist was qualified for participation after the two-week preconditioning period. The age range of the panelists was between 20 and 55 years of age, and the sex distribution was three males and thirty-five females.","The test compositions were coded and sent to an independent laboratory for testing. The test was a single-blind study in which only the wash monitors were aware of the coded product assignments when the products were applied to the hand and volar forearm. All wash procedures were conducted in a separate area in order to maintain blinding of the expert grader and instrument operators. The test materials were dispensed by a wash monitor into the hand of the panelists during the wash procedure.","Using appropriate randomization, panelists were assigned a wash partner for \u201cskin-to-skin\u201d friction. Composition C was applied to dry skin and spread over the hand and forearm for 30 seconds. Immediately thereafter, the panelists were instructed to rinse the hand and forearm for 15 seconds. The skin was patted dry with a disposable towel. HCPHW-E was applied to wetted skin and spread over the designated hand and forearm for 30 seconds. Immediately following, panelists were instructed to rinse the hand and forearm for 15 seconds. The skin was patted dry with a disposable towel. The time between wash cycles was approximately five minutes. The time between the tenth cycle and grading was approximately twenty minutes. These protocols were chosen to represent typical in-use scenarios envisioned for both samples used as commercial products.","To determine the effects that the two test compositions had on panelists' skin, both visual expert grading and instrumental evaluations were used. Expert grading involved the \u201cDryness,\u201d \u201cErythema,\u201d and \u201cTactile Roughness\u201d scales summarized below.

The data presented above illustrate that a present antibacterial composition can contain ingredients to enhance product esthetics and to impart skin care properties, and can exhibit a log reduction of at least about 2 (after 30 seconds) or at least about 3 (after 60 seconds) vs. , or of at least about 2.5 (after 30 seconds) or at least about 3.5 (after 60 seconds) vs. ","The antibacterial compositions of the present invention have several practical end uses, including hand cleansers, mouthwashes, surgical scrubs, body splashes, hand sanitizer gels, and similar personal care products. Additional types of compositions include foamed compositions, such as creams, mousses, and the like, and compositions containing organic and inorganic filler materials, such as emulsions, lotions, creams, pastes, and the like. The compositions further can be used as an antibacterial cleanser for hard surfaces, for example, sinks and countertops in hospitals, food service areas, and meat processing plants. The present antibacterial compositions can be manufactured as dilute ready-to-use compositions, or as concentrates that are diluted prior to use. The compositions can be applied to a surface, then either rinsed from, wiped from, or allowed to remain on the treated surface.","The compositions also can be incorporated into a web material to provide an antibacterial wiping article. The wiping article can be used to clean and sanitize skin or inanimate surfaces.","The present antimicrobial compositions provide the advantages of a broad spectrum kill of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in short contact times. The short contact time for a substantial log reduction of bacteria is important in view of the typical 15 to 60 second time frame used to cleanse and sanitize the skin and inanimate surfaces.","The present compositions are effective in short contact time because the antibacterial agent is present in the aqueous continuous phase of the composition, as opposed to surfactant micelles. The antibacterial agent, therefore, is available to immediately begin reducing bacterial populations, and further is available to deposit on the skin to provide residual antibacterial efficacy. In addition, because the antibacterial agent is in solution as opposed to surfactant micelles, the absolute amount of antimicrobial agent in the composition can be reduced without adversely affecting efficacy, and the antibacterial agent is not rinsed from the skin with the surfactant prior to performing its antibacterial function. In addition, the amount of surfactant in the present antibacterial compositions typically is low, thereby providing additional environmental benefits. Furthermore, the present compositions exhibit excellent esthetic properties, especially with respect to foam generation and foam stability, making the compositions useful in pump foam dispersers.","Obviously, many modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and, therefore, only such limitations should be imposed as are indicated by the appended claims.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0220","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0005","list-style":"none"},"li":["Acetyl Tnoctyl
