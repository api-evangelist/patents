Technical Field","The invention relates to predicting the outcome of a chaotic system. More particularly, the invention relates to predicting outcome of chaotic systems using Lyapunov exponents.","2. Description of the Related Art","Chaotic non-linear systems are known. Examples of chaotic systems include, but are not limited to, the weather, the stock market and fluid flow. By its nature, it is difficult to calculate the outcome of a chaotic system. A slight change in initial conditions or an intervening event can result in a completely different outcome or trajectory. In a weather system, a slight change in the initial conditions of temperatures and pressures at various locations results in a completely different weather trajectory. As a result, a long range forecast may be difficult or impossible to make. One way that chaotic systems can be defined is by calculating a Lyapunov exponent, which is a measure of the rate of divergence of a trajectory with time.","It is well known that the significant digits of variables defining a chaotic system are rapidly lost during calculation and the initially valid digits in the chaotic system become meaningless in a short number of iterations. The number of valid digits n(t) decreases linearly with time. The maximal Lyapunov exponent L is equal to\u2014dn\/dt and can be calculated to determine the number of digits which are lost per unit time. Traditional Lyapunov exponent algorithms, such as those calculated by the Benettin technique, can be applied only to a system of differential equations. A different algorithm is used for discrete maps and until now no algorithm existed for any other mathematical process.","The present invention provides a system and method for predicting the outcome of a chaotic system. A prediction system includes means for varying the initial conditions of a chaotic system and means for calculating a plurality of possible trajectories for the chaotic system. The prediction system also includes means for calculating a Lyapunov exponent for each of the plurality of possible trajectories and means for selecting the trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent as the most likely trajectory to occur.","A method of predicting the likelihood of an outcome in a chaotic system is also provided. In one embodiment, the method generally includes varying initial conditions of a mathematical model of a chaotic system and calculating multiple trajectories of the chaotic system model based on a number of uncertainty factors. The method includes calculating a Lyapunov exponent for each of the multiple trajectories and comparing the Lyapunov exponents from each of the multiple trajectories to determine the trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent, whereby the trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent is indicative of the likelihood of the outcome of the chaotic system.","A computer program disclosed herein is stored on a computer readable medium for execution by a computer. The computer program includes logic elements that vary the initial conditions of a chaotic system and calculate a plurality of possible trajectories for the chaotic system. The computer program also includes logic configured to calculate a Lyapunov exponent for each of the plurality of possible trajectories to determine the trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent and to select the trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent to represent a prediction of an outcome of the chaotic system.","Systems and methods for predicting the outcome of chaotic systems are provided. Suggested chaotic systems may include, but are not limited, weather systems, fluid flow systems, traffic patterns, the stock market and other dynamic systems that are sensitive to initial conditions. An accurate prediction of the chaotic systems can be made using the systems and methods of the invention and can be calculated using less computational complexity than previously known systems. With regard to weather systems, also referred to as weather maps, the invention can accurately and quickly forecast or predict the weather patterns in various locations. With regard to fluid flow systems, the invention can predict liquid flow through a conduit or around a structure, such as a dam, spillway, watercraft and so forth. Fluid flow systems may also include air flow systems, such as those which may be used to design an airplane or other aircraft. With regard to traffic systems, the invention can be used to predict patterns of vehicular traffic on a road or network of roads.","The invention can predict outcome of such chaotic systems by comparing single-precision calculations with double-precision calculations to determine the maximal Lyapunov exponent. The resulting maximal Lyapunov exponent is found in less than one-tenth of the computational time required by traditional methods. Furthermore, this algorithm can be applied to both maps, such as weather forecast maps, and systems of differential equations. This algorithm is easily coded because it is free of Jacobians, tangent vectors, Gramm-Schmidt procedures, overflow errors, and trial-and-error parameters. The algorithm is applicable to any numerical time evolution procedure and can be applied where no existing routine is available, e.g. recursion relations or to the successive terms of a series, as often exist in quantum mechanical calculations. It is shown herein that the maximum Lyapunov exponent can be experimentally measured by comparing two data runs of the chaotic system at different levels of precision.","Another technique involving the products of the ratios of successive differentials is also used to find maximal Lyapunov exponents in systems of differential equations. Lyapunov exponent plots and local Lyapunov exponent distributions are given for the logistic map and the Lorenz equations. Restricted error regions are discussed where the Lyapunov exponent is greater than zero, but the error magnitude is restricted to a fraction of the size of the available phase space. An empirical formula is also provided which can quickly calculate the r\u221e point of a period p window.","A trajectory having a large Lyapunov exponent, large rate of divergence, will be less likely to occur than one having a small Lyapunov exponent, small rate of divergence. The analysis of chaotic systems using the Lyapunov exponents can also be used to determine the most likely trajectory. By defining a range of uncertainties of a chaotic system, the initial conditions of the system can be varied within their initial uncertainties to calculate several possible trajectories. The Lyapunov exponents from each of these trajectories are then be calculated. The trajectory having the smallest Lyapunov exponent is the most likely to occur.","In the alternative, the time rate of loss of the number of digits, dn\/dt, can be determined by comparing single-precision and double-precision calculations of the system's trajectories to produce maximal Lyapunov exponents more quickly and easily than previous techniques. The invention can be applied, without alteration, to both maps, such as weather maps, and systems of differential equations, and can be applied to any time evolution system. For example it can be applied to recursion relations, the Gramm-Schmidt re-orthogonalization procedure and the like. It has been used to determine Lyapunov exponents in the chaotic behavior found in a first number of partial sums, e.g. the first 50 partial sums, of a series describing the electromagnetic scattering from a pair of overlapping spheres. This lost digits technique can be used to test for divergence between two calculations of differing precision, which describes the time evolution in quantum mechanical systems.","The invention also provides a computer program that uses the source code of the non-linear system as a subroutine. The input to the computer program includes the initial conditions and the relative uncertainties of these conditions. For instance, in a weather program, the input includes the temperature and pressure at various locations and uncertainties associated with these input values. The main program would calculate various trajectories and Lyapunov exponents of these trajectories. It would then determine the smallest exponent and assign this as the most likely outcome.","The system of the invention for calculating Lyapunov exponents using single precision and double precision values for predicting the outcome of chaotic systems can be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination thereof. In the currently contemplated Best Mode, the system is implemented in software as an executable computer program and is executed by a general purpose digital computer or other suitable digital processing device.","The software may be stored in memory in any suitable format and may include one or more separate programs. The software includes an ordered listing of executable instructions for implementing logical functions. The software may be a computer program, source program, executable program, object code, script or any other entity that can include a set of instructions to be performed.","When the system of the invention for calculating Lyapunov exponents is implemented in software, the system can be stored on any computer readable medium for use by or in connection with any computer related system or method. A computer readable medium is any electronic, magnetic, electromagnetic, optical, infrared or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium or other suitable physical device or means that can contain or store a computer program for use by or in connection with a computer related system or method.","Alternatively, the system for calculating Lyapunov exponents may be configured using physical or electrical components, modules, and\/or processing means for performing various functions. For example, these functional components, modules and processing means are capable of varying the initial conditions of a chaotic system model and then calculating trajectories for the chaotic system. Among other things, they are further capable of calculating a Lyapunov exponent for each trajectory and selecting a trajectory with the smallest Lyapunov exponent to determine the most likely predictable outcome of the chaotic system.","Lyapunov Exponent","The jth iteration of a map f(X) is written as\n\n()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere Xis the initial value. When a small error \u03b5is found to grow exponentially, the system is said to be chaotic.

it should be noted that this technique is computationally advantageous to previous techniques using Runge-Kutta algorithms, e.g. the Bennetin and Wolf algorithms. Although the present technique requires calculating two distinct trajectories using single- and double-precision, the previous techniques require one trajectory in double precision plus an associated system of qdimensions stemming from the Jacobian of the system. The Runge-Kutta and Gramm-Schmidt procedures require a great deal of additional calculations. In addition, the error in these other techniques is not 10, but set to unit magnitude.","Results","Equation 17 or 20 provides a procedure for the direct measurement of Lyapunov exponents. The system is run twice from identical initial conditions for a certain elapsed time and then the difference between the two runs is calculated throughout the elapsed time. Another usually more expensive approach is to build two exact copies of the system, run them simultaneously and compare them through time. For instance, X(t) and X(t) are replaced by X(t) and X(t), where X(t) and X(t) are either the two runs of the system or the two copies of the system. At t=0 the two runs agree to several significant digits. If the system is chaotic then the number of digits that agree in X(t) and X(t) decreases linearly in time.","Implementation Details","In applying the lost digits technique according to the invention, the following considerations should be taken into account. First, more choices than merely single- and double-precision may be used. With more than two levels of precision, the two most precise precision levels should be used. For example, 16 and 20 digit variables have been compared to obtain those results. Second, because the maximum magnitude of an error depends on its position within the trajectory, it is better to set the stopping criteria to a floating fractional error than to a constant error magnitude. Third, it is best to iterate or integrate until most of the digits of Xand Xhave come to disagree, e.g. a fractional error of 0.01 is used in the calculations herein. Fourth, in a modulus map the difference might be determined before performing the modulus. Sometimes one precision falls below the cutoff while the other falls above it. Fifth, a large elapsed time or number of iterations is necessary to determine a small positive Lyapunov exponent, L. For this reason, a maximum elapsed time should normally be set in the program. Sixth, negative exponents can be calculated by starting two solutions with a small difference, 1% for example, and then watching an increase in the number of agreeing digits. And seventh, it is well known that the computed trajectories must be found to be independent of the numerical integration step size.","The lost digits Lyapunov exponent is not due to a single iteration or integration time step, or an infinite number of them, but is instead due to a small number of time steps. For the lost digits approach, about 50 to 100 iterations are needed (for W=16) to determine a good approximation to the global exponent in the logistic map, compared to about 10,000 iterations which are used in the conventional infinite sum formula for the global exponent of a map (Equation 4). The Lyapunov exponent can be calculated from the product of the 50 or so error magnifications that the trajectory encounters. For the Lorenz equations (with W=16) the lost-digits technique as described herein determines an exponent after every ten-second trajectory segment. For this reason, the lost digit approach can be said to produce only regional exponents. The lost digits technique typically produces a global exponent only for the case W\u221e.","Logistic Map","For reference, an example of a period-3 window of a logistic map is shown in . The power of this lost-digits technique is demonstrated by calculating a few iterations of the logistic map, X=rX(1\u2212X). We consider r=3.853, W=16, and initially set X(t=0)=X(t=0)=X=0.65. The system is iterated until the stopping point is reached. The next experiment is reinitialized by setting X(t)=X(t) and the process is repeated. In this region of the map (r=3.853), the iterations typically move from band A to band B to band C and then back to band A.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0072"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Band","X","Width","f (X)","Slope"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["A","X \u2208 0.132 to 0.165","0.033","f (X) \u2208 0.451 to 0.528",">1"]},{"entry":["B","X \u2208 0.451 to 0.528","0.077","f (X) \u2208 0.957 to 0.968","<1"]},{"entry":["C","X \u2208 0.957 to 0.968","0.011","f (X) \u2208 0.132 to 0.165",">1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"sub":"o ","figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"sub":["s","d"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"1) averaging iterations over precisions;","2) averaging over k initial conditions, i.e., setting X=X=Xand iterating until m digits disagree, calculating L, then resetting X=X=X, where i=1 . . . k, for a set of k initial values (taking the k initial values randomly or by distributing the Xuniformly throughout the available space); and","3) averaging through time, that is, starting X=X=X, and then after m digits disagree resetting X=X(in this case the new Xis already in the attractor region) and repeating the process k times. The average maximal exponents are insensitive to the averaging process.","Each trajectory produces a local Lyapunov exponent. Recently, interest has grown in distributions of local Lyapunov exponents. These exponents reveal the variation of the local error exponential growth rate throughout the system trajectory. A plot of the distributions of local exponents for the parameters of  is shown in . The parameter values in FIG.  were chosen near the end of a periodic window where oscillations appear in the distribution (solid line). These oscillations are a result of the stopping point criterion never being satisfied on bands B or C. The oscillations can be removed by iterating a randomly selected number of times (i=1, 2, or 3) after the stopping point is reached or by terminating the experiment after a set amount of time or number of iterations, but not so few that the asymptotic value has not been reached, nor so many that the fractional error exceeds unity.  also shows the distribution (dashed line) when the method of terminating the experiment is chosen. In this case, the map is in a restricted error region as defined below. Note that most Lyapunov distributions are smooth and do not contain these oscillations. Although the artifact is easily removed from the distribution, it is of interest because it indicates that the map is in an interesting or unusual region.","Restricted Error Regions","Consider a one-dimensional map X=f(X, r), with parameter r. The range of the iteration is X(r, t)\u2266X(r, t)\u2266X(r, t). At a particular chaotic parameter value rthe range of X is restricted to a smaller segment composed of a set of separate, disjoint regions numbered i=1 to k. These k regions, or bands, restrict the iterations to the values, X\u2266X(r, t)\u2266X. If the iteration moves through time in a permanent pattern from the first region to the second region . . . to the kth region then back to the first region, for all time, then the iterations Xare always known to within a maximum error equal to the width of the largest region. When the Lyapunov exponent is positive for a particular range of r values, but at least one valid digit is retained in the computed trajectory, then we refer to that parameter region as a restricted error region. When at least one digit is always known, then the trajectory is not 100% uncertain. A physical system is always limited to a finite phase space. These restricted error regions always occur near the ends of periodic windows where the system is returning to chaos. These regions are readily apparent in the bifurcation diagrams and Lyapunov exponent plots of published systems. They become smaller in higher period windows, which increases the number of digits that remain valid. These bands have been investigated in the past by Lorenz. The edges of the regions have been extensively studied as crisis points. The scaling properties of the windows are known. Gade and Amritkar developed time-dependent generalized exponents that measure the loss of memory with time in a chaotic time series. These references report an example for the logistic map, at the chaotic parameter value r=3.59687 (L>0 at this point) where the memory is not completely lost. This is a two band region of the logistic map. It was noted in these references that the iterations hop between the two bands in a permanently set pattern. The restricted error regions are most easily found when maximum errors, rather than local errors, are monitored and can be located by setting the stopping point to be a small constant as discussed above.","We consider a period p window which begins at r=r, where\n\n()=\u2003\u2003(30)\n\nThe window contains its own transition back to chaos: there is a sequence of period doublings followed by the emergence of a set of k restricted coordinate sections at r=r\u221e. The periodic window is then seen to abruptly end at r=r. The restricted error region covers the segment r\u2266r\u2266r. This can be seen in the logistic map of . It is known that roccurs at the r value where pairs of super cycles match in value. The super cycles are the first few iterations obtained from setting the initial value to X=X, where Xis determined from df(X)\/dX=0. The point ris then found from\n\n()=().\u2003\u2003(31)\n","We consider the point rbetween rand rwhere certain pairs of super cycles also have the same slope, that is,\n\n()=(),\u2003\u2003(32)\n\nwhere the prime (\u2032) indicates differentiation with respect to r and N=1 . . . p. This is illustrated in , which shows super cycles  and  for the logistic map. It can be seen that the two super cycles have equal slope and value, then have equal slope but unequal values (r), and then later have equal values but unequal slopes (r).\n","For example, the period-3 window of the logistic map (with X=0.5) begins at the point f(X)=X, or r=1+\u221a{square root over (8)}\u2248828427125 (see ) and ends at the point where the super cycles have the same value, that is f(X,r), =f(X,r), where p=3, and N=1 . . . p. The pair f(X, r)=f(X, r) gives r=3.856800696. Point ris given by f\u2032(X, r)=f\u2032(X, r). The average rfor the (4, 7) and (5, 8) and (6, 9) pairs is r=3.85064. The r value for the period-3 window is r\u02dc3.84950. It can be found in this and numerous other calculations that r\u02dcr. This result is useful, since the r value is much more difficult to determine than the equal slope condition.","Two-Dimensional Map","We consider the maximal Lyapunov exponent for a two-dimensional map taken from Sagdeev:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00020","num":"00020"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":"X","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}},{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":"Y","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}}}]}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":"+","mn":"11"}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mi":"r","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"1.1em","height":"1.1ex"}}},"mn":"1"}}}]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":["X","j"]}}},{"mtd":{"msub":{"mi":["Y","j"]}}}]}}],"mo":"\u2061"}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"33"}}]}}}},"br":[{},{},{}],"in-line-formulae":[{},{}],"i":["L","r\/","+r\/"],"sup":["2","1\/2"],"figref":"FIG. 7"},"The Lorenz equations are\n\n\u2003\u2003(35)\n\n\u2003\u2003(36)\n\n\u2003\u2003(37)\n\nwhere a=10, b=8\/3, and the parameter c is varied from 170 to 215. The lost digits Lyapunov exponents are computed by comparing  and , for example, significant-digit solutions with a stopping point given by Equation 18. The lost digits exponent is averaged over 9 initial conditions using a constant Runge-Kutta step size of 0.02 and integrated for a maximum of 100,000 time steps, so that a tiny positive exponent could be found if it occurred. The results shown in  are virtually identical to the traditional Lyapunov exponent method results shown in the plots given in the Schuster reference (page 116) and Froyland. The largest exponents found in this plot are L=2.5 natural digits per second (this is about 1 decimal digit per second). This means that 12 decimal digits are lost in about 12 seconds (600 Runge-Kutta time steps). The system completes about two orbits per second when c=190. If a variable time step procedure is used then normally the higher precision calculation should change the step size. The single-precision calculation typically uses the time step, which has been determined by the double-precision procedure so that the two precisions stay together in time.\n","For the continuous Lorenz equations at c=190 the distribution is shown in . The distributions can show multiple peaks for chaotic parameter values near the ends of the periodic windows. For example, at c=182.57, with dt=0.02, the distribution contains 3 peaks. This indicates that the trajectory alternates between three exponents (as can be seen visually in a real time plot), or that the computed trajectory is alternating between three actual trajectories. However, the 3 peaks become a single peak for dt=0.002. This illustrates another effect of a Runge-Kutta time step that is too large.  shows the distribution, with dt=0.02, for c=133.278. In this case, however, the 2 peaks remain when the time step is reduced to dt=0.00002. This case is located near the end of a periodic window. It indicates that liquid flow systems may also display interesting behavior similar to that of the restricted error regions of the one-dimensional maps.","The number of valid digits is a direct measure of the information that is known about a system. This fact can be used to provide several methods of determining Lyapunov exponents. Maximal Lyapunov exponents are determined by the time rate of change of the number of valid digits in the system's trajectory and can be computed by combining the stopping point given by Equation 18 with either of Equations 5, 17, 19, or 20. For a flow system, the stopping point can also be combined with Equation 23, 25, or 26. The Lyapunov exponent can be experimentally measured by comparing two separate runs of a system, and applying Equations 17 and 18. This method allows Lyapunov exponents to be calculated in less than one-tenth of the computational time required by traditional methods. Furthermore, the same algorithm is applied to maps, systems of differential equations, or any numerical time evolution procedure. A new technique involving the products of the ratios of successive differential is also used to find maximal exponents in systems of differential equations. The power of this algorithm is demonstrated by providing Lyapunov exponent plots and local Lyapunov exponent distributions for the logistic map, a two-dimensional map, and the Lorenz equations. Restricted-error regions are discussed where L>0, but the error's magnitude is restricted to a fraction of the size of the available phase space.","The distribution of local Lyapunov exponents explains the noise seen in maximal Lyapunov exponent plots. A distribution of local exponents occurs because the error growth rate of any segment of a trajectory is due to the product of local slopes which are encountered by that segment. The variation in local exponents is simply a factor of the variation in local slopes. An oscillation in the distribution indicates that some interesting feature of the trajectory is causing certain integer counts to be absent from the lost-digits stopping time.
