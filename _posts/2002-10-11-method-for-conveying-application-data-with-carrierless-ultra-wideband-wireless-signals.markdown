title: Method for conveying application data with carrierless ultra wideband wireless signals
abstract: A method for conveying application data via carrierless ultra wideband wireless signals, and signals embodied in a carrierless ultra wideband waveform. Application data is encoded into wavelets that are transmitted as a carrierless ultra wideband waveform. The carrierless ultra wideband waveform is received by an antenna, and the application data is decoded from the wavelets included in the waveform. The waveforms of the signals include wavelets that have a predetermined shape that is used to modulate the data. The signals may convey, for example, Web pages and executable programs between mobile devices. The signals are low power and can penetrate obstructions making them favorable for use with a wireless node of a network.

Field of the Invention","The present invention is directed to methods and signals for ultra wideband communications, and more particularly to methods and signals for conveying application data via carrierless ultra wideband wireless signals.","2. Discussion of the Background","Digital information typically takes the form of a stream of binary pulses of a square wave, each pulse representing a bit (i.e., 1 or 0) of data. To transmit a digital stream of data, it is well known to use the digital data stream to modulate a carrier waveform and to transmit the modulated carrier waveform rather than the digital waveform. By using modulation, a carrier waveform can be used that is most compatible with the transmission channel. Typically, these waveforms are high-frequency sinusoids for transmitting signals through space.","A discussion of the reasons data signals are modulated onto carriers is included in Sklar, B., \u201cDigital Communications: Fundamentals and Applications,\u201d Prentice Hall, 1988, p. 118, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Signals are launched into space via antennas. The design of an antenna is dependent on the wavelength, \u03bb, of the signal being transmitted. A practical example illustrates one reason why signals are modulated onto high-frequency carrier waves. The wavelength, \u03bb, of a signal is equal to c\/f, where c is the speed of light, or 3\u00d710m\/s, and f is the frequency of the frequency of the signal being transmitted in Hz. It is well known by those of ordinary skill in the digital communication art that the aperture of an antenna should be at least as large as the wavelength being transmitted (see Sklar, at p. 118). Given this design constraint, it can be shown that a signal with a frequency, f, of 3000 Hz has a wavelength, \u03bb, of c\/f, or 10m, which is approximately 60 miles. Of course, it is not realistic to build an antenna with a 60 mile aperture. However, if that same signal is modulated onto a 30 GHz carrier prior to transmitting it, the antenna can have an aperture of less than \u00bd inch (see Sklar, at p. 118).","Another consideration is the bandwidth required to transmit an ideal square wave. An unmodulated, unshaped ideal square wave requires an infinite amount of bandwidth in the frequency domain. For this reason, it is well known to shape the digital pulses using a filter that will round the edges of the square wave, thereby narrowing the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. Pulse shaping and modulation are discussed in Webb, W., \u201cThe Complete Wireless Communications Professional: A Guide for Engineers and Managers,\u201d Artech House Publishers, 1999, pp. 55-64, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.","When digital information is modulated onto a carrier and transmitted through space, the power spectral density of that signal tends to be concentrated about the frequency of the carrier itself. These signals are normally generated with large antennas and at high power so that the signal is not interfered with by noise. The frequency spectrum is, of course, regulated in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Regulation of the frequency spectrum ensures that there will not be interference within the various allocated frequency ranges. Since all frequency bands contain noise, there is no practical reason to regulate transmissions that are lower than the noise.","With the popularization of the Internet, laptop personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and cellular telephones, society has become more and more dependent on the availability of information and the ability to share information. With the miniaturization of computing power, many users of information are now demanding mobile access to their information. Using conventional methods, exchanging, and sharing information requires access to network via a telephone connection, or through a direct connection to the network itself. The need for a network limits access to and sharing of information to those that can access the network.","The challenge, then, as presently recognized, is to develop an approach for transmitting and receiving information using, for example, mobile devices such as PDAs, cellular telephones, and laptop personal computers. It would be advantageous if the approach was wireless, eliminating the need for direct connection between the sharing devices. It would be advantageous if the approach were to employ communications techniques that would not fall under the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies, thereby allowing for global use.","An object of the present invention is to provide a method for communicating information using carrierless wireless signals.","The inventors of the present invention have recognized that low power carrierless transmissions can be effectively used to communicate at high data rates without interfering with narrowband or spread spectrum signals, and if the power is kept sufficiently low, the transmissions do not need to be as broadcast devices. Accordingly, another object of the present invention is to encode digital data into multi-phase wavelets that can be transmitted without a carrier at low power and at high data rates over short distances.","In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented as a method for conveying application data with carrierless ultra wideband wireless signals. The application data is encoded into wavelets that are transmitted without modulating them onto a carrier waveform. In another embodiment, the present invention is implemented as a computer data signal that is embodied in a carrierless ultra wideband waveform.","Consistent with the title of this section, the above summary is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all the features or embodiments of the present invention. A more complete, although not necessarily exhaustive, description of the features and embodiments of the invention is found in the section entitled \u201cDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00023","num":"00023"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","a"],"b":["11","9","13","11","9","13","9","9","11","13"]},"The receiver  includes an antenna  that converts a UWB electromagnetic waveform into an electrical signal (or optical signal) for subsequent processing. The UWB signal is generated with a sequence of shape-modulated wavelets, where the occurrence times of the shape-modulated wavelets may also be modulated. For analog modulation, at least one of the shape control parameters is modulated with the analog signal. More typically, the wavelets take on M possible shapes. Digital information is encoded to use one or a combination of the M wavelet shapes and occurrence times to communicate information.","In one embodiment of the present invention, each wavelet communicates one bit, for example, using two shapes such as bi-phase. In other embodiments of the present invention, each wavelet may be configured to communicate nn bits, where M\u22672. For example, four shapes may be configured to communicate two bits, such as with quadrature phase or four-level amplitude modulation. In another embodiment of the present invention, each wavelet is a \u201cchip\u201d in a code sequence, where the sequence, as a group, communicates one or more bits. The code can be M-ary at the chip level, choosing from M possible shapes for each chip.","At the chip, or wavelet level, embodiments of the present invention produce UWB waveforms. The UWB waveforms are modulated by a variety of techniques including but not limited to: (i) bi-phase modulated signals (+1, \u22121), (ii) multilevel bi-phase signals (+1, \u22121, +a1, \u2212a1, +a2, \u2212a2, . . . , +aN, \u2212aN), (iii) quadrature phase signals (+1, \u22121, +j, \u2212j), (iv) multi-phase signals (1, \u22121, exp(+j\u03c0\/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c0\/N), exp(+j\u03c02\/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c02\/N), . . . , exp(+j(N\u22121)\/N), exp(\u2212j\u03c0(N\u22121)\/N)), (v) multilevel multi-phase signals (aexp(j2\u03c0\u03b2\/N)| a\u03b5{1, a1, a2, . . . , aK}, \u03b2\u03b5{0, 1, . . . , N\u22121}), (vi) frequency modulated pulses, (vii) pulse position modulation (PPM) signals (possibly same shape pulse transmitted in different candidate time slots), (viii) M-ary modulated waveforms g(t) with B\u03b5{1, . . . , M}, and (ix) any combination of the above waveforms, such as multi-phase channel symbols transmitted according to a chirping signaling scheme. The present invention, however, is applicable to variations of the above modulation schemes and other modulation schemes (e.g., as described in , \u201cModern Digital and Analog Communications Systems,\u201d Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1998, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference herein), as will be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art(s).","Some exemplary waveforms and characteristic equations thereof will now be described. The time modulation component, for example, can be defined as follows. Let tbe the time spacing between the (i\u22121)pulse and the ipulse. Accordingly, the total time to the ipulse is \n\n\nThe signal Tcould be encoded for data, part of a spreading code or user code, or some combination thereof. For example, the signal Tcould be equally spaced, or part of a spreading code, where Tcorresponds to the zero-crossings of a chirp, i.e., the sequence of T's, and where \n\n\nfor a predetermined set of a and k. Here, a and k may also be chosen from a finite set based on the user code or encoded data.\n","An embodiment of the present invention can be described using M-ary modulation. Equation 1 below can be used to represent a sequence of exemplary transmitted or received pulses, where each pulse is a shape modulated UWB wavelet, g(t\u2212T). \n\n","In the above equation, the subscript i refers to the ipulse in the sequence of UWB pulses transmitted or received. The wavelet function g has M possible shapes, and therefore Brepresents a mapping from the data, to one of the M-ary modulation shapes at the ipulse in the sequence. The wavelet generator hardware (e.g., the UWB waveform generator ) has several control lines (e.g., coming from the radio controller and interface ) that govern the shape of the wavelet. Therefore, Bcan be thought of as including a lookup-table for the M combinations of control signals that produce the M desired wavelet shapes. The encoder  combines the data stream and codes to generate the M-ary states. Demodulation occurs in the waveform correlator  and the radio controller and interface  to recover to the original data stream. Time position and wavelet shape are combined into the pulse sequence to convey information, implement user codes, etc.","In the above case, the signal is comprised of wavelets from i=1 to infinity. As i is incremented, a wavelet is produced. Equation 2 below can be used to represent a generic wavelet pulse function, whose shape can be changed from pulse to pulse to convey information or implement user codes, etc.\n\n()=()\u00b7()+()\u00b7()\u2003\u2003(2)\n","In the above equation, function f defines a basic wavelet shape, and function h is simply the Hilbert transform of the function f. The parameter Bis a complex number allowing the magnitude and phase of each wavelet pulse to be adjusted, i.e., B=a<\u03b8, where ais selected from a finite set of amplitudes and \u03b8is selected from a finite set of phases. The parameters {B,B, . . . } represent a generic group of parameters that control the wavelet shape.","An exemplary waveform sequence x(t) can be based on a family of wavelet pulse shapes f that are derivatives of a Guassian waveform as defined by Equation 3 below. \n\n","In the above equation, the function \u03a8( ) normalizes the peak absolute value of f(t) to 1. The parameter Bcontrols the pulse duration and center frequency. The parameter Bis the number of derivatives and controls the bandwidth and center frequency.","Another exemplary waveform sequence x(t) can be based on a family of wavelet pulse shapes f that are Gaussian weighted sinusoidal functions, as described by Equation 4 below.\n\n()=sin(\u03c9).\u2003\u2003(4)\n","In the above equation, bcontrols the pulse duration, \u03c9controls the center frequency, and kcontrols a chirp rate. Other exemplary weighting functions, beside Gaussian, that are also applicable to the present invention include, for example, Rectangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman-Harris, Nutall, Taylor, Kaiser, Chebychev, etc.","Another exemplary waveform sequence x(t) can be based on a family of wavelet pulse shapes f that are inverse-exponentially weighted sinusoidal functions, as described by Equation 5 below. \n\n","In the above equation, the leading edge turn on time is controlled by t, and the turn-on rate is controlled by t. The trailing edge turn-off time is controlled by t, and the turn-off rate is controlled by t. Assuming the chirp starts at t=0 and Tis the pulse duration, the starting phase is controlled by \u03b8, the starting frequency is controlled by \u03c9, the chirp rate is controlled by k, and the stopping frequency is controlled by \u03c9+kT. An example assignment of parameter values is \u03c9=1, t=t=0.25, t=t\/0.51, and t=t\u2212t\/9.","A feature of the present invention is that the M-ary parameter set used to control the wavelet shape is chosen so as to make a UWB signal, wherein the center frequency fand the bandwidth B of the power spectrum of g(t) satisfies 2f>B>0.25f. It should be noted that conventional equations define in-phase and quadrature signals (e.g., often referred to as I and Q) as sine and cosine terms. An important observation, however, is that this conventional definition is inadequate for UWB signals. The present invention recognizes that use of such conventional definition may lead to DC offset problems and inferior performance.","Furthermore, such inadequacies get progressively worse as the bandwidth moves away from 0.25fand toward 2f. A key attribute of the exemplary wavelets (or e.g., those described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/209,460) is that the parameters are chosen such that neither f nor h in Equation 2 above has a DC component, yet f and h exhibit the required wide relative bandwidth for UWB systems.","Similarly, as a result of B>0.25f, it should be noted that the matched filter output of the UWB signal is typically only a few cycles, or even a single cycle. For example, the parameter n in Equation 3 above may only take on low values (e.g., such as those described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09\/209,460).","The compressed (i.e., coherent matched filtered) pulse width of a UWB, wavelet will now be defined with reference to . In , the time domain version of the wavelet thus represents g(t) and the Fourier transform (FT) version is represented by G(\u03c9). Accordingly, the matched filter is represented as G*(\u03c9), the complex conjugate, so that the output of the matched filter is P(\u03c9)=G(\u03c9)\u00b7G*(\u03c9). The output of the matched filter in the time domain is seen by performing an inverse Fourier transform (IFT) on P(\u03c9) so as to obtain p(t), the compressed or matched filtered pulse. The width of the compressed pulse p(t) is defined by T, which is the time between the points on the envelope of the compressed pulse E(t) that are 6 dB below the peak thereof, as shown in . The envelope waveform E(t) may be determined by Equation 6 below.\n\n()=\u221a{square root over ((()+(())}{square root over ((()+(())}\u2003\u2003(6)\n\nwhere p(t) is the Hilbert transform of p(t).\n","Accordingly, the above-noted parameterized waveforms are examples of UWB wavelet functions that can be controlled to communicate information with a large parameter space for making codes with good resulting autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions. For digital modulation, each of the parameters is chosen from a predetermined list according to an encoder that receives the digital data to be communicated. For analog modulation, at least one parameter is changed dynamically according to some function (e.g., proportionally) of the analog signal that is to be communicated.","Referring back to , the electrical signals coupled in through the antenna  are passed to a radio front end . Depending on the type of waveform, the radio front end  processes the electric signals so that the level of the signal and spectral components of the signal are suitable for processing in the UWB waveform correlator . The UWB waveform correlator  correlates the incoming signal (e.g., as modified by any spectral shaping, such as a matched filtering, partially matched filtering, simply roll-off, etc., accomplished in front end ) with different candidate signals generated by the receiver , so as to determine when the receiver  is synchronized with the received signal and to determine the data that was transmitted.","The timing generator  of the receiver  operates under control of the radio controller and interface  to provide a clock signal that is used in the correlation process performed in the UWB waveform correlator . Moreover, in the receiver , the UWB waveform correlator  correlates in time a particular pulse sequence produced at the receiver  with the receive pulse sequence that was coupled in through antenna  and modified by front end . When the two such sequences are aligned with one another, the UWB waveform correlator  provides high signal to noise ratio (SNR) data to the radio controller and interface  for subsequent processing. In some circumstances, the output of the UWB waveform correlator  is the data itself. In other circumstances, the UWB waveform correlator  simply provides an intermediate correlation result, which the radio controller and interface  uses to determine the data and determine when the receiver  is synchronized with the incoming signal.","In some embodiments of the present invention, when synchronization is not achieved (e.g., during a signal acquisition mode of operation), the radio controller and interface  provides a control signal to the receiver  to acquire synchronization. In this way, a sliding of a correlation window within the UWB waveform correlator  is possible by adjustment of the phase and frequency of the output of the timing generator  of the receiver  via a control signal from the radio controller and interface . The control signal causes the correlation window to slide until lock is achieved. The radio controller and interface  is a processor-based unit that is implemented either with hard wired logic, such as in one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or in one or more programmable processors.","Once synchronized, the receiver  provides data to an input port (\u201cRX Data In\u201d) of the radio controller and interface . An external process, via an output port (\u201cRX Data Out\u201d) of the radio controller and interface , may then use this data. The external process may be any one of a number of processes performed with data that is either received via the receiver  or is to be transmitted via the transmitter  to a remote receiver.","During a transmit mode of operation, the radio controller and interface  receives source data at an input port (\u201cTX Data In\u201d) from an external source. The radio controller and interface  then applies the data to an encoder  of the transmitter  via an output port (\u201cTX Data Out\u201d). In addition, the radio controller and interface  provides control signals to the transmitter  for use in identifying the signaling sequence of UWB pulses. In some embodiments of the present invention, the receiver  and the transmitter  functions may use joint resources, such as a common timing generator and\/or a common antenna, for example. The encoder  receives user coding information and data from the radio controller and interface  and preprocesses the data and coding so as to provide a timing input for the UWB waveform generator , which produces UWB pulses encoded in shape and\/or time to convey the data to a remote location.","The encoder  produces the control signals necessary to generate the required modulation. For example, the encoder  may take a serial bit stream and encode it with a forward error correction (FEC) algorithm (e.g., such as a Reed Solomon code, a Golay code, a Hamming code, a Convolutional code, etc.). The encoder  may also interleave the data to guard against burst errors. The encoder  may also apply a whitening function to prevent long strings of \u201cones\u201d or \u201czeros.\u201d The encoder  may also apply a user specific spectrum spreading function, such as generating a predetermined length chipping code that is sent as a group to represent a bit (e.g., inverted for a \u201cone\u201d bit and non-inverted for a \u201czero\u201d bit, etc.). The encoder  may divide the serial bit stream into subsets in order to send multiple bits per wavelet or per chipping code, and generate a plurality of control signals in order to affect any combination of the modulation schemes as described above (and\/or as described in Lathi).","The radio controller and interface  may provide some identification, such as user ID, etc., of the source from which the data on the input port (\u201cTX Data In\u201d) is received. In one embodiment of the present invention, this user ID may be inserted in the transmission sequence, as if it were a header of an information packet. In other embodiments of the present invention, the user ID itself may be employed to encode the data, such that a receiver receiving the transmission would need to postulate or have a priori knowledge of the user ID in order to make sense of the data. For example, the ID may be used to apply a different amplitude signal (e.g., of amplitude \u201cf\u201d) to a fast modulation control signal to be discussed with respect to , as a way of impressing the encoding onto the signal.","The output from the encoder  is applied to a UWB waveform generator . The UWB waveform generator  produces a UWB pulse sequence of pulse shapes at pulse times according to the command signals it receives, which may be one of any number of different schemes. The output from the UWB generator  is then provided to an antenna , which then transmits the UWB energy to a receiver.","In one UWB modulation scheme, the data may be encoded by using the relative spacing of transmission pulses (e.g., PPM, chirp, etc.). In other UWB modulation schemes, the data may be encoded by exploiting the shape of the pulses as described above (and\/or as described in ). It should be noted that the present invention is able to combine time modulation (e.g., such as pulse position modulation, chirp, etc.) with other modulation schemes that manipulate the shape of the pulses.","There are numerous advantages to the above capability, such as communicating more than one data bit per symbol transmitted from the transmitter , etc. An often even more important quality, however, is the application of such technique to implement spread-spectrum, multi-user systems, which require multiple spreading codes (e.g., such as each with spike autocorrelation functions, and jointly with low peak cross-correlation functions, etc.).","In addition, combining timing, phase, frequency, and amplitude modulation adds extra degrees of freedom to the spreading code functions, allowing greater optimization of the cross-correlation and autocorrelation characteristics. As a result of the improved autocorrelation and cross-correlation characteristics, the system according to the present invention has improved capability, allowing many transceiver units to operate in close proximity without suffering from interference from one another.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00060","num":"00060"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["1","15","1","15","27","3","3","29","29","31","31","31","31","7","7","7","19","2"],"i":"a","sub":["1","N","1","N ","1","N "]},"The timing generators -, for example, receive a phase and frequency adjustment signal, as shown in , but may also receive a fast modulation signal or other control signal(s) as well. The radio controller and interface  provides the control signals, such as phase, frequency and fast modulation signals, etc., to the timing generator module , , for time synchronization and modulation control. The fast modulation control signal may be used to implement, for example, chirp waveforms, PPM waveforms, such as fast time scale PPM waveforms, etc.","The radio controller and interface  also provides control signals to, for example, the encoder , the waveform generator , the filters , the amplifier , the T\/R switch , the front end , the tracking correlators -(corresponding to the UWB waveform correlator  of ), etc., for controlling, for example, amplifier gains, signal waveforms, filter passbands and notch functions, alternative demodulation and detecting processes, user codes, spreading codes, cover codes, etc.","During signal acquisition, the radio controller and interface  adjusts the phase input of, for example, the timing generator , in an attempt for the tracking correlator to identify and the match the timing of the signal produced at the receiver with the timing of the arriving signal. When the received signal and the locally generated signal coincide in time with one another, the radio controller and interface  senses the high signal strength or high SNR and begins to track, so that the receiver is synchronized with the received signal.","Once synchronized, the receiver will operate in a tracking mode, where the timing generator is adjusted by way of a continuing series of phase adjustments to counteract any differences in timing of the timing generator and the incoming signal. However, a feature of the present invention is that by sensing the mean of the phase adjustments over a known period of time, the radio controller and interface  adjusts the frequency of the timing generator so that the mean of the phase adjustments becomes zero. The frequency is adjusted in this instance because it is clear from the pattern of phase adjustments that there is a frequency offset between the timing generator and the clocking of the received signal. Similar operations may be performed on timing generators -, so that each receiver can recover the signal delayed by different amounts, such as the delays caused by multipath (i.e., scattering along different paths via reflecting off of local objects).","A feature of the transceiver in  is that it includes a plurality of tracking correlators -. By providing a plurality of tracking correlators, several advantages are obtained. First, it is possible to achieve synchronization more quickly (i.e., by operating parallel sets of correlation arms to find strong SNR points over different code-wheel segments). Second, during a receive mode of operation, the multiple arms can resolve and lock onto different multipath components of a signal. Through coherent addition, the UWB communication system uses the energy from the different multipath signal components to reinforce the received signal, thereby improving signal to noise ratio. Third, by providing a plurality of tracking correlator arms, it is also possible to use one arm to continuously scan the channel for a better signal than is being received on other arms.","In one embodiment of the present invention, if and when the scanning arm finds a multipath term with higher SNR than another arm that is being used to demodulate data, the role of the arms is switched (i.e., the arm with the higher SNR is used to demodulate data, while the arm with the lower SNR begins searching). In this way, the communications system dynamically adapts to changing channel conditions.","The radio controller and interface  receives the information from the different tracking correlators -and decodes the data. The radio controller and interface  also provides control signals for controlling the front end , e.g., such as gain, filter selection, filter adaptation, etc., and adjusting the synchronization and tracking operations by way of the timing generator module , .","In addition, the radio controller and interface  serves as an interface between the communication link feature of the present invention and other higher level applications that will use the wireless UWB communication link for performing other functions. Some of these functions would include, for example, performing range-finding operations, wireless telephony, file sharing, personal digital assistant (PDA) functions, embedded control functions, location-finding operations, etc.","On the transmit portion of the transceiver shown in , a timing generator also receives phase, frequency and\/or fast modulation adjustment signals for use in encoding a UWB waveform from the radio controller and interface . Data and user codes (via a control signal) are provided to the encoder , which in the case of an embodiment of the present invention utilizing time-modulation, passes command signals (e.g., \u0394t) to the timing generator for providing the time at which to send a pulse. In this way, encoding of the data into the transmitted waveform may be performed.","When the shape of the different pulses are modulated according to the data and\/or codes, the encoder  produces the command signals as a way to select different shapes for generating particular waveforms in the waveform generator . For example, the data may be grouped in multiple data bits per channel symbol. The waveform generator  then produces the requested waveform at a particular time as indicated by the timing generator . The output of the waveform generator is then filtered in filter  and amplified in amplifier  before being transmitted via antenna ,  by way of the T\/R switch .","In another embodiment of the present invention, the transmit power is set low enough that the transmitter and receiver are simply alternately powered down without need for the T\/R switch . Also, in some embodiments of the present invention, neither the filter  nor the amplifier  is needed, because the desired power level and spectrum is directly useable from the waveform generator . In addition, the filters  and the amplifier  may be included in the waveform generator  depending on the implementation of the present invention.","A feature of the UWB communications system disclosed, is that the transmitted waveform x(t) can be made to have a nearly continuous power flow, for example, by using a high chipping rate, where the wavelets g(t) are placed nearly back-to-back. This configuration allows the system to operate at low peak voltages, yet produce ample average transmit power to operate effectively. As a result, sub-micron geometry CMOS switches, for example, running at one-volt levels, can be used to directly drive antenna , , such that the amplifier  is not required. In this way, the entire radio can be integrated on a single monolithic integrated circuit.","Under certain operating conditions, the system can be operated without the filters . If, however, the system is to be operated, for example, with another radio system, the filters  can be used to provide a notch function to limit interference with other radio systems. In this way, the system can operate simultaneously with other radio systems, providing advantages over conventional devices that use avalanching type devices connected straight to an antenna, such that it is difficult to include filters therein.","The UWB transceiver of or  may be used to perform a radio transport function for interfacing with different applications as part of a stacked protocol architecture. In such a configuration, the UWB transceiver performs signal creation, transmission and reception functions as a communications service to applications that send data to the transceiver and receive data from the transceiver much like a wired I\/O port. Moreover, the UWB transceiver may be used to provide a wireless communications function to any one of a variety of devices that may include interconnection to other devices either by way of wired technology or wireless technology. Thus, the UWB transceiver of or  may be used as part of a local area network (LAN) connecting fixed structures or as part of a wireless personal area network (WPAN) connecting mobile devices, for example. In any such implementation, all or a portion of the present invention may be conveniently implemented in a microprocessor system using conventional general purpose microprocessors programmed according to the teachings of the present invention, as will be apparent to those skilled in the microprocessor systems art. Appropriate software can be readily prepared by programmers of ordinary skill based on the teachings of the present disclosure, as will be apparent to those skilled in the software art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00075","num":"00075"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["301","301","303","305","303","301","307","303","305","307","305","301","309","303","305","311","303"]},"The processor system  may also include special purpose logic devices (e.g., application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) or configurable logic devices (e.g, simple programmable logic devices (SPLDs), complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), or re-programmable field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)).
