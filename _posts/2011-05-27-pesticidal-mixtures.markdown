Therefore there is a need for pest control agents that help prevent or overcome resistance.","Another problem underlying the present invention is the desire for compositions that improve plants, a process which is commonly and hereinafter referred to as \u201cplant health\u201d.","The term plant health comprises various sorts of improvements of plants that are not connected to the control of pests. For example, advantageous properties that may be mentioned are improved crop characteristics including: emergence, crop yields, protein content, oil content, starch content, more developed root system (improved root growth), improved stress tolerance (e.g. against drought, heat, salt, UV, water, cold), reduced ethylene (reduced production and\/or inhibition of reception), tillering increase, increase in plant height, bigger leaf blade, less dead basal leaves, stronger tillers, greener leaf color, pigment content, photosynthetic activity, less input needed (such as fertilizers or water), less seeds needed, more productive tillers, earlier flowering, early grain maturity, less plant verse (lodging), increased shoot growth, enhanced plant vigor, increased plant stand and early and better germination; or any other advantages familiar to a person skilled in the art.","If used in connection with the treatment of plant propagation material (preferably seeds) the term \u201cplant health\u201d is equivalent with \u201cseed vitality\u201d. Seed vitality manifests itself in a variety of factors. Examples of factors which are manifestations of the plant's vitality are:\n\n","Preferably, the term \u201cSeed vitality\u201d denotes plant stand density, storability of seeds and\/or germination behavior.","A further object of various efforts in crop protection is to increase the yield of plants. \u201cYield\u201d is to be understood as any plant product of economic value that is produced by the plant such as grains, fruits in the proper sense, vegetables, nuts, grains, seeds, wood (e.g. in the case of silviculture plants) or even flowers (e.g. in the case of gardening plants, ornamentals). The plant products may in addition be further utilized and\/or processed after harvesting.","According to the present invention, \u201cincreased yield\u201d of a plant, in particular of an agricultural, silvicultural and\/or horticultural plant, preferably agricultural plant means that the yield of a product of the respective plant is increased by a measurable amount over the yield of the same product of the plant produced under the same conditions, but without the application of the mixture according to the invention.","Increased yield can be characterized, among others, by following improved properties of the plant:\n\n","According to the present invention, the yield is increased by at least 2%, preferable by at least 4%, more preferred by at least 8%, even more preferred by at least 16%.","It has to be emphasized that the above effects of the mixture of the invention or of compound I when used alone, i.e. enhanced crop yield of the plant, also are present when the plant is not under biotic stress and in particular when the plant is not under pest pressure, such as fungi or insect stress. It is evident that a plant suffering from pest attack produces a smaller biomass and a smaller crop yield as compared to a plant which has been subjected to curative or preventive treatment against the pest and which can grow without the damage caused by the biotic stress factor. However, the use and the method according to the invention lead to an enhanced crop yield even in the absence of any biotic stress and in particular in the absence of any pest. This means that the positive effect of the mixture of the invention or of compound I used alone on the crop yield cannot be explained just by the pesticidal activities of the mixture, but is based on further activity profiles.

The mixture of the invention is particularly useful for controlling insects of the order Thysanoptera and Homoptera.","The mixtures of the present invention show synergistic action against the pests to be controlled. Synergism can be described as an interaction where the combined effect of a mixture of two or more compounds is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each of the compounds. The presence of a synergistic effect, in terms of percent control, between two mixing partners (X and Y) can be calculated using the Colby equation (Colby, S. R., 1967, Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses in Herbicide Combinations, Weeds, 15, 20-22):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0308","num":"0411"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mi":"E","mo":"=","mrow":{"mi":["X","Y"],"mo":["+","-"],"mfrac":{"mi":"XY","mn":"100"}}}}}},"In Colby's formula X and Y are the % control observed for the individual compounds at a given concentration. E is the expected combined control effect, which would be expected in the absence of synergism, if the compounds were applied together at the same concentrations of solo application. When the control effect observed for the mixture (i.e. the observed combined control effect) is greater than the expected combined control effect (E) as calculated from Colby's formula, then the observed effect is synergistic.","The expected efficacies of active compound mixtures were determined using Colby's formula [R. S. Colby, \u201cCalculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations\u201d, Weeds 15, 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.","Microtests","The active compounds were formulated separately as a stock solution having a concentration of 10000 ppm in dimethyl sulfoxide.","The compound of formula I was used as a commercial finished formulation and diluted with water to the stated concentration of the active compound.","The stock solutions were mixed according to the ratio, pipetted onto a micro titer plate (MTP) and diluted with water to the stated concentrations.

The measured parameters were compared to the growth of the active compound-free control variant (100%) and the fungus-free and active compound-free blank value to determine the relative growth in % of the pathogens in the respective active compounds.
