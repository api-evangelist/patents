title: Blast-resistant concrete also suitable for limiting penetration of ballistic fragments
abstract: Concrete with improved strength and toughness. A uniform mix of first constituents comprises: cement of Blaine fineness of 280-360 m/kg; sand at a mass ratio of 0.75-1.25 of the cement; silica fume at a mass ratio of 0.15-0.4 of the cement; silica flour at a mass ratio of 0.15-0.3 of the cement; and microinclusions at a mass ratio up to 0.35 of the cement. This is then mixed with a blend of second constituents comprising a specified amount of an HRWRA and an amount of water at a mass ratio of 0.2-0.35 of the cement. This is mixed sufficiently to form a uniform cement-based paste to which an amount of macrofibers at a mass ratio of up to 0.35 of the cement is added to yield a uniform product. Nanoinclusions may be added to improve crack resistance and increase density.

Because cement, typically portland cement, is the active component of concrete and usually has the greatest unit cost, its selection and proper use are important in obtaining the balance of properties meeting user needs.","Type I and type I\/II portland cements are the most popular cements used. However, some applications require other types for meeting user requirements. The need for high early strength cements in pavement repairs and the use of blended cements with aggregates susceptible to alkali-aggregate reactions are examples of such applications. The choice involves the correct knowledge of the relationship between cement and performance and, in particular, between type of cement and durability of the resultant concrete.","ASTM C 150 defines portland cement as \u201chydraulic cement (cement that not only hardens by reacting with water but also forms a water-resistant product) produced by pulverizing clinkers consisting essentially of hydraulic calcium silicates, usually containing one or more of the forms of calcium sulfate as an interground addition.\u201d Clinkers are nodules (approximate diameters, 5-25 mm [0.2-1.0 inch]) of a sintered material that is produced when a raw mixture of predetermined composition is heated to high temperature. The low cost and widespread availability of limestone, shales, and other naturally occurring materials make portland cement one of the least expensive building materials widely used over the last century.","Different types of portland cement meet physical and chemical requirements for specific purposes, such as durability and high early strength. Eight types of cement are covered in ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 85. These types and their uses are listed in Table 1.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Portland Cement Types and Uses"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"63pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"154pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CEMENT TYPE","USE"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["I","General purpose cement, when there are no"]},{"entry":[{},"extenuating conditions"]},{"entry":["II","Aids in providing moderate resistance to sulfate"]},{"entry":[{},"attack"]},{"entry":["III","When high-early strength is required"]},{"entry":["IV","When a low heat of hydration is desired (in massive"]},{"entry":[{},"structures)"]},{"entry":["V","When high sulfate resistance is required"]},{"entry":["IA","A type I cement containing an integral air-"]},{"entry":[{},"entraining agent"]},{"entry":["IIA","A type II cement containing an integral air-"]},{"entry":[{},"entraining agent"]},{"entry":["IIIA","A type III cement containing an integral air-"]},{"entry":[{},"entraining agent"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00001"},"sup":"1"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00002"},"sup":"2","sub":"2"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00003"},"sup":"3"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"left","id":"FOO-00004"},"sup":"4"}}]}}]}}},"More than 92% of portland cement produced in the United States is Type I and II (or Type I\/II). Type III accounts for about 3.5% of cement production. U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Cement Mineral Yearbook, Washington, D.C., 1989. Type IV cement is available only on special request, and Type V may also be difficult to obtain, accounting for less than 0.5% of production.","If a given type of cement is not available, comparable results can frequently be obtained by using modifications of available types. High early strength concrete, for example, may be made by using a higher content of Type I when Type III cement is not available or by using admixtures such as chemical accelerators or high-range water reducers (HRWR). National Material Advisory Board, -, NMAB-437, Washington, D.C., National Academy Press, 1987.","The composition of portland cements is what distinguishes one type of cement from another. ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 85 give the standard chemical requirements for each type. The phase compositions in portland cement are denoted by ASTM as tricalcium silicate (CS), dicalcium silicate (CS), tricalcium aluminate (CA), and tetracalcium aluminoferrite (CAF). Note that these compositions occur at a phase equilibrium of all components in the mix and do not reflect effects of bum temperatures, quenching, oxygen availability, and other real-world kiln conditions. The actual components are often complex chemical crystalline and amorphous structures, denoted by cement chemists as \u201calite\u201d (CS), \u201cbelite\u201d (CS), and various forms of aluminates. The behavior of each type of cement depends on the proportions of these components.","Studies have shown that early hydration of cement is principally controlled by the amount and activity of CA, balanced by the amount and type of sulfate interground with the cement. CA hydrates rapidly and will influence early bonding characteristics. Abnormal hydration of CA and poor control of this hydration by sulfate can lead to such problems as flash set, false set, slump loss, and cement-admixture incompatibility. Previte, R., , ACI Journal Proceedings 74 (8):361-67, 1977; Whiting, D., , ACI special publication, Permeability of Concrete SP-108: 195-222, 1988; Meyer, L. M. and W. F. Perenchio, , Concrete International, Design and Construction 1 (1):36-43, 1979.","Development of the internal structure of hydrated cement, referred to as the microstructure, occurs after the concrete has set and continues for months, and often years, after placement. The microstructure of the cement as it hydrates determines the mechanical behavior and durability of the resultant concrete. In terms of cement composition, CS and CS have the primary influence on long-term development of structure, although aluminates may contribute to formation of compounds such as ettringite (sulfoaluminate hydrate), which may cause expansive disruption of concrete. Cements high in CS, in particular those that are finely ground to less than about 40 microns, hydrate rapidly and lead to high early strength. However, hydration products adversely affect hydration as the concrete ages, in some cases leading to an ultimate strength lower than desired. Cements high in CS hydrate slowly, leading to a dense ultimate structure and a high long-term strength. The relative ratio of CS to CS, and the overall fineness of cements, has been steadily increasing over the past few decades. This ability to achieve desired strengths at a higher workability, and hence a higher water content (w\/c), may account for many durability problems, as it is now established that higher w\/c invariably leads to higher permeability in the concrete. Ruettgers, A., E. N. Vidal, and S. P. Wing, , ACI Journal Proceedings 31:382-416, 1935; Whiting, 1988.","One of the major aspects of cement chemistry that concerns users is the influence of chemical admixtures on portland cement. Since the early 1960's most states have permitted or required the use of water-reducing and other admixtures in highway pavements and structures. Mielenz, R., , Concrete International: Design and Construction 6 (4):40-54 (April), 1984. A wide variety of chemical admixtures have been introduced to the concrete industry recently, and engineers are increasingly concerned about the effects of these admixtures on performance.","Considerable research dealing with admixtures has been conducted. Air-entraining agents are widely used in the highway industry in North America, where concrete is subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Air-entraining agents have no appreciable effect on the rate of hydration of cement or on the chemical composition of hydration products. Ramachandran, V. S. and R. F. Feldman, , In Concrete Admixtures Handbook: Properties, Science, and Technology, ed. V. Ramachandran, 1-54, Park Ridge, N.J., Noyes Publications, 1984. However, an increase in cement fineness or a decrease in cement alkali content generally increases the amount of an admixture required for a given air content. ACI Comm. 225R 1985. Water reducers or retarders influence cement compounds and their hydration. Lignosulfonate based admixtures affect the hydration of CA, which controls the setting and early hydration of cement. CS and CAF hydration is also influenced by water reducers. Ramachandran and Feldman (1984).","ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 85 specify certain physical requirements for each type of cement. These properties include 1) fineness, 2) soundness, 3) consistency, 4) setting time, 5) compressive strength, 6) heat of hydration, 7) specific gravity, and 8) loss of ignition. Each one of these properties has an influence on performance. The fineness of the cement, for example, affects the rate of hydration. Greater fineness increases the surface available for hydration, causing greater early strength and more rapid generation of heat, e.g., the fineness of Type III is higher than that of Type I cement. U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, , Report no. FHWA-Ed-89-006 (August). Washington, D.C., FHWA, 1990.","ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 85 specifications are similar except with regard to fineness of cement. AASHTO M 85 requires coarser cement that results in high ultimate strengths and low early strength gain. The Wagner Turbidimeter and the Blaine air permeability test for measuring cement fineness are both required by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) and the American Association for State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Average Blaine fineness of modern cement ranges from 3,000 to 5,000 cm\/g.","Soundness, i.e., the ability of hardened cement-based paste to retain its volume after setting, is characterized by measuring the expansion of mortar bars in an autoclave. ASTM C 191, AASHTO T 130. The compressive strength of 50-mm (2-inch) mortar cubes after seven days, as measured by ASTM C 109, should be greater than 19.3 MPa (2,800 psi) for Type I cement. Other physical properties included in both ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 95 are specific gravity and false set. False set is a significant loss of plasticity shortly after mixing due to the formation of gypsum or the formation of ettringite. In many cases, workability may be restored by remixing the concrete before casting.","Effects of the type of cement on the most important concrete properties are presented in Table 2. Cement composition and fineness control concrete properties. Fineness of cement affects the placeability, workability, and water content of a mixture much like the amount of cement used does.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Effects of Cement Property on Concrete Characteristics"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["CHARACTERISTIC","CEMENT PROPERTY"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Placeability","amount, fineness, setting characteristics"]},{"entry":["Strength","composition (CS, CS and CA), loss on"]},{"entry":[{},"ignition, fineness"]},{"entry":["Drying Shrinkage","SOcontent, composition"]},{"entry":["Permeability","composition, fineness"]},{"entry":["Resistance to Sulfate","CA content"]},{"entry":["Alkali Silica Reactivity","alkali content"]},{"entry":["Corrosion of Embedded Steel","composition (esp.

C. Hayes, and H. M. Mann, , ACI Journal Proceedings 51 (3):285-98, 1954. Coarse cement tends to produce pastes with higher porosity than that produced by fine cement. Powers et al. 1954.

The higher the CA content, the more chloride that is tied into chloroaluminate complexes and unavailable for catalysis of the corrosion process.","Blended cement, as defined in ASTM C 595, is a mixture of portland cement and blast furnace slag (BFS) or a \u201cmixture of portland cement and a pozzolan (most commonly fly ash).\u201d The use of blended cements in concrete reduces mixing water and bleeding, improves finishability and workability, enhances sulfate resistance, inhibits the alkali-aggregate reaction, and lessens heat evolution during hydration, thus moderating the chances for thermal cracking on cooling.

During the early hydrating period after setting, expansive cement-based paste increases in volume significantly more than does portland cement-based paste. Expansive cement is used to compensate for volume decrease due to shrinkage and to induce tensile stress in reinforcement.","Expansive cement-based concrete used to minimize cracking caused by drying shrinkage in concrete slabs, pavements, and structures is termed shrinkage-compensating concrete. ACI Committee 223, -, ACI 223-83, American Concrete Institute, Detroit, Mich., 1983.","Self-stressing concrete is another expansive cement-based concrete in which the expansion, if restrained, induces a compressive stress high enough to result in a significant residual compression in the concrete after drying shrinkage has occurred.","Three kinds of expansive cement are defined in ASTM C 845:","Type K: Contains anhydrous calcium aluminate;","Type M: Contains calcium aluminate and calcium sulfate; and","Type S: Contains tricalcium aluminate and calcium sulfate. Only Type K is used in any significant amount in the United States.","Concrete placed in an environment where it begins to dry and lose moisture will begin to shrink. The amount of drying shrinkage that occurs in concrete depends on the characteristics of the materials, mixture proportions, and placing methods. When pavements or other structural members are restrained by subgrade friction, reinforcement, or other portions of the structure, drying shrinkage will induce tensile stresses. These drying shrinkage stresses usually exceed the concrete tensile strengths, causing cracking. The advantage of using expansive cements is to induce stresses large enough to compensate for drying shrinkage stresses and minimize cracking. ACI Comm. 223 1983; Hoff, G. C. et al., 2 vols, Report no. FHWA-RD-77-110 (May), U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Miss., 1977.","Physical and mechanical properties of shrinkage compensating concrete are similar to those of portland cement concrete (PCC). Tensile, flexural, and compressive strengths are comparable to those in PCC. Air-entraining admixtures are as effective with shrinkage-compensating concrete as with portland cement in improving freeze-thaw durability.","Some water-reducing admixtures may be incompatible with expansive cement. Type A water-reducing admixture, for example, may increase the slump loss of shrinkage-compensating concrete. Call, B. M., , Concrete International: Design and Construction, January: 44-47, 1979. Fly ash and other pozzolans may affect expansion and may also influence strength development and other physical properties.","In Japan, admixtures containing expansive compounds are used instead of expansive cements. Tsuji and Miyake described using expansive admixtures in building chemically pre-stressed precast concrete box culverts. T suji, Y. and N. Miyake, , Concrete International: Design and Construction 10 (5):76-82 (May), 1988. Bending characteristics of chemically pre-stressed concrete box culverts were identical to those of reinforced concrete units of greater thickness. Tsuji and Miyake (1988).","Very-high-strength concrete (VHSC) is made from the same general constituents as conventional concrete, i.e., cementitious material, water, aggregate, and admixture for removing air and water from the mix. Careful selection of constituents and proportions, as well as proper processing, results in significant increases in both tensile and compressive strength, toughness, durability, and reduced water permeability. Physical and mechanical properties may be improved by the application of heat and pressure during casting and curing. Defining characteristics of VHSC include:\n\n","Conventional concrete is very heterogeneous incorporating constituents from fine cement to coarse aggregates. Under a system of forces, each of these constituents deforms at its own rate. The differential movement of these components produces strain between the constituents that begin the process of tensile fracture when the strain exceeds the capacity of the concrete. VHSC comprises particles of similar moduli and size, contributing to a greater homogeneity of the concrete and reducing any differential tensile strain, thereby ultimately increasing the load-carrying capacity. Conventional formulations of VHSC often incorporate macro-length reinforcing fibers (macrofibers) to enhance \u201ctoughness\u201d and have a rheology that requires retention in formwork until they are hydrated (hardened).","In selecting and mixing constituents for VHSC, particle-packing techniques are employed to maximize the solids per unit volume to achieve an optimally high \u201cdenseness,\u201d i.e., the relative amount of volume attributed to solids. The largest particle in VHSC is the aggregate, e.g., sand, having a maximum particle size of 4.75 mm. The next largest size is that of the cement at between 10 and 100 microns (\u03bcm). The smallest size used in conventional VHSC is that of silica flume at about 0.1 \u03bcm. The higher the \u201cdenseness,\u201d and thus, the greater the strength, the lower the permeability because the voids are fewer and smaller.","The strength of VHSC is further enhanced via incorporation of pozzolanics, such as fine siliceous or aluminous powders. These react to form hydration products. VHSC formulations employ materials with a high silica content, such as low carbon silica flume, to achieve high strength. These materials include chemically active silica that facilitates production of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H), bonding the other constituents together. Large amounts of C-S-H increase the strength of the binder, improving the bond between cement and aggregate.","To optimize a VHSC formulation, the water to cement (w\/c) ratio must be controlled. For example, water needed to hydrate all of the portland cement in a mix requires a w\/c ratio of about 0.4. Water not chemically or physically combined in the hydration or pozzolanic reactions weakens the resultant concrete. Thus, the volume of water in a VHSC mix is kept lower than that needed to hydrate all the cement, insuring that the water is consumed in the hydration and pozzolanic reactions. Because this low volume of water may affect workability of the mix, at least one high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWRA) may be added.","Conventional VHSC may exhibit an ultimate compressive strength near 175 MPa when processed at ambient temperature. Curing at 90\u00b0 C. for a few days yields compressive strength greater than 200 MPa. Further, compression of the product during early hydration to remove excess air and water, and heating up to 400\u00b0 C. on a reasonable schedule, yields VHSC having a compressive strength of 800 MPa.","The tensile strength of conventional VHSC may be made greater than conventional concrete. The tensile strength of VHSC with a compressive strength of 180 MPa may be about 10 MPa, but may be enhanced via use of steel reinforcing fibers, typically macrofibers. These fibers increase the first-crack load, the ultimate load-bearing capacity and significantly increase flexural toughness.","Conventional VHSC exhibits a near linear stress-strain relationship to failure as fabricated without reinforcing fibers, typically macrofibers, exhibiting a typical fracture energy of less than 140 J\/m. Incorporating macrofibers in a VHSC improves response in the post-first-crack region of the load-to-failure cycle. Best results have been seen using hooked-end steel macrofibers of about 0.5 mm diameter. The large number of small macrofibers crossing the path of potential cracks, coupled with the good bond between the macrofibers and the matrix, greatly increase toughness. Cargile, Dr. J. Donald et al., ----, The AMPTIAC Quarterly, Vol. 6, No. 4, 1999.","Field tests subjected thin concrete panels to fragment penetration. These panels were made from predecessor formulations to those of embodiments of the present invention. The panels experienced high resistance to dynamic loads of blast and penetration. O'Neil, E.

Select embodiments of the present invention envision inexpensive concrete products that provide dynamic resistance to blast and penetration forces at a level equivalent to more expensive materials, such as ceramics.","In select embodiments of the present invention, a superior concrete, marketed as COR-TUF\u2122, provides a combination of high strength and superior energy absorbing capacity, or \u201ctoughness,\u201d against blast and ballistic penetration. Toughness is a measure of the amount of energy required to be expended to open cracks in the matrix under tensile loading. It is an important metric for objects that suffer impact.","Select embodiments of the present invention provide formulations and methods of fabrication for producing an optimum combination of increased strength and toughness in a custom concrete component that may be formulated with diverse types and lengths of both macrofibers and microinclusions, such as micro-sized fibers (microfibers), or nanoinclusions (some available as nanofibers and others as nanoparticles).

Select embodiments of the present invention obtain superior strength and toughness qualities through, among other considerations, proper selection of the type and quantity of constituents, including macro-, micro- and nano-sized inclusions of specified composition.","Macro- and microfiber reinforcement contributes to an optimum combination of strength and toughness.

In select embodiments of the present invention, an HRWRA may be added in specified amounts of about 3 -20 fluid ounces per 100 lbs of the cement-based paste.","For select embodiments of the present invention, constituents may vary within the initial mix. For example, the cement may be portland cement of high-silica content, i.e., a calcium to silica ratio (Ca\/Si) of less than about 3.1. Silica fume may be incorporated, of preferably at least 96% silica with a carbon content of less than about 4%. Silica flour may be incorporated, preferably as pure, finely crushed silica of less than about 40 microns. Macrofibers may be selected from the group consisting of: steel fibers, synthetic fibers, polymer fibers, organic fibers, natural inorganic fibers, and the like, and combinations-thereof. Preferably, macrofibers are provided in lengths between about 18 to about 38 mm (0.75 -1.5 in.) and in diameters between about 0.38 to about 0.63 mm (0.015 -0.025 in.). The ends of the macrofibers may be hooked, straight, or \u201cbulbed.\u201d Special treatment of the macrofibers, such as bonding silica fume or glass frit to the surface or roughening the surface, enhances the bond between the cement-based paste and the macrofibers.

Micro- and nanoinclusions may be selected from the group comprising: fiber-like microinclusions, spherical microinclusions, polyhedron microinclusions, fiber-like nanoinclusions, spherical nanoinclusions, polyhedron nanoinclusions, and the like, and combinations thereof. In select embodiments of the present invention, microinclusions may have a longest dimension from about one micron to about 150 microns.","Microinclusions may be selected from the group of materials comprising: metals, ceramics, organics, natural minerals, and the like, and combinations thereof. Specific configurations of these microinclusion and nanoinclusion materials may be selected from the group comprising: steel shavings, ceramic whiskers, ceramic spheres, mineral fibers, wollastonite, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, and the like, and combinations thereof. Further, nanoinclusions may be selected from the class of materials of a colloidal nature such as colloidal silica.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the rheology of the constituents in the mix may range from highly flowable to that of stiff dough or clay, depending on the concentration of each of the constituents. The rheology of a particular mix is dependent on the volume and surface area of dry constituents (including the microinclusions and select nanoinclusions), the volume of water, and the mass of the HRWRA used. For example, a stiff dough-like mixture suitable for extruding or spin-casting contains a relatively high volume of dry constituents, a relatively low volume of water and a relatively moderate to low mass of an HRWRA. Conversely, a flowable mixture contains a relatively low volume of dry constituents, a relatively high volume of water and a relatively high mass of an HRWRA.","For mixing select embodiments of the present invention, equipment for making \u201cstiff\u201d mixtures comprises a shear-type mixer, such as a paddle or star-wheel mixer. These impart high-shear energy to the wetted constituents, readily converting them into a cement-based paste, albeit a stiff paste. The greater the shear-imparting energy imparted to the constituents in mixing, the quicker they form into a cement-based paste. For mixing select embodiments of the present invention, equipment for making \u201cflowable\u201d mixtures may be conventional drum-type mixers or the above high-shear mixers.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the process comprises loading dry constituents, including microinclusions and select nanoinclusions, such as microfibers and nanofibers, into the bowl of the mixer and first blending them in the dry state for about ten minutes. The HRWRA and water, and optionally, any colloidal nanoinclusions, are blended separately from the dry constituents and then added to the dry ingredients as the mixer is operating. Mixing continues to yield a homogeneous cement-based paste. In select embodiments of the present invention, the wet mixing may consume an hour depending on the amount of shear energy being imparted to the mixture and the volume of water and mass of the HRWRA added to wet the dry constituents. The mixture becomes a \u201chomogenized\u201d paste when no more individual particles are visible and the components in the mixer have come together as a single mass of cement-based paste having no separately distinguishable components. At this point, for select embodiments of the present invention, macrofibers may be added and blended for ten minutes to allow them to distribute evenly.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the cement-based paste is placed in molds to hydrate (harden). In select embodiments of the present invention, the molding procedure depends on the rheology of the final cement-based paste. Flowable cement-based pastes are placed or poured into molds that contain the cement-based paste until it hydrates.","In select embodiments of the present invention, fluid cement-basedspaste-maybe-vibrated by placing molds filled with cement-based paste on an external vibrating table and vibrating the mold and cement-based paste as a unit, or by inserting internal vibrators into the cement-based paste and vibrating until it is consolidated. Vibration frees entrapped air voids from the cement-based paste and consolidates solid constituents into a tightly packed configuration.","In select embodiments of the present invention, \u201cstiff\u201d mixtures of the cement-based paste are shaped by pressure molding, extrusion molding, or spin casting. In select embodiments of the present invention, pressure molding comprises rolling or pressing a dough-like cement-based paste into a prepared mold or pressing a dough-like cement-based paste to a given thickness as in the case of making plates or tiles. In select embodiments of the present invention, placing a dough-like cement-based paste into an extruder and applying pressure to force it through the die yields a final molded shape. Extruded product may need to be supported until it hardens to prevent it from changing shape. In select embodiments of the present invention, spin casting involves placing a dough-like cement-based paste along the longitudinal axis of the inside of a mold and spinning the mold at high speed to distribute the cement-based paste evenly over the inside of the mold with the centrifugal force created by the spinning.","In select embodiments of the present invention, the molded, extruded or spun-cast cement-based paste is left in the mold or supported in the extruded or spun-cast shape until it has hydrated. This is normally 24 hours, but may be longer depending on the amount of the HRWRA specified for the formulation. In select embodiments of the present invention, product is not removed from the mold until it has achieved a stiffness that resists deformation under moderate force, such as thumb pressure.","In select embodiments of the present invention, curing may be done by conventional methods such as water curing or by applying a curing compound for the same length of time as conventional cement-based paste is cured. However, conventional curing methods may not yield an optimum combination of strength and toughness. To achieve a desired combination, in select embodiments of the present invention, the hydrated but not fully cured, cement-based paste is heated. In select embodiments of the present invention, prior to heating, the cement-based paste is cured for about seven days in an environment of approximately 100% relative humidity at ambient temperature, approximately 21\u00b0 C.\u00b13\u00b0 C. (70\u00b0 F.\u00b15\u00b0 F), submersed in water at approximately 88\u00b0 C.\u00b13\u00b0 C. (190\u00b0 F.\u00b15\u00b0 F.) for about three to about five days, and heated in air at approximately 88\u00b0 C.\u00b13\u00b0 C. (190\u00b0 F. \u00b1 5\u00b0 F.) for about one to about two days. This process configures amorphous calcium silicate hydrate as a structure that is more like a crystalline structure than the original amorphous calcium silicate hydrate.","A baseline VHSC mixture for experimental concrete cubes, as given in Table 4 below, was provided for each of a series of 3M\u00ae microsphere-enhanced compositions. The microspheres used are 3M\u00ae high-strength ceramic microspheres (product description G-800) that are thick-walled spheres of nominal diameter ranging from 0.3 -200 microns. The microspheres were added to the baseline mixture in percent (by volume) ranging from 0 (baseline) to 12% in 1\u00bd% increments. Specimens were cured at 100% relative humidity at 25\u00b0 C. for seven days, then in hot water @90\u00b0 C. for four days, and finally in 90\u00b0 C. air for two days.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0066"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 4"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Baseline VHSC Mix (grams) for Test Cubes"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Cement","Sand","Si Flour","Si Fume","HRWRA","Water"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["1123.78","1087.20","311.09","437.12","33.71","247.23"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Refer to the figure for a graph of example test results for the addition of 3M\u00ae microspheres to the above VHSC mixture in amounts from 1\u00bd-12% by volume. Upon adding the 3M\u00ae microspheres, at an optimum volume percent of microspheres, the ultimate compressive strength of the resultant custom concrete component increases by approximately thirty percent and toughness (not shown separately in the graph) increases by approximately ten percent over that of conventional VHSC. The data for a baseline VHSC are the points  along the ordinate (x=0) indicating no microspheres added to the concrete. With additions of 3M\u00ae microspheres the average strength of the mixture increases with a maximum average strength occurring at a 6% (by volume) addition of microspheres as indicated at  where average strength was 36.9 KSI. This is a 36.5% increase in compressive strength over conventional VHSC. As the percent of microspheres increases from 6% the average strength decreases slightly with the observation that one of the cubes with a 7.5% microsphere content yields at 40.1 KSI as indicated at . Although the microinclusions (3M\u00ae microspheres) were added as a volume percent in this example, a preferred method when fabricating actual structure, as opposed to test samples, is to provide the microinclusions as a mass percent of the cement used in the formulation.","As shown, select embodiments of the present invention provide a concrete that is both strong and tough for fabricating superior building components. These superior components may be made in any shape through form casting while conventional structural shapes may be made by either mold extrusion or spin-casting.","Select embodiments of the present invention are suitable for fabricating inexpensive structural panels, such as thin concrete armor panels that may be used for vehicles as well as fixed structures. Structural armor panels may be formed or extruded to a thickness heretofore impractical because of the improved toughness and strength of embodiments of the present invention. For example, panels may be produced in size and thickness to accommodate man-portability. These man-portable panels may be configured for attaching to a structural framework to resist penetration of small arms fire and mitigate blast and fragmentation effects.","Military forces use a variety of protective materials ranging from soil cover to expensive, high-performance, lightweight ballistic ceramics.
