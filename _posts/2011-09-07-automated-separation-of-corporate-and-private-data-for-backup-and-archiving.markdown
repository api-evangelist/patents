{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the invention relate to the field of data backup and archival, and more particularly, to separating private and corporate data for backup and archival purposes.","It is common for corporate employees to use corporate resources (e.g., corporate email systems, corporate computers, corporate phones, etc.) for personal uses. Such mixed use of corporate resources for both corporate purposes and personal purposes introduces a number of problems with regards to the generation of backups and archives.","Mixed use of corporate resources causes the resources to include mixed personal and corporate data. Conventional backup and archival systems are not able to distinguish between the corporate and personal data. Accordingly, conventional backup systems simply backup all personal data along with the corporate data. This increases an amount of storage space that is used by the backup and archive systems. Additionally, there may be legal ramifications of the corporation backing up the users' personal data. Employees may also be uncomfortable with having their personal data backed up by the corporation. Moreover, when an employee leaves the corporation, the employee loses access to their personal data that has been archived or backed up by the corporation. Finally, employees who attempt to perform personal backups of their personal data that is on the corporate resources may inadvertently copy sensitive corporate data into the employee's personal backup.","In one embodiment, a computing device categorizes a plurality of data items, wherein each data item is categorized as a corporate data item when one or more first criteria are satisfied and as a personal data item when one or more second criteria are satisfied. The computing device provides the plurality of corporate data items to a first backup system that stores the corporate data items to a corporate data store. The computing device provides the plurality of personal data items to a second backup system that stores the personal data items to a personal data store.","In one embodiment, categorizing a data item comprises assigning a rating to the data item indicating a likelihood that the data item is a corporate data item, providing the data item to the first backup system if the rating is within a first rating range, and providing the data item to the second backup system if the rating is within a second rating range. In one embodiment, the categorizing is performed using a data loss prevention (DLP) system. For each data item, the DLP system applies at least one of indexed document matching, exact data matching, described content matching or vector machine learning to determine whether the data item contains sensitive information, wherein the data item is categorized as a corporate data item if the data item contains sensitive information.","In one embodiment, the computing device receives a user designation of the second backup system and of authentication credentials to use for accessing the second backup system. In one embodiment, the computing device scans previously backed up or archived data in the corporate data store. The computing device then separates out personal data items from the previously backed up or archived data, stores the personal data items to the personal data store, and deletes the personal data items from the corporate data store.","In one embodiment, the computing device includes a file system filter driver that intercepts an attempt by the first backup system to access the plurality of data items. The file system filter driver filters out the personal data items from the plurality of data items so that only the corporate data items are accessible by the first backup system. In one embodiment, the computing device includes a file system filter driver that intercepts an attempt by the second backup system to access the plurality of data items. The file system filter driver filters out the corporate data items from the plurality of data items so that only the personal data items are accessible by the second backup system.","In one embodiment, a computer readable medium includes instructions that will cause a processor that executes the instructions to categorize a plurality of data items, wherein each data item is categorized as a corporate data item when one or more first criteria are satisfied and as a personal data item when one or more second criteria are satisfied. The instructions further cause the processor to perform a first operation to backup or archive the corporate data items onto a first data store. The instructions further cause the processor to perform a second operation to backup or archive the personal data items onto a second data store that is different from the first data store.","In one embodiment, a method comprises categorizing a plurality of data items by a computing device, wherein each data item is categorized as a corporate data item when one or more first criteria are satisfied and as a personal data item when one or more second criteria are satisfied. The method further comprises providing the plurality of corporate data items to a first backup system that stores the corporate data items to a corporate data store. The method further comprises providing the plurality of personal data items to a second backup system that stores the personal data items to a personal data store.","A method and apparatus for performing automated, policy based control of backup and archiving of mixed corporate and personal data are described. The process of backing up data creates a second copy of the data. The process of archiving data moves data from a particular location (e.g., an email server) to a secondary location. The method and apparatus provide a mechanism for separating an employee's personal data, (e.g., messages, files, contacts, etc.) from corporate data (e.g., messages, files, contacts, etc.), and for storing the corporate data on a corporate data store and the personal data on an employee's personal data store.","Some embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to a backup system or backup client. It should be understood that as used herein, a backup system and backup client can perform both backup operations and archiving operations. Additionally, it should be understood that any embodiments described with reference to performing backup can equally be applied to performing archiving, and that any embodiments described with reference to performing archiving may be applied to performing backup.","In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.","Some portions of the detailed description that follows are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. The steps are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, or the like.","It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following discussion, it is appreciated that throughout the description, discussions utilizing terms such as \u201ccategorizing\u201d, \u201capplying\u201d, \u201cproviding\u201d, \u201creceiving\u201d, \u201cseparating,\u201d \u201cstoring\u201d, or the like, refer to the actions and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage devices.","The present invention also relates to an apparatus for performing the operations herein. This apparatus may be specially constructed for the required purposes, or it may comprise a general purpose computer selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program stored in the computer. Such a computer program may be stored in a computer readable storage medium, such as, but not limited to, any type of disk including floppy disks, optical disks, CD-ROMs, and magnetic-optical disks, read-only memories (ROMs), random access memories (RAMs), EPROMs, EEPROMs, magnetic or optical cards, or any type of media suitable for storing electronic instructions.","The algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus. Various general purpose systems may be used with programs in accordance with the teachings herein, or it may prove convenient to construct a more specialized apparatus to perform the required method steps. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description below. In addition, the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein.","Embodiments of the present invention automatically identify corporate data items and personal data items from a set of mixed data items. Corporate data items can then be provided to a corporate backup system, while personal data items can be provided to a user designated personal backup system. This may reduce an amount of disk storage that is used for backup or archiving purposes by the corporate system. Additionally, this enables corporate employees to manage the backup of their personal data. The corporate employees may select a data service to use for their personal backup system, and may have access to this data after they separate from the corporation. Additionally, the corporate employees can prevent the corporation from accessing their personal backup after they leave the corporation simply by changing a password associated with their personal backup system. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention provide advantages over conventional backup and archiving techniques for both corporations and their employees.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","124","120","120","120","100","140","130","118","120"]},"Endpoints  may be laptop computers, desktop computers, mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebook computers, tablet computers, or other endpoint computing devices connected to network . Alternatively, endpoints  may be virtual machines. Endpoints  include applications  that access, operate on and generate data items . Examples of applications include an email application (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, etc.), a word processor (e.g., Microsoft Word, Open Office, etc.), a spreadsheet application (e.g., Excel), an instant messaging application (e.g., Yahoo Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, ICQ, etc.), and so on. Examples of data items  include email messages, spreadsheet files, word processor files, presentation files, images, virtual business cards (or other electronic contact information), and so on.","In one embodiment, endpoints  include one or more backup clients . Backup clients  may facilitate and\/or perform the backup and archiving of data items  to the corporate backup system  and\/or the personal backup system . In one embodiment, endpoints  include a personal backup client for backing up data (or archiving data) to a personal backup system and a corporate backup client for backing up data (or archiving data) to a corporate backup system . Alternatively, endpoints  may include a single backup client that can backup data items  to both a personal backup system  and to a corporate backup system .","In one embodiment, the personal backup system  is an online backup service. The personal backup system  receives data items from a backup client  executing on an endpoint  or server , and stores the data items  in a data store . Examples of personal backup clients  include backup clients provided by Carbonite\u00ae, Backblaze\u00ae, SOS\u00ae, Dropbox\u00ae, Jungle Disk\u00ae, and Crashplan\u00ae, each of which backs up data to a specific personal backup system  (e.g., to Carbonite's data centers, to Backblaze's data centers, etc.). A user of the endpoint  (e.g., a corporate employee) may select a specific personal backup system that he or she prefers, and install a backup client  provided by the service provider of that personal backup system . Alternatively, the backup client may not be provided by the service provider of the personal backup system . Instead, the user may specify a personal backup system  in the backup client . The backup client  may include a list of supported personal backup systems. Alternatively, the user may input a location of the personal backup system (e.g., an internet protocol (IP) address and\/or port number). The backup client  may then automatically backup data items  to the personal backup system . Users of different endpoints  may use different personal backup systems .","The corporate backup system  may be an online backup service. In one embodiment, the corporate backup system  is an enterprise class online backup system such as provided by Barracuda Networks\u00ae, IronMountain\u00ae, CoreVault\u00ae, Rackspace\u00ae, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\u00ae, and so on. Alternatively, the corporate backup system  may be a corporate managed backup system that backs up data items to data stores  controlled by the corporation whose data is being protected. Examples of such corporate backup systems  include Symantec\u00ae Backup Exec\u00ae, Symantec NetBackup\u00ae, EMC Networker\u00ae, IBM Tivoli Storage Manager\u00ae, and so on.","Corporate backup system  may include one or more computing devices such as, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, server computer, etc. configured to perform designated tasks. Corporate backup system  may include one or more processing devices, memory, data stores, etc. Additionally, corporate backup system  may be a single machine or multiple machines, which may be arranged in a cluster. Different corporate backup systems  may use various combinations of backup clients , backup server software installed on server computers, network appliances, and so forth.","In one embodiment, backup clients  perform backup independent of any remote backup system. In such an embodiment, backup clients  may backup or archive data to a local drive (e.g., an external hard drive coupled to endpoint ) or to a network drive (e.g., to a storage area network (SAN) or to a network attached storage (NAS)) without communicating with a personal backup system  or a corporate backup system . In another embodiment, backup is performed without use of backup clients. For example, corporate backup system  may access data items  on endpoints  without use of a backup client .","Enterprise servers  provide services to endpoints  on network . Examples of enterprise servers  include storage servers that provide network storage, email servers that handle incoming and outgoing email traffic, web servers, and so forth. Enterprise servers  may include one or more computing devices such as, for example, a desktop computer, laptop computer, server computer, etc. configured to perform designated tasks. Servers  may include one or more processing devices, memory, data stores, etc. Additionally, servers  may be a single machine or multiple machines, which may be arranged in a cluster. Servers  may include data items  that are to be backed up or archived. In one embodiment, servers  include backup clients  that facilitate or perform backup. Alternatively, backup may be performed without use of backup clients .","Data items  stored by servers  and data items stored by endpoints  may include a mixture of personal data items and corporate data items. The personal data items may include personal email messages, personal word processor files (e.g., resumes, recipes, letters), personal image files (e.g., personal photos), personal contacts, and so forth. Corporate data items may include corporate (e.g., work related) emails, work related spreadsheets, work related word processor files, presentations, and so forth. Moreover, data items  may include personal data items for multiple different individuals.","In one embodiment, endpoints  and\/or servers  include a backup filter . Backup filter  analyzes data items to determine whether the data items resemble personal data items or corporate data items. Backup filter  then categorizes individual data items as personal data items or corporate data items. Backup filter  may additionally classify personal data items as personal data items belonging to a particular individual. For example, backup filter  may identify personal emails from a particular employee's mailbox as personal data items belonging to that employee.","Backup filter  provides corporate data items  to the corporate backup client and\/or corporate backup system  for corporate backup, and provides personal data items  to personal backup clients and\/or personal backup systems  for personal backup. In one embodiment, backup filter  controls which data items are visible to the different backup clients and\/or backup systems. For example, backup filter  may block all visibility and\/or access to personal data items  for a corporate backup client , and may block all visibility and\/or access to corporate data items  for a personal backup client.","In one embodiment, backup clients  and backup systems ,  are specified to the backup filter  as either personal backup clients\/systems or corporate backup clients\/systems. Alternatively, backup filter  may automatically designate particular backup clients\/systems as personal backup clients\/systems or corporate backup clients\/systems. For example, a Symantec Backup Exec backup system is an enterprise class backup solution, and would not ordinarily be used by an individual for personal backup. Accordingly, Backup Exec may automatically be identified as a corporate backup system .","In one embodiment, backup filters  rely on data loss prevention (DLP) systems to identify data items as personal data items or corporate data items. For example, backup filters  may classify data items as corporate data items if a DLP system has identified the data items as including sensitive information such as confidential information. Accordingly, in one embodiment, endpoints and\/or servers  include host based DLP systems . Each host based DLP system  protects an endpoint  or server  from data loss. In one embodiment, the backup of corporate data items to a personal backup system is classified as a data loss. Host based DLP system  may scan data items  for sensitive information. In one embodiment, when a host based DLP system  identifies sensitive information in a data item, the host based DLP system  notifies backup filter  that the data item contains sensitive information. Backup filter  may then classify the data item as a corporate data item. In another embodiment, the host based DLP system  makes a determination as to whether a data item is a personal data item or a corporate data item, and reports the determination to the backup filter . Host based DLP system  may also perform other data loss prevention, such as restricting access to sensitive data, tracking programs and\/or users that access data items  that include sensitive information, and so on.","In one embodiment, backup filters  communicate with a network based DLP system  to help identify data items as corporate data items or personal data items. Network based DLP system  protects sensitive data that is at rest and\/or in transit on network . Network based DLP system  may protect data that is present on network storage and\/or data that is present on storage devices of individual endpoints . Network based DLP system  may also protect data that is included in email messages, in instant messages, that is uploaded to web sites, or that is otherwise to be transferred out of the network . The network based DLP system  in one embodiment includes a network appliance that is configured to enforce DLP policies on network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","170","200","205","210","215","220"]},"Categorizer  classifies data items  as personal data items or corporate data items. In one embodiment, categorizer  uses categorization rules  to determine whether a data item should be categorized as a personal data item or a corporate data item. One example categorization rule may specify to categorize a data item as a corporate data item if it contains sensitive information (e.g., as determined by a DLP system). Another categorization rule may specify to categorize a data item as a corporate data item if it is a message that was directed to or received from an individual within a corporate domain (e.g., if it was an email to a workmate). Another categorization rule may specify to categorize a data item as a corporate data item if it is a message that was directed to or received from an individual in a corporate domain of a competitor or affiliate of a corporation that controls the endpoint hosting the backup filter . Other categorization rules may also be used.","In one embodiment, categorizer  assigns a rating to the data items . The rating indicates a likelihood that the data item is a corporate data item. In one embodiment, the rating is on a scale of 0 to 100, where 100 indicates that there is a 100% change that the data item is a corporate data item, and a 0 indicates that there is a 0% chance that the data item is a corporate data item (and thus a 100% chance that the data item is a personal data item). In one embodiment, a data item having a rating that falls within a first rating range is classified as a corporate data item and a data item having a rating that falls within a second rating range is classified as a personal data item. For example, on the scale of 0-100, a rating of 0-40 may be classified as a personal data item and a rating of 60-100 may be classified as a corporate data item. In another example, a rating of 0-40 may be classified as a personal data item and a rating of 41-100 may be classified as a corporate data item. Data items having a rating between the two rating ranges (e.g., having a rating of 41-59 in the first example) may be classified as both corporate data items and personal data items. Alternatively, such data items may be classified as unidentifiable data items.","In one embodiment, the rating for a data item is determined based on the categorization rules . For example, if a data item includes sensitive information, it may be assigned a maximum rating (e.g., 100). If the data item is to or from an individual within the corporate domain, and includes an attachment, a rating of 80 may be applied. If the data item is to or from an individual within the corporate domain, a rating of 70 may be applied, and so on. Categorizer  may determine which categorization rules are satisfied for a data item and then assign a rating to the data item based on the results.","In one embodiment, categorizer  tags data items after categorizing those data items. Tagging the data items may include adding metadata to the data items. The tag associated with a data item identifies that data item as a personal data item or as a corporate data item. Data items may also be tagged as unidentifiable data items, or as both corporate and personal data items.","In another embodiment, categorizer  generates a categorization data structure that includes an entry for each of the categorized data items. Each entry may identify the data item as a personal data item, a corporate data item, or both. The categorization data structure  may be a list, table, database, collection of key value pairs, or other data structure.","In one embodiment, categorizer  relies on a DLP system to categorize data items. In another embodiment, categorizer  categorizes a data item as a personal data item or a corporate data item based on whether the data item includes sensitive information. In such an embodiment, a DLP system indicates whether a data item includes sensitive information.","In one embodiment, categorizer  classifies data items on a periodic basis. For example, categorizer  may be configured to categorize data items daily, hourly, every 15 minutes, or on some other frequency. In another embodiment, categorizer  categorizes data items in response to a predefined event or events. For example, categorizer  may categorize data items as they are created and\/or modified. In another example, categorizer  may categorize data items in response to detecting a data backup or archive operation.","Backup filter  may include a DLP system interactor  that exchanges communications with a network based DLP system and\/or host based DLP system. DLP system interactor  may send a data item to a DLP system, or may send a pointer or other identifier that can be used to locate the data item to the DLP system. The DLP system may process the data item using a DLP policy designed to classify data items as corporate or personal data items, or using a DLP policy designed to identify whether the data item contains sensitive information. The DLP system interactor  may then receive a response from the DLP system indicating whether the data item is a corporate data item or a personal data item, or whether the data item contains sensitive information. In one embodiment, the response indicates a rating for the data item. The DLP system interactor  may then forward the received information on the data item to the categorizer .","In one embodiment, backup filter  includes a file system filter driver . Alternatively and\/or in addition, backup filter  may include a disk filter driver (not shown). A file system filter driver is a driver that modifies the behavior of a file system. A file system filter driver can filter I\/O requests for one or more file systems and\/or file system volumes. The file system filter driver  can log, observe, modify and\/or prevent I\/O operations for file systems. In one embodiment, file system filter driver  is configured to prevent I\/O operations by a corporate backup client or system that are directed to personal data items and prevent I\/O operations by a personal backup client or system that are directed to corporate data items. File system filter driver  may intercept an I\/O request, and determine whether a requestor is a corporate backup client\/system or personal backup client\/system. The file system filter driver  may then provide only corporate data items (e.g., filter out all personal data items) if the requestor is a corporate backup client or system, or provide only personal data items (e.g., filter out all corporate data items) if the requestor is a personal backup client or system.","In one embodiment, backup filter  operates in conjunction with off the shelf backup services, and the file system filter driver  selectively decides which data items  to provide to each backup service. In another embodiment, backup filter  is a component of a backup client, or is accessible via an application programming interface (API) by backup services and\/or backup clients.","In one embodiment, backup filter  includes a restore module . If restoration of backed up (or archived) data is needed, restore module  may pull data from both the corporate backup system and the personal backup system to achieve a complete restoration of corporate and personal data to an endpoint or server. Restore module  may enable a user to search backed up or archived data via a single interface. Restore module  may present an integrated view of all archived data, as if the data had all been archived in a single data store. In one embodiment, restore module  identifies personal data items and corporate data items in the integrated view of the searched data items. The user may optionally choose to search, show or operate on only corporate data items or only personal data items.","In one embodiment, backup filter  includes a user interface . The user interface  may be a graphical user interface, command line user interface, or other user interface that enables a user to configure the backup filter . Users may, for example, adjust categorization rules and\/or policies, specify backup services or clients as corporate or personal, control the format of backup data, adjust the location to which personal data will be backed up, input authentication information (e.g., for accessing a user's account with a personal backup system), control whether or not personal data items will be copied to the corporate backup system, and so on. In one embodiment, a user may additionally adjust actions that are performed by the backup filter  if it is unable to contact a specified personal backup system. For example, the backup filter  may be configured to cause the corporate backup system to copy the personal data items if the personal backup system is unavailable. Alternatively, the backup filter  may be configured to do nothing with regards to personal data items if the personal backup system is unavailable.","In one embodiment, backup filter  can be used to scan previously backed up or archived data. This data may have been backed up or archived to a corporate backup system. Backup filter  may identify personal data items that are included in the backed up or archived data. Backup filter may then copy or move the backed up or archived personal data items to a personal data system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["300","300","115","140","300","300","300","300","310","320","325","315","335","330"]},"The IDM module , DCM module , EDM module  and VML module  each implement a particular data loss prevention technique. The DLP system  implements one or more DLP policies , which indicate which DLP techniques to use. A DLP policy  is violated if one or more criteria included in the DLP policy  are satisfied. Examples of criteria include user status (e.g., whether a user has access privileges to a file), file location (e.g., whether a file is stored in a confidential database), file contents (e.g., whether a file includes sensitive information), time (e.g., whether an operation is requested during normal business hours), data loss vector, application attempting the operation, and so on.","The DLP policy  may include profiles that invoke one or more of the IDM module , DCM module , EDM module  or VML module . Each module may identify sensitive data. In one embodiment, the DLP policy  includes a DCM profile that invokes the described content matching (DCM) module . A DCM profile defines one or more key words and\/or regular expressions to be searched for. For example, a profile may define a social security number using a regular expression. Using a DCM profile, DCM module  determines whether any information included in scanned data match the key words and\/or regular expressions. If a match is found, then it may be determined that the data includes sensitive information.","In one embodiment, the DLP policy  includes an exact data matching (EDM) profile and\/or a indexed document matching (IDM) profile that invoke EDM module  and\/or IDM module , respectively. Exact data matching (EDM) may be used for protecting data that is typically in structured formats, such as database records. Indexed document matching (IDM) may be used to protect unstructured data, such as Microsoft\u00ae Word or PowerPoint\u00ae documents, or CAD drawings. For both EDM and IDM, sensitive data is first identified to the DLP system . DLP system  then fingerprints the sensitive data for precise, ongoing detection. In one embodiment, the fingerprinting process includes accessing and extracting text and data, normalizing it, and securing it using a nonreversible hash. When a file or other data is to be scanned, a fingerprint (e.g., hash) is generated of that file or contents of that file and compared to stored fingerprints. If a match is found, then the scanned file is identified as containing sensitive data.","In one embodiment, the DLP policy  includes a vector machine learning (VML) profile that invokes VML module . Vector machine learning may be used to protect sensitive unstructured data. For VML, a training data set including a set of sensitive data and a set of non-sensitive data is provided to the DLP system . The VML module  analyzes the training data set using vector machine learning to generate a classification model and a feature set, which are added to a VML profile along with the training data set. The classification model is a statistical model for data classification that includes a map of support vectors that represent boundary features. The feature set is a data structure such as a list or table that includes multiple features (e.g., words) extracted from the training data set. The VML module  processes the VML profile and input unclassified data to classify the data as sensitive or non-sensitive (or to classify the data as personal data or corporate data).","In one embodiment, DLP policies  include a DLP policy for classifying data as personal data or corporate data. The DLP policy may include an IDM profile, a DCM profile, an EDM profile and\/or a VML profile. Additionally, the DLP policy may include additional categorization rules, as described with reference to . In one embodiment, the DLP system  assigns a categorization rating to a processed data item to indicate the likelihood that the data item is a corporate data item.","In one embodiment, DLP policies  include a DLP policy to determine whether the data item includes content indicative of personal data items. For example, messages that are signed, \u201clove\u201d or \u201csincerely,\u201d or that include specific phrases such as \u201chappy birthday\u201d may be more likely to be personal data items. The DLP policy for detecting personal data items may include an IDM profile, a DCM profile, an EDM profile and\/or a VML profile.","Backup filter interactor  receives requests from a backup filter to process one or more data items. After the data items are processed, backup filter interactor  reports the results to the backup filter. The report may indicate whether a data item includes sensitive data, or may identify a data item as a personal data item or a corporate data item.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIGS. 4-7","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"b":["200","300"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","405"]},"At block , processing logic provides the corporate data items to a corporate backup system.

Accordingly, the method continues to block .","At block , processing logic determines whether the data item is a message (e.g., an email message or instant message) to or from an entity in a corporate domain. For example, processing logic determines whether the data item is between two employees of the corporation. If the data item is a message between employees of the corporation, it is likely that the message pertains to corporate business. Accordingly, if the data item is a message between employees of the corporation, the method continues to block , and the data item is classified as a corporate data item. In one embodiment, if only the sender or recipient of the message is an entity of the corporate domain, the method continues to block .","At block , processing logic determines whether the data item is a message to or from a partner or competitor of the corporation. For example, processing logic may determine whether the message is from a supplier, a client, a contractor, etc. of the company. If the message is to or from a corporate partner or competitor, the method proceeds to block , and the message is categorized as a corporate data item. Otherwise, the method continues to block .","At block , processing logic determines whether the message is marked as a high priority message. Processing logic may also determine whether the message includes a header that labels the message as urgent, or for immediate action, or the like. High priority messages are likely to be corporate data items. Accordingly, if the data item is a message marked high priority, the method continues to block , and the data item is classified as a corporate data item.

If the data item is a message, processing logic classifies senders and\/or recipients of the message as either personal contacts or professional contacts. At block , processing logic determines, if the data item was a message, whether the data item is marked as a high priority message.","At block , processing logic applies a rating to the data item based on the results of blocks -. The applied rating may be a categorization rating that indicates a likelihood that the data item is a corporate data item. The higher the rating, the higher the likelihood that the data item is a corporate data item. For example, if the data item includes sensitive information (as identified by a DLP policy), then it can be determined with nearly 100% accuracy that the data item should be classified as a corporate data item. Data items that are assigned a rating in a first range may be categorized as corporate data items, while data items that are in a second range may be categorized as personal data items. Data items assigned an intermediate rating between the first range and the second range may not be clearly identified as either corporate data items or personal data items.
