title: System and method for minimizing occupant injury during vehicle crash events
abstract: A method, computer program product and apparatus for minimizing occupant injury by optimizing occupant restraint properties and/or actions in real time, during pre-crash and crash phases. The restraint system uses three catalogs and a database linking these catalogs. The catalogs include a catalog of possible occupant states, a catalog of possible collision scenarios, and a catalog of potential restraint control laws. The database is an assessment of injury outcome for each possible combination of occupant state, collision scenario, and restraint control law. In addition to the catalogs, the method requires four computational components: an occupant identifier, a collision identifier, a restraint law optimizer, and a restraint controller.

No. 61\/050,837, filed May 6, 2008, entitled \u201cSystem and Method for Minimizing Occupant Injury during Passenger Vehicle Crash Events\u201d the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and PCT Patent Application No. PCT\/US2009\/042988 filed May 6, 2009.","The present invention relates to a vehicle occupant restraint or safety system and a method for optimizing a vehicle occupant restraint or safety system to minimize occupant injury during a crash event.","Automobiles and other vehicles are increasingly utilizing a variety of automated technologies that involve a wide variety of different vehicle functions and provide vehicle occupants with a diverse range of benefits. Some of those functions are more central to the function of the vehicle, as a vehicle, than other more ancillary functions. For example, certain applications may assist vehicle drivers to \u201cparallel-park\u201d the vehicle. Other automated applications focus on occupant safety. Safety restraint applications are one category of occupant safety applications. Airbag mechanisms or systems are a common example of a safety restraint application in a vehicle. Vehicle applications can include more discretionary functions such as navigation assistance, and environmental controls, and even purely recreational options such as DVD players, Internet access, and satellite radio. Automated devices are an integral and useful part of modern vehicles. Automatic transmission is an example of an automated application geared towards vehicle functionality. However, the automated devices embedded into vehicles need to do a better job of taking into account the context of the particular vehicle, and the person(s) or occupant(s) involved in using the particular vehicle. In particular, such devices typically fail to fully address the interactions between the occupants within the vehicle and the internal environment of the vehicle. It would be desirable for automated applications within vehicles to apply more occupant-centric and context-based \u201cintelligence\u201d to enhance the functionality of automated applications within the vehicle.","Additionally, safety belt restraint system (or sub-system) and air bag systems (or sub-systems) can be designed to meet separate and distinct safety criteria and performance standards based on regulatory and compliance tests and then used together as a combined system to provide occupant protection during frontal vehicle crashes. The performance, in terms of known, measurable occupant injury performance standards such as head injury criteria (HIC) and resultant chest acceleration of these combined systems may be less than the performance of the individual sub-system. Moreover, conventional restraint practices do not provide any or limited adaptation to the crash severity or occupant properties.","Today's restraint systems may even injury the occupant when deployed in an undesirable situation. For example, an air bag deployed when a crash is relatively mild, when an occupant is out of position, or where the occupant is a child, can lead to more serious injuries than if the restraint is not deployed at all. A more intelligent system may decide to deploy the air bags at a slower speed, or not deploy them at all, based on the type of accident and occupant. While the theory of safety restraint design has advanced greatly in the last decade, many of the advancements have remained in the laboratory. Particularly, there has been great progress in computer modeling of restraint systems, which is important since small modifications in the output of various restraint components often lead to significant changes in the safety of the occupants.","An aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention overcomes some shortcomings of conventional practices regarding sensing of occupant vehicle and crash.","An aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention overcomes some shortcomings of conventional practices by providing, such as but not limited thereto, a real-time process (takes place during the crash) with sensing of the conditions (occupant, vehicle, crash), development of probabilistic estimates of these conditions, and then optimization of the restraint or other safety systems.","Conventional practices are capable of sensing the presence of the occupant and\/or belt use but this information is used to trigger a small set of discrete restraint modalities (e.g., air bag deployment or non-deployment, pretensioner deployment or non-deployment). Similarly, the assessment of crash severity triggers a discrete set of restraint modalities. At most, two modalities are used in current restraint systems. With regard to conventional practices, a single mode of operation of the seatbelt and airbags may be too strong for a light crash\u2014thereby causing more injury to the occupant, than had the restraint devices not been activated. Thus, a desirable aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention is that it may provide a safety system that can accurately determine the optimal restraint system response to minimize injury to the occupant.","Regarding a collision, occupant properties are evolving in time, and true prediction of these properties in real time is not accurate in conventional practices. Thus, an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention may focus on real-time optimization, probabilistic estimates.","None of the uses of the prior art include calculating actual conditions in real time in a probabilistic manner\u2014leveraging computer-intensive statistical analysis. There is a long-felt need in the art for a restraint system that can optimize a vehicle's restraints for different passengers, and make optimization adjustments in real time. The present invention satisfies this need.","An aspect of an embodiment provides a method, system and computer program product that provides the ability to use restraint optimization to reduce injury relative to what can be attained with a fixed, non-adaptive strategy. An advantage of an embodiment of the optimized restraint system disclosed herein may, in some scenarios, be more aggressive than the fixed system, or just differently aggressive.","An advantage of an embodiment of the present invention method, system and computer program product is that it provides for optimizing a restraint system (or other safety or event system) that is computationally efficient, operationally efficient, and fast; and that which may be operable with computer processors and passenger vehicle on board computers (for any variety of vehicle types and systems). Computers and processors may be located remote from the vehicle in whole or in part; as well as in communication with computers, processors, or communication devices within the vehicle, other vehicles, or travel infrastructure\u2014including satellites and stationary devices.","An aspect of an embodiment provides a method, system and computer program product that provides the results that may depend on the performance of computational human models, and electronic systems for occupant detection, etc.","An aspect of an embodiment provides a method, computer program product and an apparatus for minimizing occupant injury by optimizing occupant restraint properties and\/or actions and other safety measures in real time, during pre-crash and crash phases. The safety or restraint system (and related method and computer program product) may use three catalogs (or any number as desired or required) and a database (or multiple databases as desired or required) linking these catalogs. The catalogs may include a catalog of possible occupant states, a catalog of possible collision scenarios, and a catalog of potential restraint control laws. The database may provide an assessment of injury outcome for each possible combination of occupant state, collision scenario, and restraint control law. In addition to the catalogs, the method may require four computational components: an occupant identifier, a collision identifier, a restraint law optimizer, and a restraint controller, all of which are specific to the vehicle in which the system is installed.","Current automobile restraint systems which employ either a single, fixed restraint response or a very limited (perhaps 2-mode) restraint response are inherently optimized for limited target occupant and collision scenarios. Consequently, the implemented restraint laws may be highly sub-optimal when deployed for a substantially different occupant and\/or in a substantially different collision scenario. Further, the use of crash dummies with limited biofidently in assessment of restraint performance may bias the design and performance of these systems toward an occupant model that does not well represent any human occupant.","For an insight into real world collision characteristics refer to \u2014the cumulative frequency of passenger car crashes vs. delta-velocity (Published in Nolan et al., 1998, compilation of NASS CDS data 1990-1995, of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). The dotted curve and small-dashed curve represent AIS2+ and AIS3+ (Abbreviated Injury Scale), respectively. These curves show the crash frequency for different injury levels. The 90th percentile mark corresponds to a delta-velocity range of 45 to 50 km\/h. Comparing this with the test protocol speeds, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) performs the barrier test at 64 km\/h which is around 58 km\/h delta-velocity for a mid-sized car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) testing velocity corresponds to a similar 50 km\/h delta-velocity. The choice of testing velocity shows that most severe injuries are covered by the test protocol; however, injuries in less severe impacts are neglected.","Another parameter affecting the performance of occupant restraints is the occupant characteristics. Two aspects are particularly worthy of notice in crash testing: the guidelines set in the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) for positioning of the occupant  (See ) of a vehicle , and the use of a passive mechanical surrogate to simulate a human response. One cannot deduce, from this kind of testing, the actual ensemble performance of the restraint system on a reasonable spectrum of collisions and occupants. Consequently, it is not possible to infer the real performance or optimality of the restraint system from such testing.","Today's restraints have the potential to do harm to an occupant. For example, an air bag deployed when a crash is relatively mild, when an occupant is out of position, or where the occupant is a child, can lead to more serious injuries than if the restraint is not deployed at all. While the theory of safety restraint design has advanced greatly in the last decade, many more advancements have been made in the laboratory and are yet to be implemented. Particularly, there has been great progress in computer modeling of restraint systems, which is important since small modifications in the output of various restraint components often lead to significant changes in the safety of the occupants.","An aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention may provide methods, computer program products, and apparatuses for, but not limited thereto, controlling a vehicle occupant restraint system that is able to adapt to different types of collisions and occupant conditions in real time, and in a manner that specifically addresses the problem of uncertain knowledge of the collision and occupant. Additionally, an aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention has multiple activation modes for the restraint systems and safety devices\u2014not simply on\/off parameters. Thus, the restraint system can choose the optimal restraint control law that minimizes the overall injury to that particular occupant in that particular collision scenario\u2014and readjust itself before and during the collision.","To accomplish this, an aspect of some of the various embodiments of the present invention may provide for the collection of data from multiple sensors, including occupant and collision sensors (or other sensors as desired or required). The restraint system and safety devices have stored catalogs of different occupant descriptions and collision scenarios, and a catalog of restraint control laws. Using the sensor data, the restraint system uses a probabilistic approach to assign relative likelihood to each occupant description and collision scenario in the two catalogs. Then, using these relative likelihoods in conjunction with a database that correlates the performance of each element of a restraint law catalog to individual occupant\/collision pairs, the expected performance of each restraint law is estimated and that law having the highest expected performance (lowest expected injury) is implemented using the restraint controller.","The database of performance correlation for the catalog of restraint laws may be created offline, prior to the restraint system's use, to leverage computer-intensive collision simulation or experimental results or may be created in real time during the collision. The selection of the optimized restraint law is based on real time data that adjusts to the varying collision conditions. Such database can be constructed, using numerical\/computer simulations (e.g., multibody simulations) or actual experimental assessment, for known vehicle, crash, and occupant characteristics. The catalogs and database can be updated either through direct connections or wirelessly.","In one embodiment, the method, computer program product, and restraint system and safety devices determine an optimal restraint law (or safety law) based on a plurality of vehicle collision sensor signals and vehicle occupant sensor signals. The optimal restraint law (or safety law) is the specific combination of restraint and safety device modes, for example air bag deployment and seatbelt resistance, that ensures the lowest occupant injury levels. The occupant injury levels are determined based on an injury metric, discussed in further detail below.","Current occupant safety research addresses acquisition of new information regarding impending collisions as well as the characteristics of the occupant (e.g., pre-crash sensors, air bag suppression sensors, occupant position sensors, occupant tracking systems, range finding radar, vehicle transponders, infra-red systems). An aim of the present invention is to anticipate the continued emergence of these new sources of information related to collision and occupant characterization and to provide a framework for the efficient incorporation of this information into the restraint and safety system decision process. It should be appreciated that any available or future safety related system may be implemented with the embodiments discussed herein.","Current occupant protection research addresses the development of advanced restraint and safety devices including both passive and active systems. An aim of the present invention is to anticipate the continued emergence of these new restraint and safety devices and to provide a framework for the efficient incorporation of these devices into the restraint and safety system decision process. It should be appreciated that any available or future safety related system may be implemented with the embodiments discussed herein.","Current occupant protection research addresses the development of advanced algorithms or restraint laws governing the deployment or adaptation of restraint and safety devices. An aim of the present invention is to anticipate the continued emergence of these algorithms and restraint laws and to provide a framework for the efficient incorporation of these algorithms and restraint laws into the restraint and safety system decision process.","It should be appreciated that an additional feature of an embodiment of the present invention is the estimation of crash and occupant properties and the prediction of occupant injury outcome at the level of body-region and probable severity during and at cessation of the collision event. This provides the opportunity to deliver this information to first responders and other providers of medical care.

Thus, high probabilities will be assigned to models that are consistent with sensor data while low probabilities will be assigned to models that are not consistent with the sensor data.","The term \u201cprobabilistically assessed catalog,\u201d as used herein, refers to a catalog, such as an occupant catalog, that has identified the likelihood of each catalog element matching a sensor reading from a sensor, such as an occupant sensor.","As used herein, a \u201cresponse controller\u201d is responsible for actually implementing the response law. The response law may be implemented directly or indirectly through another mechanical component.","The term \u201cresponse laws,\u201d as used herein, refers to a set of rules that dictate the behavior of the response controllers during the fault event. An example of response laws are the restraint laws described herein.","As used herein, a \u201crestraint controller\u201d is responsible for actually implementing the control law selected by the restraint law optimizer. The restraint controller retrieves real-time data from sensors in the vehicle and, based on the specific control law selected by the restraint law optimizer, controls the restraint devices\u2014such as, but not limited to air bags and seatbelts. The only assumption that the method makes about the restraint controller is that it is capable of physically implementing any of the restraint laws contained in the restraint law catalog.","The term \u201crestraint laws\u201d (or \u201ccontrol laws\u201d), as used herein, refers to a set of rules that dictate the behavior of the restraint mechanism(s) during the collision. Restraint mechanisms in the car could include active (or passive, or parameter adjustable) seatbelts, air bags, bolsters, or other devices. These rules may be based on data measured during the collision in addition to pre-specified actions triggered by onset (or anticipation) of a collision. The restraint laws may be passive or active, they may be feedback based or open loop, and they may be either linear or nonlinear: the method makes no particular assumptions about either the form of the laws or about their complexity.","The term \u201crestraint law catalog\u201d (or \u201ccatalog of restraint laws\u201d), as used herein, refers to a collection or parametric description of possible restraint laws.","As used herein, a \u201crestraint law optimizer\u201d receives, at each instant in time, probability lists from the occupant and collision identifiers. These probability lists are then used to construct the expected injury metric for each member of the restraint law catalog. The restraint law characterized by the lowest expected injury metric is then deemed best and is activated in the restraint controller. To form the expected injury metric for each restraint law in the catalog, the optimizer simply adds up the product of occupant probability, collision scenario probability, and injury outcome metric for each possible combination of occupant model and collision scenario applied to this restraint law. Once this set of sums of products is formed, the restraint law with lowest expected injury metric is obtained by simply sorting the list. The computational process implied by this selection method is very fast and readily implemented in real-time on practical vehicle computing platforms.","The term \u201cwirelessly\u201d (or \u201cwireless), as used herein, refers to a connection between components through non-physical means. Wireless connections may be accomplished in a number of ways including: radio frequency (RF), microwave, infrared, 802.11 (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth, RFID, or satellite.","Although the various embodiments of the present invention are mainly described in terms of passenger vehicles, it would be equally applicable to a broad array of control problems. Generally, it is suitable for control problems where the range of possible physical systems (e.g., vehicle, occupant, and posture) is reasonably narrow, the range of possible events requiring special response (ex. collision scenarios) is also reasonably narrow and of a short transient character, and the complexity of the physical system is high enough to make deterministic state estimation impractical. The term \u201creasonably narrow\u201d simply meaning it could be expressed in a probability density function. An example of such a problem is a fault event controller for industrial machinery. It should be appreciated that the various embodiments are applicable to fields other than occupant restraint. Generally, for example, it may be directed to machine fault detection and selection of \u201cbest\u201d palliative action.","It should be appreciated that the various embodiments are applicable to more than just \u201cfrontal vehicle crashes.\u201d Rather it is applicable to any general \u201cvehicle crashes\u201d such as applying the algorithms, methods and systems at different crash scenarios (e.g., side impacts, rear impacts, rollovers, pedestrian crashes, crushing, etc.).","Referring to , the illustration represents a schematic block diagram of the various modules of the real-time interaction of the occupant identifier, collision identifier, restraint law optimizer, and restraint controller in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For instance, this embodiment provides, but is not limited thereto, an active restraint system  (or related method and computer program product) that is able to adapt to different types of collision situations and occupants (positions and size) in real time. Thus, the restraint system  can choose the optimal restraint control law  that minimizes the overall injury to that particular occupant in that particular collision situation\u2014and readjust itself during the collision. To accomplish this, the current invention uses occupant and vehicle collision sensors  to monitor the external variables. The restraint system  has stored catalogs of different occupant descriptions  and catalogs of collision scenarios , and a catalog of restraint control laws . Using the sensor data, occupant identifier  and collision identifier  estimate the relative probabilities  that each element in the occupant and collision catalogs represents the actual occupant and collision. Then, using a database of injury metric  associated with each possible cataloged occupant\/collision pair combined with each cataloged restraint law, the expected injury metric for each restraint law is constructed. Finally, the cataloged restraint laws are sorted to find the one with lowest expected injury metric and this law is implemented on the occupant restrain mechanisms  using the restraint controller . The structure and method of implementation of this system may be generic and may not necessarily be vehicle specific: customization of the system to specific vehicles may be accomplished by choice of data in the catalogs and specific estimation processes implemented in the estimators.","It should be appreciated that the various modules shown in , and disclosed throughout may be a variety applicable elements.

For instance, the database  containing the injury metric for each occupant-collision-restraint law combination is created prior to the use of the restraint system\u2014via simulations or experimental assessment  of all possible combinations for a given vehicle.","Further, while the process described above implies that the restraint law is continually modified during the collision, another possible embodiment could halt re-optimization at any pre-specified instant during the collision or in response to measured collision variables or states.","As used herein, sensors can be used to detect occupant position and type, collision, steering wheel position, vehicle acceleration\/deceleration, rollover (vehicle angle). This list is only representative, not exhaustive. Sensors may have an analog or digital output.","Embodiments of the present invention cover any method of optimization that is based on probability distributions for finite discrete catalogs of occupant\/posture and of collision scenario as applied to a finite discrete catalog of potential control laws whose performance on the occupant\/posture\u2014collision scenario grid has been determined in advance.","Based on the probability distribution of the catalogs, the best control law is found. One method of determining the best control law is using the expected injury related cost (IRC). IRC is the injury related cost for a given collision occupant combination. The expected IRC is a composite assessment and is different from IRC. The expected IRC (EIRC) for a given control law is a sum over all occupants and all collisions of IRC for each pair and joint probability of each pair, represented by the following formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0097","num":"0096"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"E","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["C","k"]}}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"x"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"y"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"f","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["c","i"]},{"mi":["p","j"]},{"mi":["C","k"]}],"mo":[",",",",","],"mi":"v"}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["c","i"]}}},{"mi":"P","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["p","j"]}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}}],"mo":"="}}},"br":{},"sub":["k","i ","j ","i","i ","k ","i","j","k"]},"One category of occupant parameters consists of the time invariant parameters, herein referred to as the passive occupant model parameters. This mainly consists of the occupant anthropometry properties such as the mass and overall height. In order to analyze these properties in a parametric way, geometric scaling techniques may be used to generate parametric models.","The other category of parameters consists of time varying active parameters. These include parameters that define the posture of the occupant such as seating position, posture angle, upper body velocity, muscle bracing state, etc.","Current technology allows for one time estimation of occupant parameters at the instant a collision is determined and accordingly restraint properties are decided. Whereas, in an embodiment of the present invention, the occupant model could be continuously characterized during the pre-collision phase and use feedback techniques to reduce the variability in estimation. The passive occupant model parameters may be calculated by a joint probability distribution, and the probability density function of the active parameters can then be determined as a conditional probability at the time of crash for a given probability of a passive occupant model using the combined probability model.","Another possibility of an embodiment of the invention is to use the estimated parameters determined through correlation over a time period prior to the event of the collision. At the instant of the collision the parameter information collected over the time period will be used to establish the occupant model probability density at the instant of collision.","In another embodiment of the invention, the database is assembled in advance and presents an assessment of each candidate controller for a range of occupants and collision scenarios that is expected to encompass the actual occupant and actual collision.","Referring to , the illustration represents a schematic block diagram of the various modules of the real-time interaction of the occupant identifier, collision identifier, safety law optimizer, and safety controller in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.
