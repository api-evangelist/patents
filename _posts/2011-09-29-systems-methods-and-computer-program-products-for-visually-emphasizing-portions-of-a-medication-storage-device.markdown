{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to medication storage devices and associated methods and, more particularly, using lighting to aid a user when interacting with the medication storage devices.","Medication dispensing cabinets have been developed to store and controllably dispense a variety of medications. A medication dispensing cabinet may include a cabinet body with one or more drawers that are slideably disposed within the cabinet body. The drawers store the various medications. While some of the drawers may be unlatched and freely openable, other drawers may be locked in order to more closely control access to the medications stored in the locked drawers.","Some medication dispensing cabinets are automated and, as such, include or are otherwise associated with a computer that controls access to the compartments that store medications within the cabinet. The computer may be configured to allow access to only authorized users, such as pharmacists who stock the cabinet and medical providers who remove medications from the cabinet.","The amount of time it takes for the medical provider to interact with the computer and access the respective drawer can vary based on the type of medication dispensing cabinets and their computer control systems. While medication storage cabinets are important tools in loss prevention of narcotics as well as in providing the proper medication to each patient, any time spent interacting with the medication storage cabinets is time that the medical providers cannot be with their patients.","Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an improved system and method for dispensing medication that allows healthcare professionals to dispense medication for the patients under their care in a more rapid, efficient, and accurate manner.","Methods, apparatuses and computer program products are provided according to embodiments of the present invention for using light projectors and\/or other devices to aid a user when interacting with the medication storage devices. For example, a light projector can comprise a light source configured to: project light to illuminate a first medication storage compartment of a medication storage device without illuminating a second medication storage compartment of the medication storage device. Likewise, the projector's light source can be configured to project the light to illuminate the second medication storage compartment of the medication storage device without illuminating the first medication storage compartment of the medication storage device.","The light projector can further comprise at least one reflective surface that is configured to direct light projected onto the medication storage device. The at least one reflective surface can be configured to be moved to cause either the first medication storage compartment to be illuminated or the second medication storage compartment to be illuminated.","The light projector can be included in the medication storage device and\/or located remote or otherwise separate from the medication storage device (e.g., in a room's ceiling or wall and\/or mounted on a stand located proximate to the medication storage device). When separate from the medication storage device, the projector can include circuitry that is configured to communicate with the circuitry included in the storage device.","The medication storage device can comprise a drawer that includes the first and\/or second medication storage compartments. The medication storage compartments can be lidded and\/or un-lidded pockets that may or may not be located adjacent to each other in the drawer.","The light projector can be configured to project light that highlights at least one storage compartment included in the medication storage device and moves as an indicator for the next stage as the user progresses through the workflow. In some embodiments, the light projector can be configured to project user-readable information on at least one storage compartment included in the medication storage device.","Likewise, one or more methods and computer readable media can be implemented that include, among other things, projecting light onto a medication storage device, comprising: projecting light, using a light projector, to illuminate a first medication storage compartment of the medication storage device, wherein illuminating the first medication storage compartment occurs without illuminating a second medication storage compartment of the medication storage device; and projecting the light, using the light projector, to illuminate the second medication storage compartment of the medication storage device, wherein illuminating the second medication storage compartment occurs without illuminating the first medication storage compartment of the medication storage device.","The above summary is provided merely for purposes of summarizing some example embodiments of the invention so as to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the above described example embodiments are merely examples and should not be construed to narrow the scope or spirit of the invention in any way. It will be appreciated that the scope of the invention encompasses many potential embodiments, some of which will be further described below, in addition to those here summarized.","Embodiments of the present inventions now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Indeed, embodiments of these inventions may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.","The storage devices, systems, and methods of embodiments of the present invention may be used by healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, physicians' offices, healthcare clinics, and any other facility that manages and\/or stores drugs and\/or other materials for patient use. The storage devices, systems, and methods described herein can be configured to, for example, (1) indicate which pocket the user needs to access by highlighting the pocket with a directing light, (2) minimize the number of times the user has to look down and up from a storage device's monitor to a drawer and vice-versa, (3) improve the speed of the workflow (e.g., the user's interactions with the storage device), and (4) reduce the likelihood of a user taking the wrong medication from the storage device, among other things. Further, although nurses are one example of a type of user (as they are often tasked with removing medication stored in an automated storage device) and examples with a nurse are sometimes used in the description that follows, it is understood that the described embodiments apply to any type of user who may interact with an automated storage device, including pharmacists, nurses, nurse technicians, pharmacy technicians, physicians, laboratory personnel, respiratory therapists, and others. Furthermore, although the examples of a user interfacing with an automated storage device for the purposes of removing medications are predominantly described below, one skilled in the art in light of this disclosure would recognize that the embodiments are also applicable to users interfacing with the automated storage device for the purpose of taking inventory, conducting counts of medications in the storage device (including, e.g., pocket-specific \u201cblind counts\u201d), stocking the storage device, and performing other tasks that may require access to the medication storage compartments in the automated storage device. In addition, the phrase \u201cstorage device\u201d is intended to include any type of automated storage device, including automated dispensing cabinet (ADC), unit-based cabinet (UBC), automated dispensing device (ADD), automated distribution cabinet, medication dispensing cabinet, automated dispensing machine (ADM), and\/or any other type of automated medication storage and retrieval system, including those used in pharmacies, hospitals, and\/or elsewhere.","Turning now to , a storage device  is shown. For example, some embodiments of the storage device  can be similar to and\/or include components that are currently included in the cabinets and\/or other medication management systems sold and marketed as McKesson's AcuDose-Rx\u00ae cabinet, MedCarousel\u00ae system and\/or Anesthesia-Rx\u2122 cart. The storage device  may be configured to store a number of different types and quantities of medications. In this regard, the storage device  may include (e.g., define) a plurality of drawers , examples of which are discussed below. In addition, access to the drawers  may be restricted to certain authorized users and may further be accessible only when medication stored in the particular drawer is to be removed, stocked and\/or counted, as described in greater detail below. For example, each drawer  may be in a locked state until an authorized user interfaces with the storage device  to select for removing a particular medication stored within a particular drawer, at which point the storage device may unlock and\/or open the drawer containing the selected medication to allow the user's access. Additionally, one or more drawers may include and\/or otherwise function as a display screen onto which a projected display is presented to a user, as described in greater detail below.","The drawers  may hold more than just medications, in some cases. For example, certain medical accessories or supplies may also be stored in the automated storage device , such as applicators, syringes, keys, prescription pads, cameras, etc., which may also be dispensed, stocked, and\/or otherwise handled by the user during an interaction with the storage device . Accordingly, although the examples provided below refer to the removal of medications, the dispensing, stocking, transport, counting and\/or other type of handling of any item stored in the storage device , such as medical accessories, is contemplated herein.","In some embodiments, the storage device  can further include various data and\/or user input devices, such as input device . A data input device may be, for example, a device that receives data from another machine, such as communications modules discussed below, and user input devices may include devices configured to receive inputs from the user, such as touch displays, keyboards, cameras, touchpads, and computer mice, among other things. User input device  and display device  are shown in , wherein user input device  is shown as a keyboard and display device  is shown as a touch-sensitive display device.","The user and data input devices can be used to facilitate, among other things, removal transactions. In this regard, the phrase \u201cremoval transaction\u201d is used herein to describe the interfacing between the user and the storage device to remove one or more medications to be administered to a single patient. Thus, each removal transaction is associated with a particular selected patient. Furthermore, each user may have multiple removal transactions with the storage device in a single interaction with the storage device (i.e., he or she may remove medications for multiple patients during a single interaction with the storage device). In this regard, the window between the time a user logs into the system (e.g., provides identification credentials indicating that the user is authorized to have access to the medications stored within the storage device) to the time the user logs out of the system (which may require, e.g., a log-out event by the same user or resulting from an expiration of a predetermined period of time, or a log-in event by a different user for access to the storage device) may define the interaction, whereas the time it takes for the user to remove medications relating to a particular patient may define the removal transaction. A user may conduct multiple removal transactions for multiple patients in a single user interaction with the storage device, and the storage device  can be configured to illuminate one or more storage compartments associated with each removal transaction, as discussed below. Additionally or alternatively, the storage device  can be configured to illuminate one or more storage compartments associated with any other type(s) of transaction, including counting transaction, stocking transaction, etc.","In some embodiments, one or more lasers and\/or other light emitting devices may be configured to facilitate the illumination of, for example, a medication storage compartment by projecting light onto one or more portions of the storage device . The light projected onto the portion(s) of the medication storage device may facilitate one or more removal transactions from the storage device  by guiding the user to the proper portion of the storage device (e.g., by \u201chighlighting\u201d a particular portion) and\/or by displaying user-understandable information (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols, etc.). For example, the projected light can highlight a particular pocket that is to be accessed next by a user. As another example, the projected light can cause information to be displayed onto the medication storage compartment and\/or other portion of the storage device. In embodiments where information is projected onto the pocket, for example, the storage device  may be able to communicate the information to the user without the need for the user to consult the touch-screen interface (e.g., display device ) and\/or in the absence of any other functioning user interface. In some embodiments, the projected information and\/or highlighting light may complement the information displayed by display device  and\/or other types of user interface components.","Projecting light onto the pocket (and\/or any other component of the storage device ) may also be used instead of or in addition to light emitting components integrated in the drawers and\/or other components of the storage device . For example, the storage device  can be configured to project light from a first location that is external to the drawer and\/or any other storage compartment onto a pocket and\/or other component of the storage device  instead of or in addition to including pocket indicators and\/or drawer level displays that may be located in or around storage compartments of the storage device . Examples of drawer level displays, which may be used in conjunction with the projection functionality discussed herein, are provided in commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/076,762, filed Mar. 31, 2011, titled \u201cSTORAGE DEVICES, SYSTEMS, AND METHODS FOR FACILITATING MEDICATION DISPENSING AND RESTOCKING,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, projecting light (as a highlighting means and\/or as an information displaying means) on a pocket of the storage device  may enable the partial or complete (depending, for example, on the transaction and\/or configuration of the storage device ) elimination of the need for the nurse to consult the touch-screen during at least some types of interactions with the storage device . In this regard, some embodiments that include projecting light onto components of the storage device  may increase the user workflow speed and\/or reduce the likelihood of a user inadvertently stocking or removing a medication in\/from an incorrect compartment.","To enable the storage compartments and\/or other components as projection screens, storage device  may also include one or more light projectors, such as projection box  and\/or projection bars . Additional examples regarding projection box  are discussed in connection with, e.g., , and additional examples regarding projection bars  are discussed in connection with, e.g., . Furthermore, example methods of using projection box  and\/or projection bars  are discussed in connection with .","Additionally, some embodiments of the storage device  may include display device , which may include a monitor, as depicted in , and may be configured to present various user-understandable information. The display device  may include one or more display screens that may also be configured to function as input devices, as noted above. For example, display device  may include touch-sensitive components and associated hardware, software and\/or firmware. The display device  may also be configured to present one or more display screens and\/or include one or more cameras and associated hardware, software and\/or firmware, such as the examples provided in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13\/235,178, filed Sep. 16, 2011, titled \u201cSYSTEMS, METHODS AND COMPUTER PROGRAM PRODUCT FOR MONITORING INTERACTIONS WITH A MEDICATION STORAGE DEVICE,\u201d which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In embodiments of the storage device  that include cameras, the cameras can be configured to assist in the calibration of the light projectors discussed herein (e.g., projection box  and\/or projection bars ) by, e.g., determining how accurately the light being projected is illuminating the portion of storage device  that it is intended to be illuminated. Other examples of user output components that may be included in the storage device  include lights, audio speakers, haptic feedback components, and\/or any other component that may generate stimuli detectable by a user.","As such, the user input and output devices (including projection box  and\/or projection bars ) may be configured to help facilitate particular removal, stocking and\/or counting transactions. For example, a user input device may receive input in the form of identification credentials authorizing the user to access the storage device  and\/or a particular drawer  of the storage device ; a selection of a patient for whom medication is to be dispensed; a request for information regarding a particular medication stored in one of the drawers or a particular patient to whose records the user has access; a selection of a particular medication to be viewed or dispensed; and so on. User output devices may then help direct the user to the appropriate storage compartment (e.g., drawer, pocket, and\/or any other medication storage component of the storage device ) from which the medication can be removed. Furthermore, in some cases, the storage device  may be configured to communicate with other storage devices and\/or other types of machines, as discussed in connection with , such that the user may be able to enter input requesting information regarding the contents of the other storage devices.","For example, using the display device , the user may be able to view a list of patients under the user's care; view patient details (e.g., patient's name, date of birth, medical condition, allergies, date of admittance, date of expected discharge, etc.); view a list of prescribed medications for a particular patient; view medication details (such as potential interactions, medication properties, and dosage information); and\/or view order details (such as the name of a medication, required dosage, quantity to be dispensed, portion of the medication in the storage device, etc.). Some or all of the user's interactions at the storage device  may be monitored at a remote machine and\/or recorded at the storage device and\/or at a remote machine. Additionally or alternatively, any information presented by the display device  may also be presented on any other component of the storage device  using one or more projectors discussed herein.","Different types of storage devices  may include different sizes and styles of drawers , depending on, for example, the types of medications to be stored in the drawers , the quantities required (which may be dictated by the size or type of the facility or other area serviced by the automated storage device), and user preferences. For example, as shown in , some of the drawers  may be relatively deep, whereas others may be relatively shallow. As another example, the number, arrangement and size of the pockets and\/or other types of storage type compartment(s) included in one of the drawers  may be different than that included in another of the drawers . Despite the various arrangements of the drawers , projection box  and\/or projection bars  can be configured to visually highlight and\/or project information onto one or more specific storage compartments included in one or more of drawers , as described in greater detail below. In some embodiments, the storage compartment(s) can be made of materials and\/or otherwise configured (e.g., include structure elements, like ribs and textured surfaces) that enhance or otherwise facilitate their illumination by one or more projectors, such as those discussed herein.","Additionally or alternatively, each storage compartment may also be locked with a lid that the storage device  can be configured to unlock only when medication stored in the particular pocket is to be dispensed, restocked and\/or counted. For example, each drawer  and\/or compartment may be in a locked state until an authorized user interfaces with the storage device  to access a particular drawer, pocket and\/or other storage compartment, at which point the storage device may unlock and\/or open the compartment to allow the user's access. In some cases, the compartment and\/or other component of the storage device may have an opaque or other type of cover that aids in enabling the component to function as a display screen for the projectors discussed herein. For example, the configuration (e.g., materials, structural design features, etc.) of the lid (and\/or any other portion) of the storage device  can help enhance the display of information projected by one or more of the projection box , projection bars  and\/or any other projector located external to that onto which the light is being projected. In some embodiments, rather than or in addition to displaying information, the compartment and\/or other component of the storage device can simply be highlighted using a light projected by projection box  and\/or projection bars .","The storage device  may also include one or more other components and\/or provide one or more other functions not specifically shown in the drawings (to avoid overcomplicating the drawings unnecessarily). For example, the storage device  may include a container dispensing device mounted to or otherwise supported by the storage device. The container dispensing device may be configured to store and dispense containers, and each container may be configured to receive one or more dispensed medications for administering to a single selected patient. Thus, each container may be configured to allow the secure transport of the dispensed medications received therein between the storage device  and the selected patient's bedside.","Turning next to , projection box  may include one or more light emitting devices that may be controlled by circuitry (such as a processor of storage device  and\/or a processor included within the projection box ) to project light  onto one or more components, such as pocket lid , of drawer . Light  may include, among other things, laser light, visible light, infrared light and\/or any other suitable form of light. For example, a laser light source can be used that emits standard low-intensity laser beams similar to or the same as those used in other applications (such as, e.g., laser pointers, laser levels, laser thermostats, etc.). In some embodiments, for example, light  may be directed at one or more particular areas of drawer , such that light  highlights, guides the user to and\/or otherwise indicates one or more correct pocket locations that are to be accessed by the user for various reasons (e.g., remove medications, stock supplies, conduct a blind count, etc.). For example, projection box  may be configured to direct the light , such that the light  is projected onto only one component of drawer  at a time (as shown in ), and\/or be configured to highlight a plurality of components of drawer  simultaneously (or near-simultaneously, including seeming to the user to appear simultaneously). Any suitable means can be included in projection box  that allows for the directing of light, such as one or more movable mirrors and\/or other light reflecting components that can be configured to be controllably moved by circuitry (such as a processor included in storage device ) and direct the light emitted by the projecting component(s).","For example, as shown in , projection box  may include processor  that may, for example, be embodied as various means including one or more microprocessors with accompanying digital signal processor(s), processor(s) without an accompanying digital signal processor, one or more coprocessors, multi-core processors, controllers, computers, various other processing elements including integrated circuits such as, for example, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) or FPGA (field programmable gate array), or some combination thereof. Accordingly, although shown in  as a single processor, in some embodiments the processor  comprises a plurality of processors and\/or any other type of control circuitry. The plurality of processors, for example, may be embodied on a single computing device or may be distributed across a plurality of computing devices collectively configured to function as the processor . The plurality of processors may be in operative communication with each other and may be collectively configured to perform one or more functionalities of the processor  as described herein. In an example embodiment, the processor  is configured to execute instructions stored in the memory  and\/or that are otherwise accessible to the processor .","The memory  can be in communication with and\/or included in the processor . The memory  may comprise volatile and\/or non-volatile memory that stores content, data and\/or any other information. For example, the memory  can store information generated by, transmitted from, and\/or received by, the projection box . Also for example, the memory  can store software applications, firmware, instructions and\/or the like for the processor  to perform steps associated with operation of the projection box . For example, the memory  may be a non-transitory storage medium that stores computer program code comprising instructions or other executable portions that the processor  executes to perform the steps described above and below with regard to, e.g., .","These instructions, when executed by the processor , may cause the projection box  to perform one or more of the functionalities described herein. As such, whether configured by hardware, firmware\/software methods, or by a combination thereof, the processor  may comprise an entity capable of performing operations according to embodiments of the present invention while configured accordingly. Thus, for example, when the processor  is embodied as an ASIC, FPGA or the like, the processor  may comprise specifically configured hardware for conducting one or more operations described herein. Alternatively, as another example, when the processor  is embodied as an executor of instructions, such as may be stored in the memory , the instructions may specifically configure the processor  to perform one or more algorithms and operations described herein.","For example, the memory  may include instructions for controlling one or more light sources  and\/or reflective surface motors . Upon being executed, the instructions may, for example, cause one or more light sources  to direct certain types of light in a particular manner, including causing the movement of mirrors (using reflective surface motors ) and\/or the adjusting of aperture(s), among other things.","In other embodiments, one or more of the components shown in  (and\/or any other drawing discussed herein) may be omitted and\/or the functionality associated therewith may be performed by another component discussed herein. For example, the functionality discussed in connection with processor  may be performed by processor  of  discussed below. As another example, the instructions executed by processor  may be based on data stored in memory  of , as opposed to or in addition to data stored on memory .","Light sources  may include, for example, a single standard laser beam (such as a laser pointer) that can be used to cast a single beam of light (e.g., light ) onto the lid , as shown in . Similarly, the laser beam and\/or other type of light may be projected onto open matrix pockets that do not include a lid (not shown). In such embodiments, one or more of the open matrix pockets can comprise various materials, structure features and\/or other configurations that enhance the illumination caused by light sources . For example, if light source  is an ultraviolet laser beam, lid  and\/or open matrix pockets can comprise a material that fluoresces in the presence of ultraviolet light.","As another example, light sources  may include a plurality of laser beams (e.g., four laser beams). Additionally or alternatively, each of light sources  may include one or more optical components that can split and\/or otherwise influence the light  such that it may be used to highlight and\/or project information simultaneously onto one or more open pockets and\/or lidded compartments, among other things. The plurality of laser beams (and\/or parts of a split laser beam) can also or instead be used to outline a pocket. To gain an outlined image of a pocket and\/or other component of the storage device , a plurality of lasers may be incorporated in light sources  and\/or light sources  may include or project through a square filter (and\/or other type of optical component(s)) to achieve the outlining effect.","In addition to or instead of outlining and\/or otherwise highlighting a component of the storage device , information may be projected onto a component of storage device . For example, as shown in , the number \u201c2\u201d may be projected onto lid , thereby indicating to the user that 2 doses of medication should be removed from the pocket associated with lid  during the next removal transaction. In some embodiments, projection box  can be configured to project any type of information (including user-understandable characters, words, symbols, images, etc.) onto one or more components of storage device  (including into a pocket, on a side wall of a pocket, on the bottom of a pocket, across multiple pockets, among other places).","For example, to project various information, projection box  may also or instead include a non-laser light source in light sources , such as a mini-projector (e.g., a pico projector), which can be configured to cast dynamically changing data onto one or more pockets and\/or other components of the storage device . In this regard, projection box  may include components similar or the same as those sometimes used in a heads-up-display (\u201cHUD\u201d) used in aircraft and terrestrial vehicles.","The drawers  and\/or other components of the storage device  can also include one or more components that assist in functionality of projection box . In some embodiments, sensors mapped to the pockets in each drawer can be included, which may enable the highlighted pocket to be illuminated correctly. For example, the sensors may include a progression sensor that enables processor  to cause light  to follow the pocket dynamically by, e.g., controlling light sources  and\/or reflective surface motor . As another example, the sensors may be configured to determine when the drawer is fully extended, thereby enabling the circuitry in the storage device to know at least the proximate location of various components of one or more drawers  relative to the location of the projection box  on the storage device . In other words, the sensors may be used by the circuitry of the storage device  to triangulate and\/or otherwise calculate the relative position of one or more components of the drawers  that are to be highlighted and\/or otherwise used as a projection screen.","In some embodiments, projection box  may also be able to move on the storage device . For example, projection box  may be mounted on a track and\/or other apparatus that allows projection box  to move in one or more directions relative to the drawers . Although such motors are not discussed in connection with , those discussed in connection with  may be used in conjunction with projection box . Furthermore, other aspects of various embodiments may be combined, substituted and\/or rearranged, among other things, without departing from the spirit of the invention.","In some embodiments and further to the above discussion, the lid  and\/or other component of the storage device  can be configured to aid in facilitating the display of information projected by projection box . For example, the lid can be opaque (rather than translucent) and\/or otherwise made from one or more materials that enable the display of information. As another example, one or more portions of the storage device  can comprise material that fluoresces when exposed to one or more particular wavelengths of light (such as ultraviolet light and\/or infrared light), which may allow projection box  to use various wavelengths of light to highlight and\/or display various information on components of the storage device .","The processor  can also be configured to communicate directly and\/or indirectly with other components and\/or machines discussed herein. In some embodiments, one or more input and\/or output modules, such as input\/output module  may enable processor  to interface with the circuitry discussed in connection with  and\/or . The input\/output module  may include specialized circuitry, one or more ports (serial, such as universal serial bus \u201cUSB\u201d ports, and\/or parallel ports), any wired or wireless communication network components (including those for WiFi, BlueTooth\u00ae, among others), and\/or any other component that facilitates the reception and\/or transmission of signals from\/to one or more other components. In this regard, the input\/output module  can facilitate the functionality of the projection box . Although more than one input\/output module  can be included in the storage device , only one is shown in  to avoid overcomplicating the drawing (like the other components discussed herein).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":["FIGS. 3-4","FIGS. 3"],"b":["30","30","4"]},"Projection bars A, B, C and\/or D may each include a processor , memory , light sources  and input\/output module , which may be the same as or similar to their respective components discussed in connection with projection box .","The light sources  may be located in a single row or multiple rows along the length, \u201cL,\u201d of one or more of the projection bars A-D. For example, a first light emitting component included in projection bar A can be configured to project light A onto lid A, and a second light emitting component included in projection bar A can be configured to project light B onto lid B. Additionally or alternatively, each light emitting component included in one or more of the projection bars A-D can include optics and\/or other components (such as those that may be used in accordance with projection box ) that may influence the light emitted by the light emitting components included in projection bars A-D.","Light source motor  may also or instead be included in one or more of projection bars A-D. Light source motor  may be configured to move one or more of the light emitting components, represented by light sources , along the length L and\/or otherwise within projection bars A-D. In this regard, for example, the beam of projected light A may move along length L of projection bar A in response to light source motor being instructed to do so by processor .","Lids A and B may be similar to or the same as lid  discussed in connection with . In this regard, projection bars A-D can be configured to project light A and\/or B onto the drawer  located directly below. In some embodiments, when the lid is open, as shown by lid B in , the lid  may block the beam of light (e.g., light B) that illuminates the lid  when it is in the closed position. To enable light to continue to highlight or otherwise project onto a pocket (and\/or other component of the storage device ) while in an open position, one or more of the lids of one or more drawers  can open in a manner that does not obstruct the projection of light B and\/or any other light being emitted by any projector (e.g., projection box  and\/or projection bars A-D). For example, lid B can be configured to open in a direction orthogonal to the movement of drawer  as shown in .","Referring now to , the storage device  may include any type of circuitry to facilitate the functionality discussed herein. For example, circuitry commonly found in various computing devices and other types of machines (e.g., desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet, etc.), may be included in the storage device . To illustrate this,  shows a block diagram of example circuitry components that may be configured to store and\/or execute computer-readable program code portions comprising executable instructions and\/or other types of executable portions. As such, the storage device  may include various means for performing one or more functions in accordance with some embodiments, including those more particularly shown and described herein. It should be understood, however, that the storage device  may include alternative means for performing one or more like functions, without departing from the spirit and scope of embodiments discussed herein. As shown, the storage device  is a machine and can generally include means, such as processor  for performing or controlling the various functions of the storage device .","The processor  may, for example, be embodied as various means including one or more microprocessors with accompanying digital signal processor(s), processor(s) without an accompanying digital signal processor, one or more coprocessors, multi-core processors, controllers, computers, various other processing elements including integrated circuits such as, for example, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) or FPGA (field programmable gate array), or some combination thereof. Accordingly, although shown in  as a single processor, in some embodiments the processor  comprises a plurality of processors and\/or any other type of control circuitry.

For example, the user may have to first login to the system by providing various identifying credentials (e.g., username and password), and progress through the workflow of the storage device's user interface system before a selection of one or more medications for stocking and\/or removal can be made. In other words, in some embodiments, while the user is interacting with the storage device in a manner other than removing, taking inventory of and\/or stocking medication(s) (but not limited to these tasks), the projection functionality of the storage device may wait at  to be activated.","At  a determination is made as to whether or not a selection of a medication to be removed and\/or stocked has been made. In response to determining no medication has been selected yet, process  returns to  and continues to wait.","In response to determining at  that the processor has received an indication of a medication to be selected for dispensing or stocking (e.g., receiving an indication of a user selecting a medication identifier presented on display device ), process  can be configured to proceed to .","At , a determination is made as to where in the storage device the medication is to be stored and\/or removed from. For example, a determination can be made at  as to the relative and\/or absolute location of a pocket, medication storage compartment and\/or other storage device portion associated with the selected medication. In some embodiments, the storage device can begin executing at  one or more projection algorithms, including retrieving the projection algorithms and\/or projection settings from memory and storing any results calculated in memory. In other embodiments, one or more of the functionalities discussed in connection with  may occur later in process  (e.g., at ).","For example, at  the storage device can be configured to utilize relative location algorithms that may include inputting one or more projection settings into one or more projection algorithms that can be used to determine a target portion relative to a known location of a storage device component. For example, a first pocket may be used as a default position and other pockets may be illuminated based on their position relative to the known pocket. In embodiments that include projection box , for example, to shine on a pocket to the left of the known pocket location, the system can execute an algorithm that causes it to direct a mirror (included in projection box ) 5 degrees to the left relative to the position the mirror would be used for the known pocket location. As another example, each storage device portion (e.g., pocket and\/or other type of compartment) may be independently preprogrammed into the storage device in terms of, for example, mirror angles, aperture settings, light intensity, power output and\/or other projector-related settings (sometimes referred to herein as \u201cprojection settings\u201d). The various projection settings and\/or projection algorithms (into which the projection settings are inputted) can be dependent on the types, locations, and\/or other characteristics of the one or more projectors included in the particular storage device(s) configured to implement process , and the projection settings and\/or projection algorithms can be stored locally within the storage device(s) (e.g., in memory ) and\/or remotely (e.g., in database ).","At , a determination can be made whether or not the storage device is at a point in its workflow in which light is to be directed and projected. For example, the projecting functionality discussed herein (e.g., projecting a highlight and\/or information carrying beam of light) may not be triggered until the storage device determines that the drawer containing the pocket to be highlighted is in the fully extended position. The amount a drawer is open may, in some instances, effect the configuration needed by the projector to illuminate a particular portion of the storage device. For example, the farther a drawer is extended into the open position, the farther away a pocket may be relative to where a light source is mounted onto the storage device. In some embodiments, the processor (and\/or other circuitry) of the storage device can be configured to dynamically determine the location of any component of the storage device (including, e.g., using a sensor that measures the distance that a drawer is extended at a given time, such as when the light projector is and\/or is about project light). In other embodiments, the drawer and\/or other component being in a predetermined position (e.g., fully extended into the open position) may function as a triggering event required to activate the light source(s), as discussed herein. In addition to or instead of determining at  the physical location of the storage device component targeted for illumination (with, e.g., a highlighting beam of light and\/or information), a determination can be made at  as to whether or not the user has reached a point in the user interface workflow at which medication is ready to be stocked and\/or removed from the storage device. These are but a few examples of projection triggering events that may need to be satisfied in some embodiments before the projector(s) are activated (e.g., before projection settings are retrieved and\/or executed in the projection algorithms, and\/or light is illuminated by the light source(s).","In response to determining at  that the storage device is not yet ready for illumination of the targeted storage device portion (e.g., the pocket or other compartment to be interacted with by the user), process  proceeds to  and continues to execute the workflow of the storage device (e.g., wait for sensors to indicate the drawer is fully extended into the open position, the user to finish interacting with the user interface of the storage device, etc.).","In response to determining at  that the storage device is ready for illumination of the targeted storage device portion (e.g., the pocket or other compartment to be interacted with by the user), process  proceeds to  and activates one or more projectors (e.g., projection box  and\/or projection bars ). Activating the one or more projectors may include various sub-algorithms, an example of which is represented by the process flow shown in  discussed below. While the one or more projectors is active, light may be projected onto one or more targeted portions of the storage device without illuminating at least some non-targeted portions. For example, a medication storage pocket of a drawer may be illuminated by the projector, while another medication storage pocket within the same drawer may not be illuminated. These pockets may or may not be adjacent, in some embodiments. As used herein, a lack of illumination could, but does not necessarily mean absolutely no light from the projector is reaching the non-targeted portion of the storage device. Rather, as used herein, the targeted portion(s) of the storage device would receive, for example, at least 95% of the light projected by the projector and the non-targeted portions would receive less than, for example, 5% of the light projected by the projector. In some embodiments, however, a light emitting device can be used that has a contrast ratio of approximately 1000:1 or better. For example, some pico projectors can have such a contrast ratio, wherein \u201ccontrast ratio\u201d is defined as the difference between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks on the projected surface. In such instances, a contrast ratio of 1000:1 would translate to a 99.9% amount of light transmitted to the target area (e.g., the pocket being highlighted).","At , a determination can be made whether or not the storage device's workflow has progressed to a point where the projector(s) should cease to project light onto the targeted storage device portion. For example, at  one or more sensors and\/or input components can be periodically polled and\/or a determination may be made as to whether one or more predetermined interrupts have been received that indicate to the storage device that the storage compartment (e.g., pocket and\/or drawer) has been closed or is being closed. As another example, a determination can be made at  whether or not the user has interacted with display device  in a manner that indicates the user has finished removing and\/or stocking medications within the targeted storage device portion. In response to determining at  that light should continue to be projected, process  returns to .","In response to determining at  that the projector should cease projecting light onto the targeted storage device portion, process  can proceed to  and stop projecting light (e.g., a highlighting beam and\/or information) onto the targeted storage device portion.","At , a determination can be made as to whether or not another medication is to be removed and\/or stocked into another storage device portion. If so, process  may return to an early step. Although  shows process  returning to , process  may return to any other step that may be included in process , such as . In some embodiments, light will continue to be projected by the projector while the next targeted portion is determined. For example, light may continue to be projected while the mirrors and\/or other reflective surfaces within the projection box  are adjusted to illuminate another targeted area of the storage device  and\/or while the light source included in projection bar (e.g., A-D) is moved along the length of the projection bar. In some embodiments, the projector(s) can stop projecting light while determining at  if there is another storage device portion that is to be illuminated and\/or while executing one or more of the other steps of process  after determining that there is another storage device portion that is to be illuminated.","Process  can end at  in response to determining at  that there are no other portions of the medication storage device targeted for illumination.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","25","30","800","802"]},"At , in embodiments where multiple light sources are included in the storage device (e.g., lasers having different wavelengths in the projection box  and\/or plurality of projection bars  mounted on different drawers), a determination can be made as to which light source(s) should be used to illuminate the targeted storage device portion. As another example, multiple light sources may be used to project information onto and\/or highlight the targeted storage device portion. In other embodiments that include only a single light source, step  can be omitted (as can any other functionality discussed herein be omitted from some embodiments).","At , a determination can be made as to whether or not information and\/or highlighting light is to be projected onto the storage device. For example, in some embodiments, the storage device may be configured to shine a light onto one or more pockets that are to be accessed by the user, and\/or project user-understandable information (e.g., numbers, words, symbols, etc.) onto the pocket and\/or other component of the storage device.","At , the projection algorithm and\/or projection settings can be accessed from memory and executed. In some embodiments, the projector can be calibrated prior to executing the projection processes discussed herein (e.g., by projecting light and receiving feedback automatically from integrated sensors and\/or from user inputs), and at  an adjustment based on one or more previous calibration results can be integrated into the projection algorithm.","At , the components of the projector(s) can be adjusted to be directed at the targeted storage device portion. For example, reflectors included in projection box  can be rotated or otherwise moved to the correct angle of attack. In response to one or more triggering events (some examples of which are discussed in connection with ), light can be projected at . In some embodiments, one or more sensors may be included in one or more targeted storage device portions, and at  the storage device can monitor (e.g., receive and analyze) the light that is projected. The decision made at  can be the same as or substantially similar to that discussed in connection with  discussed above. Process  can end at  and, for example,  of  may be executed thereafter.","In this regard, embodiments discussed herein can assist in highlighting a compartment and\/or other component of a medication storage device for a user.
