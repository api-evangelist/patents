The Government has certain rights in the invention.","Embodiments herein relate to the field of chemistry, and, more specifically, to novel luminescent compounds, synthesis thereof, and methods of using same.","Squaraine dyes are organic dyes with very intense fluorescence spectra, typically in the red and near infrared region, which makes them attractive for biological applications. They are characterized by an aromatic four-membered ring system derived from squaric acid.","Some squaraine dyes may be conjugated to biomolecules through a free carboxylic acid group. However, these lipophilic squaraine dyes suffer from three problems in physiological solutions: poor solubility, massive aggregation-induced loss of fluorescence signal, and poor stability. Even sulfonated squaraine derivatives that are water-soluble are still unstable in PBS.","Most squaraines are encumbered by nucleophilic attack of the central four-membered ring, which is highly electron deficient. This encumbrance may be attenuated by trapping the squaraine inside a macrocycle to form a permanently interlocked molecule called a squaraine rotaxane. Formation of a rotaxane around the dye helps to protect it from nucleophiles, which improves the stability of squaraine dyes in physiological solutions like phosphate buffered saline (PBS). However, squaraine rotaxanes still lose fluorescence signal under very strong aggregation conditions such as phosphate buffered saline, which limits their usefulness in biological applications.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration embodiments that may be practiced.

A molecule may have several attached \u201czwitterionic groups\u201d Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a new family of squaraine rotaxane dyes that solve all major problems that known squaraine rotaxanes exhibit in physiological solutions, including: poor solubility, aggregation-induced loss of fluorescence signal, poor stability, only moderate brightness, poor biodistribution in animals, or bioconjugates with greatly altered charge patterns. The novel squaraine rotaxane dyes have photophysical properties that are very similar to the commonly used Cy-5 fluorophore, however, the new dyes are substantially more photostable and they resist quenching. This makes them superior substitutes for Cy-5 in many biotechnological and imaging applications. In some embodiments, the dyes may be conjugated to small and large biological molecules to make fluorescent molecular probes for various imaging applications.","In some embodiments, the squaraine rotaxanes may include one or more sulfonate or phosphonate groups and also may include one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. In other embodiments, the squaraine rotaxanes may be uncharged or nearly uncharged overall, but may include one or more zwitterionic groups for water solubility and also may include one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. Embodiments of the present disclosure encompass any racemic, optically-active, polymorphic, tautomeric, or stereoisomeric form or mixture thereof, of a compound of the disclosure that possesses the useful properties described herein. Other embodiments include bioconjugates of the squaraine rotaxane dyes disclosed herein. Still other embodiments provide methods of synthesizing the squaraine rotaxane compounds described herein.","In embodiments, squaraine rotaxanes are made in three major steps; (1) fabrication of the central squaraine thread component, (2) encapsulation of this thread component inside a macrocycle to make a rotaxane, and (3) covalent modification of the rotaxane. As described herein, sulfonate, phosphonate, or zwitterionic groups are added after the second step since their presence diminishes the synthetic yields in the second step. Reactions that directly attach sulfonate groups via electrophilic addition mechanisms do not produce high yields of products. Embodiments disclose herein a much better approach for attaching a sulfonate or a phosphate group or a zwitterionic group to the squaraine rotaxane.","In some embodiments, attaching a sulfonate, phosphonate, or zwitterionic group to the squaraine rotaxane via amide bond formation is undesirable for bioimaging probes because amide bonds may be broken by enzymatic action. Preferred embodiments involve the conjugation method of forming triazole linkages using a copper catalyzed azide\/alkyne cycloaddition reaction. In embodiments, triazoles are excellent linkages because they are resistant to protease enzyme cleavage and their formation does not produce by-products.","In an embodiment, a squaraine rotaxane may have at least one sulfonate\/phosphonate group and\/or at least one zwitterionic group, and may have the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"75.69mm","wi":"103.38mm","file":"US08273875-20120925-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3 ","1 ","2 ","1 ","2 ","1","2","3","4 "]},"In certain embodiments, the squaraine rotaxane may have the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"83.23mm","wi":"60.88mm","file":"US08273875-20120925-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3 ","1 ","2 ","1","2","3","4 "]},"In certain embodiments, the squaraine rotaxane may have the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"83.23mm","wi":"60.88mm","file":"US08273875-20120925-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sup":["1","2","3 ","1 ","2 ","1","2","3","4 "]},"In embodiments, the exemplary compounds described above may be synthesized according to the following general procedures.

Another favorable attribute gained by the presence of ortho-hydroxyl groups is reduced fluorescence quenching by water. This may be demonstrated by comparing compound 1, which has no ortho-hydroxyls attached to the anilines, with compound 2, which has two ortho-hydroxyls attached to one of the anilines. Photophysical measurements in two solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and THF:water (1:1), show that the fluorescence quantum yield of compound 1 decreases by 33% when the solvent is changed from THF to THF:Water (1:1). This is due to the squaraine quenching effect of water. In contrast, the fluorescence quantum yield of compound 2 is not altered when the solvent is changed from THF to THF:water (1:1).

In another embodiment, the attachment of a dye having many anionic groups or many cationic groups to a biological molecule produces a bioconjugate that when introduced into an animal is not likely to be cleared primarily from the bloodstream by the kidney, which complicates imaging performance. These problems are solved, in embodiments, by creating squaraine rotaxanes with one or more polyethyleneglycol or zwitterionic groups for water solubility and one or more reactive sites for bioconjugation. In embodiments, the overall net charge of these compounds is zero or close to zero. In embodiments, these compounds have excellent water solubility and excellent stability, do not form non-fluorescent aggregates in PBS, and have a greater tendency to clear from the bloodstream of animals through the kidney.","Surprisingly, in embodiments, squaraine rotaxanes with one or more attached sulfonates or attached zwitterionic groups are very photostable, even when they are associated with proteins that normally quench other dyes.

The dyes were incubated in excess with 1.3 \u03bcm magnetic particles coated in avidin. Following the incubation, the particles were washed of any unbound fluorophore, and the samples were then imaged on an epifluorescent microscope. The samples remained under constant excitation and images were captured every 30 seconds. Using ImageJ software, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the imaged magnetic particles and the mean pixel intensity was measured for each image.
