{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)"],"p":["The present invention generally relates a distributed data storage systems. Typically, such distributed storage systems are targeted at storing large amounts of data, such as objects or files in a distributed and fault tolerant manner with a predetermined level of redundancy. The present invention relates more particularly to a distributed object storage system.","The advantages of object storage systems, which store data objects referenced by an object identifier versus file systems, such as for example US2002\/0078244, which store files referenced by an inode or block based systems which store data blocks referenced by a block address in terms of scalability and flexibility are well known. Object storage systems in this way are able to surpass the maximum limits for storage capacity of file systems in a flexible way such that for example storage capacity can be added or removed in function of the needs, without degrading its performance as the system grows. This makes such object storage systems excellent candidates for large scale storage systems.","Such large scale storage systems are required to distribute the stored data objects in the object storage system over multiple storage elements, such as for example hard disks, or multiple components such as storage nodes comprising a plurality of such storage elements. However as the number of storage elements in such a distributed object storage system increase, equally the probability of failure of one or more of these storage elements increases. To cope therewith it is required to introduce a level of redundancy into the distributed object storage system. This means that the distributed object storage system must be able to cope with a failure of one or more storage elements without data loss. In its simplest form redundancy is achieved by replication, this means storing multiple copies of a data object on multiple storage elements of the distributed object storage system. In this way when one of the storage elements storing a copy of the data object fails, this data object can still be recovered from another storage element holding a copy. Several schemes for replication are known in the art, in general replication is costly as the storage capacity is concerned. This means that in order to survive two concurrent failures of a storage element of a distributed object storage system, at least two replica copies for each data object are required, which results in storage capacity overhead of 200%, which means that for storing 1 GB of data objects a storage capacity of 3 GB is required. Another well-known scheme is referred to as RAID systems of which some implementations are more efficient than replication as storage capacity overhead is concerned. However, often RAID systems require a form of synchronisation of the different storage elements and require them to be of the same type and in the case of drive failure require immediate replacement, followed by a costly and time consuming rebuild process. Therefor known systems based on replication or known RAID systems are generally not configured to survive more than two concurrent storage element failures. Therefor it has been proposed to use distributed object storage systems that are based on erasure encoding, such as for example described in WO20091356300 or US2007\/0136525. Such a distributed object storage system stores the data object in encoded sub blocks that are spread amongst the storage elements in such a way that for example a concurrent failure of six storage elements can be tolerated with a corresponding storage overhead of 60%, that means that 1 GB of data objects only require a storage capacity of 1.6 GB.","In order to reduce power consumption and increase reliability of the distributed object storage system, some form of monitoring of the hardware is required. In prior art systems some central monitoring facility will periodically connect to the storage elements and request status information such as fan speeds, temperature, disk error rates etc. The central facility will then analyse all this data and try to determine if certain actions are to be taken like proactively replication of data of a storage element that is about to fail. However for very large and distributed object storage systems this approach does not scale well and the time it would take to poll all of the storage elements would lead to a very low monitoring frequency.","According to the invention there is provided a storage node for a distributed object storage system, said storage node comprising:\n\n","Traditional computer systems are managed through a KVM (Keyboard, Video an Mouse) system, that allows to remotely take over Keyboard, Video and Mouse. The implementation of such remote control system requires three connections on each computer to be connected to a central KVM device. This is a complex and expensive solution. The control board of the storage node according to the invention eliminates the need for such a KVM and is able to automatically control the hardware of the storage node in such a way that the power consumption can be minimized and reliability can be improved even when the motherboard is powered down or the operating system of the storage node is unavailable. This all is accomplished in a scalable way as the control board allows for low latency control in the storage node while the control node is able to modify the parameters controlling the operation of this control board and receive signals informing it about their operational status.","According to a preferred embodiment said storage node further comprising an incoming serial connector and an outgoing serial connector connected to said control board for daisy chaining said multiple storage nodes via said serial bus.","This enables a scalable setup with simple wiring requirements, which in large scale systems becomes increasingly important.","According to a preferred embodiment said plurality of temperature sensors are arranged:\n\n","In this way the temperature measurements can be used to regulate and direct the airflow more efficiently to the specific areas in the storage node where it is needed in order to limit power consumption.","According to a preferred embodiment said plurality of temperature sensors are coupled to said control board by means of a single digital bus configured to power said temperature sensors and to transfer the temperature measurements to said control board. This setup allows a simpler wiring implementation inside the storage node, which frees up space for the other components and reduces its disturbance of the air flow.","According to a further embodiment said control board is further operable to monitor the speed of said at least one fan, and said control board is further configured to:\n\n","This allows the fan control to happen with low latency and low overhead and even at times when the motherboard or the operating system of the storage node are unavailable, which allows to still further reduce power consumption.","According to still a further embodiment:\n\n","This allows to reduce the power requirements for the power supply which can then operate in an operating mode that is more efficient and as such results in a lower power usage of the storage node and further allows to reduce power consumption of low usage storage elements or to extend the life span of highly loaded storage elements.","According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a distributed object storage system comprising a plurality of storage nodes according to any of the preceding claims, comprising:\n\n","Said controller node is operably connected to said storage nodes by means of said serial bus to:\n\n","Preferably said controller node is further operably connected to said storage nodes by means of said serial bus to:\n\n","Preferably said controller node is further operably connected to said storage nodes by means of said serial bus to:\n\n","This allows for a scalable approach for the distributed object storage system that is able to limit its power consumption and extend its operational life and reliability.","According to a further embodiment said spreading module is configured to control continuation or discontinuation of usage of one or more of said storage elements on the basis of:\n\n","This allows for the distributed object storage system that to limit its power consumption and extend its operational efficiency by for example discontinuing use of storage elements that are causing high amounts of heat or from switching back on storage elements for only a short period of time.","According to still a further embodiment said spreading module is further configured to adapt the selection of said storage elements in order to distribute storage load across said storage elements on the basis of:\n\n","In this way an intelligent use of the spreading policy by the spreading module on the basis of the information provided by the control boards allows to reduce power consumption and increase reliability of the distributed object storage system.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0077"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1","FIGS. 7 and 8"],"b":["1","10","1","10","1","20","30","1","30","40","24","20","30","10","20","26"]},"According to alternative embodiments of the distributed object storage system could comprise any other suitable number of storage nodes  and for example two three or more controller nodes  also connected to these storage nodes . These controller nodes  and storage nodes  can be built as general purpose computers, however more frequently they are physically adapted for arrangement in large data centres, where they are arranged in modular racks  comprising standard dimensions. Particular controller nodes  and storage nodes , such as for example the Amplistor AS20 storage node as manufactured by Amplidata, are dimensioned to take up a single unit of such rack , which is generally referred to as 1U.","As shown in  several storage nodes  can be grouped together, for example because they are housed in a single rack . For example storage nodes .-.; .-.; . . . ; and .-. each are respectively grouped into racks ., ., . . . .. Controller node  could for example be located in rack .. These racks are not required to be located at the same location, they are often geographically dispersed across different data centres, such as for example rack .-. can be located at a data centre in Europe, .-. at a data centre in the USA and .-. at a data centre in China.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["30","30","1","310","320","330","340","350","360","370","300","1","300","10","310","30","1","320","330","320","320","340","30","1","350","360","30","1","30","20","370","310","300","300","30","1","300","1","300","10","30","1","1","30","2","30","40","30","1","1"]},"Taking into account  the distributed object storage system  comprises a plurality of redundant storage elements . The storage nodes  each comprise a share of these storage elements . As shown in  storage node . comprises ten storage elements .-.. Other storage nodes  could comprise a similar amount of storage elements, but this is however not essential. Storage node . could for example comprise eight storage elements .-.. As will be explained in further detail below with respect to , the distributed object storages system  is operable to store and retrieve a data object  comprising data , for example 64 MB of binary data and a data object identifier  for addressing this data object , for example a universally unique identifier such as a globally unique identifier (GUID). Storing the data offered for storage by the application  in the form of a data object, also referred to as object storage, has specific advantages over other storage schemes such as conventional block based storage or conventional file based storage, such as scalability and flexibility, which are of particular importance in a distributed object storage system  that is directed to large scale redundant storage applications, sometimes also referred to as cloud storage.","The storage elements  are redundant and operate independently of one another. This means that if one particular storage element  fails its function can easily be taken on by another storage element  in the distributed storage system. However as will be explained in more detail further below, there is no need for the storage elements  to work in synchronism, as is for example the case in many well-known RAID configurations, which sometimes even require disc spindle rotation to be synchronised. Furthermore the independent and redundant operation of the storage elements  allows to use any suitable mix of types storage elements  to be used in a particular distributed object storage system . It is possible to use for example storage elements with differing storage capacity, storage elements of differing manufacturers, using different hardware technology such as for example conventional hard disks and solid state storage elements, using different storage interfaces such as for example different revisions of SATA, PATA and so on. All this results in specific advantages for scalability and flexibility of the distributed object storage system  as it allows to add or remove storage elements  without imposing specific requirements to their design in correlation to other storage elements  already in use in that distributed object storage system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["20","20","210","220","230","240","250","210","20","220","230","220","320","240","20","250","260","20","30","20"]},"According to an alternative embodiment the controller node  could have an identical design as a storage node , or according to still a further alternative embodiment one of the storage nodes  of the distributed object storage system could perform both the function of a controller node  and a storage node . According to still a further embodiment the device on which the application  runs is a controller node .","As schematically shown in , controller node  comprises four modules: an encoding module ; a spreading module ; a clustering module ; and a decoding module . These modules , , ,  can be implemented as programming instructions stored in local memory  of the controller node  for execution by its processor .","The functioning of these modules , , ,  will now be explained to . The distributed object storage system  stores a data object  offered by the application  in function of a reliability policy which guarantees a level of redundancy. That means that the distributed object storage system  must for example guarantee that it will be able to correctly retrieve  even if a number of storage elements  would be unavailable, for example because they are damaged or inaccessible. Such a reliability policy could for example require the distributed object storage system  to be able to retrieve the data object  in case of six concurrent failures of the storage elements  it comprises. In large scale data storage massive amounts of data are stored on storage elements  that are individually unreliable, as such redundancy must be introduced into the storage system to improve reliability. However the most commonly used form of redundancy, straightforward replication of the data on multiple storage elements  is only able to achieve acceptable levels of reliability at the cost of unacceptable levels of overhead. For example, in order to achieve sufficient redundancy to cope with six concurrent failures of storage elements , data objects  would need to be replicated six times and stored on redundant storage elements . This means that next to the master copy of a data object  stored on one storage element , six replica's must be stored on six other storage elements. As such storing 1 GB of data objects in this way would result in the need of 7 GB of storage capacity in a distributed object storage system, this means an increase in the storage cost by a factor of seven or an additional storage overhead of 600%. Therefor the distributed object storage system  according to the invention makes use of erasure coding techniques in order to achieve the requirements of the reliability policy with considerably less overhead. As will be explained in further detail below when using an erasure encoding with a rate of encoding r=10\/16 six concurrent failures of storage element  can be tolerated, which only require a storage overhead of 60% or a storage cost by a factor of 1.6. This means that storing 1 GB of data objects in this way only results in the need of 1.6 GB of storage capacity in the distributed object storage system . Some erasure encoding techniques make use of Reed-Solomon codes, but also fountain codes or rateless erasure codes such as online codes, LDPC codes, raptor codes and numerous other coding schemes are available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["1","300","500","1","10","500","510","520","500","400","20","400","500","600","510","300","600","500","300","600","500","400","600","1","600","12800","600","600","1","500","600","1","600","1","500","600","400","400","500","600","1","600","12800","600","600","1","600","12800","500","600","600","1","600","4000","600","8001","600","12000","1","500"]},"Subsequently, as shown in , the spreading module  will store the predetermined number x*n=800*16=12800 of encoded redundant sub blocks .-. on a number of storage elements  which corresponds to said desired spreading width n=16, such as for example storage elements .-.. The spreading module  will store on each of these storage elements .-. said predetermined multiple x=800 of these sub blocks .

As shown in  storage elements .-. are arranged in storage node . and storage elements .-. are arranged in storage node ..","According to an alternative embodiment the sub blocks could be spread by the spreading module  on a number of storage elements  which is larger than said desired spreading width n=16, for example n+1=16+1=17 storage elements . This could be implemented by for example storing sub blocks .-. on storage element . and storing sub blocks .- on storage element .. It is clear that this would still allow for the storage system  to cope with f=6 concurrent failures of storage elements . Alternative methods for determining the share of sub blocks to be stored on specific storage elements  are well known to the person skilled in the art and are for example described in WO2009135630.","It is clear that according to alternative embodiments of the invention other values could have been chosen for the parameters x, f, k, n=k+f and r=k\/n mentioned in embodiment above, such as for example x=400, f=4, k=12; n=k+f=12+4=16 and r=12\/16; or any other possible combination that conforms to a desired reliability policy for redundancy and concurrent failure tolerance of storage elements  of the distributed object storage system .","According to still a further alternative there could be provided a safety margin to the number of concurrent failures f that a distributed object storage system  needs to be able to cope with. In such an embodiment some of the efficiency is traded in for some additional redundancy over what is theoretically required. This preventively increases the tolerance for failures and the time window that is available for a repair activity. However according to a preferred embodiment this safety margin will be rather limited such that it only accounts for an increase in sub blocks that must be generated and stored of for example approximately 10% to 30%, such as for example 20%.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0092"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5","FIG. 6"],"b":["1","300","500","1","10","500","510","520","20","600","600","1","600","12800","300","1","300","16","420","600","300","1","300","16","20","30","2","600","1","600","8000","600","1","600","8000","430","500","10","600","500","430","500"]},"As shown in , which shows the hardware of the storage node . for use in a distributed object storage system  in more detail comprises a power supply  and ten storage elements .-. powered by said power supply . The storage node . further comprises a motherboard  powered by said power supply  and connected to said ten storage elements . This motherboard  comprises a CPU , two network interfaces  and , through which data is transported to said storage elements .-., and a serial port  configured for providing access to a serial console of the storage node ., allowing remote access and management. The serial port  is connected to a control board  which is connected to an incoming serial connector  and an outgoing serial connector . This allow for connecting multiple storage nodes  through a serial bus , preferably using a daisy chain topology as illustrated schematically in . Each storage node comprises said incoming serial connector  and outgoing serial connector  for that purpose. This serial bus  does not only allow for a keyboard and video access to the storage node via the serial port  of the mother board , but also allows for configuration of the storage node  in case for example the operating system of the mother board is unavailable or powered down. Therefor this hardware setup is beneficial with reference to a traditional terminal server setup that links directly to the serial console of the motherboard . This further also simplifies the physical and logical architecture to get remote management access to a large number of the nodes . And it eliminates the need for a KVM system to remotely access the storage node .","The main cause of failure of disks is temperature variation. If a disk operates in an environment with frequent temperature variations of over 10 degrees Celsius, then chances for failure of the disk increase considerably. Temperature variations can be caused by external factors such as variations in environment temperature or humidity. Or the variations can be caused by a temporary increase in the workload on the disk.","Therefore, according to the embodiment of the invention shown in , the storage node  further comprises several temperature sensors  that are bolted on to each of the storage element .-.. This allows the temperature to be measured on each of the storage elements  individually at regular intervals and to detect temperature variations. Although preferred, it is not required to have a temperature sensor  available on every storage element , as long as there are sufficient temperature sensors , which provide temperature measurements that are sufficiently representative for the temperature of the storage elements  of the storage node . In some cases even a single temperature sensor  could suffice.","The storage node . shown in  further also comprises an inlet temperature sensor  at the air inlet  or the storage node and an outlet temperature sensor  at the air outlet  of the chassis of the storage node .. At the air inlet , the temperature of the incoming air is measured. The temperature sensor  for the outgoing air is positioned, in the vicinity of the CPU , for example behind the CPU heatsink, as this is generally the position where the highest air temperature can be experienced.","According to the embodiment shown in , the temperature sensors , ,  are connected via a digital bus system  that provides power to these temperature sensors , ,  and allows communication of the measurements to the control board . This digital bus system  enables installing a temperature sensor  on each storage element , while still keeping the cabling complexity limited. Having less cables also increases the free air space in the system, which enhances airflow and cooling of the storage node ..","The benefit of this detailed temperature measurement is that it allows to reduce temperature fluctuations on the storage elements  and as such lengthen the life span of the storage elements . Temperature fluctuations can be regulated by regulating for example the fan speeds and airflow in the system. Typical storage nodes have no fan control or control the fan by measuring the temperature of the outgoing air at one point. As shown in  the control board  is connected to the fans such that it can control the rotation speed of the fans  of the storage node  based on temperature measurements of each storage element  and of the incoming and outgoing air. Controlling the rotation speed of the fans is further important to limit the power consumption of a node as each fan can consume up to 10 W at full speed. In this way by limiting the fluctuations of temperature on the storage elements , the lifespan of these storage elements  can be lengthened significantly. Furthermore the control board  optionally is also able to assess the rotation speed of the fans .","According to the invention the control board  can receive a parameter for setting one or more predetermined allowable temperature ranges through said serial port  from said controller node . Such an allowable temperature range could for example be a range from 30\u00b0 C. to 50\u00b0 C., or any suitable range for operating the storage elements  within the storage node . These allowable temperature ranges could can also be differentiated for each of the individual temperature sensors , , . The allowable temperature range for the inlet temperature sensor  could for example be lower than that for the outlet temperature sensor . Depending on the position, type and usage of the storage element  within the storage node  also the allowable temperature ranges for each of their associated temperature sensors  could be suitably chosen. The control board  will then control the speed of the fans  such that these measurements of temperatures remain within said predetermined allowable temperature ranges. Also here depending on the position of the fans  the control board can differentiate the speed of the fans  in order to achieve this goal. In this way not only the amount of air flow can be regulated, but also the distribution of the airflow within the storage node . In this way, for example the airflow can not only be increased, but can also be more efficiently directed to a specific storage element under heavy load of which the temperature is rising. In this way the control board  will allow for a more energy efficient operation of the fans  which will allow to reduce the overall power consumption of the storage node .","If however one or more of the measured temperatures would rise above or below its associated allowable temperature range the control board will send a signal through the serial port  to the controller node  for indicating that the measurements of temperatures lies outside the predetermined allowable temperature ranges.","This mode of operation in which only the parameters for the allowable temperature ranges and the warning signals for temperatures not within the allowable temperature ranges are to be communicated over the serial bus allow for the distributed object storage system  to be scaled up without affecting the performance of the temperature control and the power consumption of the storage nodes  without any compromise on the level of flexibility for monitoring and adapting the operation of the storage nodes  in this respect.","According to a further embodiment wherein the control board  is able to monitor the speed of the fans , the control board  can be configured by means of setting a predetermined allowable fan speed range in which the control board is allowed to operate the fans. This fan speed range can be chosen so that the power consumption of the fans is limited during operation of the storage node and their operational life is extended. Preferable the parameter for setting one or more of these predetermined allowable fan speed ranges, which optionally may be differentiated for each fan, is received as a parameter through said serial port  from said controller node . If one of the fans needs to be operated outside of its allowable fan speed range, for example because a storage element  risks being operated outside its allowable temperature range, then the control board  will send a signal through said serial port  for indicating that this fan speed measurement lies outside the predetermined allowable fan speed range to the controller node .","According to an embodiment of the invention the design of the power supply  of the storage nodes  allows the storage elements  to be individually put in idle power mode or even completely powered down. This functionality allows to carefully manage the power consumption of a storage node  by putting specific storage elements  in idle or by cutting power to specific storage elements . This can lead to a radical reduction in power consumption. Each storage element typically consumes 5-10 W of power. For an embodiment of a storage node  with then storage elements  in its chassis, this means a power consumption of less than 140 W under full load. Powering down these storage elements  will reduce the power consumption of the storage node  by 100 W or 70%. In order to do this the power supply  is connected to the control board  and the control board can be configured with a parameter for controlling the switching on or off of the storage elements  through the serial port  from the controller node . Additionally the control board  will send a signal through the serial port  for indicating which of said storage elements  is switched on or off to the controller node . In this way the status of the storage elements  can be assessed without activating them, which in the case of hard disks means without spinning them up, which limits power consumption of the storage node  and extends the life span of the storage elements .","Traditional computers and storage systems contain power supplies that are typically over-dimensioned to resist power surges, specifically while powering on the system or at occasional peak loads. Because of that, the load on the power supply is typically 50% or less of the specified maximum load of the power supply.","According to a still further optimized embodiment of the invention there are provided storage nodes  which avoid power surges and load the power supply  close to its specified maximum power delivery. In order to avoid a current surge at startup, the control board  can be configured by means of setting a parameter to instruct the power supply  to power on the storage elements  sequentially or in sequential groups, allowing them to spin up sequentially instead of all at once which will limit the power surge during startup. Optionally this parameter for controlling the switching on or off of the storage elements  configures the control board  to instruct the power supply  to execute the powering up or down of said storage elements  in function of said temperature measurements and said allowable temperature ranges. This allows for example to switch off storage elements  that get too hot and switching them back on when they have sufficiently cooled down.","The benefit of dimensioning the power supply  smaller to load it closer to its maximum specified load is that modern power supplies work most efficiently when they are loaded close to their specified maximum power delivery. There is thus less unnecessary power dissipation, resulting in a more optimal power usage.","The additional benefit is that in the storage node , the power supply  is dimensioned to deliver just about enough power to power all components. Which results in a reduction in cost of the power supply and typically also in a reduction of the size of the power supply.","Most traditional storage controllers use high speed CPU's which consume in the order of 70-100 W. However according to an embodiment of the invention the storage nodes  comprise a low power CPU  and combines this with distributing the load over a large number of storage nodes . Typical CPU's that can be used are for example Intel's Atom processor, ARM (Acorn RISK Machine) processors, or equivalent low power CPU's that typically consume power below 15 W. The direct benefit of using a low power CPU is the reduction in power consumption per storage node , and per TB usable capacity. The additional benefit of using a low power CPU is that the CPU can be cooled using a passive cooling heatsink, without a fan. By positioning this heatsink with its fins in the airflow generated by the fans  of the storage node , it will be able to dissipate its heat to the back of the storage node . While not having a fan on the heatsink reduces power consumption and enhances the reliability of the storage node .","Typical storage systems have hot swap storage elements that are front or back accessible. This is because a storage element failure in a traditional storage system requires immediate attention. In a distributed object storage system according to the invention however, the failure of a storage element is managed by the encoding technology of the controller node  or the storage nodes  as explained above. Therefore, storage elements  do not need to be replaced immediately. It might even decide to keep using a storage node  of the distributed object storage system  even when one or more of the storage elements  have failed.","According to a further embodiment of the distributed object storage system according to the invention, the storage elements  are not front mounted, but rather they are mounted fixed in the inside of the chassis of the storage node  to make maximum usage of the available space in the chassis. This results in the benefit that extremely high density is achieved for the storage system. For example ten standard 3.5\u2033 storage elements can be mounted in a single 1U (one industry standard rack unit) storage node  of one rack depth.","As explained above the controller node  of the distributed object storage system  that is connected to the storage nodes  by means of said serial bus  as explained above will send parameters for setting said predetermined allowable temperature ranges to the controller boards  of the respective storage nodes and receive said signals for indicating that one or more of the measurements of temperatures lies outside said predetermined allowable temperature ranges from these controller boards . Preferably it is also able to send parameters for setting one or more predetermined allowable fan speed ranges to these control boards ; and receive signals for indicating that one or more of said fan speed measurements lies outside their predetermined allowable fan speed ranges. Further it is also beneficial if it can send parameters for controlling the switching on or off of specific storage elements  of the storage node; and receive signals for indicating which of the storage elements  is switched on or off. This will then enable the distributed object storage system  by means of its spreading module  to control continuation or discontinuation of usage of one or more of the storage elements  on the basis of these signals. According to one example a storage element  could be discontinued from usage is if for example its signal for indicating that its measurement of temperatures lies outside its predetermined allowable temperature ranges. According to a further example the usage of a storage element  could be continued if for example its signal for indicating if it is switched on indicates it is switched on. All of this can be accomplished in a scalable manner as the control board  of each storage node  will continuously and with low latency check the status of the storage node  and only send signals to the controller node  when necessary.","Traditional storage systems with RAID protection technologies require all storage elements to be spinning at all times. This results in a constant high power consumption, even when the data on the storage elements is not frequently accessed. The above mentioned configuration allows the distributed object storage system  to assess which of the storage elements  needs to be available at any time. Similarly, the distributed object storage system  incorporates the flexibility to determine automatically which storage element can be powered off, e.g. for storage elements that only store redundant data, or storage elements that contain rarely used data.","If these control measures would not be sufficient to avoid extreme temperature fluctuations, then these temperature measurements can give a good indication about which storage elements would potentially fail first. The distributed object storage system according to the invention can then benefit from this information as it can take precautions to for example increase the reliability policy for the data that is stored on this storage element , or even more radically; discontinue using the storage element before it actually breaks down as explained above.","According to still a further embodiment the distributed object storage system  by means of its spreading module  will enable to adapt the selection of said storage elements  in order to distribute the storage load across the storage elements  on the basis of the signals for indicating that one or more of the measurements of temperatures lies outside the predetermined allowable ranges and\/or the signals for indicating which of the storage elements  is switched on or off. In this way the spreading module  will be able to adapt is spreading policy for selecting suitable storage elements  to a number of possible scenarios in a scalable way in order to for example reduce power consumption or robustness of the distributed object storage system  as a whole or of one or more specific storage elements  by regulating and distributing the data load. According to one scenario the spreading policy could be set to balance the storage load evenly over a as many storage nodes  as possible in order to keep the power consumption of the fans within control, but according to an alternative scenario the spreading policy could be set to keep as many storage elements  that are in the switched off state in this switched off state.","Although the present invention has been illustrated by reference to specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the details of the foregoing illustrative embodiments, and that the present invention may be embodied with various changes and modifications without departing from the scope thereof.
