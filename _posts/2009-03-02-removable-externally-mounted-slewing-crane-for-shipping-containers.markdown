title: Removable externally mounted slewing crane for shipping containers
abstract: A slewing crane is assembled and installed at the end of a shipping and stowage container having block-shaped corner fittings. Left and right rotatable mounts engage top corner fittings on the container, and a cross piece section engages the rotatable mounts. A boom section has upper and lower hinges rotatably mounting it on the cross piece section via the hinges' axially aligned pins to extend outwardly from the cross piece section. A hoist on the boom section lifts and moves loads, and first and second displacement mechanisms connected to the boom section linearly displace the hoist and angularly displace the hoist and boom section in a slewing motion around the axis of the axially aligned pins. An element connected between the cross piece section and a corner fitting is tensioned by a turnbuckle to securely engage both rotatable mounts and hold the slewing crane on the container.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a crane mounted on a shipping and stowage container. More particularly, this invention is for a slewing crane secured to the end of a shipping and stowage container utilizing powered and\/or manual force for lifting\/lowering loads, extending\/retracting the loads and swinging or slewing the loads in the horizontal plane.","Containers are widely used in air, sea and land transport of goods since they keep many items together as a lot and protect them from damage during the haul. Large transport, vehicles can carry rows and columns of the containers that can rest singly or in stacks on decks and\/or pallets.","The great majority of shipping and stowage containers in commercial air and maritime commerce have evolved into a standard design. The standard established by ISO 1161 requirements by the International Organization for Standardization defines containers of standardized dimensions and ruggedness to promote efficiency and safety for air and maritime use. The ISO 1161 containers are robustly constructed with rigid side walls mounted on strong frameworks that have a heavy-duty block-shaped corner fitting at each of the containers' eight corners. The corner fittings and other parts of an ISO 1161 container can be made of steel, aluminum or other tough material.","The ISO block-shaped corner fittings have outward facing elongated openings sized to receive appropriately dimensioned heavy-duty rotatable bayonet portions of standard single or double-cone twist-lock fittings. When a cone-shaped bayonet portion of a single or double-cone twist lock fitting is inserted through an opening and into an ISO 1161 corner fitting, the inserted portion is manually rotated a partial turn via an attached small twist-lock lever. This rotation of the inserted bayonet portion securely engages the twist-lock fitting to the block-shaped corner fitting, and when the other cone-shaped bayonet portion of the double-cone twist lock fitting is inserted through an opening and into a piece that needs to be interconnected, the other inserted portion is manually rotated a partial turn via an attached small twist-lock lever to secure the piece to the container. A considerable number of ISO 1161 corner fittings and interfacing standard single or double-cone twist-lock fittings are well known and commercially available.","Frequently, the need arises for strong lifting mechanisms at containers to help in the performance of work tasks in the area adjacent the containers or to help load or unload some goods to or from containers through one of their several closable openings. Currently, readily affixed mechanisms that are specifically designed for lifting\/relocating items at the containers are not known. Typically, external non-fixed lifting equipment must be brought to the work site at the ends of shipping and stowage containers and there utilized to lift\/move things. When such non-fixed lifting equipments are available on ships at sea, ship motions may make the use of such forklifts or portable hoists impractical and\/or unsafe. In addition, some stowage compartments and holds on ships may have insufficient overhead clearance and\/or capacity to mount an adequate lifting device to lift loads at the ends of the containers. Cranes potentially can be mounted internally in the shipping and stowage containers, but internally mounted cranes cannot slew the load past the plane projecting out from the vertical side wall of the container. Another limitation of internally mounting cranes in the containers is that they will consume too much valuable space inside the containers and compromise the amount of material that can be stowed and shipped. In addition, these internally mounted cranes can be fixed in size and may not be easily removable or further erectable to accommodate different sized containers.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a slewing crane externally mounted on a shipping and stowage container utilizing powered and\/or manual force for lifting\/lowering loads, extending\/retracting the loads and swinging or slewing the loads in the horizontal plane.","The present invention provides a slewing crane assembled and installed at the end of a shipping and stowage container having block-shaped corner fittings on top corners. Left and right rotatable mounts engage top corner fittings on the container, and a cross piece section engages the rotatable mounts. A boom section has upper and lower hinges and is rotatably mounted on the cross piece section via axially aligned pins of the hinges to radially extend outwardly from the cross piece section. A hoist on the boom section lifts and moves loads, and first and second displacement mechanisms connected to the boom section linearly displace the hoist and angularly displace the hoist and boom section in a slewing motion around the axis of the axially aligned pins. A rod connected to the cross piece section is tensioned by a turnbuckle to securely engage both rotatable mounts to hold the slewing crane on the container and to compensate for loads supported by the hoist. The first and second displacement mechanisms include first and second chainfalls mounted on a boom-track member of the boom section. The first chainfall has an elongate threaded bolt shaped to engage a correspondingly threaded nut connected to the hoist on the boom-track member to linearly displace the hoist along the length of the boom-track member, and the second chainfall has an elongate threaded bolt on the cross piece section and the boom section shaped to engage a correspondingly threaded nut on the diagonal brace member of the boom section to angularly displace the hoist in an angular or rotational slewing motion around the axis defined by the axially aligned pins in an essentially horizontal plane at the end of the container.","An object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane secured to the end of a shipping and stowage container for supporting and moving loads.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane quickly secured to a shipping and stowage container to lift and displace loads.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane installed and secured to the end of a container in sections without requiring any ancillary heavy-lifting equipment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane readily connectable to the ends of single or stacked shipping containers for lifting and moving loads.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane quickly and securely coupled to a shipping container by workmen to lift and move loads by powered and\/or manual force.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane quickly secured to a shipping container with standard interfacing hardware to suspend and move loads in the area adjacent the container.","Another object of the invention is to provide a slewing crane quickly secured to a shipping container with standard interfaces and interfacing hardware and utilizing powered and\/or manual force for lifting\/lowering loads, extending\/retracting the loads and swinging or slewing the loads in the horizontal plane.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Referring to , slewing crane  of the invention is mounted at one end of a commercial shipping and stowage container A by its cross piece section  to position and support its boom section  at the container's end. Container A, an ISO 1161 shipping and stowage container for example, has a well known heavy-duty ISO block-shaped corner fitting B at each of the containers' eight corners, and each corner fitting B has an upward facing opening C as well as laterally aligned side openings D.","Slewing crane  of the invention is quickly assembled and securely attached to the upper ISO block-shaped corner fittings B and B at the end of container A by cross piece section  interfacing with upward facing openings C that each communicate with a hollow interior E of each corner fitting. Goods are transferred through doors F located on the sides and\/or at ends of container A, end door F is shown closed in the FIGS. Slewing crane  can add, remove, and relocate goods in container A, and is also useful to support goods and\/or other work-pieces at the right height and\/or lateral\/longitudinal position for further work or processing adjacent-to the container's end.","The structural components of cross piece section , boom section  and other parts to be described can be made from appropriately dimensioned solid or tubular aluminum, steel or other strong lightweight natural or man-made stock and\/or materials selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to safely bear the expected loads and survive the harsh ambient conditions. In addition, the components of slewing crane  have been designed and made to be readily carried and installed on a designated container A by relatively unskilled workmen.","Referring also to , cross piece section  of slewing crane  includes a diagonal component  interconnected via a articulative joint  to a vertical component , see also . Diagonal component  and vertical component  are respectively connected to a separate one of top block-shaped corner fittings B and B by left and right rotatable mounts  and . Rotatable mounts  and  are shown in  in the rotated-open position about hinge pins  and . This rotated open position occurs as slewing crane is being installed on container A and cross piece section  has just been attached to corner fittings B and B. Rotatable mounts  and  are shown in  in the rotated-closed position about hinge pins  and  after installation and mounting of slewing crane  on container A has been completed.","Referring also to , after installation of slewing crane  on container A, it is securely held in place on fittings B and B by a tensioned elongate rigid structural element  such as a rod or cable. Rigid element  is connected at one end to a pad eye  at the upper end of vertical component  of  cross piece section  and is connected at its other end to a block-shaped corner fitting B at the rear of container A via any of a number of commercially available single twist or cam lock fittings or mount  similar to left and right mounts  and . Rigid element  not only secures cross piece section  of slewing crane  to container A but also functions to counteract or neutralize the torque created by the weight of slewing crane  and supported loads. A turnbuckle device  can be included to assure that sufficient tension is exerted in rigid element  to securely engage left and right mounts  and  in corner fittings B and B and hold components of slewing crane  on container A.","Mount  of  is exemplary and representative of mounts ,  and  and will now be described in more detail. Mount  is shown separated from diagonal component  of cross piece section  and rotated 180\u00b0 about its vertical axis to better show details of this exemplary design. It is understood that having the disclosure of slewing crane  of the invention in mind, other configurations of other mounts using these and other mechanical coactions could be made and used by one of ordinary skill within the scope of this invention.","Mount  has a relatively flat upper portion  having upward extensions  provided with aligned bores that slideably guide an elongate pin  through them when it is axially displaced by an attached handle . When a lateral bore  of diagonal component  is interposed between and aligned with the aligned bores in upward extensions  of mount , displacement of elongate pin  by handle  through bored upward extensions  permits selective engagement and disengagement of diagonal component  by mount .","Upper portion  of mount  has a lateral ridge  and hold-down bolt  to fit into and be accommodated by a mating groove  and recess  in a lower portion  of mount  when upper portion  is rotated about hinge pin  onto lower portion  to the closed position shown in . A downward projecting block  integrally extending from lower portion  is sized to be fitted through upward facing opening C to extend into hollow interior E of corner fitting B. A lateral pin  can be inserted through a lateral hole  in block  and through a side opening D of corner fitting B by a handle  to selectably laterally extend through and across integral block  and through laterally aligned side openings (only one of which D being shown) in corner fitting B. This engagement of the upper edge of side opening D by lateral pin  secures mount  in corner fitting B.","When upper portion  has been rotated to the closed position and rigid element rod  is connected and tensioned, the tension exerted by element  securely holds mount  shut. Being held shut by element  and the mating co-action of the mating parts of upper and lower portions  and  and integral block , lateral pin  and corner fitting B, diagonal component  of cross piece section  and the rest of mount  are secured in both the vertical and horizontal directions.","Referring also to , mount  is made and operates much the same as mount  with the exception that mount  does not have upward extensions . Instead upper portion A of mount  is welded to the base  of vertical component  of cross piece section  and lower portion of mount  has its lower portion A and associated structure engaging corner fitting B via a lateral pin connected to handle . Mount  and mount  can rotate about their hinge pins  and  from the open position shown in  during installation of slewing crane  on container A to the closed position as shown in . Rigid element  can then be connected and tensioned to hold cross piece section  in a vertical upright orientation and extend boom section  outwardly in a horizontal direction from the upper edge of the container.","Boom section  has a diagonal brace member  connected to a boom-track member  by three cross-brace members ,  and , as shown in . These members are arranged and secured in an essentially triangularly-shaped form that has upper and lower hinges  and  to rotatably couple cross piece section  and boom section  together. Hinge portions  and  of hinges  and  on vertical component  are rotatably joined via axially aligned hinge pins  and  to mating upper and lower hinge portions  and  on diagonal brace member  and boom-track member . This hinged interconnection allows boom section  to rotatably or angularly slew about the axis of aligned hinge pins  and  at vertical component  in an essentially horizontal plane at the end of the container.","Boom-track member  of boom section  receives and supports a hoist  for engaging, raising, lowering and moving loads engaged by its hook . Hoist  is shaped to travel and be supported along the length of boom-track member  in radially outward and inward excursions. Hoist  has appropriately interconnected and operator-controllable electric motor\/pneumatic\/hydraulic\/manual means to effect raising and lowering of loads on hook  by a workman at the work site.","Hoist  can be a well known commercially available powered unit connectable to an electrical power source and operated by a relatively untrained workman. A typical hoist unit that could be used is a Model 3505 Lodestar Electric Two-Speed 1 Ton Hoist coupled with a Model 3677 Suspension and Model 3575 Low Headroom Trolley, all manufactured by Columbus McKinnon Corporation, 140 John James Parkway, Amherst, N.J. 14228, to raise, support and lower loads. Other readily available models could be selected depending on the expected loads, power availabilities, and other considerations of the work site.","A first chainfall  is mounted on the outer end of boom-track member  and allows a workman to selectively displace hoist  in inward\/outward displacements along boom-track member . Chainfall  displaces hoist  by any of a number of well known mechanical linkages. For example, a rotatable first elongate threaded rod  also known as an acme screw is supported in a journal (not shown) at its inner end and extends the length of member  to threadably engage a correspondingly threaded acme screw nut  connected to hoist . Selectively bidirectionally rotating first chainfall  connected to rod  displaces hoist  in responsive linear directions on boom-track member  to bidirectionally displace a load hanging on hook .","A second chainfall  is connected to a second rotatable elongate threaded rod  supported at its inner end in a journal mount  on diagonal component  of cross piece section  that supports and permits rotation of rod . Threaded rod  threadably engages a correspondingly threaded acme screw nut  secured to diagonal brace member . Selectively bidirectionally rotating second chainfall  connected to rod  engaging nut , angularly displaces boom section  including hoist  and any attached loads in responsive rotational angular displacements about the vertical axis of aligned hinge pins  and  of hinges  and .","The structures associated with first and second chainfalls  and  for linearly displacing hoist  and angularly displacing boom section  are only exemplary of a number of well known means for effecting such linear and angular displacements from rotational displacements of chainfalls  and . It is in the purview of one of ordinary skill to select other effective mechanical arrangements that may include small controlled motor-driven mechanisms and other appropriately interconnected and operator-controllable electric motor\/pneumatic\/hydraulic\/manual mechanisms\/assemblies to effect bidirectional displacements of hoist  on boom-track member  and angular displacements of member .","Slewing crane  of the invention can be expediently assembled and installed at the end of container A without any elaborate, propelled heavy-lifting equipment by relatively unskilled workmen to enable quick, efficient loading or unloading of goods at the container. Assembly and installation of slewing crane  requires no other power machinery and it can be installed in sections to reduce the overall weight and size of hardware that needs to be moved at any given time.","Slewing crane  can be assembled at the work site adjacent container A from all the component parts described above. However, complete assembly at a work site may not be efficient and take too much time when quick transfer of goods is needed. One of the salient features of slewing crane  is that its cross piece section  and boom section  can be individually preassembled at a centralized workshop, held in inventory until needed, and brought to the work site for final assembly and installation on a container. A further option is that the components of cross piece section  and boom section  can be pre-assembled in other combinations, or they could be brought as separate pieces or smaller subassemblies for ease of transport to the work site and final assembly can be completed there.","During installation of slewing crane  on container A, cross piece section  is carried to the end of container A, raised to the top of the container by workmen, and mounts  and  are inserted into and connected to upper block-shaped corner fittings B and B, see . Cross piece section  extends rotated about mounts  and  with hinge portions  and  of upper and lower hinges  and  facing downward, see . Boom section  is brought by workmen near the end of container A, and since hoist  is likely to be the heaviest component, it is placed at the outer end of boom-track member  to rest on the ground, see . Now, the workmen pick up boom section , mating hinge portions  and  of hinges  and  are maneuvered to align with hinge portions  and , and hinge pins  and  are inserted to rotatably couple cross-piece section  and boom sections  together, also see .","Referring also to  a cable  extends from a hand-powered winch  that can be mounted on a solid anchoring footing adjacent the other end of container A, or hand-powered winch  might be mounted adjacent block-shaped corner fitting B at the other end of container A, see . Cable  from hand winch  is connected to diagonal component . Rotation of hand winch  by the workmen tensions cable  to rotate and raise cross piece section  and boom section  of slewing crane  about hinge pins  and  of mounts  and  to the upright rigid position shown in . Now, element  is connected to corner fitting B and pad eye  on vertical component  of cross piece , and turnbuckle device  is rotated to match or exceed the tension of cable  so that cable  can be disconnected from diagonal component . Slewing crane  is now ready to perform loading and unloading of goods for container A and the tension in element  can be increased to compensate for loads connected to hoist  by further tightening turnbuckle device .","Loads on hoist  can be linearly extended from and retracted to container by selective rotation of first chainfall  and loads on hoist  can be angularly rotated or moved from one side to another by selective rotation of second chainfall  or a combination of rotations from both chainfalls  and  can be utilized to precisely engage and move goods to selected positions at the end of container A. Movement by chainfalls  and  need not be restricted to the acme screw-nuts, gear driven wheels, or other manually operated mechanisms and one skilled in the art could use many well known controllable motor-driven powered subassemblies for moving hoist  as desired.","All components of slewing crane  of the invention can be made from a wide variety of tough non-corrosive or corrosion resistant materials to survive in harsh environments where containers A are used. Modifications and alternate embodiments of slewing crane  of the invention may be adapted for other containers. In addition to the highly functional crane structure described, slewing crane  of the invention could have different shapes, sizes and materials to create other user-friendly lifting structures.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Slewing crane  of the invention gives relatively unskilled workmen the capability to effectively load and unload standardized containers in confining storage areas. Therefore, slewing crane  of the invention, as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
