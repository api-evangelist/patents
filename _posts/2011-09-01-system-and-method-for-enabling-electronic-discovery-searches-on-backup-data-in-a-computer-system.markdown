{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of computer storage systems, and more particularly, to a system and method for implementing electronic discovery searches on backup data or archived data.","2. Description of the Related Art","Many civil litigation and investigative procedures require attorneys and paralegals to find and preserve electronic information relevant to the litigation. The process of finding, preserving, and analyzing electronic information as required by litigation or investigation is referred to as electronic discovery, or e-Discovery. E-Discovery often requires the legal team to search an organization's backup or archive storage systems to find archived information relevant to the case. Once the files are found the legal team may then evaluate them and place a legal hold on the ones that are deemed to be relevant to the investigation.","A large organization can have hundreds or thousands of computer users, and enormous amounts of backup data or archived data. The process of performing an e-Discovery search to find the relevant files from the organization's backup data can be difficult to implement.","Various embodiments of a system, method and computer-accessible storage medium for enabling electronic discovery (e-Discovery) searches to be performed on backup data in a computer system are disclosed. The backup data may need to be searched to find data files relevant to a legal proceeding or investigation. As one example, legal team members may need to perform a search on the backup data to find all the files that were accessed, modified, created, owned or deleted by a particular user or group of users during a particular time period. Embodiments of the system and method described herein are generally directed to enabling the relevant files to be found in the backup data.","According to one embodiment, a computer-accessible storage medium may store program instructions executable by one or more processors to receive backup data from a file server computer. The backup data may include file data for a plurality of files on the file server computer. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to receive event data specifying file access event history on the file server, and to create e-Discovery mapping information for the backup data using the event data. The e-Discovery mapping information may map file access events specified by the event data to respective file data in the backup data, which may enable e-Discovery searches to be performed on the backup data. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to store the e-Discovery mapping information on a storage device.","In some embodiments, each of the file access events in the event data may specify that a respective file was accessed by a respective user at a respective time. The e-Discovery mapping information may map each file access event for a respective file to the file data for the respective file in the backup data.","In some embodiments the event data may include a first file access event and a second file access event for a particular file. The first file access event may specify that the particular file was accessed by a first user at a first time. The second file access event may specify that the particular file was accessed by a second user at a second time. The e-Discovery mapping information may map both the first file access event and the second file access event to the file data for the particular file in the backup data.","In some embodiments the program instructions may be further executable to receive backup catalog information for the backup data. The backup catalog information may specify data locations of the file data for the plurality of files within the backup data. The e-Discovery mapping information may map the file access events specified by the event data to the data locations specified by the backup catalog information.","According to another embodiment, a computer-accessible storage medium may store program instructions executable by one or more processors to store backup data received from a file server computer. The backup data may include file data for a plurality of files on the file server computer. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to store backup catalog information for the backup data. The backup catalog information may specify data locations of the file data for the plurality of files within the backup data. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to store event data specifying file access event history on the file server. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to receive user input specifying an e-Discovery search query to perform on the backup data, and to match the search query to a plurality of file access events specified in the event data. Each of the matching file access events may correspond to a respective file. The program instructions may be further executable by the one or more processors to determine data locations within the backup data for the file data of the files corresponding to the matching file access events. The data locations may be specified by the backup catalog information. In further embodiment the program instructions may also be executable by the one or more processors to display information on a display device indicating the files corresponding to the matching file access events.","While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments are shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however, that drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.","Various embodiments of a system and method for enabling electronic discovery (e-Discovery) searches to be performed on backup data in a computer system are disclosed. The backup data may need to be searched to find data files relevant to a legal proceeding or investigation. As one example, legal team members may need to perform a search on the backup data to find all the files that were accessed, modified, created, owned or deleted by a particular user or group of users during a particular time period. Once these files have been identified, the legal team members may evaluate the files and possibly place a legal hold on them.","Embodiments of the system and method described herein are generally directed to enabling the relevant files to be found in the backup data. The backup data may be any kind of backup data, backup image, or data archive created by a backup or archiving software application. Large organizations often have computer systems that use file server computers that store files used by many different users, e.g., where the users access the files through a network from client computers. A backup application may execute to periodically create backup data from the file server computer.","The backup application may create either full backups or incremental backups of the data on the file server computer. A full backup may be a complete representation of a set of files, a storage device, or a data volume on the file server computer as it exists at the time the full backup is created. For example, a full backup may include all of the data of all of the files on a storage device or volume being backed up. Thus, a full backup may be an independent backup that does not depend on any other backup. An incremental backup is a backup that depends on, or is relative to, another backup, e.g., an incremental backup that represents the data that has changed since a previous backup was created. An incremental backup may depend on a full backup (e.g., may represent the data changes that have occurred since the full backup was created) or may depend on another incremental backup (e.g., may represent the data changes that have occurred since the other incremental backup was created). An incremental backup may include the data that has changed since the time when the (full or incremental) backup on which it depends was created, and may not include data that has not changed since the time when the backup on which it depends was created.","In addition to creating the backup data itself (the actual data of the files being backed up from the file server computer), a backup application may also create meta-data describing the backup data, e.g., backup catalog information. The backup catalog information may be used, for example, in the event that the backup data needs to be restored at a later point in time. The backup catalog information may specify the names of the files included in the backup data, the data locations of the file data stored within the backup data, and possibly other information such as the owner of each file. However, the backup catalog information created by conventional backup applications typically does not include sufficient information to enable thorough e-Discovery searches to be performed on the backup data. For example, if a particular file in the backup data was originally created by a user \u201cJohn Smith\u201d then the backup catalog information may indicate that \u201cJohn Smith\u201d is the owner of the file. Users other than \u201cJohn Smith\u201d may have accessed or modified the file, and it may be necessary to discover this fact during an e-Discovery search. However, while the backup catalog information created by conventional backup applications may specify which files are owned by which users, the backup catalog information may not specify which files were accessed (e.g., during read accesses) or modified (e.g., during write accesses) by which users. Also, the catalog information may not specify files that were deleted by users, which may be another important piece of information that needs to be discovered in an e-Discovery search.","Other aspects of the backup data or catalog information created by conventional backup applications may further complicate the use of the catalog information to perform e-Discovery searches. For example, rather than the user's real name or username, the backup catalog information may list the owner of a given file as the user's login ID, which may be different from the user's username. A legal team member performing an e-Discovery search may not know the login ID for a user of interest. As another example, the backup catalog information may list the owner of a given file as the user's SID (Security Identifier), which again may be different from the user's username. Also, some files may be owned by a group instead of a particular user. For example, the backup catalog information may indicate that a file is owned by an Administrators group. A particular user \u201cJane Doe\u201d may be a member of the Administrators group, but the backup catalog information may not explicitly associate the file with \u201cJane Doe\u201d. Thus, if the backup catalog information is used for an e-Discovery search to find the files owned by \u201cJane Doe\u201d then this file may not be found.","Embodiments of the system and method disclosed herein may overcome various problems described above by using additional information to perform e-Discovery searches in conjunction with the backup catalog information created by a backup application.  illustrates one embodiment of the system. The system includes client computers A-C coupled by a network A to a file server computer . The file server computer  may execute file system software  which manages user data files  in response to software applications executing on the client computers A-C to create new files, read or modify existing files, delete files, etc. A particular user may be logged in on each of the client computers , and thus each of these file access events may be associated with a particular user.","The file server computer  may be configured to execute file server monitoring software  which monitors the file activity to detect the file access events and store event data  logging the events. For example, when a particular user (e.g., software application executing on the user's behalf) accesses a file in order to read the file, the file server monitoring software  may store file access event information in the event data  indicating the file that was accessed, which user accessed the file, the type of access (e.g., read access), and the time the access was performed. Similarly, when users perform other types of file accesses, such as creating new files, modifying (e.g., writing data to) files, or deleting files, the file server monitoring software  may store file access event information in the event data  indicating which file was accessed, which user accessed the file, the type of access, and the time the access was performed. In some embodiments the file server monitoring software  may also store other information, such as the particular software application that requested the access, and the particular client computer from which the access was requested.","The system may also include one or more backup server computers  coupled to the file server computer  via a network B. The backup server computer(s)  may execute server-side backup software  that communicates with client-side backup software  executing on the file server computer  to backup the user files  to the backup server computer  in the form of backup data . The backup data  may include full backups and\/or incremental backups of the user files . For example, the backup software may be configured with a backup policy specifying that a full backup should be performed once a week, with incremental backups being performed at the end of each day, or another desired time schedule. In addition to the backup data , the server-side backup software  may also create respective backup catalog information  for each backup data set which specifies meta-data for the backup data set, such as the names of the files included in the backup data set, the owners of the files, and the data locations of the data for each file.","According to some embodiments, each time a new backup operation is performed to create a respective set of backup data and corresponding backup catalog information, the backup server computer  may also receive corresponding event data  from the file server computer . For example, the backup server computer  may query the file server monitoring software  or other software on the file server computer  at the time of the backup operation or after the backup operation is finished to request information specifying the file access events that occurred since the previous set of backup data was created. Thus, for example, if an incremental backup operation is performed at the end of each day then the backup server computer  may communicate with the file server computer  (or another computer where the event data  is stored) to retrieve the event data specifying all the file access events that occurred since the time when the previous backup data set was created on the previous day.","In some embodiments, at the time each backup operation is performed, the backup-server computer  may create e-Discovery mapping information  using the backup catalog information  and the corresponding event data . The e-Discovery mapping information  may map the file access events specified by the event data  to the respective file data in the backup data , e.g., where the data locations of the file data are determined from the backup catalog information . For example, for each file access event in the event data  specifying that a particular user accessed, modified, or created a particular file at a particular time, the e-Discovery mapping information  may map that file access event to the meta-data for the file specified by the backup catalog information , e.g., map the file access event to the name of the file and the location of the data for that file within the backup data .","The e-Discovery mapping information  created during a respective backup operation may enable subsequent e-Discovery searches to be performed on the backup data  that was created during the backup operation. In some embodiments the backup server computer  may be configured to execute e-Discovery software  which is operable to use the e-Discovery mapping information  to perform e-Discovery searches on the backup data . For example, the e-Discovery software  may display a graphical user interface enabling a legal team member or other user to enter a search query requesting to find all the files accessed by a particular user or group of users during a particular time period. In response to the search query, the e-Discovery software  may determine which sets of backup data  correspond to the specified time period, and may then search the e-Discovery mapping information  corresponding to this backup data to match the search query to various file access events specified in the e-Discovery mapping information, e.g., by finding all the file access events associated with the specified user(s). For each file access event that matched the search query, the e-Discovery software  may then determine information about the corresponding file, such as the file name and the data locations of the file's data in the backup data . The file names may be displayed to the user of the e-Discovery software . The e-Discovery software  may also perform further actions, such as extracting the file data of the files corresponding to the matching file access events from the backup data , and storing copies of the files, which the user of the e-Discovery software  may then browse. The user may also request the e-Discovery software  to place a legal hold on the files. In response to such a request, the e-Discovery software  may modify properties of the extracted files or properties of the backup data  to prevent the files or the backup data set from being expired or deleted so that the files will remain available for a legal proceeding or investigation.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":"550"},"Also, the server-side backup software  and the e-Discovery software  may be different software applications that work in conjunction with each other, or may be different modules of the same software application. The functions of creating the e-Discovery mapping information  may be performed by the server-side backup software  in some embodiments. In some embodiments the e-Discovery software  or the server-side backup software  may use a third-party indexing service that indexes the e-Discovery mapping information  so that it can be efficiently searched.","In some embodiments the e-Discovery mapping information  created by the e-Discovery software  or the server-side backup software  may be kept separate from the backup catalog information . In other embodiments the e-Discovery mapping information  may be created by directly modifying the backup catalog information , e.g., by adding information specified by the event data  directly to the backup catalog information .","The file server computer  may be any kind of file server computer or computer system specialized for hosting user files. Examples of file server computers include NetApp\u00ae filers, EMC Corp. file servers, and SharePoint\u00ae computers. The functions performed by the file server monitoring software  may be implemented in various ways. In some embodiments the file server computer  may provide an application programming interface (API) that enables third-party monitoring software to register for and monitor various file access events, or the vendor of the file server computer  may provide software that can monitor the file access events. In various embodiments the event data  created by the file server monitoring software  may be stored in any desired location or storage device. In some embodiments the event data  may be stored on a same storage device where the user files  are stored, e.g., in a database. In other embodiments the event data  may be stored on a different storage device, e.g., one that is directly coupled to the file server computer  through a communication bus, or one that is coupled to the file server computer  through a storage area network (SAN) or other network.","In various embodiments there may be any number of client computers , and they may connect to the file server computer  through any kind of network A. The backup server computer(s)  may also connect to the file server computer  through any kind of network B. The networks A and B may include any type of network or combination of networks. For example, the networks may include any type or combination of local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), wireless networks, an Intranet, the Internet, etc. Examples of local area networks include Ethernet networks, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks, and token ring networks. Also, computer may each be coupled to the network(s) using any type of wired or wireless connection medium. For example, wired mediums may include Ethernet, fiber channel, a modem connected to plain old telephone service (POTS), etc. Wireless connection mediums may include a wireless connection using a wireless communication protocol such as IEEE 802.11 (wireless Ethernet), a modem link through a cellular service, a satellite link, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["550","520","580","550"]},"The backup server computer  may include at least one central processing unit or CPU (processor)  which is coupled to a processor or host bus . The CPU  may be any of various types. For example, in some embodiments, the processor  may be compatible with the x86 architecture, while in other embodiments the processor  may be compatible with the SPARC\u2122 family of processors. Also, in some embodiments the backup server computer  may include multiple processors .","The backup server computer  may also include memory  in which program instructions implementing the server-side backup software  and\/or the e-Discovery software  are stored. In some embodiments the memory  may include one or more forms of random access memory (RAM) such as dynamic RAM (DRAM) or synchronous DRAM (SDRAM). In other embodiments, the memory  may include any other type of memory configured to store program instructions. The memory  may also store operating system software or other software used to control the operation of the backup server computer . The memory controller  may be configured to control the memory .","The host bus  may be coupled to an expansion or input\/output bus  by means of a bus controller  or bus bridge logic. The expansion bus  may be the PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) expansion bus, although other bus types can be used. Various devices may be coupled to the expansion or input\/output bus , such as a video display subsystem  which sends video signals to a display device, as well as one or more hard disk drives  or other storage device which stores information in a non-volatile manner. The hard disk drive(s)  or other storage device(s) may store information such as the backup data , the backup catalog information , and the e-Discovery mapping information .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4"],"b":["520","580","550"]},"In block , backup data may be received from a file server computer by the backup data module . The backup data module  may store the backup data on a disk drive or other device coupled to a backup server computer. In block , backup catalog information for the backup data may be created by the catalog module . The backup catalog information may include meta-data describing the backup data that can be used to restore the backup data at a future time, such as the name of the files included in the backup data, the locations of the data for each file in the backup data, and possibly the owner of each file.","In block , event data specifying a history of file access events on the file server computer may be received by the event module . The event module  may communicate with the file server computer from which the backup data originated to receive the event data. In block , e-Discovery mapping information for the backup data may be created by the mapping module . The e-Discovery mapping information may map the file access events specified by the event data to the respective file data in the backup data, and may enable e-Discovery searches to be performed on the backup data.","At a subsequent time, a user may perform an e-Discovery search on the backup data.

Thus, for each backup data set, respective e-Discovery mapping information may be stored in addition to the backup data and backup catalog so that it is already available at a later time in the event that an e-Discovery search needs to be performed. This may enable e-Discovery searches to be performed quickly. This may also enable the event data that specifies the file access history to be deleted after the e-Discovery mapping information is created, if the event data is not needed for other applications.","In other embodiments the e-Discovery mapping information  may not be created at the time a backup operation is done. Instead, the e-Discovery mapping information may only be created in the event that it is necessary to actually perform an e-Discovery search on the backup data. The system may save the event data that specifies the file access history to ensure that it will be available at a later time to use in response to e-Discovery searches. The event data may be stored or archived in various places, such as the file server computer, backup server computer, or another computer system. If a legal team member enters an e-Discovery search query to find files pertaining to a particular time period, then the system may lookup the backup data, backup catalog information, and the event data corresponding to that time period. The system may then dynamically use the backup catalog information and the event data to determine which files in the backup data match the user's query. In some embodiments the system may be able to use the backup catalog information and the event data directly to find the files matching the search query. For example, if the search query is to find all the files accessed by a particular user then the system may first search the event data to find the file access events pertaining to the user. The system may then search the backup catalog information to find the meta-data for the files corresponding to these file access events. The meta-data may then be used to locate the files within the backup data. In other embodiments, the system may create new mapping information at the time a search query is entered, e.g., by creating new data based on the backup catalog information and the event data, or by transforming the backup catalog information and\/or the event data. For example, the backup catalog information and the event data may be provided to an indexing service that creates new e-Discovery mapping information, and the system may then perform a search on the e-Discovery mapping information to find the files matching the search query.","Dynamically mapping the event data to the backup catalog information in response to an e-Discovery search query may mean that it takes longer to perform an e-Discovery search than if the e-Discovery search information were pre-created and pre-stored at the time of the backup operation because it can take some time to create the e-Discovery mapping information. However, in some systems, e-Discovery searches may not need to be performed often, whereas backup operations may be performed frequently. It may thus be desirable to implement the e-Discovery searches this way in order to make the backup operations more efficient by eliminating the time needed to create the e-Discovery mapping information for each backup operation.","Turning now to , a block diagram of a computer accessible storage medium  is shown. The computer accessible storage medium  may store program instructions executable by one or more processors to implement various functions described above, such as program instructions associated with the server-side backup software  and\/or the e-Discovery software . Generally, the computer accessible storage medium  may store any set of instructions which, when executed, implement a portion or all of the functions performed by one or more backup server computers  as described above.","Generally speaking, a computer accessible storage medium may include any storage media accessible by a computer during use to provide instructions and\/or data to the computer. For example, a computer accessible storage medium may include storage media such as magnetic or optical media, e.g., disk (fixed or removable), tape, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or Blu-Ray. Storage media may further include volatile or non-volatile memory media such as RAM (e.g. synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), Rambus DRAM (RDRAM), static RAM (SRAM), etc.), ROM, Flash memory, non-volatile memory (e.g. Flash memory) accessible via a peripheral interface such as the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, a flash memory interface (FMI), a serial peripheral interface (SPI), etc. Storage media may include microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), as well as storage media accessible via a communication medium such as a network and\/or a wireless link. A carrier medium may include computer accessible storage media as well as transmission media such as wired or wireless transmission.","Numerous variations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art once the above disclosure is fully appreciated.
