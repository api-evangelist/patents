Therefore, the federal government has certain rights in this invention.","This invention relates to crystals comprising apo-LsrB and holo-LsrB. The structure of holo-LsrB identifies a tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran derived from 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) as the active autoinducer-2 (AI-2) molecule in . The X-ray crystallographic data can be used in a drug discovery method. Additionally the invention provides AI-2 analogs based on this discovery as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing those analogs.","Many bacteria modulate their behavior in response to cell-cell communication in a process termed quorum sensing (Bassler, 2002). Intercellular communication is accomplished through the production, release, and detection of small signaling molecules called autoinducers. Typically, Gram-negative bacteria use acylated homoserine lactones as autoinducers, whereas Gram-positive bacteria use modified oligopeptides. In its simplest form, quorum sensing consists of the accumulation of high autoinducer concentrations at high bacterial population densities. The bacteria respond with a population-wide alteration of gene expression, allowing the community to coordinate behavior in a manner akin to cells in a multicellular organism. Quorum sensing provides a mechanism for the collective regulation of processes including biofilm formation and virulence in and , antibiotic production in , and light production in (Miller et al., 2001). In general, different bacterial species produce and respond to chemically distinct autoinducers, restricting quorum sensing to intraspecies communication.","Genetic and biochemical studies of quorum sensing in the marine bacterium led to the identification of a novel autoinducer used to control bioluminescence (Bassler et al., 1994, 1997; Chen et al., 2002; Schauder et al., 2001; Surette et al., 1999). This autoinducer signal, termed AI-2, is unusual in that it is produced by a large number of bacterial species in addition to . Furthermore, AI-2-responsive genes have been identified in a variety of bacteria (Xavier et al., 2003). Consequently, AI-2 has been proposed to serve as a \u201cuniversal\u201d quorum-sensing signal that enables interspecies communication (Schauder et al., 2001).","The enzyme LuxS, which has been identified in more than 55 Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species, is responsible for AI-2 biosynthesis (Surette et al., 1999; Xavier et al., 2003). AI-2 signals are derived from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), whose consumption as a methyl donor yields S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) (). SAH is metabolized to adenine and S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) (Cornell et al., 1998). SRH is the substrate for LuxS (Lewis et al., 2001; Schauder et al., 2001), which cleaves it to generate homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD, ).","The products of the LuxS reaction strongly stimulate light production in (Meijler et al., 2004; Schauder et al., 2001; Zhao et al., 2003). One of these products, homocysteine, has no autoinducer activity. The other product, DPD, is expected to cyclize spontaneously to form two epimeric furanoses, (2R,4S)- and (2S,4S)-2,4-dihydroxy-2-methyldihydrofuran-3-one (R- and S-DHMF, respectively; ). Hydration of R- and S-DHMF would give rise to (2R,4S)- and (2S,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R- and S-THMF, respectively; ).","Because DPD exists in equilibrium with other chemical species in solution (this work and Meijler et al., 2004), identifying the form that is active in AI-2 signaling in proved difficult. Trapping AI-2 in its receptor LuxP greatly facilitated its identification. X-ray crystallography allowed direct visualization at 1.5 \u212b resolution of the ligand bound to LuxP (Chen et al., 2002), establishing that the signal molecule is S-THF-borate (). Formation of this molecule from DPD can be explained by a simple mechanism. Since borate reacts readily with adjacent hydroxyl groups on furanosyl rings (Loomis et al., 1992), it is chemically reasonable that S-THMF-borate forms spontaneously by addition of borate, which is abundant (ca. 0.4 mM) in marine environments, to S-THMF (). Consistent with this scheme, chemically synthesized DPD induces bioluminescence in , but only in the presence of boric acid (Meijler et al., 2004). S-THMF-borate is unrelated to previously characterized autoinducers and is highly unusual in containing boron, an element rarely observed in biological molecules.","The presence of boron in the LuxP ligand raised the question of whether S-THMF-borate is the sole bacterial signaling molecule derived from DPD. Hence, this question was addressed by determining whether other bacteria that respond to AI-2 signals recognize S-THMF-borate or whether, instead, they recognize different derivatives of DPD. In the latter case, the use of S-THMF-borate as a signaling molecule might be confined, for example, to bacteria such as marine vibrios that live in relatively high-borate environments. The identification of LsrB as an AI-2 binding protein in and (Taga et al., 2001, 2003) provided a starting point for characterizing the spectrum of AI-2 signal molecules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"i":["S. typhimurium ","S. typhimurium "]},"The structure of LsrB, both unliganded and in complex with its DPD-derived ligand was determined. Like other periplasmic binding proteins, LsrB undergoes a significant conformational change upon ligand binding. Most strikingly, the LsrB ligand differs from the LuxP ligand and lacks boron. Thus, two different bacterial AI-2 receptors bind chemically distinct derivatives of DPD. These findings mean that the earlier use of the term \u201cAI-2\u201d to refer exclusively to S-THMF-borate is not accurate. Instead, the AI-2 response in different bacterial species can be triggered by at least two different derivatives of the LuxS product, DPD.","The present invention is directed to crystals comprising apo-LsrB or holo-LsrB, i.e., an LsrB-ligand complex. The crystals diffract X-rays to a resolution of greater than. 5.0 \u212b, and preferably to a resolution greater than 1.5 \u212b or 1.3 \u212b.

This form is also referred to herein as apo-LsrB. In this context, those skilled in the art will understand that the term \u201ccrystal\u201d refers to an ordered arrangement of atoms, the crystal having an overall size and quality sufficient for the elucidation of the atomic arrangement by X-ray crystallography. Preferably, the crystal diffracts X-rays to a resolution of greater than about 5.0 Angstroms (\u212b), more preferably greater than about 2.5 \u212b, even more preferably greater than about 1.5 or 1.3 \u212b. A resolution \u201cgreater than\u201d a particular value means a resolution that numerically exceeds the recited value. For example, in X-ray crystallography, a resolution of 2.8 \u212b is greater than a resolution of 5.0 \u212b. Crystals comprising LsrB are preferably prepared by the methods described in the Examples below. The atomic coordinates for LsrB are preferably determined by X-ray crystallography of a crystal comprising LsrB, preferably by the methods described in the Examples below but can be determined using other methods known in the crystallographic art. A set of atomic coordinates for the apo-LsrB crystal has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1TM2.","Another crystal of the invention comprises LsrB and a ligand. That ligand has been identified as containing a furan moiety. As used herein, the term \u201cligand\u201d refers to a molecule or ion that binds to LsrB. Preferably, binding between the ligand and LsrB occurs at an LsrB binding site, which a region of LsrB that interacts with the ligand to produce an LsrB-ligand complex in which the ligand binds relatively tightly to LsrB. Such strong binding may be produced, for example, when the shapes of the binding site and ligand are mutually compatible (e.g., \u201clock and key\u201d), and\/or when at least some of the ligand atoms are attracted to at least some of the LsrB atoms in the vicinity of the binding site by intermolecular forces, e.g., dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals attractions, hydrogen-bonding, etc. A set of atomic coordinates for the holo-LsrB crystal has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 1TJY. The binding site for the LsrB-ligand complex is shown schematically in , left panel.","Binding sites have significant utility in fields such as drug discovery. The association of natural ligands with the binding sites of their corresponding proteins, enzymes or receptors is the basis of many biological mechanisms of action. Similarly, many drugs exert their biological effects through association with the binding sites of proteins, enzymes, and receptors. Such associations may occur with all or any parts of the binding site. An understanding of such associations enables the design of drugs having more favorable associations with their target proteins, enzymes or receptors, and thus, improved biological effects. Therefore, this information is valuable in designing potential inhibitors of the binding sites of biologically important targets.","For example, the holo-LsrB structure can be used to computationally dock compounds into the binding pocket. Compounds with high affinity may block transport via LsrB, whether or not the bound conformation closely resembles holo-LsrB. In another example, the apoLsrB structure, or the two domains of the holo-LsrB structure separately, can be used to search for compounds that bind in the interdomain interface. Such compounds do not necessarily need to bind to the exact same site as R-THMF and could prevent LsrB from adopting the holo-LsrB conformation, thereby preventing it from interacting functionally with the LsrC\/D transporter. In either case, the crystal structures are used to carry out virtual screening. Potential \u201chits\u201d can then be tested in quorum sensing assays. The high resolution structures of holo- and apo-LsrB will aid in such rationale design and search for LsrB ligands","Hence, the atomic coordinates of the apo-LsrB and holo-LsrB can be used to identify whether a ligand binds to LsrB, and thus may be used for a variety of purposes, such as drug discovery. A preferred method comprises obtaining the atomic coordinates in the crystal of at least a selected portion of LsrB. Preferably, the selected portion comprises the ligand binding site. More preferably, the selected portion includes the amino acid residue found at the ligand binding site including residues Gln167, Asp116, Pro220, Ala 222, Lys35 and Asp166. Lys35, Asp116 and Asp166 are involved in hydrogen bonding with the R-THMF. Additionally, hydrophobic residues near the methyl group of R-THMF include Phe41 and Leu265.","The atomic coordinates are preferably used to model the selected portion. Such modeling is preferably accomplished by storing crystallographic information about the selected portion on a computer and then using the computer to translate the atomic coordinates into the three-dimensional structure of the selected portion of LsrB. Computers and software suitable for carrying out these functions are commercially available. Computer packages include Sybyl version 6.8 from Tripos, Inc. and MacroModel version 8.0 from Schrodinger Software. A potential ligand is then identified, and the likelihood of binding between the ligand and LsrrB is determined by docking the potential ligand to the selected portion of holo-LsrB. Such docking preferably involves computationally evaluating the ligand for its ability to bind with LsrB, preferably using the commercially available computational packages described above. Ligands that bind with LsrB are potential drug candidates. The LsrB structure encoded by the crystallographic data may be displayed in a graphical three-dimensional representation on a computer screen. This allows visual inspection of the structure, as well as visual inspection of the structure's association with the ligand. Preferably, a computer is used for the identifying of the potential ligand or the docking of the potential ligand to the binding site, or both. A general review of computation docking methods is found in Perola et al. (2004) and Kellenberger et al. (2004).","After docking (preferably by the computational methods described above) indicates that a particular ligand has the potential to bind to LsrB, the interaction of the indicated ligand is preferably examined by obtaining a sample of the potential ligand and testing that ligand for activity. Preferably, the compounds are tested in quorum-sensing assays using prokaryotic cells, e.g., bacteria, to determine whether and to what extent the ligand affects quorum sensing.","AI-2 Analogs","The final biosynthetic product in the AI-2 signaling pathway is DPD. This molecule can cyclize to give two furanoketones, S-DHMF and R-DHMF as shown in . Each of these can add water (hydrate) leading to S-THMF and R-THMF, also shown in . Addition of borate to S-THMF produces the AI-2 signaling molecule for , S-THMF borate, which acts through binding to the periplasmic protein, LuxP. The hydrated version R-THMF is the member of this set which is active in , binding to the sugar transport protein, LsrB. The hydration reaction and boron complexation are spontaneous for these molecules under physiological conditions. DPD and these isomers are in rapid equilibrium and are relatively unstable.","Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a series of stable compounds that exhibit antagonist\/agonist activity for AI-2. These compounds are also referred to herein as AI-2 analogs. The discovery that LsrB binds R-THMF provides a new mechanism of bacterial control.","These compounds were designed to satisfy three criteria. The compounds of the invention were designed to be (1) chemically stable, (2) capable of spontaneous, favorable hydration in the case of analogs S-DHMF and R-DHMF, and (3) to optimize binding to the receptor proteins via matching of the shape and positioning of functional groups.

Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection","Both apo-LsrB and holo-LsrB crystallized by the hanging drop method in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 22%-25% PEG 4000 (w\/v) in space group P222. The apo-LsrB crystals initially obtained (a=38.0, b=74.0, c=116.2) were used to seed crystallization in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 18%-24% PEG 4000. Crystals were cryoprotected by brief soaks in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20% PEG 4000, 16% (v\/v) glycerol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Native crystals diffracted to 1.9 \u212b and data were collected at 100 K using an R-AXIS-IV image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku 200HB generator. Selenomethionine LsrB crystals were grown and frozen in the same conditions as native crystals. Selenomethionine crystals diffracted to 2.1 \u212b resolution at NSLS beam line X25, where MAD data were collected using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. Holo-LsrB crystals (a=37.8, b=76.6, c=109.7) were prepared by addition of approximately 0.25 mM in vitro LuxS reaction product (Schauder et aL, 2001) to the native LsrB crystallization conditions, giving a DPD:LsrB molar ratio of slightly over 1:1. Crystals diffracted to 1.3 \u212b resolution at NSLS beam line X25. To test the possibility that LsrB can bind a borated adduct of DPD, crystals of LsrB were grown as above with both \u02dc0.25 mM in vitro LuxS reaction product and 0.5 or 5 mM boric acid. Crystals grown under these conditions were isomorphous with native crystals. Data were collected at NSLS beam line X25 where crystals diffracted to 1.3 \u212b for 0.5 mM boric acid and 2.0 \u212b for 5 mM boric acid. In all cases, data were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1998).","C. Structure Determination and Refinement","Positions of the selenium atoms were determined using SOLVE (Terwilliger et. al., 1999) with subsequent density modification and initial automatic model building by RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2002). The automatically generated partial model was used as a starting point for model building using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The apo-LsrB structure was refined using native data to 1.9 \u212b and water molecules added with the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The final model contains all LsrB residues present in the protein (27-340) plus 348 ordered water molecules and has good geometry (Table 1) with only one residue (Asp116) outside of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (see below).","The structure of holo-LsrB was solved via molecular replacement using CNS, treating the two domains of apo-LsrB as separate objects in the search. The model was built in O and refined with CNS and CCP4 (CCP4, 1994) to 1.3 \u212b resolution. Asp116 again lies in a disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, with both backbone and side chain conformations identical to those observed in apoLsrB. Its proper positioning is nevertheless unambiguous in both the 1.9 \u212b apo-LsrB and 1.3 \u212b holo-LsrB electron density maps. The ligand present in the holo-LsrB crystals was not built until the Rand Rhad dropped to 0.18 and 0.20, respectively, and water molecules had been included in the model (but not in the ligand binding site). The electron density in the binding site was well ordered and clearly interpretable and was modeled as (2R,4S)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran (R-THMF). The ligand was refined using CNS, with parameter files generated by the HIC-Up server (Kleywegt et al., 1998). Given the high resolution of the data, the geometric terms were relaxed during later cycles of refinement. Omitting all waters and examining a simulated annealing omit map revealed 11 side chains with multiple conformations. The final model contains 399 water molecules and the two heterologous N-terminal residues (Gly-Ser) remaining after removal of the GST tag. Molecular images were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano, 2002).","The structures of the holo-LsrB complex crystallized in the presence of 0.5 and 5 mM boric acid were determined by molecular replacement using holo-LsrB with the ligand omitted via the program EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999). The structures were partially refined to Rvalues of 24.3 (data to 1.3 \u212b) and 24.0 (data to 2.0 \u212b), respectively, by which point it was clear that the ligand was identical to that present in the fully refined holo-LsrB complex.","D. B-NMR","Holo-LuxP was purified as described previously (Chen et al., 2002), exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol) using a small gel filtration column (PD10; Amersham Biosciences), and concentrated to 200 \u03bcM. To prepare holo-LsrB, GST-LsrB was incubated overnight with an approximately equimolar amount of in vitro LuxS reaction product (Schauder et al., 2001). Unbound ligand was removed by immobilizing the protein on glutathione agarose beads and washing extensively with NMR buffer. Finally, the fusion protein was eluted using NMR buffer plus 10 mM glutathione and concentrated to approximately 1 mM. B NMR spectra were collected on each sample before and after addition of boric acid to a final concentration of 5 mM. Then, each sample was heated 3 min at 70\u00b0 C. to release the ligand from the protein, the denatured protein was pelleted, and spectra were collected for the ligand-containing supernatants. All B NMR spectra were collected at 4\u00b0 C. using a Varian Unity\/INOVA spectrometer at 128.4 Mhz equipped with a 8 mm tunable X\/H probe (Nalorac) and were referenced to BFO(Et)2. 180,000 scans were averaged for each spectrum with a 0.25 s recycle time using an approximately 30\u00b0 flip-angle pulse.","E.

Despite low sequence identity (11%), LsrB exhibits the same fold as the AI-2 signaling receptor LuxP (Chen et aL, 2002), with a three-stranded hinge connecting two similar \u03b1\/\u03b2 domains (). LsrB also has strong structural homology with several other sugar binding proteins including ribose binding protein (RBP) and galactose binding protein, as well as repressors such as purine nucleotide synthesis repressor and trehalose repressor (Hars et al., 1998; Mowbray et al., 1992; Mowbray et al., 1983; Schumacher et al., 1994). In periplasmic binding proteins, including LuxP, the ligand binding site is near the hinge between the two domains.

The structure was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 1.3 \u212b resolution (Table 1). In this structure, the domains of LsrB have closed around the binding site, rotating shut about the hinge region by 21\u00b0 relative to one another () (Hayward et al., 2002). Nonprotein electron density is prominent between the two domains () in a location analogous to the ligand binding sites of LuxP and other periplasmic binding proteins. As detailed below, this electron density is consistent with R-THMF, a DPD derivative not previously known to be biologically active ().","The LsrB ligand R-THMF differs from the LuxP ligand S-THMF-borate in two respects (). First, no borate is present. Second, the stereochemistry of the LsrB ligand appears to be opposite to that of the LuxP ligand at position 2, the anomeric center (see ). This stereochemical assignment is supported by the crystallographic data. Specifically, examination of a 1.3 \u212b resolution F-Fmap at high contour level shows stronger electron density in the position modeled as a hydroxyl group (). Indeed, the oxygens in the ligand all display stronger electron density in the F- Fmap than the carbons (). (To eliminate phase bias, the map was calculated using a model in which the ligand had never been present and from which any water molecules in or around the ligand binding site had been removed.) In addition, the proposed stereochemistry places the methyl group in a hydrophobic environment (the nearest residues are Phe41 and Leu265, 3.6 and 3.9 \u212b away, respectively), while the hydroxyl group is situated near polar atoms, the closest of which is the backbone oxygen of Pro220 (3.3 \u212b away). A possibility remains that the S stereoisomer, or a mixture of the R and S stereoisomers, is present in the crystal structure, and their chemical interconvertability prevents us from testing their biological activity individually. Nonetheless, both the electron density and the placement of polar and hydrophobic residues within the binding site support the identification of the LsrB ligand as R-THMF ().","While LsrB and LuxP share the same fold, their binding sites are distinctive and appear to be designed to accommodate different ligands (). Key residues involved in hydrogen bonding between LuxP and S-THMF-borate are not conserved in LsrB. Gln77, Ser79, and Thr266, polar residues in the LuxP binding site that hydrogen bond with S-THMF-borate, are replaced in LsrB by the nonpolar residues Val39, Gly40, and Ala222, respectively. LuxP residues Arg215 and Arg310, each of which makes multiple hydrogen bonds with S-THMF-borate, are replaced in LsrB by Trp170 and Trp266, respectively, whose ring nitrogens are too distant from R-THMF to participate in hydrogen bonding. LuxP Trp82, whose ring nitrogen hydrogen bonds with S-THMF-borate, corresponds to Phe42 in LsrB.","Perhaps the most striking-difference between the LsrB and LuxP ligand binding sites is that they differ in net charge (). The binding site in LsrB has three charged residues, Lys35, Asp116, and Asp166. Lys35 and Asp166 are positioned to form a salt bridge, neutralizing their respective charges, while still contributing to ligand binding. Asp116 does not have a salt bridge partner, leaving a net negative charge in the binding pocket. This contrasts with the binding pocket in LuxP, which contains two positively charged residues (Arg215 and Arg310) that stabilize the negative charge on S-THMF-borate. The negative charge in the LsrB binding pocket makes it unlikely that S-THMF-borate would bind to LsrB.","The furanosyl rings of the two DPD derivatives are oriented differently in the LsrB and LuxP binding pockets (compare ). The furanosyl ring in LsrB occupies roughly the same position as the boratering in LuxP and the ribose ring in RBP. Barring a large structural rearrangement, there does not appear to be sufficient room in the LsrB binding pocket to accommodate S-THMF-borate. Overall, because of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and steric differences, LsrB and LuxP have binding sites that accommodate chemically distinct signaling molecules derived from the same precursor, DPD. Consistent with this proposal, LsrB crystallized in the presence of both DPD and boric acid (0.5 or 5 mM) displayed electron density (at 1.3 and 2.0 \u212b, respectively) in the ligand binding pocket indistinguishable from the ligand density in holo-LsrB. Thus, even with the addition of high levels of boric acid, the analyzed crystals of LsrB have never been observed to bind the borated form of AI-2 responsible for quorum sensing in ",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0142","num":"0169"},"sup":["11","11"],"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"sub":"a "},"For comparison, an identical set of experiments was carried out using GST-LsrB preincubated with the same in vitro DPD synthesis reaction products used for crystallization of holo-LsrB; unbound ligand was chromatographically removed. In this case, no boron peak was observed in B-NMR spectra (, top trace). Addition of 5 mM boric acid had no effect on the NMR spectrum (, middle trace). In a separate experiment, simultaneous incubation of unliganded GST-LsrB with both 5 mM borate and the in vitro DPD synthesis reaction products gave identical results. Thus, within the detection limits of this experiment, LsrB does not bind a borated derivative of DPD. Strikingly, however, thermal release of the bound LsrB ligand into 5 mM boric acid (, bottom trace) led to the appearance of a peak at 5.8 ppm, exactly as observed upon release of the bound LuxP ligand. This result is consistent with the chemical scheme in  according to which, upon release into excess boric acid, THMF would be converted spontaneously into THMF-borate. Taken together, the B-NMR results are in agreement with the hypothesis, based on crystallographic evidence, that LsrB binds an unborated ligand. Furthermore, they indicate directly that the LsrB ligand, once released, can be converted into a borated form. This property may underlie the ability of AI-2 activity secreted by to stimulate light production in (Bassler et al., 1997; Surette et al., 1999).","The crystallographic and B NMR results imply that and recognize different derivatives of DPD, one that contains boron and one that does not. That this distinction was not previously recognized may stem, in part, from the ability of the molecules to interconvert, as indicated by chemical considerations, earlier functional studies, and the NMR results (Bassler et al., 1997; Chen et al., 2002; Meijler et al., 2004; Schauder et al., 2001; Surette et al., 1999) (). To test these ideas further, and bioassays were used to examine whether AI-2 signaling molecules released from the two receptors are in equilibrium with one another. Furthermore, the position of this equilibrium, and thus the signaling activity, can be influenced by the presence of boric acid. The model () predicts that boric acid should enhance AI-2 signaling in but inhibit AI-2 signaling in ","To directly examine the influence of borate on AI-2-dependent signaling in and , borate-depleted medium was prepared. AI-2 responses (bioluminescence in , lsr operon induction in ) were measured both with and without added boric acid. In this experiment, strain, MM32 was used because this strain lacks the LuxS enzyme needed to biosynthesize DPD and thus produces no endogenous AI-2 signal. This strain also has the AI-1 pathway inactivated. Bioluminescence was measured following addition of enzymatically synthesized DPD or, alternatively, ligand released from either LsrB or LuxP.","No light was produced when the reporter strain was exposed to DPD or to the released LsrB ligand in borate-depleted medium (, black bars). The released LuxP ligand also failed to stimulate light production. The inability of the released ligand to stimulate light production suggests that, in borate-depleted medium, S-THMF-borate dissociates into THMF and boric acid (see ). In all cases, a large increase in ligand-stimulated light production occurred when boric acid (5 mM) was added to the borate-depleted medium (, white bars). The ability of both DPD and the released ligand to stimulate light production in the presence of boric acid confirms that DPD and THMF are in equilibrium with one another and that THMF, once borated, is active in AI-2 signaling (Meijler et al., 2004).","AI-2 induction of the lsr operon of can be monitored by measuring \u03b2-galactosidase activity in strain MET844 (lsr-lacZ, luxS).  shows that, even in borate-depleted medium, addition of DPD or the ligand released from either LsrB or LuxP induces lsr expression (black bars). Note that approximately 2.5-fold less LuxP ligand was used in this experiment compared to DPD and the LsrB ligand. Strikingly, whereas boric acid strongly enhances the ability of DPD or either receptor's ligand to activate the assay (), it inhibits the ability of the same molecules to activate the assay ().","The results demonstrate that borate is required for the AI-2-response in but inhibits the AI-2 response in . These findings are consistent with the model shown in , which posits that DPD, R-THMF, and S-THMF-borate are in equilibrium with one another. This equilibrium, as expected, can be shifted toward borated forms by the addition of boric acid, and toward unborated forms by borate depletion. Hence, in accordance with the the crystallographic results, it appears that R-THMF is the active species for AI-2 signaling whereas S-THMF-borate is the active species for AI-2 signaling.","Bassler, B.
