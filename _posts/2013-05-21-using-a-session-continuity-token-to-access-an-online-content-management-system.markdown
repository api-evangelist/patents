title: Using a session continuity token to access an online content management system
abstract: The disclosed embodiments relate to a session continuity feature that allows a user to access an online content management system through different instances of a third-party application located on different computing devices without having to log in to the online content management system separately from each computing device. When the user signs on to the online content management system, the session continuity mechanism provides a session continuity token to the third-party system. When the user subsequently accesses an instance of the third-party application located on another computing device, the third-party system provides the session continuity token to the new instance of the third-party application. This enables the user to access the online content management system through the new instance of the third-party application without having to sign on again.

Field","The disclosed embodiments generally relate to techniques for accessing an online content management system. More specifically, the disclosed embodiments relate to a technique for enabling a user to access an online content management system from different instances of a third-party application located on different computing devices without having to sign on separately from each computing device.","2. Related Art","Online content management systems such as the Dropbox\u2122 service, which is offered by Dropbox, Inc., of San Francisco, Calif., are quite popular because they enable users to access their online content from a number of different computing devices. Unfortunately, the process of accessing the online content management system can be complicated if the user tries to access the online content management system through a third-party application, such as an email system. In this case, the user has to sign on to the online content management system from each instance of the third-party application.","For example, suppose a user is accessing a online content management system through a first email client located on a first device. If the user switches to a second computing device and subsequently attempts to access the online content management system through a second email client on the second device, the user needs to sign on to the online content management system again from second email client, even though the user has already signed on to the online content management system through the first email client.","This process of signing on to the online content management system from each instance of the third-party application is time-consuming and cumbersome.","The disclosed embodiments relate to a session continuity feature that allows a user to access an online content management system through different instances of a third-party application located on different computing devices without having to log in to the online content management system separately from each computing device. When the user signs on to the online content management system, the session continuity mechanism provides a session continuity token to the third-party system. When the user subsequently accesses an instance of the third-party application located on another computing device, the third-party system provides the session continuity token to the new instance of the third-party application. This enables the user to access the online content management system through the new instance of the third-party application without having to sign on again.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the present embodiments, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present embodiments. Thus, the present embodiments are not limited to the embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.","The data structures and code described in this detailed description are typically stored on a computer-readable storage medium, which may be any device or medium that can store code and\/or data for use by a computer system. The computer-readable storage medium includes, but is not limited to, volatile memory, non-volatile memory, magnetic and optical storage devices such as disk drives, magnetic tape, CDs (compact discs), DVDs (digital versatile discs or digital video discs), or other media capable of storing computer-readable media now known or later developed.","The methods and processes described in the detailed description section can be embodied as code and\/or data, which can be stored in a computer-readable storage medium as described above. When a computer system reads and executes the code and\/or data stored on the computer-readable storage medium, the computer system performs the methods and processes embodied as data structures and code and stored within the computer-readable storage medium. Furthermore, the methods and processes described below can be included in hardware modules. For example, the hardware modules can include, but are not limited to, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and other programmable-logic devices now known or later developed. When the hardware modules are activated, the hardware modules perform the methods and processes included within the hardware modules.","Overview","The disclosed embodiments relate to a technique for enabling a user to access an online content management system from different instances of a third-party application located on different computing devices without having to sign on separately from each computing device. Before describing details of this system, we first describe the basic structure of the online content management system.","Note that the description herein refers to \u201ccontent items.\u201d Content items may generally include any type of files, folders, collection of folders, or data that may be stored on a computer-readable storage medium.","Content Management Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["105","105","110","110","110","120","130","118","110","120"]},"Client Devices","In various embodiments, each client device  may selectively execute a content-management client application A-B (collectively ) (also referred to as a \u201ccontent-management client\u201d), which may be used to access content items stored within a content management system . In some embodiments, copies of content items A and B are maintained on client devices A and B, respectively, and synchronized copies of content items A and B are maintained on content management system . In some embodiments, client devices  may provide a file-browser type interface (not shown) for directly manipulating the content items stored on online content management system  without maintaining a local copy. Client devices  may also include applications A and B (collectively ) for manipulating content items, such as content items A and B.","While only two client devices A and B are shown in  for purposes of clarity, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that many client devices  may simultaneously connect through network(s)  to content management system  at any given time. Examples of suitable client devices  include, but are not limited to, a desktop computer; mobile computing devices, such as a laptop or a tablet; and handheld devices, such as a smartphone (e.g., an IPHONE\u00ae, BLACKBERRY\u00ae, or ANDROID\u2122-based smartphone). Each client device  may store a local, synced copy of one or more content items from within content management system , and the content items may be stored in any suitable file format. When content-management client  presents content items that are stored within the file storage system to a user, the content items may be arranged in folders and the folders themselves may be arranged in other folders, or in any other arbitrary arrangement supported by content management system , as determined by the user. However, one of skill in the art should understand in light of this disclosure that each user's file storage architecture may be considerably different from the next, and in some instances, the file storage architecture may be implemented to maximize storage and file retrieval efficiency.","Content Management System","Content management system  stores content items and manages access to those content items via client devices . Content management system  and its components may be implemented using any appropriate hardware and software for file serving, storage, and retrieval functions. For example, content management system  may be implemented in the form of a single server or multiple servers.","In various embodiments, content management system  includes interface module , data store , account module , and widget code generation module . Some of these elements of content management system  are discussed in more detail below.","Content Management System\u2014Interface Module","In particular embodiments, interface module  may facilitate file access and file storage operations among content management system  and client devices . Interface module  may receive content items from and send content items to client devices  consistent with the user's preferences for sharing content items. Interface module  may act as the counterpart to a client-side file-explorer style user interface that allows a user to manipulate content items directly stored on content management system . In some embodiments, software operating on client devices  may integrate network-stored content items with the client's local file system to enable a user to manipulate network-stored content items through the same user interface (UI) used to manipulate content items on the local file system, e.g., via a file explorer, file finder or browser application. As an alternative or supplement to the client-side file-explorer interface, interface module  may provide a web interface for client devices  to access (e.g., via a suitable application ) and allow a user to manipulate content items stored within content management system . In this way, the user can directly manipulate content items stored within content management system .","Content Management System\u2014Data Store","In various embodiments, data store  may store content items such as those uploaded using client devices , or using any other suitable computing device. In the embodiment illustrated in , client device A, which is associated with a first user, is shown as locally storing at least one content item A, and client device B, which is associated with a second user, is shown as locally storing at least one content item B. As shown in , a copy of the locally stored content item A and a copy of locally stored content item B are maintained in data store  in content management system . In the embodiment illustrated in , content items A and B are synchronized content items that reside on client devices A-B and online content management system . Note that client devices A-B may also store other online content items that are replicated on online content management system , and which are shared with other client devices.","In various embodiments, data store  may maintain information identifying the user, information describing the user's file directory, and other information in a content item journal (also referred to as a \u201clog\u201d) that is maintained for each user. In some embodiments, the content item journal may be maintained on content management system , and in other embodiments, a content item journal (e.g., a \u201cserver-side content item journal\u201d) may be maintained both on content management system  and locally on each client device . In various embodiments, the content item journal may be used to facilitate the synchronization of the various copies of a particular content item that are associated with a user's account.","As a particular example, in the embodiment shown in , the system may be configured so that any changes made to content item A on particular client device A may also be automatically reflected in the copy of content item A stored within online content management system . Similarly, any changes made to the copy of content item A on online content management system  may also be automatically reflected in the copy of content item A stored on client device A.","Content Management System\u2014Account Module","In particular embodiments, account module  may track content items stored in data store  and entries in the server-side content item journal for each content item. As users grant content item access permissions to other users, account module  may update the server-side content item journal associated with each relevant user in data store . Account module  may also track client devices  that are associated with each user's account. For example, a user may want to share all their content items among their desktop computer, tablet computer, and mobile device. To make such a sharing arrangement seamless to the user, the user's single account on content management system  may be associated with each of the user's respective client devices. In some embodiments, an application running on each respective client device  may help to coordinate synchronization of content items on the client device with corresponding versions of the content items within the user's account in content management system , and also with corresponding versions of the content items stored on the user's various other client devices.","Content Management System\u2014Widget Code Generation Module","In particular embodiments, widget code generation module  may be configured to generate code that may be used to create an email-attachment-upload widget on a remote email client. Note that while the description herein describes embodiments associated with a third-party email system, any type of system may be used with embodiments of the present invention, such as content management systems, project management systems, media applications, etc. In particular embodiments, this code may be HTML code that may be pasted into an email client to create the email-attachment-upload widget. In other embodiments, the code may be program code, which is integrated into a native-client-based email system. In particular embodiments, the email-attachment-upload widget may include a button that may be used to: (1) select one or more attachments from a user's email client; and (2) facilitate the upload of the selected attachments directly from the email client to an online content management system.","Third-Party Web Servers","In various embodiments, third-party server  comprises widget code  and web server data store . In these embodiments, widget code  is generated by widget code generation module  as described previously. Widget code  allows a user to access an online content management system  through different instances of a third-party application served by third-party server  located on different computing devices without having to log in to online content management system  separately from each computing device.","Process of Creating a Session Continuity Token",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["150","130","130","202","150","120","120","204","120","120"]},"Next, the system receives a confirmation from the user indicating that the user would like to link his or her online content management system  account with his or her third-party server  account (operation ). Note that if an affirmative confirmation is not received, the system does not provide access to online content management system  without the user logging in to online content management system .","Once affirmative confirmation has been received, the system passes session continuity token  from online content management system  to third-party server  (operation ). Note that session continuity token  enables third-party server  to access a set of services and\/or content items from online content management system  without having to provide further identification or authentication credentials to online content management system . In some embodiments, the token is granted for an indefinite period of time, while in other embodiments, the token has a predetermined expiration time, or expires after a pre-determined amount of time has elapsed. Finally, the third-party server  automatically signs in the user to online content management system  (operation ).","Note that session continuity token  can be comprised of various formats and types. For example, in some embodiments, the token may contain encrypted credentials, including instructions, that grant access to online content management system , while in other embodiments, session continuity token  may only be an identifier that identifies credentials stored within online content management system .","Process of Continuing a Session From a New Session Instance",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["130","130","150","130","302","175","170","130","304","175","175","130","120","306","175","120","120","130","308"]},"Note that in other embodiments, session continuity token  can be located and sent to new devices at a time other than when the user executes widget code . For example, the system may locate and send session continuity token  when the user logs in to third-party server , opens a window to compose a new message, or accesses account management dialogs.","As described previously, session continuity token  can include any level of authorization and authentication information to grant the user access to his or her account on online content management system . This access may include general access to the user's account, or include access only to specific files or operations. In some embodiments, this access is configurable by a user, while in other embodiments, this access is configurable by an administrator.","In some embodiments, session continuity token  may only be used to grant access to online content management system  from one third-party server at a time, while in other embodiments, the session continuity token  may allow for multiple connections to online content management system  from different third-party servers. Note that in some embodiments, session continuity token  includes advanced logic to prevent session hijacking and to prevent a stolen token from granting subsequent access to online content management system ","Note that in many embodiments, access to online content management system  is only granted through the context of widget code . In some of these embodiments, the owners of online content management system  provide widget code  to the third party. Note that this can take place on demand, or may take place during a scheduled maintenance or downtime. In some embodiments, widget code  is generic code that works across many systems, while in other embodiments, widget code  is specific to a particular server or third-party. Also note that in many embodiments, the user may terminate the link between the user account at third-party server  and the user account at online content management system  at any time. Additionally, the third-party or the online content-management system may terminate the link. Deleting or revoking session continuity token  may accomplish this termination.","Note that in the situation where multiple session continuity tokens exist, the system may revoke all of the tokens at once, all of the tokens for a particular third-party, all of the tokens for a particular user, or only specific tokens.","Moreover, while the description herein describes web-based embodiments, embodiments of the present invention are not meant to be limited to web-based applications. For example, some embodiments are integrated into native clients, while other embodiments are integrated into mobile applications, while still other embodiments are integrated into platform-independent applications.","Exemplary Embodiment","The following description is associated with an exemplary embodiment that illustrates the process of accessing Dropbox\u2122 through a session continuity token from multiple web-based email sessions. This session continuity token should be associated with the corresponding email account and stored by the email provider using a secure method. The email provider can utilize the user's session continuity token to provide access to the Dropbox\u2122 embedded web content item selector running on other machines without requiring the user to separately log in to the Dropbox\u2122 service, as set forth below.","First, at the user's request, the email provider opens the Dropbox\u2122 embedded web content item selector (as described above). Next, the user signs into Dropbox\u2122 or creates a new account. If this is the first time the user is using the Dropbox\u2122 integration in the web-based email client, they are asked if they would like to link their Dropbox\u2122 account with their email account. If they choose \u201cyes,\u201d a session continuity token is created and is passed to the email provider, which is stored and associated with the current user's email account.","At some subsequent time, the user starts using a different browser to access the Dropbox\u2122 integration in their web-based email. Note that, as described previously, the system may use a native client, or another means for accessing the Dropbox\u2122 integration instead of using a web browser. The user's email provider passes the session continuity token to the Dropbox\u2122 embedded web content item selector when it is accessed. Consequently, the user is automatically signed back into their Dropbox\u2122 account, only within the Dropbox\u2122 embedded web content item selector.","The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the present invention have been presented only for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the forms disclosed. Accordingly, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in the art. Additionally, the above disclosure is not intended to limit the present invention. The scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
