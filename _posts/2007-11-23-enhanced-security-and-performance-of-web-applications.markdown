title: Enhanced security and performance of web applications
abstract: A client-side enforcement mechanism may allow application security policies to be specified at a server in a programmatic manner. Servers may specify security policies as JavaScript functions included in a page returned by the server and run before other scripts. At runtime, and during initial loading, the functions are invoked by the client on each page modification to ensure the page conforms to the security policy. As such, before a mutation takes effect, the policy may transform that mutation and the code and data of the page. Replicated code execution may take place at both the client and the server where the server runs its own shadow copy of a client-side application in a trusted execution environment so that the server may check that the method calls coming from the client correspond to a correct execution of the client-side application The redundant execution at the client can be untrusted, but serves to improve the responsiveness and performance of the Web application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Web applications provide end users with client access to server functionality through a set of Web pages. These pages often contain script code to be executed dynamically within the client Web browser. Most Web applications aim to enforce security policies, such as, for Web-based e-mail, disallowing any scripts in untrusted e-mail messages. However, Web applications are subject to attacks, such as cross-site scripting, cookie theft, session riding, browser hijacking, and self-propagating worms.","Of the current attacks on Web applications, those based on script injection are by far the most common. For example, script injection is used in cross-site scripting and Web application worms. A script injection vulnerability may be present whenever a Web application includes data of uncertain origin in its Web pages, e.g., a third-party comment on a blog page is an example of such untrusted data. In a typical attack, malicious data with surreptitiously embedded scripts is included in requests to a benign Web application server. Later, the server may include that data and scripts in Web pages it returns to unsuspecting users. Since Web browsers execute scripts on a page with Web application authority, these returned scripts can give attackers control over the users' Web application activities and\/or client devices.","A client-side enforcement mechanism may allow application security policies to be specified at a server in a programmatic manner. Servers may specify security policies as JavaScript functions included in a page returned by the server to a client, and run before other scripts. At runtime, and during initial loading, the functions may be invoked by the client on each page modification to ensure the page conforms to the security policy. As such, before a mutation (defined as any modification to the structure, including data and code, of the page) takes effect, the policy may transform that mutation and the code and data of the page.","Replicated code execution may be used on both the client and the server where the server runs its own shadow copy of a client-side application in a trusted execution environment, so that the server may check that the method calls coming from the client correspond to a correct execution of the client-side application. If the server receives a call from the client that is not issued by its trusted shadow copy, the server may ignore this call or raise a security alert.","This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1-3","b":["100","100","110","120","130","130","131","131","110","121","120","114","110","121","122","114","121","121","123","121","123"]},"Although the implementation is described with respect to documents that are pages, it should be understood that the environment can include any data and\/or objects having content and connectivity that can be characterized.","The technology infrastructure of the Web  may include server-software, content-syndication, messaging-protocols, standards-based browsers with plugins and extensions, and various client-applications. These differing, yet complementary approaches provide the Web  with a growing set of information-storage, creation, and dissemination capabilities.","The servers  may provide rich Internet application techniques, including, but not limited to: Ajax-based, semantically valid XHTML and HTML markup, microformats enriching pages with additional semantics, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to separate presentation from content and REST and\/or XML- and\/or JSON-based APIs. In addition, the servers  may provide RSS or Atom feeds, merged content from different sources (e.g., mashups), weblog publishing tools, Wiki or forum software, etc.","In some implementations, Web-based applications and desktops may be provided. Ajax may provide applications that mimic personal computer applications, such as word processing, the spreadsheet, and slide-show presentation. In other implementations, browser-based \u201coperating systems\u201d or \u201conline desktops\u201d may be provided that act as application platforms. These services mimic the user experience of desktop operating-systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment. They have as their distinguishing characteristic the ability to run within any modern browser.","In some implementations, client applications  may interact with data stored on servers . This may be accomplished through forms in an HTML page, through a scripting language such as JavaScript, or through Flash, Silverlight or Java. These methods make use of the client  to reduce server workloads and to increase the responsiveness of the application.","In some implementations, client applications  may include a security mechanism (e.g., policy enforcement engine ) to enforce security policies based on monitored client application behavior. The security mechanism may support policies that range from disallowing use of certain Web client features (e.g., IFRAMEs or OBJECTs) to fine-grained, application-specific invariants such as taint-based policies that regulate the flow of credit-card information input by the user.","In some implementations, the security mechanism may utilize Mutation-Event Transforms (METs) that allow Web application security policies to be specified at the server  in a programmatic manner (using a per-control policy definition framework ), such that the specifications may be used directly for enforcement at the client . In an implementation, a security policy mechanism (which may implement METs) may be coded as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"HTMLDocument.prototype._defineGetter_ ("]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201ccookie\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003function( ){ return null; }"]},{"entry":[{},");"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"Using METs, servers  may specify security policies as JavaScript functions included in a page  returned by the server  to the client , and run before other scripts. At runtime, and during initial loading, the MET functions are invoked by the client  on each Web page modification to ensure the page conforms to the security policy. As such, before a mutation takes effect, METs may transform that mutation, and the code and data of the page. Such monitoring and transformation gives METs great flexibility in enforcement. METs may be used to implement inlined reference monitors and edit automata for security-relevant client events, which enable METs to be used to specify and enforce any security policy based on monitoring client behavior.","In an implementation, METs may be an extension to the Document Object Model (DOM), level-2, mutation events caused by an action that modifies the document structure. METs may operate on extended data that include both the standard DOM tree model and the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of executable scripts. METs may provide mutation events for <SCRIPT> nodes as follows: an event when the script node is inserted in the DOM, and another event when that inserted node is populated with the AST for its script code. This separation allows METs to enforce security policies that limit network access caused by SRC host URL attributes in script nodes. Other nodes, such as <STYLE>, may also be handled in this manner.","In an implementation, the type signature of MET callback functions may be as follows:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"ExtendedNode"]},{"entry":[{},"MET_callback(in Node script, \/\/ source of mutation"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003in Node target, \/\/ target in Web page"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003in ExtendedNode oldValue,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003in ExtendedNode newValue);"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In an implementation, the script and target are DOM nodes in the document tree. The script refers to the node containing the script that is attempting the document mutation (e.g., by writing to an innerHTML field). The target refers to the parent node where newValue is about to be inserted to replace oldValue. Both oldValue and the newValue are well-formed, properly nested subtrees of our extended DOM that includes ASTs; either may be null to denote empty subtrees. Each callback function returns an extended DOM subtree to be used (instead of newValue).","MET callback functions may be registered for DOM elements of particular types, e.g., as follows:","add_MET_callback (nodetype, policy)","In the above, \u201cpolicy\u201d would be invoked whenever a DOM element of type nodeType is affected (i.e., inserted, replaced, or deleted). This may happen at runtime, before the mutation, but after the client application  has parsed the new, proposed extended DOM values.","In an implementation, programmatic security policy variables and functions and MET callback registration, may be placed in the first <SCRIPT> tag of a Web page . To prevent subversion of security enforcement, the script language scoping rules may prevent access to security policy code and further MET callback registration might be disabled, e.g., by setting document.prototype.add MET callback to null in the code. In other implementations, client applications  may allow other scripts to register MET callback functions.","In an implementation, security policies may use programmatic MET callback functions written in JavaScript. At runtime, MET callback functions operate on each new (or updated) Web page  and ensure that it conforms to the security policy, either through validation or transformation of the code or data within the Web page. In other implementations, code for METs may be provided as pre-packaged libraries or be determined at the server.","In an implementation, METs may be used for client-side enforcement of application-specific dynamic security policies determined automatically at the server from the natural constraints imposed by the structured composition of client pages (e.g., using frameworks such as ASP.NET, AJAX, GWT, etc.). METs may also enforce other rich policies, such as those that apply to \u201cWeb 2.0\u201d cross-domain mashups, where application pages are composed outside the server enforcement.","In an implementation, user interface widgets, such as drop-down lists, trees, rich-text content panes, etc. act as a principal. The code associated with the widget may be associated with the principal so that it can only access DOM elements within the widget itself. The client application  may walk the DOM tree to determine the origin of a document containing a portion of embedded script. However, in this case, the DOM traversal within the Web client  may stop at the most deeply nested element that is annotated with a principal.","The same-origin policy of JavaScript limits access to DOM and other Web client resources, such as cookies, by tracking the origin of a particular piece of code. The principal in the default same-origin scheme is a triple (e.g., host, protocol, port) and the origin of a piece of JavaScript is determined by where it is embedded in the HTML DOM. In some implementations, the origins of a DOM element and a piece of script may be determined by walking to the top of the DOM tree. Accordingly, JavaScript access to DOM may be allowed if the origin, as encoded by the triple above, is the same.","In some implementations, application-specific principals that can be attached to an arbitrary DOM element may be allowed in addition to the default same-origin scheme. As the client application  walks up the DOM tree, the principal list may be collected.","For example, in the following:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<div principal=\u2019blog-body\u2019>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<b>Blog entries<\/b>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<div principal=\u2019blog-entry\u2019>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003today's entry"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<div principal=\u2019blog-entry\u2019>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003yesterday's entry"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},"<\/div>"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{}},"The principals may also represent DOM elements and events, code identity, and the client-user input actions. An object of the access control system may include the entire DOM tree, all script code and variables, and external activity, such as file access and network requests. Objects may be extended to include resources such as screen real-estate (to prevent spoofing), memory, and CPU resources to prevent denial-of-service.","In an implementation, general security policies may be applied to a Web page, its script code, and the nodes and attributes of document data. Such policies may include, but are not limited to:","(1) Disallow certain dangerous nodes or attributes.","<IFRAME> nodes may be disallowed and <OBJECT> nodes only permitted when instantiating the Flash player with known content.","(2) Data invariants on certain document subtrees.","The Web page document may be subject to invariants, even when modified dynamically at the client; e.g., blog comments must be a well-formed list of <DIV> nodes.","(3) Disallow scripts in certain parts of a Web page. Disallow use of <SCRIPT> nodes in untrusted blog comments.","(4) Scripts match valid, server-defined templates.","New, client-defined scripts may be allowed, but, for example, the on Hover script code for a dynamically-inserted list item may be required to match highlight (identifier).","(5) Cross-domain scripts return only data, properly.","Prevent unexpected introduction of new code by cross-domain client-mashup applications: for instance, any script returned into a cross-domain <SCRIPT> node may have a syntax tree that matches ajaxCallback(jsonDataValue).","(6) Limit scripts to a static, server-defined set.","Match the hash of the script source text against a fixed \u201cwhitelist\u201d.","(7) Constrained access to object fields and methods.","Provide partial access to document.cookie or limiting arguments to network-access methods.","(8) Proper network access via (cross-domain) URLs.","URLs are subject to access control\u2014both node-attribute URLs (e.g., on <IMG>) and the URLs used programmatically in scripts, (e.g., in an XML request).","(9) Containment of script activity to certain subtrees.","Scripts may only modify certain document subtrees; thus, a gadget (or client-side mashup) for Web search might only be allowed to mutate a <DIV> for search results.","(10) Script execution by a secure interpreter.","Scripts are not executed directly, but through a special, security-enhanced interpreter or even more fine-grained policies, such as variants of stack inspection or data tainting.","It is noted that additional or fewer policies may be specified and that policies (1) through (10) are not exhaustive. In the above, policies (1), (3), and (6) may restrict potentially dangerous types of document nodes, while allowing scripts only in certain portions of the document, or may limit scripts to a whitelist of trusted scripts. Policies (2), (4), and (5) may validate the structure of certain data structures and scripts in Web pages, which may prevent many types of attacks (e.g., attacks that use malformed SQL queries). Without such validation, malicious attacks may exploit benign client-side code by presenting it with malformed data. For instance, without enforcement of policy (5), the client application  may execute new, unexpected code where only a data return value was expected. Client-side data validation may also reduce the number of round trips to the server.","Policies (7) through (9) demonstrate that policies supported by METs may include constraints on network access or access to security-critical client variables, such as the Web client browser history, and enforce containment scopes between client-side gadgets and modules. Policy (10) demonstrates that security policies based on METs may include the code for a security-enhanced JavaScript interpreter and ensure that it is used to execute all script code. Such a customized interpreter may implement dynamic taint propagation or other complex security policies.","In an implementation, the above security policies may be readily instantiated using MET callback functions. Such callback functions may include, but are not limited to:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"(1) Limit OBJECT nodes (on OBJECT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = (newValue.classid == theAllowedGUID);"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(2) Data invariant on inserted DIVs (on DIV events):"]},{"entry":[{},"if (target.id != insertionParentID) return null;"]},{"entry":[{},"if (oldValue != null) return null;"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = ExtDOM.MatchStructure(newValue,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201c<div><ul><li><\/li><\/ul><\/div>\u201d);"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(3) Limit script placement (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = ! findParentAttr(\u201cno_scripts\u201d, target);"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(4) Restrict the code in scripts (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = ExtDOM.MatchScriptStructure(newValue,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201chighlight(\u2019identifier\u2019);\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(5) Proper data in AJAX replies (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"if (! newValue instanceof ScriptBody) return null;"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = ExtDOM.MatchScriptStructure(newValue,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201ccallback({count: 1; sum: 5;});\u201d"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(6) Script whitelisting (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = whitelist[ hash(newValue.toString( )) ];"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(7) Disallow history access (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"if (! newValue instanceof ScriptBody) return null;"]},{"entry":[{},"return ExtDOM.ReplaceScriptLiteral(newValue,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003\u201chistory\u201d, \u201cfresh_unused_literal\u201d);"]},{"entry":[{},"(8) Limit network access (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"var ok = matchURLDomain(newValue.src, \u201cfoo.com\u201d);"]},{"entry":[{},"return (ok) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(9) Script containment (on any mutation event):"]},{"entry":[{},"var src = outmostAttr(\u201ccontainment\u201d, script);"]},{"entry":[{},"var dst = outmostAttr(\u201ccontainment\u201d, target);"]},{"entry":[{},"return (src == dst) ? newValue : null;"]},{"entry":[{},"(10) Secure interpreter (on SCRIPT events):"]},{"entry":[{},"if (! newValue instanceof ScriptBody) return null;"]},{"entry":[{},"var arg = ExtDOM.CreateScriptNode(\u201cArguments\u201d,"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003newValue.ToJSON( ));"]},{"entry":[{},"var func = \u201cspecial_js_interpreter\u201d;"]},{"entry":[{},"return ExtDOM.CreateScriptNode(\u201cCall\u201d, func, arg);"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In some implementations, METs may support callback routines defined by a security policy code. For example, the matchURLDomain function in (8) may match string URLs in a policy-specific manner, while the outmostAttr function in (9) may recursively walk up the document tree to find an attribute definition closest to the root. Similarly, policy-specific variables may encode security-relevant state such as in (1) for allowed ActiveX GUIDs (e.g., the Flash player), and in (2) the identity of a particular node in the document structure of a Web page.","In an implementation, the security policies may be application-specific and perform access control within a page .  is an exemplary document tree  within a Web page , and shows an example of a DOM tree  containing data from two RSS sources: rss 1 and rss 2. Here, rss2 code should not modify the first <div> element  to prevent a rogue RSS feed from changing the contents of another one. The code associated with rss1 should not modify the second <div> element . Likewise, neither rss1 code, nor rss2 code should be able to modify the third <div> element  that will display e-mail. By implementing security policy (9), the code may be restricted to modifying only DOM elements declared within the same scope. This policy provides for isolation of code and data on a single page .  also illustrates that a security policy may be directed by inline attributes on document nodes. In this case, a no-script attribute is used to direct MET enforcement of a policy such as (3).","In another implementation, a developer may write an application in Java that is subsequently compiled into two parts: a Java part that resides on the server and a JavaScript part that resides on the client. In a client-side attack, the assumptions of the original Java application may not hold for the scripts at the client. To prevent this, the server may generate policies that enforce consistency properties of the client code. For example, the server may ensure that access control properties such as \u201ca private method may only be invoked by methods in the same Java class\u201d present in the original Java source code are preserved in the JavaScript code on the client side. Instantiation of such a policy may be application-dependent and could be obtained through static analysis of the original Java code.","In another implementation, server-generated content templates may provide for dynamic policy generation in, e.g., ASP.NET or JSP pages. These technologies allow servers to mix static HTML and dynamic content. Using static analysis, the computed parts of a Web page  may be approximated and, thereby, the structure and contents of generated pages. For example, the analysis may be directed to assume no permitted scripts in application inputs. Such page \u201ctemplates\u201d are highly suitable for client-side enforcement.","Referring to , in an implementation, individual frameworks may define a system of principals associated with GUI widgets that they provide. In an implementation, the per-control policy definition framework  may implement AJAX.NET which provides an ajaxToolkit:TabContainer element, which may be used for creating tabbed user interfaces. AJAX.NET may generate unique principals for each tab, ensuring that neither can access each other. When the final HTML code is produced, either on the server or the client side, these principals may be injected in to the code. The isolation may then be accomplished through the changes to the same-origin policy, as described above, in the policy enforcement engine .","In some implementations, principals may also be manipulated programmatically, through changing the attributes of the surrounding DOM element, by calls to getAttribute and setAttribute. As such, a defined principal may be functionally equivalent to one that was assigned programmatically, and only JavaScript that has the permission to access a DOM element will be able to call setAttribute on it. This prevents malicious JavaScript from re-assigning principals.","Programmatic access to principals may be used for principal delegation, i.e., a piece of JavaScript code that has access to a DOM element may enable another piece of JavaScript code with the same principal to access the DOM element. Similarly, principals on a piece of JavaScript code, such as a function, may be changed as well by assigning to the field principal, such as for instance,","button.onclick=function( ){ . . . }","may be rewritten as","button.onclick=function( ){ . . . } button.onclick.principal=\u2018blog-entry\u2019;","Referring to , this is illustrated as an operational flow of an implementation of a method of enforcing a security policy. At stage , a security policy is received by the client. The client  may receive a Web page  from the server  containing JavaScript functions defining the security policy. At stage , a client-side script execution process is monitored. The client  may monitor operations performed by the client application . At stage , it is determined if the client-side script execution process complies with the security policy. The security policies noted above may be instantiated using callback functions when the web page  is modified by the client application  or a user input. If the execution conforms to the security policy, execution continues at stage . If the execution does not conform to the security policy, then a mutation is transformed. The code or data that does not comply with the security policy may be rewritten to conform to the security policy at the client . Execution of the code continues at stage .","Referring to , distributed applications provided by the server  may be partitioned into a server-side application  and a client-side application . The client-side application  may run, e.g., user interfaces and other functionalities on the client , thereby allowing richer, more reactive interfaces. As a result, a stream of messages may be communicated between the client-side application  and server-side application , representing method calls between these two parts of the distributed application.","However, the server  cannot trust that the client  will actually run the client-side application  that the server  is providing. By running a modified application, the client  may break server security by calling methods of the server-side application  that do not correspond to any normal execution of the client-side application  (e.g., delete server database entries, access other client's data, etc.)","In an implementation, integrity mechanisms make use of replicated code execution on both the client  and the server . The integrity mechanisms may include the server  running its own shadow copy  of the client-side application  in a trusted execution environment, so that it can check that the methods calls coming from the client  correspond to a normal application of the client-side application . If the server  receives a call (e.g., a method call) from the client  that is not issued by its trusted shadow copy , the server  may ignore this call or raise some security alert. Thus, the server  need only review the security of its server-side application  using traditional techniques.","For the shadow copy  being replayed at the server  to be able to accurately \u201creplay\u201d the execution of the client-side application , the shadow copy  may receive the same series of input events as those received at the client  (e.g., mouse clicks, cookies, keyboard entries). In an implementation, the shadow copy  is rewritten before the client-side application  is transmitted to the client  to include additional code that collects all client-side inputs. This may generate a stream of client-to-server method calls that includes the client inputs that can be checked against those coming from the client . In the other direction, the stream of server-to-client messages is then replicated and sent both to the client  and to the shadow copy . In some implementations, the client  may collect client-side inputs and stream them to the server , interleaved with the series of methods calls. It is also possible to omit sending the actual client-to-server method calls, as they may be reconstructed by the server . In some implementations, to keep the client-side application  and the server-side application  in sync, a queue is maintained. A block of event stream is communicated to the server-side application  and the sequence of events is replayed from the queue.","In some implementations, the client inputs may be batched and sent to the server  only when the client  makes an actual method call (e.g., waiting until the user moves away from an input value before sending it over to the client so as to avoid sending every key click, allowing allow certain events from certain places such as keyboard events from the keyboard and not \u201ckeyboard events\u201d generated by another server ). Also, the shadow copy  may be simplified by not producing outputs that are not passed to the server-side application . As such, events from the event stream sent to the server  for applications that are irrelevant may be removed (e.g., graphical code may be removed to improve performance). It is possible to apply this approach selectively, to some secure sub-part of the client-side application . The selection of code and events may be performed systematically at compile time, using type systems or static analyses.","In some implementations, shadow copy  may perform additional security policy checks or run the code in another language (e.g., IL instead of JavaScript) for performance reasons, or to remove a security dependence on the compiler that generates client-side code. In some implementations, the client-side application  that is running at the client  is different from the shadow copy  that is running at the server . In other words, the program is the same, but the code is different. JavaScript may run on the client , where ASP.NET runs on the server .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","110","602","120","604","606","608","110"]},"Exemplary Computing Arrangement",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},"Numerous other general purpose or special purpose computing system environments or configurations may be used.
