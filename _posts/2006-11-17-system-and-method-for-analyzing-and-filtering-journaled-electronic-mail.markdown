title: System and method for analyzing and filtering journaled electronic mail
abstract: A system, method, and program for the processing of large amounts of email based on user-configurable criteria in close to real-time. The invention enables filtering of all journaled emails in an organization for the duration of a regulatory proceeding, or for audit purposes, thus greatly reducing the manual effort required to produce a targeted set of emails. The journaling feature copies all unique emails coming through the distributed email server farm to a smaller set of email mailboxes. The filtering application could run as a batch operation on each of those “journaling” mailboxes at periodic intervals or could run interactively. The user-defined filter criteria are applied to the emails filling up the “journaling” mailboxes, and matches are separated from the non-matches for analysis. The invention can be executed on offline data, such as personal message stores or individual compound message files.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates generally to electronic mail processing for audits and regulatory compliance and, more specifically, to analysis and filtering of electronic mail from various input data sources.","Large corporations having thousands of employees communicate with each other using standard commercial electronic mail software applications such as Microsoft Outlook and IBM Lotus Notes that are processed through Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino in a client-server relationship. A large volume of electronic mail messages is sent and received daily using these and other commercial electronic mail (email) applications.","As the growth of electronic mail communications in all types of businesses has increased dramatically over the past decade, so has the need to journal and archive these electronic communications for audits, regulatory compliance and potential legal discovery. Governmental requirements for storing electronic communications has significantly affected operation of messaging systems. Many companies are implementing solutions to archive all sent and received electronic mail for long periods of time.","When a company is under an audit or other regulatory proceeding, it may be required to provide electronic mail communications pertaining to certain criteria. Manually processing archived electronic mail could take several months depending on the scope of the search that is required. A number of vendors provide software and solutions to address the needs of the electronic discovery market, but are generally very expensive and may require that archived data be sent to the vendor's site for processing.","There is a need for a system and method that enable filtering of all electronic mail company-wide for the duration of a regulatory proceeding or for increased responsiveness to audit requests or electronic discovery requests. The present invention is directed to such a filtering solution that works in conjunction with journaling of electronic mail by electronic mail servers.","The present invention is directed to a method, system and program product for analyzing and filtering large volumes of email based on user-configurable criteria in near real time. The analysis and filtering system is also referred to herein as the mail analyzer system. The present invention provides a system that filters all emails company-wide, thus greatly reducing the manual effort required to produce a targeted set of emails. The invention also significantly increases responsiveness to an audit request.","There are two main components of the mail analyzer solution: a backend journaling feature of electronic mail servers and a filtering application. The filtering application is applied to journaled email. The journaling feature of electronic mail server copies all unique emails coming through the distributed electronic mail server farm to a smaller set of electronic mail server mailboxes. The filtering application can be run as a batch operation on each of the journaling mailboxes at some specific time interval, e.g., every fifteen minutes. User-defined filter criteria are applied to the emails filling up the journaling mailboxes, and matches can be separated from the non-matches for further analysis. Matches are copied to an output mailbox; non-matches are discarded.","The steps involved in the mail analyzer process include: (1) loading a job configuration file and initializing job settings; (2) initializing a personal store (PST) and\/or mailbox outputs; (3) analyzing PST and\/or mailbox inputs; (4) removing duplicates from the mailbox outputs; and (5) generating reports and writing them to disk or email.","In one aspect of the invention, a method, system and program product are provided for analyzing and filtering a plurality of electronic mail messages. Each electronic mail message from an input source is copied to a journal mailbox. A plurality of electronic mail messages are then moved to a local store for analysis, where a plurality of filter criteria are applied to each electronic mail message in the local store. Each electronic mail message that matches the filter criteria is determined. A corresponding predefined action is applied to each electronic mail message that matches the filter criteria.","The following description of the invention is provided as an enabling teaching of the invention and its best, currently known embodiment. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes can be made to the embodiments described while still obtaining the beneficial results of the present invention. It will also be apparent that some of the desired benefits of the present invention can be obtained by selecting some of the features of the present invention without utilizing other features. Accordingly, those who work in the art will recognize that many modifications and adaptations of the invention are possible and may even be desirable in certain circumstances and are part of the present invention. Thus, the following description is provided as illustrative of the principles of the invention and not in limitation thereof since the scope of the present invention is defined by the claims.","An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described in the context of an electronic mail server environment. The concepts are applicable to electronic mail servers such as Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino. The Mail Analyzer system performs searches on email sources and performs a set of actions on the search results. The email sources can include email server mailboxes, personal store (PST) files and compound message (MSG) files. Messages stored in PST files are easily overlooked during email backup and retention processes. PST files increase storage and backup overhead and are very difficult to audit.","Definition of Terms:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["job","Compilation of information that defines the search process, "]},{"entry":[{},"including job inputs, job outputs, job rules, and optionally a "]},{"entry":[{},"job status file and job reports."]},{"entry":["job input","Source from which emails are read.

Message-only journaling creates a copy of all messages and the corresponding message header data to and from users on a mailbox database and sends the message copy to a specified mailbox. BCC journaling is message-only journaling with the added ability to capture the BCC recipients. Envelope journaling differs from the other two types in that it permits archiving transport envelope information. This includes information about the recipients who actually received the message, including BCC recipients and recipients from distribution groups. Envelope journaling is most commonly used for compliance purposes. Journaling cannot be enabled on public folder stores.","Journaling is enabled at the mailbox storage level by the administrator entering a mailbox where the journalized messages are sent. The message is delivered to the journal recipient mailbox and journalized using MAPI message format. Journalized messages can be retrieved from the journal recipient mailbox by using Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol version 4.1 (IMAP4). This also provides a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) format for the message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["20","22","24","26","28","30","10","40","44","42","46","42","46","50","52"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","42","12","50","42","50","60","70"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","304","306","308"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":"400"},"Each rule is examined against the input as indicated in logic block . First, the rule's input name is checked to determine if it references the input currently being examined. The status of the rule against this input is determined next. If the rule has been completed, then processing advances to the next rule. It is also determined if any rules that the currently examined rule depends on have completed successfully. The next step in rule processing is to determine if there is an action to be performed for the rule and if the action is valid. Then a check is made to determine if the output specified in the action exists and if the output is valid.","The folder specified by the rule is searched as indicated in logic block . If the specified folder contains sub-folders, the sub-folders are searched as well. The results for each folder are merged into a single collection of matched emails as indicated in logic block . In decision block , a determination is made as to whether email matches were found in the input. If matches were found, the rule's action is applied as indicated in logic block . Since this step is the most expensive, except for searching, it can be divided into several concurrent actions to increase throughput. Typically, the number of concurrent actions depends on the number of allowable connections to the output mailbox. This value is configurable at the application level.","In decision block , a test is made to determine if there is an additional rule to examine for the input. If there is, the processing logic returns to logic block  to process the next rule. After all rules have been applied to all inputs, and if configured to do so, each output is analyzed to remove duplicates as indicated in logic block . Duplicates are identified through their Internet message ID, which should be globally unique. This will not account for the same email being sent to many people, if each recipient's email is found to be a match, since they will have different ID's. Temporary files such as PST files used for moving emails from the Exchange server for local processing are deleted if the journaled electronic mail analysis and filtering application is configured to do so. The analysis and filtering process is exited in logic block .","There are some settings of the application that can be controlled by command line parameters.

At start up, the mail analyzer application loads the default job file, as determined in the mail analyzer application configuration file or by a file name specified via the command line. As illustrated in , this results in the property grid in the Job Settings tab of the mail analyzer user interface being populated with the data from that file.","To run the loaded job, the user\/administrator clicks the Run button causing the application mail analyzer to run the job. The mail analyzer application will examine the job settings to determine if they are valid, displaying a list of validation errors and warnings if there are any, or just proceeding to run the job if not. At this point, the Job Progress tab of the mail analyzer user interface as illustrated in  becomes active and begins displaying statistics and event notifications.","Below the property grid on the left side of the window illustrated in  are two buttons: Refresh Job Settings and Validate Settings. Clicking on the Refresh Job Settings button will update the property grid to reflect the current state of the job settings. Sometimes the property grid can get out of synchronization with the job settings. For example, this could occur when the Inputs property is expanded and then a new input is added. Clicking on the Validate Settings button examines the settings and displays a list of validation warnings and errors if there are any.","Once the job is running, the job can be cancelled by clicking the Cancel button on the mail analyzer user interface. Depending on the current operation, it could take a few seconds to fully stop the job.","Alternatively, an existing job file can be opened or a new one created through the file pull-down menu illustrated in . If files had been opened previously, they will appear in the Recent Files sub-menu. Also, the values in the property grid on the Job Settings tab can be saved to a file by selecting Save from the File menu. Additional information about editing jobs is described below.","Next to the File menu is the Tools menu illustrated in . The tools menu contains items for opening a message store editor and for browsing the local cache folder. The message store editor allows the user to edit the properties of emails and some other entities in a PST file, and can be useful for testing purposes. The local cache folder is the location in which the mail analyzer application stores files for local processing, such as when using an Exchange mailbox as an input source.","The Help menu, illustrated in , contains an item to access information about the mail analyzer application.","In background (or silent) mode, typically run as a scheduled or batch operation, the mail analyzer application loads the default job or one specified via the command line and then runs the job. The job can only be cancelled in this mode by terminating the process.","Most attributes and operations of a job can be customized in the Job Settings tab of the user interface. These are customized with the property grid in the user interface.","When the mail analyzer application first loads, or when a new or existing job file is opened through the File menu, the Job Settings tab  depicted in  becomes visible and the property grid within it populates with that job's settings. There are six properties of a job that can be edited through this interface: the job Name , Inputs , Outputs , Rules , Status  and Reports . All except the job name property expand to reveal additional properties. For properties that accept file names, the paths for those files can be referential, with the root being the mail analyzer application directory. Furthermore, job variables can be used to customize property values. Property names marked with an asterisk in the tables below can accept job variables.","Each cell in the property grid (e.g., Name) has contextual help  which is displayed at the bottom of the property grid. When a property like Inputs  is expanded and a new input is added to the list, that addition may not be represented in the property grid. When this happens, clicking the \u201cRefresh Job Settings\u201d button  at the bottom of the mail analyzer user interface screen will repopulate the property grid with the correct values.","Certain properties of the job settings can contain job variables, which are substituted with the values they represent. Some of these variables are only valid within a certain scope, such as the variable representing the rule name being only valid for properties related directly to a rule.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0067"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["$(JobName)","The name of the job."]},{"entry":["$(RuleName)","The name of the rule currently being applied.
