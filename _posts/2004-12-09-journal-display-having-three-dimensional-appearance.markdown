{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of graphical displays of journals. In particular, embodiments of this invention relate to presentation of journals having a three dimensional (3D) appearance when displayed by a monitor.","One of the problems with current computer journals and other documentation, especially but not uniquely documentation for games, is that customers do not read it. One reason for this is our traditional means of rendering the information on a monitor is boring and breaks the \u201cimmersion\u201d of the player in their game. In this context, there is a need to greatly increase the emotional involvement of a reader or writer of a document. For example, involving a reader in a travel or sports journal could increase the reader's comprehension and interest in the subject of the journal.","Accordingly, a system for dynamically presenting journals is desired to address one or more of these and other disadvantages.","The invention increases the emotional involvement of a reader or writer of a journal (such as a travel or sports journal) by providing a journal in 3D electronic form, and by modeling the behavior of a journal, including turning pages, fast browsing through pages, writing and editing directly to a page, and in particular rendering pages, including all pictures and movies, onto the curved surfaces of a page. The invention also may be used to present documentation with an application such as a game in the form of a fully animated journal, so that there is little if any break from the feel of the application. Indeed, an animated journal tends to add to the real feel rather than detract from it.","In one form, the invention comprises a graphical user interface for use with a computer system including a display and a user selection device for selecting audio files, video files, and image files. An engine responsive to a format file referenced to the selected audio files, the selected video files and the selected image files defines a content and a format of a 3D journal. The engine generates journal display data defining a 3D journal image in accordance with the defined content and the defined format, the journal display data being provided to the display and corresponding to a 3D model.","In another form, the invention comprises a computer readable medium having stored thereon a data structure of a journal. The data structure provides a display to create a 3D image of the journal. The data structure comprises a 3D model and a format file referenced to selected audio files, selected video files and selected image files. The 3D model and the format file are configured to define journal display data representing a 3D journal image in accordance with the format file, the journal display data being provided to the display and corresponding to the 3D model.","In another form, the invention comprises a computer readable storage medium that stores a software program comprising an application component, a documentation component related to the application component and a graphical user interface component for displaying the documentation as a 3D image.","In another form, the invention comprises a method. Audio files, video files and image files are selected. A 3D journal image according to a format file referenced to the selected audio files, the selected video files and the selected image files is provided as a layout. The 3D journal image is displayed in accordance with the format file and corresponding to a 3D model.","In another form, the invention comprises a computer readable medium comprising instructions for selecting audio files, video files and image files; laying out in a 3D journal image according to a format file referenced to the selected audio files, the selected video files and the selected image files; and displaying the 3D journal image in accordance with the format file and corresponding to a 3D model.","Alternatively, the invention may comprise various other methods and apparatuses.","Other features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.","Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the drawings.","Referring first to , an exemplary block diagram illustrates the various components of one embodiment of a 3D (three dimensional) journal system  for providing a 3D digital journal display (i.e., a journal image) having a 3D appearance according to the invention. As used herein, journal includes at least the following: book, volume, tome, manuscript, paperback, hardback, periodical, magazine, paper, academic journal, weekly, monthly, quarterly, diary, bulletin, review, publication, document, text file, or any other documentation. For example, the 3D journal image may be an on-line magazine, an interactive children's book, a scrapbook, a photo album, a personal journal, a diary, a newsletter, a catalog and a log book. As a further example, the journal may be an on-line magazine, both as a facsimile of a published magazine\u2014giving exact copies of the printed page, or with added features such as audio, movies and animations, both for the editorial content and the advertising. Another implementation may be an on-line company newsletter. Another example is a highly animated children's book\u2014with animations including for example talking figures, or 3D models of aircraft, planets, or other educational subjects. Another example is an on-line catalog, such as a mail-order catalog distributed on-line, where the buyer can browse the catalog, and select any item (perhaps by clicking on it). Selecting an item will take the user to the on-line store to order the item. Those skilled in the art will recognize other forms for the journal.","In one form, the system  is a graphical user interface  for use with a computer system (such as illustrated in ) including a monitor  or other display and a user selection device such as a mouse (see reference character  in ). The system  includes or has access to audio files , video files , and image files . The user uses the selection device to select files which define the content and\/or format of the journal. The selected files are referenced to the format file. A slide show directory  including such files separately or in combination may also be included.","The system  includes a layout engine  and a 3D rendering engine  which work together to present journal display data to the monitor  resulting in the monitor displaying a working 3D model of a journal in which each page, including the covers, are modeled in 3D, and are rendered in 3D. One underlying paradigm of the invention is a hardcover book which, because of the digital media element, becomes a \u201cmagic\u201d book, with videos and audio tracks playing, and slide shows being stepped through. Optionally, the system  may include a bookshelf engine  by which a plurality of journals reside on bookshelves, which are animated versions of a real bookshelves, allowing a user to sort their books according to date or author or other criteria. It also enables applications to add their own journal to the bookshelf.","Layout Engine ","Among other things, the layout engine  controls the list of journal entries including various entry types in an entry list, handles saving and loading, reading and writing to a blog, as well as 2D rendering capabilities, repagination, printing, transferability (pack & go), style sheets and settings, and more.","The layout engine  is responsive to a format file which defines the format of the 3D digital journal to be imaged. For example, the format file may include a journal file  which may be part of the layout engine . In one form, the journal file is in XML format containing all the journal settings and the entries in the journal. The journal file is referenced to selected audio files , selected video files  and selected image files  which define the content of the 3D journal. The format file may also include a style sheet file  which may be in any format (e.g., XML format) and is a collection of settings that can be applied to the 3D digital journal.","Rendering Engine ","The 3D rendering engine  generates the journal display data provided to the monitor  for defining a 3D journal image according to the format and content defined by the layout engine. This image corresponds to a 3D model .","The 3D rendering engine provides the 3D drawing functions for the 3D journal system . It also provides user interaction with the 3D journal system , such as turning pages, selecting entries, and playing media files. The 3D rendering engine  provides at least one of the following functions: browsing pages, curved video, writing, editing on a 3D surface, and user inputs. Further, the functions of the 3D rendering engine  may include one or more of the following areas: animation and navigation, displaying journal entries, and editing.","As noted above, as part of the construction of each journal file , the user references or links to selected audio files , selected video files , selected image files  and selected slide shows . The system  includes a video playback component  responsive to the rendering engine  for rendering the selected video files  as part of the 3D journal display. The system  also includes an audio playback component  responsive to the rendering engine  for rendering the selected audio files  as part of the 3D journal display. Selected image files  and selected slide shows  are also linked to the layout engine  for conversion into the page layouts that are rendered as part of the 3D journal display for rendering as part of the 3D journal display.","The rendering engine  communicates with the layout engine  at startup, when pages are rendered, when the user makes a selection from the journal (hit detection), to playback media and to update pages.","It is contemplated that the layout engine and the rendering engine may be integrated into a single component, that part of the function of the layout engine may be accomplished by the rendering engine and visa versa, that part of the rendering engine may be embodied in the rendering engine and visa versa, and that either the layout engine or the rendering engine can be several components. For example, the layout engine may create a journal.","Blog ","Another optional feature of the layout engine  is reading and\/or writing to a blog . A blog (short for weblog) is often a mixture of what is happening in a person's life and what is happening on the Web, a kind of hybrid diary\/guide site, although there are as many unique types of blogs as there are people. On the Internet, a blog is a personal journal that is frequently updated and intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent the personality of the author or reflect the purpose of the Web site that hosts the blog. Topics sometimes include brief philosophical musings, commentary on Internet and other social issues, and links to other sites the author favors. The frequent characteristics of the blog are its journal form, typically a new entry each day, and its informal style. The author of a blog is often referred to as a blogger.","Bookshelf Engine ","It is also contemplated that a user may have a plurality of journals so that there is a need for managing the journals. In order to provide such management, the bookshelf engine  may be a part of system  for generating bookshelf display data defining a 3D bookshelf image of the plurality of 3D journal images of the plurality of journals. The bookshelf display data is provided to the monitor  and corresponds to a bookshelf file . The bookshelf file may reference an art file  which defines the graphical look of the bookshelf. The art files  contain the graphics for the book ends. For example, the bookshelf engine may comprise one or more of the following features which may be implemented in various ways (e.g., included as menu items, operations and\/or actions, included as a user interface, and\/or included as buttons, etc.): new journal, add to bookshelf, remove from bookshelf, show shelf, new shelf, rename shelf, fixed shelf width, flexible shelf width, append content, move to shelf, pack a copy, permanently delete, rename\/restyle, sort on, add book ends, remove book ends, select book ends, select background, find, copy.","According to one embodiment of the bookshelf engine  for managing a plurality of journals in the form of books, the books reside on bookshelves, which are animated versions of real bookshelves, allowing a user to sort their books according to such aspects as title, date and\/or author. The bookshelf engine  also enables other software applications to add their own journal to the bookshelf. It is possible the bookshelf could exist as a tile (\u201ctile\u201d means an application that runs permanently and is accessible through a small user interface that runs on the task bar; also referred to as a \u201cpersistent application\u201d), and so have all the users books available to them all of the time. In one form there are two bookshelves created on installation, a \u201cSystem\u201d bookshelf containing help documentation journals, and a \u201cDisplay\u201d bookshelf containing sample journals for the new user to examine. A user is free to add as many new bookshelves, identified by a unique name, as they like.","An optional component that interfaces with the bookshelf engine  is a sound effect engine  and sound file . The sound effect engine  provides sounds in response to user action or input relating to the bookshelf or otherwise involving the bookshelf engine . There may be sound effects associated with most of the operations, such as opening and closing a book, adding a piece of text or media, removing a piece of text or media, page turning, moving a chunk of pages in one go.","The bookshelf engine  communicates with the 3D rendering engine  when journals are opened and closed. The bookshelf engine  communicates with the layout engine  when a new journal is created, when appending a file to an existing journal, when restyling an existing journal or when packing a journal.","In one form, the software aspects of system  may be a computer readable medium having stored thereon a data structure of a journal. The data structure provides data to a display to create a 3D image of the journal and comprises the 3D model  and the format file (e.g., journal file  and\/or style sheet ) referenced to the selected audio files , the selected video files  and the selected image files . The journal display data defines a 3D journal image in accordance with the format file. The journal display data is provided to the monitor  and corresponds to the 3D model .","In yet another form, the graphical user interface of the invention may be used in combination with an application program. In particular, the invention would comprise a computer readable medium software program including an application component, a documentation component related to the application component, and the graphical user interface component for displaying the documentation as a 3D image. The application component and the related documentation component may be at least one of the following: a game and instructions for game, a flight simulator game and a flight manual for the flight simulator game, an adventure game and a map for the adventure game, a media application and a manual of the media application, an interactive resource and a tutorial for the resource, a movie and editorial content related to the movie, an animated movie and editorial content related to the animated movie, a video clip and advertising attached to the video clip, an audio clip and advertising attached to the audio clip.","For example, 3D documentation for games according to the invention would provide help in the form of a journal would not break the user out of the \u201cimmersion\u201d in the game, such as a flight manual in a flight simulator game, a magic book in an adventure game, or as part of the adventure game for example in the form of a book of maps. Software (or other instructional) tutorials, where the pages turn automatically as the videos are played and possibly the text read out loud would also encourage the user to take advantage of the tutorials. The user could interrupt the auto playing at any time, for any reason, and restart it again from any page.","In another form, the invention includes a method wherein the user selects audio, video and image files and lays out in a 3D journal image according to a format file referenced to the selected files, so that the 3D journal image in accordance with the format file and corresponding to a 3D model is displayed.","Referring next to , an exemplary flow chart illustrating operation of the system of  and the interaction between various components is shown. Selected audio files , selected video files  and selected image files  are referenced to the journal file  which is controlled by the style sheet . This referenced journal file  and style sheet file  are used by the layout engine  to create a journal object including entries, a style sheet object and properties, all of which are embodied in data supplied to the monitor . The layout engine  also responds to user actions as indicated by blocks labeled repagination, save\/load journal file, save\/load style sheet, 2D rendering and entry list manipulation. The bookshelf engine  includes user actions such as new journal, restyle journal, append to journal and pack journal which interact with the journal object and with save\/load journal file, save\/load style sheet and entry list manipulation of the layout engine . The 3D rendering engine  includes actions such as 3D rendering, media playback, hit detection and page updates & additions which interact with the journal object and with repagination, save\/load journal file and 2D rendering.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["130","130","130","132","134","136","134","132","136"]},"The computer  typically has at least some form of computer readable media. Computer readable media, which include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media, may be any available medium that may be accessed by computer . By way of example and not limitation, computer readable media comprise computer storage media and communication media. Computer storage media include volatile and nonvolatile, removable and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other data. For example, computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that may be used to store the desired information and that may be accessed by computer . Communication media typically embody computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and include any information delivery media. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the modulated data signal, which has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. Wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media, such as acoustic, RF, infrared, and other wireless media, are examples of communication media. Combinations of any of the above are also included within the scope of computer readable media.","The system memory  includes computer storage media in the form of removable and\/or non-removable, volatile and\/or nonvolatile memory.
