The method includes: making the management apparatus  accept an emergency notification to the site worker (store clerk) (YES of step S); making the management apparatus  display and output the accepted emergency notification on the store terminal  (step S); and making management apparatus  call the IP telephone terminal  to make the site worker (store clerk) recognize the emergency notification (step S).","Specifically, in the management apparatus , the accepting unit  accepts an emergency notification (YES of step S). The accepting unit  allows the recording unit  to record the emergency notification information to the history storing unit , and instructs the display controlling unit  and the calling unit  to issue a notification.","In the management apparatus , the display controlling unit  allows the store server  of the store serving as an object of notification to display and output the emergency notification via the network  (step S). The store server  receives the emergency notification from the management apparatus  and allows the touch panel  of the store terminal  to perform pop-up display of the emergency notification screen  for the emergency notification (step S).","Further, in the management apparatus , the calling unit  instructs the store server  of the store serving as an object of notification to call the IP telephone terminal  via the network  (step S). The store server  receives the calling instruction of the emergency notification from the management apparatus  and calls the IP telephone terminal , so that the IP telephone terminal  receives the call and sounds the ring tone through the alarm speaker  (step S). By this, the store clerk of the store S can immediately notice the ring tone and take a procedure of responding over the IP telephone terminal .","The store clerk that has responded over the IP telephone terminal , for example, hears the notification message from the alarm speaker  of the IP telephone terminal , looks at the touch panel  of the store terminal  that is located at the same work site, and confirms the emergency notification screen  (). When the store clerk has responded over the IP telephone terminal , in the management apparatus , the detecting unit  detects that the IP telephone terminal  has responded to the calling of the emergency notification (YES of step S), and the recording unit  records the date and time of the confirmation and the like to the history storing unit  (step S).","Here, although not illustrated in the drawings, when no response has been made for more than a predetermined period of time to the calling by the emergency notification of the IP telephone terminal , the calling by the calling unit  is stopped, and the recording unit  records that there has been no response to the history storing unit .","As described above, the notification system  of the present exemplary embodiment can allow the store clerk to notice the emergency notification promptly and with certainty by allowing the store terminal  that the store clerk of the store uses to perform a pop-up display output of the message of the emergency notification, by calling the IP telephone terminal  that is used on the side of the store terminal , and by ringing. Thus, the store clerk can notice the notification outstandingly easily as compared with the case of using only the pop-up display.","Also, a case in which the store terminal  outputs an alarm sound may be considered. However, in the case of the store terminal  placed in the store, there is a possibility that the volume of the speaker is adjusted and lowered on the store side, leaving a fear that the store clerk may not notice the alarm sound.","By using the IP telephone terminal , in addition to ringing, when the store clerk has answered the call, a sound massage telling the presence or absence of the message of the emergency notification and a content itself of the message of the emergency notification can be output by sound thereby transmitting the message to the store clerk.","The notification system  of the present exemplary embodiment can be easily constructed by newly introducing the IP telephone terminal  to the store system using an existing POS terminal. As shown in , it can be easily realized by being incorporated into an application software AS as a module software MS or a customizing software CS constituting the present notification system .","Also, the notification system  of the present exemplary embodiment can be applied, for example, to a food distribution site where various kinds of boxed meals are produced from a food processing factory such as prepared daily dishes and sold at a convenience store or a shop. For example, in the event that any problem has been found in the source material of the food and the food must be recalled urgently, the notification system  of the present exemplary embodiment can issue an instruction of recalling the commercial product as an object of recall to each store to be recalled promptly and with certainty.","As shown above, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described. However, these are exemplifications of the present invention, so that one can adopt various constructions other than those described above.","For example, in another exemplary embodiment, the IP telephone terminal  may include a reading apparatus (not illustrated in the drawings) that reads the certification information of the user (store clerk) of a medium for user certificate, and the certification information of the medium for user certificate of the site worker (store clerk) is read in accordance with the calling of the emergency notification and transmitted to the management apparatus  via the store server . The management apparatus  may include a receiving unit (not illustrated in the drawings) that receives the certification information of the site worker (store clerk) that has responded to the calling to the IP telephone terminal  from the IP telephone terminal  via the interface unit  and a certification unit (not illustrated in the drawings) that certifies the site worker (store clerk) based on the certification information of the site worker (store clerk).","Further, the recording unit  of the management apparatus  records to the history storing unit  that the site worker (store clerk) has not responded to the calling of the emergency notification at the work site when the site worker (store clerk) has not been certified by the certification unit. Further, recording unit  records to the history storing unit  the certified site worker (store clerk) as the site worker (store clerk) that has responded to the calling of the emergency notification at the work site when the site worker (store clerk) has been certified by the certification unit.","The medium for user certificate may be a magnetic card, an ID card, an RFID tag, or the like. Alternatively, it may be a biometric authentication, so that various modes such as a fingerprint, a vein, an iris, and a face are may be considered.","With this construction, the site worker (store clerk) that has responded to the IP telephone terminal  and recognized the emergency notification can be identified, and whereby the site worker (store clerk) that confirms the emergency notification may possibly confirm the contents of the emergency notification with responsibility. Also, when a person other than the person in charge or an outsider has confirmed the emergency notification, the output of the emergency notification can be continued until the person in charge confirms the emergency notification, so that the emergency notification can be transmitted to the person in charge with certainty.","Further, the management apparatus  may further include a controlling unit (not illustrated in the drawings) that allows the calling unit  to call the IP telephone terminal  with respect to a work site at which it is recorded that there is no response to the emergency notification by the site worker (store clerk) by making reference to the history information recorded in the history storing unit .","With this construction, with respect to a store S that has not responded to the calling of the emergency notification, the calling unit  may be made to call the IP telephone terminal  repetitively, for each store S.","Also, in the management apparatus , the above controlling unit may allow the display controlling unit  to display and output the emergency notification again on the store terminal  of the store S.","Further, the detecting unit  may receive not only the response of the IP telephone terminal  but also the confirmation notification of the emergency notification by an operation of the confirmation button  of the emergency notification screen  displayed on the touch panel  of the store terminal , and allow the recording unit  to record them to the history storing unit .","Here, in the above-described exemplary embodiment, a construction has been given in which the message of the emergency notification is popped up on the displaying unit (touch panel ) of the information processing terminal (store terminal ); however, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the IP telephone terminal  may have a displaying unit (touch panel ) having a screen size capable of displaying a message, and the display controlling unit  of the management apparatus  may allow the touch panel  of the IP telephone terminal  to display and output a message of an emergency notification. Alternatively, the display controlling unit  of the management apparatus  may allow the displaying unit (not illustrated in the drawings) of the store server  to display and output a message of an emergency notification.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, the invention is not limited to these embodiments. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the claims."],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and other objects, advantages, and features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description of certain preferred exemplary embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
