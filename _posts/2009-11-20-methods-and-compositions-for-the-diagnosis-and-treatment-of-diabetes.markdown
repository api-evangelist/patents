{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a U.S. national stage of PCT\/EP2009\/008256 filed on Nov. 20, 2009 which claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/116,866 filed on Nov. 21, 2008, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","The present invention relates to methods, assays and compositions for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. More particularly, the invention regards the use of glutamate transporters and\/or receptors expressed in pancreatic islet cells as therapeutic tools or targets for the identification or treatment of individuals suffering from or susceptible to diabetes.","The pathogenesis of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by the gradual loss of insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells that precedes the onset of hyperglycemia. In T1DM beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune process. Conversely, in T2DM is the combination of different stressful insults (insulin resistance with chronic insulin hypersecretion, low-grade chronic inflammation, redox stress and hyperglycemia itself) that, progressively, destroy the beta cells, with following hyperglucagonemia. During the preclinical stage, the remaining beta cells tend to compensate for ongoing beta cell loss by increasing insulin secretion and cell replication. These compensatory mechanisms maintain near-normoglycemia but do not arrest unremitting beta cell death. Ultimately, when residual beta cell mass is reduced to about 50% of the original, hyperglycemia occurs. Theoretically, the long preclinical phase present in both T1DM and T2DM, could allow therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting beta cell survival thereby preventing the development of overt diabetes.","The diagnosis of T1DM is commonly done in the presence of fasting hyperglycemia, a positive urine ketone test, and the detection of serological markers of diabetes autoimmunity. These are autoantibodies directed against the beta cell antigens insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and insulinoma antigen 2 (IA-2). With the exclusion of insulin, none of these antigens is specific for the beta cell, being expressed also by other islet cell types (IA2) and GABAergic neurons (GAD). A proportion of patients shows autoantibodies directed against unknown cytoplasmic and membrane islet cell antigens (islet cell autoantibodies, ICA and islet cell surface autoantibodies, ICSA). Early reports showed that ICSA are cytotoxic for the beta cells but the actual existence of ICSA has been recently questioned. In subjects at risk of developing T1DM (first degree relatives of patients with T1DM) is the number and titre of the different autoantibodies that predict the development of the disease. Noteworthy, none of the autoantibodies described so far is pathogenic and they appear to be the results of \u201cantigen spreading\u201d consequent to beta death.","The diagnosis of T2DM is often occasional. T2DM patients are usually overweight, if not frankly obese, and insulin resistant. Insulin resistance induces beta cell hypersecretion and stimulates beta cell replication but, in genetically predisposed subjects, these compensatory mechanisms are destined to fail. In these subjects, chronic beta cell overstimulation, low-grade inflammation and redox stress (all features of the insulin resistant metabolic syndrome) progressively destroy the beta cells. Beta cell death is mediated by the accumulation of cytotoxic misfolded islet amyloid pancreatic polypeptide (IAPP) oligomers. Normally, IAPP is localized on the insulin granules and is co-secreted with insulin. Under stress conditions, IAPP processing by the endoplasmic reticulum become abnormal and misfolded cytotoxic IAPP oligomers accumulate in the cell.","In addition, replicating beta cells are even more susceptible than quiescent beta cells to misfolded IAPP oligomers so that the growth of new beta cells is severely impaired. Eventually, misfolded IAPP form fibrils that precipitates in the so called amyloid deposits which are the pathologic markers of T2DM but are present already before the onset of overt hyperglycemia.","T1DM treatment is based on the administration of exogenous insulin injections. Human recombinant or synthetic insulin analogs are injected before every meal and at bedtime to replace the lack of glucose-stimulated and basal endogenous insulin secretion. Insulin injections are cytoprotective since, by putting at rest the residual beta cells, can slow their functional exhaustion. Moreover, insulin administration restores near-normal glucose levels and reduces the deadly effect that chronic hyperglycemia \u201cper se\u201d exerts on the beta cells (so called glucose-toxicity).","Pharmacological treatment of T2DM is based on the administration of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) which are divided into insulin sensitizers (metformin and glytazones) and insulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas and glinides). Both class of OHAs are efficacious in restoring near-normoglycemia but none of them can arrest the progressive beta cell death. This is the reason why, over time, exogenous insulin administration is often required also in T2DM patients (so called secondary failure of OHAs). Recently, it has been suggested that insulin sensitizers, by probably reducing the metabolic demand and decreasing beta cell overstimulation, can increase their life span while sulphonylureas, by acting in the opposite way, can actually accelerate beta cell death and the secondary failure to OHAs.","Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) and is critical for essentially all physiological processes ranging from control of motor and somatosensory functions to information processing and storage. Recent studies highlight the presence of glutamate signal in peripheral tissues, and in particular in the endocrine pancreas (for a review see Skerry et al, 2001; Nedergaard et al, 2002; Hinoi et al, 2004).","At least five Na-dependent high affinity glutamate transporters (EAAT 1-5) have been identified. EAAC1\/EAAT3 and EAAT4 are expressed in neuronal cells, GLT1\/EAAT2 and GLAST\/EAAT1 are restricted to glial cells, whereas EAAT5 is a retina specific glutamate transporter (for a review see Danbolt, 2001). Among these, GLT1 exhibits the highest level of expression and is responsible for most glutamate transport (Rothstein et al, 1996).","An high-affinity glutamate\/aspartate transporter has been cloned from pancreas (Manfras et al, 1994), and pharmacological blockade of glutamate transporters with the non-selective TBOA inhibitor has been shown to modulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic islets of (Weaver et al, 1998). However, it is not yet clear whether glutamate transporters are exclusively present in islet of Langherans, whether different isoforms are expressed in a cell specific-manner, as in the CNS, and their exact physiological relevance.","The invention is based on the unexpected finding that the glutamate transporter GLT1 is selectively expressed in pancreatic beta cells and that suppression of the transporter activity by pharmacological blockade or RNA interference is responsible for beta cells death, suggesting that a dysfunctional glutamate transport at the level of pancreatic cells or antibody-mediated blockage are involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1D or T2D). This finding is supported by the observations that autoantibodies against GLT1 are present in the serum of T1D patients and that intracellular GLT1 is detected in T2D patients, suggesting a direct role of the transporter in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis or progression.","According to a first embodiment, the invention is directed to a method for the diagnosis of diabetes in a subject, which comprises determining the presence of antibodies reactive to GLT1 in a biological fluid, preferably in a serum sample. Several assay formats can be used, in either liquid or solid phases, preferably through immuno-techniques in which the GLT1 transporter or an immunologically-active fragment thereof (e.g. an epitope-containing peptide) are contacted with a serum sample in conditions allowing the formation of an immune complex which is then detected by immunochemical or immunoenzymatic reactions. Alternatively, the presence of antibodies reactive to GLT1 in a biological fluid, preferably in a serum sample, is detected through a functional assay. A pancreatic cell line selected from beta TC3 or a cell line transfected with the GLT1 cDNA is incubated with a serum sample in conditions allowing the interaction of the antibodies with GLT1, and the modulating effects on GLT1 are determined through uptake experiments using a GLT1 radiolabelled substrate (glutamate or aspartate). The methods and assays according to the invention can be applied to the screening of individuals affected by diabetes or of subjects at risk of developing diabetes or LADA (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults).","In a further embodiment, the invention provides a method for the identification of compounds modulating the activity, expression or surface localization of GLT1, which comprises incubating the candidate compound with a pancreatic cell line selected from beta TC3 or a cell line transfected with the GLT1 cDNA and determining the GLT1-modulated effects through uptake, immunoprecipitation and western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments (described in materials and methods). Since GLT1 is endogenously expressed in beta-TC3, the latter can be used in cell-based assays for the screening of molecules having potential antidiabetic activity.","As discussed above, the autoimmune response against GLT1 transporter was found to be one of the pathogenic factors involved in diabetes onset\/progression. Therefore it may be desirable to induce immunotolerance to GLT1 by administering the protein or an antigenic fragment thereof to a subject affected by or susceptible to diabetes. Thus, in a further embodiment, the invention provides the use of GLT1, an immunogenic fragment or derivative thereof, for the preparation of an immunotherapeutic composition for the treatment of diabetes.","According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the GLT1 (mouse and rattus)\/EAAT2(human) splice variant GLT1a, belonging to the SLC1a2 family (solute carrier family 1 (glial high affinity glutamate transporter), member 2) is the reference GLT1 protein for use in the applications herein provided. The human and mouse GLT1 amino acid sequences are identified in SEQ ID NO:1 and 2, while the corresponding nucleotide sequences are identified in SEQ ID NO:3 and 4, respectively. The invention further includes variants and isoforms of such proteins, which maintain the functionality of glutamate transporter. For the uses herein envisaged, the structure and sequence of the GLT1 protein or peptides can be modified for such purposes as increasing purification, enhancing therapeutic or preventive efficacy, or stability (e.g. shelf life ex vivo and resistance to proteolytic degradation in vivo).","Compounds increasing GLT1 activity or preventing GLT1 inactivation, internalization or degradation, can be used to prevent beta cells death and develop a cyto-protective therapy. Accordingly, in another embodiment the invention regards the use of molecules positively modulating, particularly increasing the expression or function of GLT1 for the preparation of antidiabetic medicaments. Examples of such molecules include, but are not limited to, growth factors (Figiel M, Maucher T, Rozyczka J, Bayatti N, Engele J (2003) \u201cRegulation of glial glutamate transporter expression by growth factors\u201d, Exp Neurol 183:124-135), neuroimmunophilin (Ganel R, Ho T, Maragakis N J, Jackson M, Steiner J P, Rothstein J D (2006) \u201cSelective up-regulation of the glial Na-dependent glutamate transporter GLT1 by a neuroimmunophilin ligand results in neuroprotection\u201d, Neurobiol Dis 21:556-567), cAMP analogs or agents activating adenylate cyclase (Schlag B D, Vondrasek J R, Munir M, Kalandadze A, Zelenaia O A, Rothstein J D, Robinson MB (1998) \u201cRegulation of the glial Na-dependent glutamate transporters by cyclic AMP analogs and neurons\u201d Mol Pharmacol 53:355-369), thiazolidinic compounds whose mechanism of action involves the activation of GLT1 transcription, estrogens, neuronal secreted factor(s) including the pituitary adenylyate cyclase activating peptide (Figiel M, Engele J (2000) \u201cPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a neuron-derived peptide regulating glial glutamate transport and metabolism\u201d J Neurosci 20:3596-3605), beta-lactam antibiotics such as ceftriaxone (Rothstein J D, Patel S, Regan M R, Haenggeli C, Huang Y H, Bergles D E, Jin L, Dykes Hoberg M, Vidensky S, Chung D S, Toan S V, Bruijn L I, Su Z Z, Gupta P, Fisher P B (2005) \u201cBeta-lactam antibiotics offer neuroprotection by increasing glutamate transporter expression\u201d; Nature 433:73-77). Ceftriaxone, which is currently used in human therapy, is particularly preferred for increasing GLT1 expression in endocrine pancreas. The data indicate an action of Ceftriaxone also in a beta cell model, therefore also beta lactam-like compounds acting on GLT1 transcriptional activity, but lacking anti-microbial activity and non BBB permeant will provide an ideal tool for the prevention or treatment of diabetes mellitus.","Since the inhibition or suppression of the transporter activity causes the accumulation of extracellular glutamate which produces excitotoxic effects by sustained activation of glutamate receptors, inhibiting the ionotropic glutamate receptors, particularly AMPA and kainate receptors, will provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for protecting beta cells from glutamate toxicity. Accordingly, in a further embodiment, the invention relates to the use of glutamate receptor antagonists, preferably compounds able to inhibit or block AMPA and\/or kainate ionotropic glutamate receptors, for the manufacture of medicaments for the prevention or treatment of diabetes.","The compounds modulating glutamate-transporter or glutamate-receptor function\/activity can be administered separately or in combination; the amount of each compound will depend on the pharmaceutical form, administration route, potential interactions with other drugs, general conditions of the patient and on the severity of the disease. Generally, an effective amount will allow a partial or total recovery from the disease or the alleviation of its symptoms.","Diagnostic Immuno Assay for Screening of DMT1 and LADA","The GLT1 protein is used in immunochemical assays to detect the presence of autoantibodies against the antigen in a serum sample and identify an individual at risk of developing diabetes. The GLT1 protein is incubated with the biological fluid to be tested under conditions which allow the antigen to complex with antibody in the fluid. The detection of complexes formed between the GLT1 protein or peptide and antibody is indicative of the presence of antibody against GLT1 protein in the serum sample.","Immunoprecipitation Assay","In this assay, GLT1 protein, recombinant or endogenously expressed in cells and tissues (brain), is incubated with the sample of biological fluid to be tested. The incubation is performed under conditions which allow the interaction between GLT1 protein and antibodies directed against the protein. The presence of complexes is revealed by immunoprecipitation with protein-A conjugated to beads and resolved by western blotting techniques using anti-GLT1 antibodies as a primary reagent and the appropriate secondary antibody. The detection of complexes formed between the GLT1 protein or peptide and antibody is indicative of the presence of antibody against GLT1 protein in the serum sample. The amount of label associated with the immunocomplex is compared to positive and negative controls to assess the presence or absence of anti-GLT1 antibody. In these assays, an immunoreactive form of the GLT1 protein, native, synthetic or recombinant forms of the whole molecule, or portions immunoreactive with an antibody against GLT1 may be used. In addition, modified GLT1 protein which has an amino acid sequence sufficiently duplicative of the GLT1 amino acid sequence so that they are immunoreactive with an autoantibody against GLT1 and provide an assay of suitable sensitivity and reliability can also be used. Beads formed of glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, dextran, agarose, sepharose, magnetic materials or other materials can be used to absorb protein-A.","Solid Phase Immunometric Assay","In this assay, purified GLT1 protein is immobilized on a solid phase support. The support is incubated with the sample of biological fluid to be tested. The incubation is performed under conditions which allow the interaction between immobilized GLT1 protein and antibodies directed against the protein. The solid phase support is then separated from the sample and a labeled anti-(human IgG) antibody is used to detect human anti-GLT1 antibody bound to the support. The amount of label associated with the support is compared to positive and negative controls to assess the presence or absence of anti-GLT1 antibody. In these assays, an immunoreactive form of the GLT1 protein or peptide are used. Native, synthetic or recombinant purified forms of the whole molecule, or portions immunoreactive with an antibody against GLT1 may be used. In addition, modified GLT1 protein which has an amino acid sequence sufficiently duplicative of the GLT1 amino acid sequence so that they are immunoreactive with an autoantibody against GLT1 and provide an assay of suitable sensitivity and reliability can also be used.","In the solid phase immunometric assay, purified GLT1 antigen can be adsorbed or chemically coupled to a solid phase support. Various solid phase supports can be used, such as beads formed of glass, polystyrene, polypropylene, dextran or other material. Other suitable solid phase supports include tubes or plates formed from or coated with these materials. The GLT1 protein can be either covalently or non-covalently bound to the solid phase support by techniques such as covalent bonding via an amide or ester linkage or adsorption.","The support containing GLT1 protein, functions to selectively insolubilize antibody in the liquid sample tested. In a blood test for anti-GLT1 antibody, the support is incubated with blood plasma or serum. Before incubation, plasma or serum can be diluted with normal animal plasma or serum. The diluent plasma or serum is derived from the same animal species that is the source of the anti-(human IgG) antibody. The preferred anti-(human IgG) antibody is goat anti-(human IgG) antibody. Thus, in the preferred format, the diluent would be goat serum or plasma. The conditions of incubation, e.g., pH and temperature, and the duration of incubation are not crucial. These parameters can be optimized by routine experimentation. Generally, the incubation will be run for 1-2 hours at about 4\u00b0 C. in a buffer of pH 7-8.","After incubation, the solid phase support and the sample are separated by any conventional technique such as sedimentation or centrifugation. The solid phase support then may be washed free of sample to eliminate any interfering substances.","To assess human antibody bound to the solid phase support, a labeled anti-(human IgG) antibody (tracer) is used. Generally, the solid phase support is incubated with a solution of the labeled anti-(human IgG) antibody which contains a small amount (about 1%) of the serum or plasma of the animal species which serves as the source of the anti-(human IgG) antibody. Anti-(human IgG) antibody can be obtained from any animal source. However, goat anti-(human IgG) antibody is preferred. The anti-(human IgG) antibody can be an antibody against the Ffragment of human IgG, for example, goat anti-(human IgG) Fantibody.","The anti-(human IgG) antibody can be labeled with a radioactive material such as Iodine, with an optical label, such as a fluorescent material, or with an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase. The antihuman antibody can also be biotinylated and labeled avidin used to detect its binding to the solid phase support.","After incubation with the labeled antibody, the solid phase support is separated from the solution and the amount of label associated with the support is evaluated. The label may be detected by a gamma counter if the label is a radioactive gamma emitter, or by a fluorimeter, if the label is a fluorescent material. In the case of an enzyme, the label may be detected calorimetrically employing a substrate for the enzyme.","The amount of label associated with the support is compared with positive and negative controls in order to determine the presence of anti-GLT1 antibody. The controls are generally run concomitantly with the sample to be tested. A positive control is a serum containing antibody against the GLT1 protein; a negative control is a serum from individuals (e.g., non-prediabetic individuals) which does not contain antibody against the GLT1 protein.","Diagnostic Functional Assay for Screening of DMT1 and LADA","In this assay, a pancreatic cell line selected from beta TC3 or a cell line transfected with wild type or recombinant GLT1 cDNA is incubated with the sample of biological fluid to be tested. The conditions of incubation, e.g., pH and temperature, and the duration of incubation can be optimized by routine experimentation. In a blood test for anti-GLT1 antibody, generally cells are incubated with blood plasma or serum for 2-3 hours at 37\u00b0 C. Before incubation, plasma or serum is diluted at 20%.","The interaction of the antibodies with GLT1 is determined through uptake experiments using a GLT1 radioactive substrate (glutamate or aspartate).","The modulation (up or down regulation) of uptake values is indicative of the presence of antibodies against GLT1 protein in the serum sample. The uptake values obtained in the presence of serum samples are corrected for the non-GLT1-mediated glutamate\/aspartate uptake and compared to controls to assess the presence or absence of anti-GLT1 antibodies. The controls are uptake values obtained with non pre-diabetic or non diabetic subjects. The non-GLT1-mediated glutamate\/aspartate uptake is calculated performing uptake experiments in the presence of 0.3 mM DHK. This method could be useful for routine T1D diagnosis, and presents several advantages: it is sensitive, specific and the results are quantitative and suitable for serial estimations. The assay, performed in 96-well plates, can be automated, allowing high-throughput screening, and resulting in materials, samples and time saving procedures; therefore the costs and the experimental variability can be reduced. It doesn't require any particular radioisotope, so less dangerous radioisotopes can be used for the aminoacid labelling.","Modification of GLT1 Molecule","A modified GLT1 protein or modified peptide can be produced in which the amino acid sequence has been altered, such as by amino acid substitution, deletion, or addition, to modify immunogenicity and\/or increase therapeutic effectiveness or to which a component has been added for the same purpose. For example, additional amino acid residues derived from the GLT1 sequence or other sequence can be attached to either the amino terminus, the carboxy terminus, or both the amino terminus and carboxy terminus of the GLT1 protein. Non-GLT1 derived sequences include residues which may increase solubility or facilitate purification, such as a sequence attached to the GLT1 protein to aid purification of protein produced by recombinant technique (STREP-TAG). Site-directed mutagenesis of DNA encoding the GLT1 protein or a peptide thereof can be used to modify the structure of the GLT1 protein or peptide. Such methods may involve PCR (Ho et al., Gene, 77:51-59 (1989)) or total synthesis of mutated genes (Hostomsky, Z., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 161:1056-1063 (1989)).","Antigenic fragments or peptides derived from the GLT1 protein are within the scope of the invention. Fragments within the scope of the invention include those which induce an immune response in mammals, preferably humans, such as the production of IgG and IgM antibodies or elicit a T-cell response such as T-cell proliferation and\/or lymphokine secretion and\/or the induction of T-cell anergy. Fragments of the nucleic acid sequence coding for the GLT1 protein are also within the scope of the invention. As used herein, a fragment of a nucleic acid sequence coding for the GLT1 protein refers to a nucleotide sequence having fewer bases than the nucleotide sequence coding for the entire amino acid sequence of the GLT1 protein. Nucleic acid sequences used in any embodiment of this invention can be cDNA as described herein, or alternatively, can be any oligodeoxynucleotide sequence having all or a portion of a sequence represented herein, or their functional equivalents. Such oligodeoxynucleotide sequences can be produced chemically or automatically using known techniques.","Given the nucleic acid sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of the GLT1 protein, it is possible to identify peptides which contain T- or B-cell epitopes. An epitope is the basic element or smallest unit of recognition by a receptor where the epitope comprises amino acid residues essential to receptor recognition. For example, peptides containing T cell epitopes associated with interaction with the T-cell receptor (TCR) on helper T-cells can be identified. These T cell epitopes are usually at least 7 amino acid residues in length and, when associated with the MHC II glycoprotein present on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, form a complex that interacts with the TCR. Relevant peptides comprising at least one T cell epitope of the PM-1 protein can be identified by dividing the GLT1 protein into overlapping or non-overlapping peptides of desired lengths, which may be produced recombinantly or synthetically. The peptides can be cultured in the presence of antigen-presenting cells in a standard T-cell proliferation assay to determine the ability of the peptide to stimulate T-cell proliferation as indicated by, for example, cellular uptake of labeled thymidine. Peptides derived from the GLT1 protein with altered structures can be designed which retain their ability to complex with MHC II glycoprotein but fail to effect reaction with TCR by assessing the ability of these altered peptides to inhibit the T-cell proliferation in the presence of known activators in this assay.","Immunological Therapy","The GLT1 protein can be employed in novel therapeutic methods to treat an autoimmune disease in an individual. The GLT1 protein, or antigenic fragment thereof, can be administered to a diabetic or prediabetic individual to prevent the progression or development of Type I diabetes in the individual. The GLT1 protein, or at least one antigenic fragment, in the form of a therapeutic composition, is administered simultaneously or sequentially to the individual in an amount effective to prevent the progression or development of diabetes in the individual. In addition, the therapeutic composition can be administered under non-immunogenic conditions to tolerize the individual to the GLT1 protein, rather than elicit an immune response. As used herein, tolerization is defined as non-responsiveness or diminution in symptoms upon exposure to the GLT1 protein. Techniques for administration of tolerizing doses of antigens are known in the art, including administration of the GLT1 protein, or fragment thereof, in the absence of adjuvant and\/or in soluble form. Administration of a peptide derived from the GLT1 protein comprising at least one T cell epitope may tolerize appropriate T cell subpopulations such that they become unresponsive to the GLT1 protein. Therapeutic methods that utilize antagonist peptides of the GLT1 protein which bind the MHC II glycoprotein but result in a complex which is not interactive with the TCR can also be used.","The GLT1 protein or peptide thereof may be administered alone or in concert with anti-CD4 antibodies or other CD4 blockers. This approach to conferring tolerance is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,681,760 and 4,904,481. In this approach, the antigen and the anti-CD4 antibodies or immunoreactive fragments are administered concomitantly. By \u201cconcomitant\u201d administration is meant within a time frame which permits the anti-CD4 component to block the helper T-cell response to the antigen. The nature of \u201cconcomitant\u201d in this sense is described in the above-referenced U.S. patents, incorporated herein by reference.","The GLT1 protein or fragment thereof is combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent to form a therapeutic composition. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include polyethylene glycol (Wie et al. International Archives of Allergy and Applied Immunology 64:84-99 (1981)) and liposomes (Strejan et al. Journal of Neuroimmunology 7:27 (1984)). Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Such compositions will generally be administered by injection subcutaneously, intravenously or intraperitoneally, oral administration, (e.g., as in the form of a capsule) inhalation, transdermal application or rectal administration.","Pharmacological Therapy","Although T1M and T2M are caused by different mechanisms, both types are characterized by a pronounced reduction in beta-cell mass (more than 50%), in late stages. As decreases in cell mass can take several years to develop, a cyto-protective therapy may be useful for both types of diabetes. At least two different targets have been identified:","1. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA, kainate): data from  indicate that the pharmacological inhibition of AMPA, kainate receptors protects beta cells from glutamate toxicity. According to the invention, the following antagonists can be used for the treatment or prevention of diabetes or LADA.","AMPA\/Kainate Selective: Antagonists","References: Tarnawa et al (1989) Electrophysiological studies with a 2,3-benzodiazepine muscle relaxant: GYKI 52466.

Prolonged exposure to glutamate resulted in sustained reduction of \u03b2cell viability: \u03b2-cell toxicity was already detectable at 0.05 mM glutamate (11.53+0.52% reduction in RGR; p<0.01) and it was maximal at 5 mM glutamate (51.46+2.61% reduction in RGR; p<0.01). In contrast to \u03b2TC3, in \u03b1TC1 cells glutamate toxicity was detectable only at the highest glutamate concentration (5 mM) but significantly lower than in \u03b2TC3 (p<0.01) ().","We did not find any effect on cell survival after acute exposure to glutamate (15 min, 0.5 \u03bcM glutamate: a treatment effective on neurons, Perego et al, 2000), or after exposure to glutamate for 2 days, both in \u03b1TC1 and in \u03b2TC3 cells.","The different viability of \u03b2TC3 and \u03b1TC1 cells cultured for 5 days in the presence of high glutamate concentrations was not due to differences in medium composition (RPMI for \u03b2TC3 and D-MEM for \u03b1TC1), since cell death was even more pronounced in D-MEM medium. These data indicate that \u03b2-cells, like neurons, are vulnerable to the toxic effects of glutamate even though to a much lesser extent, as expected.","To further investigate the mechanisms by which chronic glutamate exposure may cause \u03b2-cell cytotoxicity, we performed a TUNEL assay. As shown in , culture of \u03b2TC3 cells in presence of 0.5 mM glutamate for 5 days resulted in a significant increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells, indicating that glutamate induces \u03b2-cell death by apoptosis.","In the CNS, glutamate toxicity is caused by persistent activation of ionotropic receptors which are also expressed by pancreatic islet cells (Choi, 1988; Matute et al, 2007). To determine whether glutamate-induced \u03b2-cell death is mediated by the same mechanisms involved in neurotoxicity, ionotropic channels were blocked with their antagonists, in the presence of 5 mM glutamate (). Vulnerability of \u03b2-cells to glutamate was partially prevented by co-administration of glutamate with 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), a non-selective AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist (30% increase in RGR relative to 5 mM glutamate; p<0.05) but not D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. No significantly differences in \u03b2-TC3 viability were detected in the presence of glutamate receptor antagonists, when given alone. These data indicate that glutamate-mediated \u03b2-cell cytotoxicity, as in the CNS, is mediated by extracellular glutamate and is triggered by the activation of AMPA and\/or kainate ionotropic glutamate receptors.","The Na-Dependent Glutamate Transporter GLT1A is Exclusively Expressed by \u03b2TC3 Cells.","In the CNS, the extracellular glutamate concentration is maintained at relatively low levels by high-affinity glutamate transporters and in particular by GLT1. Although a high-affinity glutamate transporter has been cloned from pancreas (Manfras et al, 1994) and D-aspartate accumulation has been demonstrated in pancreatic islets (Weaver et al, 1998), it is not clear the pattern of expression of the different glutamate transporter types in endocrine cells. To this purpose, RT-PCR experiments were carried out using type-specific primers in \u03b1TC1 and \u03b2TC3 cells. RT-PCR (35 cycles) of total RNA from \u03b2TC3 cells resulted in the amplification of the GLT1A type, while all the other types were undetectable even after 40 PCR cycles. None of the canonical high-affinity glutamate transporters were detected in \u03b1TC1 cells after 40 cycles.","Western blotting experiments confirmed the exclusive expression of GLT1 in the \u03b2TC3 cells. As shown in , a previously characterized anti-GLT1 antibody (Perego et al, 2000) identified two bands, running with an electrophoretic mobility of 60 and 120 KDa, in immunoblots of \u03b2TC. The molecular weight of these bands correspond with the molecular weight of GLT1 proteins identified in brain samples, thus confirming the expression of GLT1 in \u03b2-cells. No bands were detected using a pre-immune serum or anti-GLAST and anti-EAAC1 antibodies.","Immunofluorescence studies performed with the anti-GLT1 antibody revealed that the transporter was expressed in the vast majority of \u03b2TC3 cells and that it was prevalently located at the cell membrane where it could fulfil its function (). No staining was detected in \u03b1TC1 cells or when the primary antibody was omitted.","To characterize the presence of functional transporters, experiments of 3H-D-aspartate (a non-metabolized GLT1 substrate Danbolt, 2001) uptake were performed in \u03b1TC1 and \u03b2TC3 cells. As shown in , \u03b1TC1 and \u03b2TC3 cells showed a similar Na-independent (ChCl) 3H-D-aspartate uptake. Conversely, Na-dependent D-aspartate uptake was significantly higher in \u03b2TC3 than in \u03b1TC1 cells.","Subtype specific expression of glutamate transporters was analyzed pharmacologically using dihydrokainate (DHK) a selective GLT1 inhibitor (Arriza et al., 1994). Na-dependent aspartate uptake in \u03b2TC3 was completely inhibited in the presence of 1 mM DHK, indicating that glutamate uptake in these cells is exclusively driven by GLT1. On the contrary, in \u03b1TC1 cells Na-dependent D-aspartate uptake was not inhibited by DHK, confirming that these cells express very low level of the GLT1 transporter, alternatively, they may express an unidentified glutamate type\/s.","To determine whether the \u03b2-cell-exclusive expression of GLT1 observed in cell lines occurs also in vivo, the expression and the localization of the transporter was analyzed in human isolated islets and human pancreas sections (Varese and HSR). Human islets were isolated as described by Ricordi (Ricordi et al, 1988) and the expression of the glutamate transporter GLT1a was assessed by RT-PCR (), immunoprecipitation () and uptake experiments (). RT-PCR of total RNA with human type-specific primers resulted in amplification of the GLT1a type of glutamate transporter (35 cycles) ().","Immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments confirmed the expression of GLT1 in islet of human pancreas (). In SDS-PAGE, the anti-GLT1 antibody revealed the presence of bands running with an apparent electrophoretical mobility of 60 and 120 KDa and corresponding to the monomeric and oligomeric form of GLT1, respectively, in both islets and brain immunoprecipitates.","The function of GLT1 was assessed by measuring D-aspartate uptake (). A clear Na-dependent transport of aspartate was present in isolated human islets and was completely inhibited by 0.1 mM DHK. Taken together, these data show that pancreatic islets express a functional glutamate transporter and that GLT1 is the main regulator of glutamate clearance in human islets.","In order to confirm the \u03b2-cell specific expression of GLT1 in vivo, immunocytochemical and experiments were carried out in human pancreas sections. As shown in , anti-GLT1 reactivity was restricted to a group of clustered cells, most likely correspondent to an islet. Noteworthy, few cells in the islet's core were completely devoid of GLT1 signal, thereby suggesting a cell-specific expression. At higher magnification, GLT1 staining was confined to the cell membrane, a localization consistent with the physiologic role of this transporter.","No staining for EAAC1\/EAAT3 or GLAST1\/EAAT2 was detected in the endocrine pancreas.","To identify which of the islet endocrine cell types expresses GLT1a, double immunofluorescence experiments were carried out using the anti-GLT1 antibody and hormones as markers of the different cell types (). Immunostaining with chromogranin, a marker of endocrine cells, confirmed the expression of GLT1 only in the islets. GLT1 signal was concentrated at, or immediately below, the plasma membrane where it co-localized with chromogranin granules fused to the cell membrane; no intracellular GLT1 staining was detected. Similar staining at the cell-cell boundary was detected in the majority of insulin-positive cells in the islet core, indicative of GLT1 expression in \u03b2-cells. On the contrary, GLT1 was not observed at the plasma membrane of glucagon-positive cells. These data suggest that GLT1 is not expressed in the plasma membrane of \u03b1 and \u03b4-cells, or if expressed, is under the level of detection. These conclusions were supported by a computer-assisted image analyses system (Table I). To mathematically evaluate co-localization between GLT1 (channel1) and hormones (channel2), the PDM value (product of the differences of pixel intensity from the mean intensity of each channel) was calculated. As shown in Table I, the intensity correlation quotient (ICQ=(number of positive PDM)\/(total number of PDM)\u22120.5), calculated on the entire area, was positive for the insulin\/GLT and chromogranin\/GLT double immunostainings, thus indicating that there was co-localization. On the contrary, the negative ICQ value calculated for the glucagon\/GLT1 and somatostatin\/GLT1 double immunostaining, was indicative of segregated stainings. Taken together these data demonstrate that GLT1 is mainly expressed in \u03b2-cells.","Table I.

Single channel confocal images were analyzed for pixel intensity with the JImage software.

established the exclusive \u03b2-cell expression of GLT1, both in cell lines and in human islet of Langherans, we investigated the role of GLT1 in the islet physiology.","Several independent lines of evidence indicate that glutamate controls secretion of both glucagon and insulin in pancreatic islets, via activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors (Hoy et al, 1995; Inagaki et al, 1995; Muroyama et al, 2004; Bertrand et al, 1993). Therefore, GLT1 controlling the extracellular concentration of glutamate, may affect hormone secretion.  showed the results from a representative experiment where human isolated islets were exposed to 3.3 or 16.7 mM glucose in the absence and the presence of either L-glutamate (0.5 mM), DHK (0.3 mM) or both L-glutamate and DHK, and insulin secretion measured. Insulin secretion was increased in the presence of both glutamate and DHK at 16.7 mM glucose (87\u00b138% increase over the level induced by 16.7 mM glucose control). No effect were detected in the presence of DHK or glutamate alone at 16.7 mM glucose or in any of the conditions tested at 3.3 mM glucose. These data are consistent with a key role of GLT1 in glutamate clearance in the islet, and indicate that this system contributes to the glutamatergic signalling pathway that modulates hormone secretion in the islet.","In the CNS GLT1 has been clearly shown to protect neurons from excitotoxicity. Given the vulnerability of \u03b2cells to glutamate, we investigate whether inhibition of GLT1 may affect cell survival (). Exposure to DHK induced a dose-dependent inhibition of Na-dependent D-aspartate uptake in \u03b2TC3 with IC50=0.05 mM DHK (). Five days incubation in the presence of the blocker caused a reduction in \u03b2TC3 viability that was already maximal at 0.05 mM DHK (6.17% decrease in RGR; p<0.01) (). Cytotoxicity was due to apoptosis as revealed by a TUNEL assay performed after incubation of \u03b2TC3 cells with 0.1 mM DHK for five days () (p<0.01).","Similar results were obtained after molecular GLT1a knocking down by shRNA. Two different shRNAs (SH1 and SH3) were effective in reducing the GLT1 total expression, as measured by western blotting and uptake experiments (FIGS. Da and Db). A 30% down regulation in GLT1 surface activity was sufficient to significantly increase cell apoptosis after 24 hour incubation in the presence of 0.5 mM glutamate, as determined by TUNEL assay (p<0.05) (FIG. Dc). More interestingly, the SH3 shRNA construct caused increased cell apoptosis also in normal growing medium.","These data, taken together, are consistent with a key role of GLT1 in glutamate clearance and in protecting \u03b2-cells from excitotoxicity. Moreover, they indicate that impairment of the GLT1 surface activity is sufficient, by itself, to induce \u03b2-cell death at glutamate concentrations proximal to physiological ranges.","We next tested the vulnerability of human islets to glutamate toxicity. Glutamate incubation for three days caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability that reached the statistical significance at the highest glutamate concentration (18% RGR decrease at 5 mM glutamate, p<0.01) in high glucose (16.7 mM glucose), only (). Interestingly, inhibition of GLT1 with 0.1 mM DHK reduced to 0.5 mM the cytotoxic glutamate concentration (). Cell death was due to apoptosis () and was restricted to \u03b2-cells as demonstrated by the TUNEL assay performed on dispersed isolated islets.","Our data suggest a key role of GLT1 in protecting \u03b2-cells from apoptosis, therefore up-regulation of its activity or expression is expected to be \u03b2-cell protective. Recently, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics were identified as potent stimulators of GLT-1 expression (Rothstein et al. 2005). In particular, the \u03b2-lactam ceftriaxone (CEF) was shown to increase both brain GLT1\/EAAT2 expression and functional activity in vivo and to be neuroprotective in vitro in models of ischemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, based in part on protection from glutamate toxicity (Rothstein et al. 2003 and 2005). This action appears to be mediated through increased transcription of the EAAT2 gene (Su et al., 2003, Rothstein et al. 2005). 20). Five days incubations with ceftriaxone caused a dose-dependent protection from glutamate toxicity (). This effect was, at least in part, mediated through GLT1\/EAAT2 because increased transporter's expression was measured in the presence of 10 \u03bcM ceftriaxone ().","Our data, taken together, identify glutamate and \u201cexcitotoxicity\u201d as new possible pathogenetic factors and demonstrate that the glutamate transporter GLT1 is a key regulator of islet's glutamate clearance and \u03b2-cell survival.","Given the selective expression of GLT1 in \u03b2-cells, and its direct involvement in cell survival, we hypothesized that GLT1 could have been an important target molecule in diabetes pathogenesis. We therefore examined this possibility in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which are both characterized by increased \u03b2-cell death and reduced \u03b2-cell mass.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-dependent autoimmune disease, characterized by the selective destruction of islets' \u03b2-cells (Anderson and Bluestone, 2005). Autoantibodies against insulin and other antigens expressed by either \u03b2-cell and neurons are commonly found in the serum of T1D patients, years before the clinical manifestation of the disease (Bingley et al, 1994; Pihoker et al, 2005; Achenbach et al, 2006). The same autoantibodies are found in some T1D relatives, and their number and titre can predict the progression form prediabetes to diabetes (Tan, 1991). Among them are autoantibodies against insulin (Palmer, et al. 1983), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) (Solimena et al., 1988 and 1990; Baekkeskov, et al. 1990), IA2 (Bonifacio et al, 1995) and the cationic efflux transporter ZnT8 (Wenzlau et al, 2007).","Due to its membrane localization, exclusive for the \u03b2-cell, we reasoned that GLT1 could be an ideal T1D autoantigen. In addition to that, given the direct involvement of GLT1 in \u03b2-cell survival, autoantibodies against GLT1 may be pathogenetic in sharp contrast with all the autoantigens described to date. At this regard, cytotoxic islet cell surface autoantigens (ICSA) have been described many years ago (Van der Winkle et al, 1982) although their precise identification is still missing.","Therefore, we searched anti-GLT1 antibodies in sera of T1D patients.","Three T1D sera and 1 control samples were used to immunoprecipitate the corresponding antigen from lysates of GLT1A-transfected COS cells or mock COS cells (). As a positive control, lysates were immunoprecipitated with the specific anti-GLT1 antibody. As shown in , the anti-GLT1 antibody immunoprecipitated a protein of 60 KDa from lysates of GLT1-transfected COS cells. The same specific 60 KDa reactivity was detected in immunoprecipitates obtained with sera of T1D patients but not with the control serum, indicative of the presence of anti-GLT1 antibodies in T1D patients.","To further confirm this result, serum from 5 healthy controls (C1-C5) and 5 GAD- and ICA-positive T1D patients (D1-D5), were used to immunoprecipitate the GLT1 protein from the brain P2 fraction (previously shown to contain high amount of native GLT1 protein, ). The rabbit-GLT1 immune serum and human sera specifically reacted with a 60 KDa band which correspond to the SDS-PAGE migration of the whole GLT1 protein. Quantification of sera reactivity to the 60 KDa band by densitometry revealed that the mean intensity of immunoprecipitates obtained with sera from T1D patients was 2 fold higher than control sera.","Immunoprecipitation results were confirmed by immunofluorescences studies (). GLT1 positive sera stained the membrane of COS cells transfected with GLT1A, while no staining was detected with control sera. The detected reactivity was specific for GLT1, since no signal was observed in COS cells transfected with the EAAC1 glutamate transporter.","Finally, we tested the ability of circulating anti-GLT1 auto-antibodies to modulate the transporter's activity. \u03b2-TC3 cells were incubated with serum samples for three hours at 37\u00b0 C. and the GLT1 activity measured by uptake experiments. While the control samples showed similar uptake values (100\u00b18.3%), incubation with T1D serum samples caused activity changes ranging from 11.94% to 364.31% relative to control subjects. Considering positive a sample if its uptake value was more then 2SD above or below the mean of controls subjects, we observed that 12 out of 23 T1D (52%) and one out of 12 putative control subjects (8%) were positive. Interestingly, sera found positive with the functional assay, present autoantibodies against GLT1.","Taken together, these data suggest that GLT1 may represent a novel T1D autoantigen and that anti-GLT1 antibodies may directly modulate the transporter's activity. Therefore, detection of anti-GLT1 antibodies by immunological or functional assays represent new and complementary methods for the diagnosis of T1D. Note that functional assay is rapid, easy to","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multifactorial disease characterized by inadequate insulin secretion by pancreatic \u03b2cells and impaired insulin action at the target tissues. Insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, \u03b2-cell hypersecretion and amyloid deposition, and hyperglycemia (glucotoxicity) are responsible for the progressive decline in \u03b2-cell mass. Increased oxidative stress and chronic inflammation have been shown to directly affect GLT1 expression, localization (Vanoni et al, 2006) and activity (Trotti et al, 1998). We therefore examined by immunocytochemistry (), whether GLT1 was differently expressed in islets of T2D patients. In pancreatic sections obtained from T2D subjects, the typical localization of GLT1 in the cell membrane was completely lost, and GLT1 was exclusively detected in the cytoplasm. Intracellular staining was observed in 5 out of 7 pancreases examined and in none of the 5 pancreases obtained by normal (non diabetic) controls.","Overall, these data indicate that GLT1 is selectively expressed in \u03b2cells and glutamate transporter inhibition causes \u03b2-cell death mediated by high glutamate.
