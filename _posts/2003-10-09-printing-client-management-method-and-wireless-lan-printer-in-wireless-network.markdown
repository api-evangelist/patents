{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2003-4254, filed on Jan. 22, 2003, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a printing client management method and a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) printer in a wireless network, and more particularly, to a printing client management method and a wireless LAN printer using Media Access Control (MAC) addresses as an index based on the IEEE 802.11b standard.","2. Description of the Related Art","Currently, printing operations are generally performed using a wired LAN. A client\/server printer driver system that utilizes such a wired LAN is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,069.","However, alteration and extension of performance of the network and the system in the wired LAN is difficult due to the characteristics of a wired network. In addition, alternation and extension of the network and the system of the wired LAN require large investment, and wired LANs are not able to support a mobile communications system.","Thus, demand for wireless LANs to expand the performance of or replace wired LANs has increased. Here, a wireless LAN is characterized as having the ability to transfer and receive data through air, using radio frequency (RF), or infrared rays. Wireless LANs have the advantages of easy installation, and rapid network deployment. In addition, a wireless LAN does not require interconnecting wires, thus, allows flexible installation and movement of terminals, enabling simple maintenance and repair of the wireless LAN. These advantages have brought increasing attention towards the use of wireless LANs.","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) established the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard to describe an over the air interface between a wireless client, a base station or access point, and other wireless clients. The IEEE 802.11b standard, established in September 1999, provides a maximum speed of 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz band.","The IEEE 802.11b standard has been applied in the development of wireless LAN printers. When a computer is network enabled within the IEEE 802.11b standard to perform a printing operation using an IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN printer, the computer should associate with a Basic Service Set (BSS). While included as a BSS printing client, similar to other stations connected within the IEEE 802.11b such as a computer, an IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN printer performs various processes in order to exchange upper protocol packets including scanning, synchronization, association, disassociation, authentication, de-authentication, and transfer.","The wireless LAN printer functions as a network server. If the wireless LAN printer is included in the BSS, printing clients that wish to associate with the BSS perform synchronization, association, and authentication processes in relation to the wireless LAN printer. However, association with the wireless LAN printer is limited to approximately ten printing clients.","On the other hand, printing clients that have not been authenticated to receive services of the wireless LAN printer are able to associate with the wireless LAN printer. In such cases, because the number of printing clients allowed to associate with the wireless LAN printer is limited, the printing clients that have been authenticated to receive services of the wireless LAN printer are unable to associate with the wireless LAN printer. In other words, authenticated printing clients are unable to associate with the wireless LAN printer or perform the printing operation due to the presence of non-authenticated printing clients.","An aspect of the present invention provides a printing client management method to associate authenticated printing clients with a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) printer by forming a list of printing clients using media access control (MAC) addresses as an index.","Another aspect of the present invention provides a wireless LAN printer to associate authenticated printing clients with a wireless LAN printer by forming a list of printing clients using MAC addresses as an index.","Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.","Accordingly, there is provided a printing client management method of a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) printer, which functions as a network server and manages at least one printing client in a LAN. The method comprises: extracting information from Media Access Control (MAC) frames of printing clients that associate with a Basic Service Set (BSS) that includes the wireless LAN printer; forming a list of the printing clients by using MAC addresses of the MAC frames as indexes; and managing printing operations of the printing clients according to the list.","According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a wireless LAN printer, which functions as a network server and manages printing client in a LAN. The wireless LAN printer comprises: an extraction unit, which extracts information from MAC frames of printing clients that associate with a BSS that includes the wireless LAN printer a list forming unit, which forms a list of the printing clients by using MAC addresses of the MAC frames as indexes; and a management unit, which manages printing operations of the printing clients according to the list.","According to one aspect, both the wireless LAN printer and the printing clients operate within the IEEE 802.11b standard.","According to another aspect, the list of printing clients formed using MAC addresses as an index is restructured in real time according to a beacon signal, and the list is updated when states of the printing clients change.","Further, according to another aspect, the list of printing clients denotes the states of the printing clients in relation to the wireless LAN printer including fields for at least one of synchronization, association, and authentication.","According to another aspect, the list of printing clients includes fields specifying whether each printing client is allowed to associate with the wireless LAN printer.","According to another aspect, the list of printing clients includes fields assigning a printing priority to the printing clients.","According to yet another aspect, the list of printing clients includes fields denoting whether specific functions of the wireless LAN printer can be used by a printing client.","Another aspect of the invention comprises a Personal Computer, a Personal Digital Assistant, or a cellular phone that includes a wireless LAN functionality as a printing client.","According to another aspect, the extraction unit, the list forming unit, and the management unit are implemented in network cards of the wireless LAN printer. While according to another aspect, the units are implemented as hardware or software.","Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the like elements throughout.","In describing different aspects of the present invention, the detailed descriptions of a conventional technique will be omitted when it is determined that the detailed descriptions deviate from the present invention. In addition, the terms used in the description are defined consistent with the functions of elements in the present invention. Thus, the terms may be different depending on the intentions and usages of users and operators. Thus, the terms will be defined based on the description of the present invention.","A wireless Local Area Network (LAN) group that includes a wireless LAN printer is shown in .","Referring to , a wireless LAN printer  and printing clients  communicate in a wireless LAN based on the IEEE 802.11b standard. Here, the wireless LAN printer  functions as a network server. The printing clients  include a Personal Computer (PC) , a laptop computer , a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) , and a cellular phone . The printing clients depicted in  are only illustrative of the various printing clients that may be comprised in a wireless LAN, and a given wireless LAN may include more or less of the printing clients shown in . These and other similar printing clients  perform printing operations using the wireless LAN printer .","A block diagram to illustrate a wireless LAN group that includes a wireless LAN printer according to an aspect of the present invention is shown in .","The wireless LAN printer , according to one aspect of the present invention includes: a Media Access Control (MAC) software , an Application Programming Interface (API) , and an application software . Here, the MAC software  is used to extract information from the MAC frames of the printing clients . The API  forms a list of printing clients  using each of the MAC addresses associated with the MAC frames as an index. The list of printing clients is used to manage the printing operations of the printing clients . The application software  is used to perform the printing operations.","The wireless LAN printer  maintains a wired or wireless connection to a printer management server . The printer management server  includes a wireless LAN printer remote management program .","A flowchart to illustrate a printing client management method according to one aspect of the present invention is shown in .","Referring to , information on the MAC frames of the printing clients  is extracted in operation S via the wireless LAN printer , which functions as a network server that manages multiple printing clients  in a wireless LAN. Thereafter, the list of the printing clients  are formed using each MAC address as an index, in operation S. Next, in response to the list, the printing operations of the printing clients  are managed in operation S.","In order to allow the printing clients  to use the wireless LAN printer  in a wireless LAN, the wireless LAN printer  and the printing clients  should be associated with one BSS . The BSS  is referred to as a wireless LAN group or a link level group and defines a limited space where wireless service can be provided. In other words, the BSS  is a basic network structure in the wireless LAN, or a cell, that is formed of one access point (AP) and at least one terminal.","While included in the BSS , the printing clients  perform various processes including scanning, synchronization, association, authentication, transfer, de-authentication, and disassociation in order to exchange upper protocol packets.","The wireless LAN printer , according to an aspect of the present invention, functions as a network server. In other words, the wireless LAN printer  becomes a BSS master or a link group server. The BSS master is a group owner that generates beacons. In a situation where the wireless LAN printer  is included in the BSS , the printing clients  that wish to associate with the BSS  perform processes such as, synchronization, association, and authentication with respect to the wireless LAN printer . However, association with the wireless LAN printer  is limited to approximately ten printing clients . Thus, it is preferable that only authenticated printing clients  be allowed to associate with the BSS .","To this end, information is extracted from the MAC frames of the printing clients . Thereafter, a list of the printing clients  is formed using each of the MAC addresses corresponding to the MAC frames as an index. Next, using the list, the printing operations of the printing clients  are managed. Since each of the LAN cards has a unique MAC address, each printing client  is distinguished by its respective MAC address.","The hierarchy of the MAC frames is present in the sublayer of the data link layer, which is the second layer of the seven layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) basic reference model. The MAC frames define the transmitting\/receiving method of the frames, the format of the frames, and error detection of data. According to the IEEE 802.11b standard, the MAC frames are referred to as link level frames. The link level frames include three frames, management frames, control frames, and data frames.","The list is restructured in real time according to each of the beacon signals, and the list is updated when the states of the printing clients  change. In addition, the list reflects the states of the printing clients  in relation to the wireless LAN printer  and includes fields regarding synchronization, association, and authentication.","Furthermore, the list of printing clients includes fields specifying whether each printing client  is allowed to associate with the wireless LAN printer . The wireless LAN printer remote management program  in the printer management server  updates the fields specifying association permission. In other words, the wireless LAN printer remote management program  enables the fields denoting association permission in relation to authenticated printing clients, and disables the fields in relation to non-authenticated printing clients. Allowance of the association of the printing clients  with respect to the wireless LAN printer  is determined based on the fields denoting association permission. In the conventional system, when the non-authenticated printing clients associate with the wireless LAN printer , it is impossible for the authenticated printing clients to associate with the wireless LAN printer . However, since the fields denoting association permission are included in the system according to one aspect of the present invention and the system prevents non-authenticated printing clients form associating with the wireless LAN printer , the authenticated printing clients are able to receive services from the wireless LAN printer .","In addition, the list of printing clients includes fields denoting the printing priority of the printing clients . Thus, those printing clients higher in the printing priority are granted access to the printing service prior to those printing clients lower in the printing priority.","Furthermore, the list includes fields specifying whether various functions of the wireless LAN printer  are accessible to each of the printing clients . For example, when the wireless LAN printer  is a high-end printer that includes various functions, such as color printing, photo printing, and mono printing, the list of printing clients includes the fields that specify whether a particular function is accessible to each of the printing clients . Thus, each field is enabled or disabled according to the functions desired by a user, and the change can be requested based on the functions desired by the user.","The list of printing clients is managed in real time and reflects the state of the wireless LAN printer . In the case where a plurality of wireless LAN printers of the same kind are present, the wireless LAN printer remote management program  monitors the number of clients and the traffic of the clients in each group, in relation to each of the wireless LAN printers . The wireless LAN printer remote management program  can rearrange associations so that a wireless LAN printer  having less traffic is associated with additional clients.","It is possible to construct a business model for a printing service provider by using a printing client management method and a wireless LAN printer according to as aspect of the present invention. For example, a printer manager can form a BSS that includes LAN printers installed in airports, subway stations, Internet cafeterias, and department stores. Users who desire access to the printers are assigned an authentication key. During this process, the printer manager or a manager program extracts the MAC address of the printing client, and the MAC address is provided to the wireless LAN printer to initiate a connection timer that corresponds to the printing client. The MAC address is also used to manage the link level of the printer, to request charges to the client, to forcibly stop a printing operation, and to prevent appropriation of a wired equivalent privacy (WEP) key used in a security protocol.","In addition, a log record describing usage of the printer can be stored using the MAC hierarchy. Here, the record is stored in a storage device of the printer or a storage device of the printer management server. Since the MAC addresses are unique, the printer manager can also collect user information by recording a user's device information, and storing marketing information such as the frequency of use associated with a particular printer.","As described above, by preventing association of non-authenticated printing clients with the wireless LAN printer, additional authenticated printing clients are given the opportunity to associate with the wireless LAN printer.","Furthermore, the print manager can provide distinct services by assigning a printing priority to the printing clients and request charges according to the functions of the wireless LAN printer used by the printing clients.","Although a few embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in this embodiment without departing from the principles and spirit of the invention, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The above and\/or other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent, and more readily appreciated from the following description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings of which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 3"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
