Web search engines may also have tight latency constraints. Search engines may typically use three major components: Caches, index servers, and document servers. Large result caches may be used to store previously computed query results over billions of pages crawled by large clusters. As the crawlers are crawling these pages and retrieving page contents, there may be two major challenges. First, pages may change more frequently than a crawler can update a search engine. This may lead to outdated search results that may not be found when a user clicks on a result or may be different from the summary content displayed in a search result listing.","Second, a malicious website may be able to distinguish between types of requestors such as a search engine bot versus a user at a browser. Specifically, a malicious website may identify a search engine bot (or crawler) via User-Agent properties in an request, an IP range associated or other request attributes and may respond with a first set of content for a page that may be designed to achieve a high search engine ranking. Many automated attack kits may build lots of pages for top searched keywords, link them together and even build the content dynamically using other pages such as, for example, wiki entries, news entries, etc. These attack kits may be directed towards getting a page listed in the top search results for the most searched keywords to attract users. Search engine results may contain brief text along with the key subject of the page on the search results listing which may persuade a user that the page is genuine and relevant. Once a user clicks on a search result and the malicious site determines that the request is not from a crawler or search bot, the malicious site may deliver completely different content such as, for example, a fake anti-virus scan page or perform other social engineering attacks to trick the user to download malicious content or even perform \u201cdrive by download\u201d type of attacks in which malware may be automatically downloaded. Web users may suffer from malware, misleading applications, and\/or stale content.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current search engine results management technologies.","Techniques for managing search engine results are disclosed. In one particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a method for managing search engine results comprising receiving a search engine result and associated summary content, receiving requested content associated with the search engine result, comparing, using a computer processor, the summary content and the received requested content, and performing one or more actions in the event the summary content does not match the received requested content.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise notifying a search engine that the summary content does not match the received requested content.","In accordance with other aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may further comprise expediting crawling web content based upon a received notification that summary content does not match the received requested content.","In accordance with further aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may further comprise delisting a network address based upon a determination that received requested content is malicious.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise indicating to a user that summary content is stale.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise providing the received requested content to a user.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise blocking the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise warning a user regarding potential malicious content associated with the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise preventing downloads from a network address associated with the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise one or more of: disabling at least a portion of browser functionality of a browser receiving the received requested content, disabling instantiation of ActiveX controls on a page associated with the received requested content, and preventing interaction with a web form of a page associated with the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more actions may comprise providing a notification to at least one of: an administrator, a security software vendor, a third party solution provider, and one or more additional search engine clients.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may further comprise determining which of the one or more actions to perform based on at least one of: a similarity of the received requested content to the summary content derived from the comparison, a policy, and an analysis of the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may further comprise determining that the received requested content is associated with one or more of malware and misleading content, wherein the determination is based on one or more of: a signature, behavioral analysis, and reputation based analysis.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, comparing may comprise performing a string search for one or more portions of the summary content in the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, one or more portions of functionality may be performed by at least one of: a browser API, a browser plug-in, and a browser component.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, one or more portions of functionality may be performed by a gateway, a web proxy, and a search engine.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as at least one processor readable non-transitory storage medium for storing a computer program of instructions configured to be readable by at least one processor for instructing the at least one processor to execute a computer process for performing the method.","In another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as an article of manufacture for managing search engine results, the article of manufacture comprising at least one non-transitory processor readable medium, and instructions stored on the at least one medium. The instructions may be configured to be readable from the at least one medium by at least one processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to receive a search engine result and associated summary content, receive requested content associated with the search engine result, compare, using a computer processor, the summary content and the received requested content, and perform one or more actions in the event the summary content does not match the received requested content.","In yet another particular exemplary embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a system for managing search engine results comprising one or more processors communicatively coupled to a network, wherein the one or more processors are configured to receive a search engine result and associated summary content, receive requested content associated with the search engine result, compare, using a computer processor, the summary content and the received requested content, and perform one or more actions in the event the summary content does not match the received requested content.","In accordance with additional aspects of this particular exemplary embodiment, the one or more processors may further be configured to expedite crawling web content based upon a received notification that summary content does not match the received requested content.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings.

As illustrated, one or more portions of search result management module  may reside at a client. One or more portions of search result management module  may reside at a network centric location. For example, server A may be a server, a firewall, a proxy server, a gateway, a search engine, or other network element that may perform one or more actions to gather, identify, and\/or block an malicious search engine result and\/or to identify stale or misleading search engine results. According to some embodiments, network  may be an external network (e.g., the Internet) and server A may be a gateway, proxy server, a search engine, and\/or firewall between one or more internal components and clients and the external network.","According to some embodiments, search result management module  may be implemented in several portions which may be co-located or located remote from one another. As discussed, above one or more portions of search result management module  may reside on server A and may analyze and detect malicious search engine results and\/or stale or misleading search results. Indications of detected malicious search engine results may be provided to one or more modules of search result management module  residing on server A and\/or clients , , and .","According to some embodiments, clients , , and\/or  may contain one or more modules of search result management module . If a search engine result is indicated as malicious or stale one or more modules of search result management module  residing on a client may deny access to the search engine result, may provide a warning associated with the search engine result, and\/or may activate security software to address a malware threat. For example, a component of search result management module  may be a browser plug-in or a browser bar which may perform one or more actions to protect a user of the browser from detected malicious search engine results. A browser plug-in or a browser bar may also inform a user of received content which does not match summary search engine content.","According to some embodiments, search result management module  may store or access summary search engine result summary information received in response to a web search (e.g., a search performed by client , , and\/or ). Summary search result summary information may contain information retrieved by a search engine while crawling a webpage. When a web search is performed a search engine may traverse an index using keywords contained in the search to retrieve relevant summary search engine results. Some search engine embodiments may cache one or more portions of search result summary information. Search result management module  may store or access these results as they are provided to a web search requestor (e.g., client , , and\/or ). When a search result is requested (e.g., a user of client , , and\/or  clicks on a result link) search result management module  may compare results received in response to a request with search engine result summary information. According to some embodiments, search result management module  may search for a portion of search result summary information in the results received in response to the request. For example, search result management module  may use a string of text from search engine result summary information and use a string search, regular expressions, or other mechanisms to compare the string from the summary results to the received results. A match containing an entire substring may indicate that the summary search engine results accurately represent the contents of the webpage. No match or an approximate substring match (e.g., minor variations found and\/or a match occurred after normalization of a string and\/or results) may indicate modified content, updated content, stale cached summary results, and\/or malicious or misleading content. If a match is made received results may be provided to a requestor. If an approximate match is made, according to some embodiments, further analysis may be performed to determine whether received results are current, safe, and\/or relevant. If an approximate match is made a user may be provided with a warning or message regarding potential irrelevant or harmful content. According to some embodiments, if a match is not made one or more actions may be taken. Actions may be determined by one or more configurable policies. Determining which of the one or more actions to perform may be based on one or a similarity of the received requested content to the summary content derived from a comparison, a policy, and\/or an analysis of the received requested content. Actions may be directed towards providing web user safety and reducing irrelevant, misleading, and outdated search results.","According to some embodiments, if a substring match is not made search result management module  may perform one or more actions to reduce a potential threat from malware and\/or misleading applications. Malware may include misleading applications messages such as, for example, a fake anti-virus software product, a fake network security software product, a fake anti-spyware software product, a fake computer disk optimization software product, a fake operating system update software product, a fake operating system registry tool software product, and\/or a fake computer optimization software product. Security measures to reduce such threats may include blocking the received requested content, warning a user regarding potential malicious content associated with the received requested content, and\/or preventing downloads from a network address or web page associated with the received requested content. Other actions may include disabling at least a portion of browser functionality of a browser receiving the received requested content (e.g., disabling a JavaScript engine), disabling instantiation of ActiveX controls on a page associated with the received requested content, and\/or preventing interaction with a web form of a page associated with the received requested content. Disabling functionality, forms, downloads and other web interaction may prevent the download of malware, the execution of malware, the gathering of sensitive information (e.g., user names, passwords, pins, account information, personal information, etc.). According to some embodiments, the restrictions may be configurable and\/or set by one or more policies. Further analysis may be performed including the use of signatures to identify malware, behavioral analysis, and\/or reputation based analysis (e.g., identifying network addresses associated with the received content as known malicious sites).","In addition to security measures, search result management module  may notify additional parties and\/or devices of received content which does not match summary content provided by a search engine (e.g., retrieved and\/or cached by a search engine). For example, notifications (e.g., emails, text messages, etc.) may be provided to one or more of an administrator, a security software vendor, a third party solution provider, one or more search engine clients, and\/or one or more security software clients. Notifications may be used by receiving parties to perform additional analysis, security actions, search engine cache updates, and other actions. Additionally, search result management module  may communicate to a user that received content does not match summary content provided by a search engine. Notifications to a user may be provided by an alert in a browser such as via a message in an address bar. According to some embodiments, a user may be redirected to a warning page requiring confirmation prior to receiving changed content. A user may also be notified that certain functionality may be disabled (e.g., JavaScript engine, ActiveX controls, etc.) for security. A user may also be notified that received content has changed since it was indexed by a search engine (e.g., the user's search results were stale).","Content which does not match summary content provided by a search engine may not indicate a security problem, it may indicate that summary search engine results are stale (e.g., outdated cached pages) and may need to be updated. Web content may change quickly; faster than search engine summary information and\/or caches can be updated and indexes updated. Identifying how much web content has changed or is completely different may be used to determine what actions search result management module  may take. According to some embodiments, a whitelist may be used to identify known safe sites which change their content frequently.","According to one or more embodiments, search result management module  may notify a search engine that the summary content does not match the received requested content. Search result management module  may indicate to a search engine that web crawling for content should be expedited. Notifying a search engine that the page and\/or content and the summary and indexed page information is not synchronized can be delivered to the community of the users of the security agent and\/or to the search engine provider. A search engine may benefit from expiring the corresponding result summary and\/or cache entries and refreshing them and rebuilding the indexes. Managing and keeping the result summary information fresh (e.g., eviction policies for result caches) may be a challenge for search engines providers. Techniques based on Time To Live (TTL) algorithms, Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithms, and Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithms may not precisely help identifying what results are out of sync, but may merely be approaches to decide what to refresh. However, reports of received search content which does not match summary search result information may provide specific indications of what has gone stale. Such information may also help the converse situation (i.e., what need not be refreshed aggressively and which result cache entry TTLs can be extended). Additionally, search engines may delist a network address based upon a determination that received requested content is malicious and\/or misleading. In case of the security agent user community collecting such information, the search results may be optimized by the browser component over what the search engine returns. For example, stale entries may be dropped from search results or visually indicated to improve user satisfaction and experience.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","212","210","214","217","218","220","222","224","226","228","230","232","233","234","237","238","235","290","235","239","240","242","246","212","228","247","212","230","248","212","250","252"]},"Bus  allows data communication between central processor  and system memory , which may include read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory (neither shown), and random access memory (RAM) (not shown), as previously noted.

Notifying a search engine that the page and\/or content and the summary and indexed page information is not synchronized may be delivered to the community of the users of the security agent and\/or to the search engine provider. A search engine may benefit from expiring the corresponding result cache entries and refreshing them and rebuilding the indexes. Reports of received search content which does not match summary search result information may provide specific indications of what has gone stale. Such information may also help the converse situation (i.e., what need not be refreshed aggressively and which result cache entry TTLs can be extended). In case of the security agent user community collecting such information, the search results may be optimized by the browser component over what the search engine returns. For example, stale entries may be dropped from search results or visually indicated to improve user satisfaction and experience.","At block , the method may end.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0075","num":"0074"},"figref":"FIG. 4C","b":["430","400"]},"At block , received content may be analyzed.
