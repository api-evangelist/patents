Depending upon the application, there are various requirements, factors, and tradeoffs such sensitivity, cost, and power consumption that must be considered for the various applications. For example, for automotive and high volume applications the prime factor is cost. In neuromagnetism the prime factor is sensitivity. For use in unattended ground sensor networks the prime factors are cost, sensitivity, power consumption, and visibility. For Department of Defense purposes, the Army requires magnetic sensors that can be used in unattended ground sensors (UGS) networks, at choke points, for mine detection, and general situational awareness. The Navy has applications in areas such as anti-submarine warfare (ASW), mine detection, harbor control, and checking demagnetization of ships. The Air Force has related uses.","Further examples of uses of magnetic detection devices include identification and financial credit cards, Government facilities protection, airport security, border control, drug control & enforcement, tunnel & underground facilities detection, navigation equipment, traffic light control, and ensuring airplane doors are securely closed (detection).","Illustrated in  is a chart showing the Tesla sensitivities required for various potential applications; e.g., drug delivery and cardiomagnetism, which requires sensitivity on the order of 10 pT (pico Tesla) and is presently done with SQUIDS. Another application is neuromagnetism which operates around 100 fT (10) and is presently done with SQUIDS.","As to the types of magnetometers, as illustrated in , scalar magnetometers measure the total strength (or total field), i.e., the magnitude of the magnetic field to which they are subjected, and vector magnetometers have the capability to measure the vector component of the magnetic field in a particular direction. The use of three orthogonal vector magnetometers allows the magnetic field strength, inclination and declination to be uniquely defined. Examples of vector magnetometers are fluxgates, and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). Other examples of vector sensors are coil based, magnetoresistive, and hall effect sensors.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"7pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"91pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"Type of Sensor","Advantages","Disadvantages"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Total Field","Sensitive","Costly, best at low"]},{"entry":[{},"Sensors","Insensitive to","frequencies"]},{"entry":[{},{},"rotational",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"Vibrations",{}]},{"entry":[{},"Fluxgate","Sensitive","Costly, large, consumes a"]},{"entry":[{},{},{},"lot of power"]},{"entry":[{},"Coil based","Sensitive at high","Insensitive at low"]},{"entry":[{},{},"frequencies","frequencies, costly, large"]},{"entry":[{},"Magnetoresistive","Low cost, small,","1\/f noise"]},{"entry":[{},{},"potentially",{}]},{"entry":[{},{},"sensitive"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Vector magnetometers provide more information but are affected by rotational vibrations, which makes them difficult to use on vehicles. Vector magnetometers include SQUID, coil based, Fluxgate and Manetoresistive, and Hall effect. Total field measurements usually does not measure the total field from an object; but generally measures the projection of the total field from an object on earth's total field. Total field magnetic sensors include optically pumped, Overhauser, proton precession magnetometers and Nuclear precession. Total field magnetometers employ the field dependence of quantum energy levels.","Examples of patented MEMS devices include U.S. Pat. No. 6,501,268 to Edelstein, et al., entitled \u201cMAGNETIC SENSOR WITH MODULATING FLUX CONCENTRATOR FOR 1\/F NOISE REDUCTION,\u201d U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,809 to Edelstein, et al., also entitled \u201cMAGNETIC SENSOR WITH MODULATING FLUX CONCENTRATOR FOR 1\/F NOISE REDUCTION,\u201d and U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945, to Edelstein, et al., entitled \u201cMIMIMIZING THE EFFECT OF 1\/F NOISE WITH A MEMS FLUX CONCENTRATOR,\u201d all three of which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. An example of a publication disclosing a MEMS device is found in an article entitled \u201cHybrid Magnetoresistive\/microelectromechanical Devices for Static Field Modulation and Sensor 1\/f Noise Cancellation,\u201d by A. Guedes et al., Journal of Applied Physics 103, 07E924 (2008). The Guedes article reported that low frequency 1\/f noise in magnetoresistive MR spin valve sensors was suppressed by modulating an external dc magnetic field at high frequency microelectromechanical system using a MEMS microcantilever structure with an integrated magnetic flux guide. With this hybrid MR\/MEMS device, direct detection of dc magnetic fields in the sensor high frequency thermal noise regime was reportedly achieved. The microcantilever was actuated using a gate electrode by applying an ac voltage with frequency f, causing it to oscillate at 2f. Measurements were reported to show detection of a dc magnetic field at 2f frequency (400 kHz), where sensor 1\/f noise is two orders of magnitude lower than dc.","There has been a focus on magnetoresistive sensor technology because of the opportunity for producing low cost magnetic sensors. Magnetic sensors or transducers are generally passive sensors with desirable attributes for several types of applications that include insensitivity to weather conditions, the requirement of only a small bandwidth, and the unique ability to \u201csee through\u201d walls and foliage without attenuation. Furthermore, in military applications it is generally difficult to make a weapon or vehicle that does not include ferrous material that can be detected by magnetic sensors. Though the permanent magnetic moment of the ferrous material can be minimized by \u201cdeperming,\u201d which is a process of reduction of permanent magnetism, the distortion of the earth's magnetic field due to the magnetic permeability is typically difficult to hide. Data from magnetic sensors can be combined with the data from other sensor modalities such as acoustic and seismic sensors to characterize or identify and track targets. Specifically, in military applications magnetic sensors can be used for perimeter defense, at check points, as part of a suite of sensors in unattended ground sensor networks, and on unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). Moreover, magnetic sensors or transducers can also be employed to monitor rooms and passageways that have been cleared by military personnel.","The magnetic signals from military targets come from the internal motion of ferromagnetic parts, electrical currents, and the motion of targets containing ferromagnetic material relative to the magnetic sensor. The latter can arise either from the motion of the target or the sensor. All of these magnetic signals often occur at low frequencies, typically less than 100 Hz. Because the earth's field is usually larger than the field generated by the target, it is generally difficult to detect the magnetic signals that occur at low frequencies, typically less than 100 Hz. Moreover, it is generally difficult to detect the magnetic target without having the field change by relative motion between the target and the sensor. At low frequencies the electric and magnetic fields are decoupled. The magnetic strength from a target at a distance greater than the target size is usually like that of a magnet dipole. Because of the relatively short detection range of magnetic sensors, a large number of magnetic sensors may have to be used if one wants to guarantee detection over a large area.","Magnetoresistance sensors are candidate low cost sensors because they can be mass produced by batch processing on silicon wafers and the drive and read out electronics are relatively simple. The resistance of a magnetoresistance sensor is sensitive to the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field. The types of magnetoresistive sensors include anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors, and magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) sensors. Magnetoresistance values as large as 220% may be observed in CoFe(100)\/MgO(100)\/CoFe(100) MTJ sensors at room temperature.","To detect the relative motion between the target and the magnetic sensor generally requires high sensitivity in the frequency range f\u22661 Hz. Unfortunately, most magnetoresistance sensors tend to suffer from 1\/f noise. Furthermore, there is generally a tendency for the sensors that have a larger response to magnetic fields to also have more 1\/f noise. Thus, 1\/f noise is a significant problem in applying magnetic sensors to military applications.","Another problem in using magnetoresistive sensors at low frequencies and at low fields is that the induced percentage change in the resistance is generally small. Thus, with a single device one must accurately measure a small change in a large signal. Because of this problem, most magnetoresistive sensors have several sensors that are arranged in bridge circuits to eliminate the DC bias offset.","Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors are probably the most sensitive, commercial, magnetoresistance sensors to use at frequencies of 1 Hz or less. This is true despite the fact that their magnetoresistance, approximately 4%, is relatively small. The reason for this is that AMR sensors have less 1\/f noise than other magnetoresistive sensors. However, there remains a need for a device that can eliminate the problem of 1\/f noise in small magnetic sensors.","When measuring magnetic flux, it is generally advisable to increase the input dimensions of the concentrator in order to provide for greater detection capability. In flux concentrators which move or oscillate, increasing the dimensions generally translates to an increase in mass. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,809 describes an approach that, improves the sensitivity of magnetic sensors in general that operate at low frequencies by using flux concentrators that modulate an observed sensed magnetic field with low frequency signals, thereby shifting this observed field to higher frequencies where the 1\/f noise of the sensor is smaller. This is accomplished by providing a magnetic flux concentrator deposited on suspended microelectromechanical system (MEMS) structure. Such a combined device is used in a magnetometer.","The moving flux concentrators are utilized to periodically increase the sensed magnetic flux density at the position of the sensor . A layered material forming part of the flux concentrator  can comprise a thick film of a soft ferromagnetic material with a large magnetic permeability.","There are several types of magnetometers (magnetic sensors with external instrumentation) currently used. The least expensive and least sensitive devices have resolution of about 10Oersted (Oe)\/Hzand typically are Hall effect devices. These devices work by sensing a voltage change across a conductor or semiconductor placed in a magnetic field. Such devices do not lend themselves for applications requiring greater sensitivity, such as that required in brain scan devices and magnetic anomaly detection devices. Flux gate magnetometers are more sensitive, having resolution of approximately 10Oe\/Hz. Flux gate magnetometers use a magnetic core surrounded by an electromagnetic coil and are difficult to microfabricate. Additionally flux gate magnetometers require relatively large amount of power and accordingly do not lend themselves to low-cost, compact, portable design. The most sensitive magnetometers called SQUIDS (superconducting quantum interference devices) have a resolution of about 10Oe\/Hz. However, because they include a superconducting element, these apparatus must include cooling means at liquid gas temperatures, making them extremely bulky and expensive to operate. Their size limits their utility because the active superconducting element cannot be placed directly adjacent to the source of the magnetic field, for example the brain. Accordingly, there is need for small, inexpensive, low power magnetometers that have sufficient sensitivity to be useful for a variety of magnetometer applications at low frequencies. Magnetoresistive sensors are suited for low-cost, medium-sensitivity application.","A well known way of increasing the sensed magnetic field by a magnetic sensor is by use of a flux concentrator, which can enhance a sensed magnetic field by as much as a factor of 50. An example of such a device is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,895, entitled \u201cMagnetic field sensor and current and\/or energy sensor,\u201d that use Hall sensors with flux concentrator components.","Magnetic sensors used to detect objects that move slowly typically possess considerable low frequency 1\/f-type noise, an unwanted condition. In general, there is a tendency for such devices that have higher sensitivity to also exhibit higher 1\/f-type noise. This generally occurs when using magnetoresistive-type magnetic sensors, as reported in van de Veerdonk et al., \u201c1\/f Noise in Anisotropic and Giant Magnetoresistive Elements,\u201d J. Appl. Phys. 82, 6152 (1997).","A magnetic sensor (magnetometer) that addresses 1\/f-type noise is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,864,237. This disclosure teaches of an apparatus for measuring magnetic fields, that change only at extremely low frequencies. The apparatus uses a SQUID magnetometer that includes a superconducting flux transformer that inductively couples a detected signal into a d-c SQUID sensor. This magnetometer can optionally include a device for modulating the detected signal in a frequency range characteristic of low-noise operation of the SQUID. The modulation frequencies are generally above 1 Hz and optionally even above 1-kHz. Limitations of this device include need for cryogenic operation, which inherently do not lend themselves to relatively lost cost, low power use.","Thus, there is need, for small, low-cost, low-power-consuming magnetic sensors having sensitivities capable of meeting the varied applications listed above for detecting low frequency signals and minimize 1\/f-type noise. There exists a need for a magnetic sensor with flux concentrator having sufficient sensitivity for a variety of applications that minimize the effects of 1\/f-type noise. There exists a need for a magnetic sensor with flux concentrator that is inexpensive to manufacture, having a magnetic sensor having high sensitivity, yet not having to be concerned with 1\/f-type noise associated with that type of sensor. There also exists a need for increased input dimensions of the concentrator in order to provide for greater detection capability.","Construction of a larger MEMS flux concentrator having the ability to respond to higher frequencies is somewhat problematic because increasing the size of the flux concentrator generally increases the mass, which leads to a decrease in the resonant frequency. A high resonant frequency is desirable in order to operate at higher frequencies where 1\/f noise is small. By using at least one supplemental flux concentrator whose mass is independent of at least one movable flux concentrator, the overall mass of the flux concentrators may be increased providing an enhanced magnetic fluid without affecting the frequency of the at least one movable flux concentrator. The present invention also incorporates vacuum packaging to reduce frictional resistance imparted by the air. A preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a magnetic sensor assembly with an extended or supplemental flux concentrator that enhances the input of flux. A preferred embodiment assembly can be produced, for example, by microfabrication MEMS-techniques, producing a small and inexpensive yet extremely sensitive magnetic sensor. Improved sensitivity of magnetic sensors operating at low frequencies is achieved by using flux concentrators that modulate an observed or sensed magnetic field, thereby shifting this observed field to higher frequencies where the noise of the sensor is smaller to minimize 1\/f-type noise. This is accomplished by providing a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-type magnetic flux concentrator in combination with a magnetic sensor. The magnetic sensor can be a Hall effect or other type of magnetic sensor. The MEMS flux concentrators  may be composed of a soft magnetic material, such as permalloy, deposited on MEMS structures.","These and other aspects of the embodiments of the invention will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings.

The representations in each of the figures are diagrammatic and no attempt is made to indicate actual scales or precise ratios.

As used herein the term \u201cand\/or\u201d includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.","The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the full scope of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

In contrast, when an element is referred to as being \u201cdirectly on\u201d or extending \u201cdirectly onto\u201d another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201ccoupled\u201d to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.

For example, when referring first and second photons in a photon pair, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.","Furthermore, relative terms, such as \u201clower\u201d or \u201cbottom\u201d and \u201cupper\u201d or \u201ctop,\u201d may be used herein to describe one element's relationship to other elements as illustrated in the Figures. It will be understood that relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to the orientation depicted in the Figures. For example, if the device in the Figures is turned over, elements described as being on the \u201clower\u201d side of other elements would then be oriented on \u201cupper\u201d sides of the other elements. The exemplary term \u201clower\u201d, can therefore, encompass both an orientation of \u201clower\u201d and \u201cupper,\u201d depending of the particular orientation of the figure.

Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region or object illustrated as a rectangular will, typically, have tapered, rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.","Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.","It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that references to a structure or feature that is disposed \u201cadjacent\u201d another feature may have portions that overlap or underlie the adjacent feature.","Referring to , a subassembly is shown that includes a magnetic sensor  with two flux concentrators . Each flux concentrator  increases the sensed magnetic flux density at the position of the sensor . A layered material forming part of the flux concentrator  can comprise a thick film of a soft ferromagnetic material with a large magnetic permeability.  illustrates the lines of flux within the flux concentrators , and in the region near the flux concentrator.  illustrates graphically the enhancement of the field using flux concentrators.","The flux concentrators  enhance the field at the position of the magnetic sensor . Decreasing the separation between the MEMS structures increases the enhancement. At least one (or two) MEMS flux concentrator is forced to oscillate by applying a power source, such as an ac voltage, to a drive, such as an electrostatic comb drives. Because the teeth of the comb are pulled together independently of the sign of the applied voltage, the field at the sensor is modulated at twice the frequency of the applied drive voltage. By tuning the frequency, one can excite the normal mode in which the distance between the MEMS structures oscillates. This is the out-of-phase mode shown in . One can also vary the frequency in which the position of the entire MEMS structure oscillates, this is the in-phase mode shown in . The resonant frequency for the MEMS structure may, for example, be about 10 kHz. The size of the flux concentrators B may be limited by the need to keep the resonant frequency of the flux concentrators B, comb drives , and springs S, A in the range of several kHz or higher. The values for the enhancement provided by the flux concentrators B are calculated when the separation between the MEMS flux concentrators B is at their planned maximum and minimum displacements. These values may be approximately 1.5 and 3.5, respectively.","The oscillation of the MEMS flux concentrators modulates the field at the position of the sensor and, hence, shifts the operating frequency of the sensor above the frequency where 1\/f noise dominates. Depending on the type of magnetic sensor used, this shift in operating frequency can preferably increase the sensitivity of magnetometers at 1 Hz by one to three orders of magnitude. The MEMS structures may be connected to one another and to the body of the sensor by silicon springs so that there is an in-plane normal mode for the motion in which the separation between the MEMS flux concentrators is oscillatory. The effectiveness of spin-valve sensors may be enhanced because they have a considerable amount of 1\/f noise.","In a preferred form, the sensor  comprises films deposited on a silicon substrate. As shown in , the flux concentrators  are deposited on silicon MEMS structures . Modulation of a sensed magnetic signal at the magnetic sensor  is accomplished by suspended flux concentrator members  so that they move relative to the magnetic sensor or transducer . The silicon MEMS structures  are formed using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication techniques.","In the magnetometer, the flux concentrators  on the silicon MEMS structures  are driven electrostatically to move at modulating frequency f. In the in-phase mode, when one of the concentrators  is at a position closest to the transducer , the sensed magnetic flux is concentrated at the magnetic sensor . In operation, when the flux concentrators  are moved back and forth, the concentrated magnetic field is modulated vis-\u00e0-vis the transducer .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1","FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["10","40","10","40"]},"Driving the motion from the signal generator requires very little power. This is especially true if the drive frequency is set equal to the mechanical resonant frequency of the suspended structures  containing the flux concentrators . By using the resonant frequency, one obtains the largest amplitudes for the oscillations using the least power. The magnetic field generated by the small currents of the exciting electrostatic modulating signal is negligible.","The magnetic sensor  as shown, can be a Hall-effect device wherein four electrical leads  (identified as \u201celectrode leads to magnetic sensor\u201d in ) are required. Other types of Hall effect devices, which typically have a rectangular geometry with current or voltage electrodes arranged on each side of a rectangle, may also be used. It is also possible to use Hall devices in which three or all four electrodes are arranged on one side of the rectangle, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,890. When a Hall effect device is used, an output voltage from such a device results from the Lorentz force of the magnetic field acting on charge carriers within such a device. Other types of magnetic sensors that can be used other than Hall effect devices include flux gate magnetometers and magnetoresistive sensors that include anisotropic magnetoresistive sensors, giant magnetoresistive sensors, spin dependent tunneling sensors, and bismuth, magnetostrictive sensors, and MEMS sensors.","When the magnetic sensor  is a magnetoresistive element, a Wheatstone electrical bridge configuration is typically used. When the resistance of the magnetoresistive element changes because of a magnetic field, the bridge output voltage changes. The change in the bridge output is increased by using the flux concentrator. The bridge output voltage is modulated at a frequency f, typically the resonant frequency of the suspended silicon MEMS structures , by the motion of the MEMS flux concentrators . The signal can then be amplified by a narrow band amplifier and then demodulated. The bandwidth of the amplifier only has to be broad enough to include the low frequencies in the original signal coming into the MEMS flux concentrator.","In one form the flux concentrator  (), B () or C () comprises a single layer of a soft ferromagnetic material. There are several other alternatives.  is a plan view of one of the MEMS structures  having release holes .","The flux concentrators , B and C can be constructed in multiple layers: these layers comprise a hard magnetic material (having a coercivity greater than 50 Oersteds) layer and a soft magnetic material (having a coercivity less than 3 Oersteds) layer with equal magnitude magnetizations separated by a spacer layer, as described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,670,809, hereby incorporated by reference. The spacer layer is a nonmagnetic material, such as aluminum or silicon dioxide the thicknesses of the layers may be, for example, about one micron. In zero applied field, the magnetizations of both the hard material and the soft material should be perpendicular to the field measuring direction B and directed opposite to one another. Thus, in the absence of an applied field, the fields due to the soft and hard material should approximately cancel one another at the position of the sensor.","A design can be used wherein the edges of the flux concentrators  are modified to decrease the magnetic noise. This can be done by treating the edges of the soft magnetic material of the flux concentrators , B and C so that they have slightly higher coercivity than the center. This improves the magnetic response. The rest of the flux concentrator preferably includes a similar three-layer structure with similar arrangement of the magnetizations as described above. The directions of the magnetization can be obtained by processing the flux concentrator in a magnetic field. This overall geometry maximizes the response of the flux concentrator to a field that is applied in the field measuring direction B.","The invention may be fabricated by MEMS processing techniques. Such techniques are addressed by LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung, for \u201clithography, electroplating molding\u201d) micromachining processing methods that use metals, polymers and even ceramics for the production of varied microstructured devices having extreme precision. These collective microstructures are referred to as MEMS-type devices that are alternatives to conventional discrete electromechanical devices such as relays, actuators, and sensors. When properly designed, MEMS-type devices produce useful forces and displacement, while consuming reasonable amounts of power.","Current LIGA processes create features whose top surface is as much as 200-microns above the substrate. Any technology may be used to form the device, whether a LIGA-type process or a bulk plasma micromachining technique such as RIE (reactive ion etching), or a surface micromachining technique using standard photolithography and etching processes yielding the desired configurations. Preferably each flux concentrator , B is fabricated on a die that in an extreme case might be as large as one square centimeter, but is more likely to be less than one square millimeter in area and about 0.5 to 50 microns thick.","As mentioned above, each device may be implemented on a single silicon chip or die, but multiple dies also can be used. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the device is monolithic in its basic configuration. MEMS devices can be readily integrated and interfaced with electronics because they are fabricated much the same way as integrated circuits. The specific MEMS fabrication technique requires only that desired geometries and mechanical and electrical performance characteristics are obtained.

No. 6,670,809, it is important to minimize the 1\/f noise of the flux concentrator , B. The MEMS structures  in  may be coated with a soft magnetic material. The 1\/f noise may be minimized if the magnetization changes by domain rotation. The magnetization can be forced to change by domain rotation by coating the magnetic material onto the MEMS structures in a special way","The technology of the present invention may be used in embodiments where two or more MEMS devices, one of which is shown for example in , may be utilized in parallel in a variety of geometrical configurations.  shows a plurality of MEMS structures fabricated on a sensor or MEMS chip.","As shown in , a preferred embodiment of the present invention enables the maintaining of a high resonant frequency while incorporating a large flux concentrator design.","A preferred embodiment of the present invention may operate in two modes. The first mode is when the flux concentrators B move out of phase. The motion of the flux concentrators B is out of phase in the sense that the separation between the MEMS structures oscillates in time. The magnetic field at the position of the sensor increases and decreases depending upon the separation. In the second mode, as shown in , the motion of the flux concentrators B move in phase. The motion of the flux concentrators B is in phase in the sense that the separation between the MEMS structures stays constant in time.  illustrate the time where the gap is centered at the sensor . Another position of the flux concentrators B is shown in . Using the technology of the present invention, Magnetoresistance Based Magnetometers have the potential to become sensitive to 2 pT (pico Tesla), cost less than $100, consume small amounts of energy (<1 mW) and operate at a large bandwidth (0.001 Hz<f>10 Meg Hz.","As illustrated in , the embodiments of the invention provide a MEMS device comprising pairs of MEMS flux concentrators B, C, positioned on opposite sides of a magnetic sensor . The microelectromechanical modulating magnetic sensor comprises a base; a magnetic transducer or sensor  associated with the base that provides an output in response to a magnetic field; and at least one movable flux concentrator B positioned to move relative to the magnetic transducer. The movable flux concentrator B has a region of maximum concentration of flux at a predetermined region associated with the positions of the at least one movable flux concentrator. In otherwords, if there are two flux concentrators, there will be a region of maximum flux concentration at a region located between the two flux concentrators B, generally central to the two flux concentrators. The embodiment of  further includes at least one flux collector positioned to collect flux for transfer onto at least one movable flux concentrator B. Support structure enables the movable flux concentrators B to move. The support structure may be a spring . The preferred embodiment further includes a power source for causing the movable flux concentrators B to move at a frequency within the predetermined frequency range. As the movable flux concentrators move back and forth from a first position to a second position the region of maximum concentration of flux moves relative to the transducer. The flux in the region of maximum concentration of flux may change due to the motion. As the flux concentrators B move, the output of the transducer  is modulated.","In the in-phase mode of a preferred embodiment, where two flux concentrators B are separated a fixed distance apart and translate rigidly, the flux concentrators B have a region of maximum flux in the region between the two movable flux concentrators. When the pair of movable flux concentrators is in a first position the region of maximum flux is in a first location, and when the pair of movable flux concentrators is in a second position, the region of maximum flux is in a second position. As the pair of flux concentrators B move in tandem, the location of the region of maximum flux concentration moves relative to the sensor or transducer . As the flux concentrators B move from the first position to the second position the intensity of the flux sensed by the transducer is modulated as the region of maxima approaches and recedes from the location of the transducer.","In the out-of-phase mode of a preferred embodiment, where two flux concentrators B no longer are separated a fixed distance apart. Instead they move toward and away from each other. The flux concentrators B have a region of maximum flux in the region between the two movable flux concentrators. However, in the out-of-phase mode, the location of the region of maximum flux concentration does not substantially change; but the intensity of the maximum flux changes. When the pair of movable flux concentrators is in a first position, such as a position where the pair of movable flux concentrators are a maximum distance apart, region of maximum flux intensity is at a minimum. As the flux concentrators B move to a point at which they are closest to each other, the region of maximum flux is at a maximum. Accordingly, as the flux concentrators B move from the first position to the second position the intensity of the flux sensed by the transducer is modulated as the intensity of the flux in the region of maximum flux increases and decreases.","Regarding the collector flux concentrator C, which may remain stationary relative to the movable flux concentrators B, the volume of each of the collector flux concentrators is generally greater than the movable flux concentrator B so that more flux lines are drawn in. This is effective in situations where there is a need to detect weaker fields, such as the magnetic field generated by the heart. The sensitivity is enhanced without affecting the weight of the movable flux concentrator B. There is sufficient overlap and close proximity between the collector flux concentrator(s) C and movable flux concentrators B so that collected flux is efficiently transferred to the moving flux concentrator B. Although not all of the flux may not be transfer due to fringing effects, the positioning in close proximity achieves a substantial transfer of flux so as to result in an increase in the overall flux sensing capacity overall.","The flux concentrators B, C, coupled with the elements of the present invention, may potentially enhance the magnetic field at the position of the magnetic sensor  by a factor ranging from 1.5 to as much as a 100. Preferably, the flux concentrators B, C are comprised of soft magnetic materials such as permalloy. According to the embodiments of the invention, the flux concentrators B are deposited on MEMS structures , as shown in . The substrate may be a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer, but other substrates may be used as is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferably, the SOI wafer is used in lieu of a plain silicon wafer because fewer processing steps are required. The SOI wafer may comprise a thin upper device layer of silicon separated from a thick layer (also referred to as the handle layer) of silicon by an approximately 1 to 5 micron silicon dioxide (SiO) layer. There are anchors of SiO(as shown in ) that connect one end of the springs A of the MEMS structure  to the handle wafer (as shown in ). From a different perspective, the support  in  is connected to the handle wafer beneath through the silicon dioxide layer.","The MEMS structures  and flux concentrators B are driven to oscillate at frequencies on the order of 10 to 30 kHz by electrostatic comb drives . The electrostatic comb drives  (as shown in ) have the advantage that they provide sufficient force to drive the flux concentrators B and springs S (and\/or A, ) and that, unless the amplitude of the motion is too large, the force is independent of displacement.","The flux concentrators B on the MEMS structure may be connected by the springs  or the flux concentrators may be rigidly connected to one another so that the flux concentrators B have a common normal mode frequencies. This is a feature of one mode of the embodiments of the invention because if the motion of the two flux concentrators B is not coupled, the relative phase between the motion of the flux concentrators B would tend to drift. When the flux concentrators B oscillate, they modulate the field at the position of the magnetic sensor . This shifts the operating frequency of the MEMS device from the high 1\/f noise region at low frequencies to higher frequencies where the sensor noise is orders of magnitude lower. Moreover, the thickness of the springs S (and\/or A) and separation of the teeth in each of the comb drives  (as shown in ) is approximately 2 to 4 \u03bcm.","In the preferred embodiment shown in , there is a flux concentrator B on the MEMS structure  and a flux concentrator collector C on each side of the magnetic sensor . As described above, the flux concentrators B are driven to move by an ac power source at a frequency f and oscillate in the directions of the arrows shown in . The flux concentrator collectors C need not move with the ac power source and overlap the flux concentrators B by a distance X, as shown in , which varies according to the movement of flux concentrators B. The flux concentrators B may be each mounted on separate MEMS structures  as shown in  or, in the alternative, may be mounted together on a MEMS structure separated by an area without permalloy. The flux collector\/concentrators C, which may be larger, are mounted in association with the upper or sensor chip , which also may support sensor , for fabrication purposes. Because the flux concentrator\/collectors C are not attached to the movable flux concentrators B, the additional mass contained in the flux collectors\/concentrators C, does not result in the change to the resonant frequency of the movable flux concentrators B that occurs when the mass is increased in the movable flux concentrators B.","The overall objective is to maximize the collection of the flux to be measured. There are several geometries that can be used for the flux collector\/concentrators C. One improvement realized by the present invention is the increase in lateral size of the flux collector\/concentrator C without increasing the mass of the flux concentrator . Flux collector\/concentrators C are preferably made of permalloy (80% nickel and 20% iron) or some other material with a high magnetic permability and can be mounted on a sensor chip , as shown in , which may be a silicon compound or the like. One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that several other alloys or compounds could be used in place of permalloy that have magnetism retention characteristics similar to permalloy. The flux collector\/concentrator C in  is shown as having a trapezoidal configuration. However, any configuration that would increase the collection of flux for passage onto the flux concentrator B could be used, including flux\/collector concentrators which are trapezoidal in a direction perpendicular to longitudinal axis of the device shown in , and extending vertically from the illustration of flux collector\/concentrators C (which may be fixed) shown in . The flux collector\/concentrators C may be mounted on a sensor chip  as shown in , . Since the flux collector\/concentrators C are preferably independent from the flux concentrators B, and consequently, do not contribute to the weight of the flux concentrators B, resulting in more flux flowing to the flux concentrators B without the drawback of additional weight considerations that would effect the movement or oscillation of the flux concentrators B. Flux concentrators B may be mounted on portions of MEMS structure  as shown in .","In the simplest form of flux concentrators B, C the permalloy portion consists of a single layer of a soft ferromagnetic material. Alternatively, the flux concentrators B, C can be constructed in multiple layers in which different layers of soft ferromagnetic material or magnetic alloys are separated by non-ferromagnetic layers.","The MEMS structure  and sensor chip  may be silicon or the like. The separation between the two chip layers is 2-8 microns. As the MEMS structures oscillate, the overlap of the flux concentrators shown in  is always large compared with the separation between the chips. In this case, most of the flux lines will be transferred from the large flux collector\/concentrator C to the small flux concentrator B. In a second mode, the motion of the flux concentrators  move in phase as shown in . In the motion of the in-phase mode, the separation between the flux concentrators stays constant. The motion of the MEMS structure may be either in the in-phase or out-of-phase mode.  illustrates the time where the gap is centered at the sensor. At this time, the field is maximum. The field is minimum when the flux concentrators have the position shown in . In an alternate embodiment of the present invention, both portions of the flux concentrators B are mounted on a single substrate portion which has no permalloy in between the flux concentrators B.","As discussed in the foregoing, it is somewhat difficult with large flux concentrators B to get a large, high frequency, modulating magnetic field. The supplemental flux collector\/concentrators C achieves more desirable results. The small flux concentrator B can be energized to move at frequencies up to 30 kHz with an amplitude of modulation of a factor of about 5 modulation, with an amplification of the magnetic field by a factor of 2. The large flux collector\/concentrator C can have dimensions of 1 mm or more and potentially may concentrate the magnetic field by a factor of about hundred, because of the improve demagnetization factor. Thus, the field at the position of the sensor potentially may be amplified by a factor of about 10 or more instead of a factor of two and it can still be modulated at a high frequency.","The flux concentrators B on the MEMS structures  may be connected by a spring type supports S, A as shown schematically in , which permits movement along the longitudinal axis of the device. The spring type support S is fabricated to support the flux concentrators B and permit the in-plane motion of the MEMS structure in a direction along a line B-B shown in  when they are driven by the ac power source at frequency f. The ac drive is inputted in the manner shown in FIG. 1(A) of U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945, hereby incorporated by reference. As in the '945 patent, comb drives supply a voltage at a frequency f to drive the flux concentrators 40. This voltage, independent of its sign, creates a force that tends to increase the overlap of the teeth 11 of the comb drives. Because the force is independent of the sign of the applied voltage, the MEMS motion occurs at a frequency 2f. Thus, the signal is insensitive to pickup at the drive frequency f Alternatively, the motion of the MEMS structure may be driven by applying both an AC and a DC voltage. The voltage across the sensor 10 is amplified by a broadband amplifier (not shown) and demodulated. FIG. 115 shows the electrostatic comb drives 11 of an embodiment of the present invention.","The flux concentrators B can be operated in two modes. In mode , the motion of the flux concentrators B is out of phase in the sense that the separation between the MEMS structures oscillates in time. The magnetic field at the position of the sensor increases and decreases depending upon the separation and location, as is well know to those of ordinary skill in the art.","One method of making an embodiment of the invention comprises a method of fabricating a MEMS device, wherein one embodiment comprises forming a magnetic sensor over a silicon base, such as a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer; forming a pair of MEMS flux concentrators sandwiching the magnetic sensor; connecting an electrostatic comb drive to each of the MEMS flux concentrators; and optionally connecting at least one spring to the pair of MEMS flux concentrators and the electrostatic comb drive. The methodology may also comprise performing a plurality of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) processes on an SOI wafer; and releasing the MEMS flux concentrators, the electrostatic comb drive, and (optionally) at least one spring formed from the device layer of the SOI wafer.

Moreover, the flux concentrators may comprise a layer of soft ferromagnetic material on a portion of the device layer of the SOI wafer. An HF process may be used to remove the silicon dioxide from beneath the MEMS flux concentrator and thereby release the MEMS structure  and electrostatic comb drive . Furthermore, the MEMS flux concentrators preferably comprise a double layer of Cr and permalloy.","Moreover, the plurality of processes may comprise performing a process on the device layer of the SOI wafer to define the MEMS flux concentrators , B, the electrostatic comb drives , and the at least one spring , S, and\/or A. Furthermore, the MEMS flux concentrator preferably comprises a layer of silicon dioxide thereunder, wherein the plurality of release processes may comprise methodology for removing the layer of silicon dioxide from beneath the MEMS flux concentrator and MEMS structure. Additionally, if the insulator is something other than silicon dioxide, such as an epoxy, the releasing of the MEMS flux concentrators and MEMS structure, the electrostatic comb drive, and the at least one spring from the SOl wafer may be performed using oxygen plasma. The intermediate layer may comprise an epoxy layer. Also, the MEMS flux concentrators may comprise a double layer of Cr and permalloy.","Another preferred embodiment of the invention provides a method of fabricating a MEMS device, wherein the method comprises forming a first wafer; forming adhesive bumps on the first wafer; forming a magnetic sensor on the first wafer; forming a second wafer; forming a pair of MEMS flux concentrators, a pair of electrostatic comb drives, and at least one spring on the second wafer, wherein the pair of MEMS flux concentrators, the pair of electrostatic comb drives, and the at least one spring are connected to one another, and wherein the pair of MEMS flux concentrators sandwich the magnetic sensor. The method further includes bonding the second wafer to the adhesive bumps; and compressing the adhesive bumps using non-thermal means.","Preferably, the adhesive bumps comprise indium. Additionally, the nonthermal means preferably comprises pressure. Preferably, the magnetic sensor is formed by providing an antiferromagnetic layer; positioning a first ferromagnetic layer over the antiferromagnetic layer; positioning a conducting layer or the insulating layer over the first ferromagnetic layer, and positioning a second ferromagnetic layer over the conducting layer or insulating layer. Furthermore, the first wafer preferably comprises a SOl wafer and the second wafer preferably comprises silicon or silicon nitride. Also, the MEMS flux concentrators may comprise a double layer of Cr and permalloy.","The task of fabricating the device is provided according to the embodiments of the invention by combining two very different technologies, MEMS fabrication technology and magnetic sensor technology. The resulting device may increase the sensitivity of small, low cost, magnetic sensors by one to three orders of magnitude. The device can be fabricated on wafers by low cost, mass production techniques. Moreover, powering the motion of the MEMS structures only requires microwatts of energy.","ALTERNATE FLUX PATHS\u2014In the alternate embodiments shown in , methods are described for producing alternative magnetic flux paths.","For the embodiment illustrated in , as the separation between the flux concentrators  increases, the separation between the soft magnetic material  decreases. This motion will draw flux lines away from the sensor. This will increase the amplitude of the field modulation. Although springs S are used in conjunction with the embodiment illustrated in , alternate mechanical\/electrical subsystems which move the soft magnets  in and out (as illustrated in ) as the flux concentrators oscillate, may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0117","num":"0116"},"figref":["FIG. 20","FIG. 20","FIG. 20","FIG. 20"],"b":["10","40","53","54","48","40","40","40","48","40"]},"The embodiment of  uses an alternative flux path that is stationary. The upper portion of  shows a schematic picture that includes the alternative path. The alternative flux path may be a layer of a soft magnetic material, such as permalloy, deposited inside a depression made in the bottom of the chip containing the MEMS structure. The depression in the bottom of the chip containing the MEMS structure may be made by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). If s<<x, most of the flux travels between the MEMS structures. In this case, the sensor \u201csees\u201d the maximum field. If s>>x, then most of the flux goes around the alternative flux path and the sensor \u201csees\u201d a smaller field. Thus, the oscillation of the MEMS structures causes an increased modulation of the field at the position of the sensor. In the first method, the alternative flux path changes as the MEMS structures oscillate.","The methods in ,  and  provide a larger field modulation for the same amount of motion of the MEMS structures. It is further noted that the secondary flux concentrators C, which may be mounted on a sensor chip , shown in  can be used in conjunction with the embodiments shown in , , and . Likewise, the springs S may be used to support the flux concentrators  and comb drives  (such as that shown in ) may be used to power the flux concentrators  in .

Likewise the sensor  may be mounted on a sensor chip  as shown in .","During one method of fabrication of the embodiment shown in , the flux concentrators , comb drives , and springs  may be released from the SOL wafer  by dipping the MEMS device into hydrofluoric (HF) acid. Substantially the same methods can be utilized for the alternate embodiments shown in  for like components, but details are omitted for the sake of brevity. Alternatively, one can use HF vapor instead of HF liquid. The HF acid removes portions of the insulating SiOlayer. Alternatively, one could use an alternate wafer in which the SiOlayer of the SOI wafer (of ) is replaced by an approximate 20 m thick epoxy layer as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945, incorporated by reference. For example, the type of epoxy material that may be used is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,617,657, the complete disclosure of which, in its entirety, is herein incorporated by reference. Except for the fact that the SiO2 layer is replaced by the epoxy layer, the properties of this alternate wafer are very similar to the wafer shown in, inter alia, . This alternative approach has the advantage that the epoxy layer  can be removed during the release step by exposing the MEMS device to an oxygen plasma environment. This eliminates the problem of possible damage to the magnetic sensor  caused by the HF during the release step.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 14"},"Optimal Magnetic modeling was done using the finite element code Maxwell from Ansoft. This modeling was used to choose the separation between the flux concentrators, the thickness of the ferromagnetic films, and how much motion was required to obtain an adequate modulation. Based on the modeling, it was estimated that \u00bc micron thick permalloy flux concentrators separated 45 microns oscillating with a 12 micron amplitude would provide an enhancement of the magnetic field that varies between 6 at the smallest separation and 2 at the largest separation.","In the preferred embodiments, the flux concentrators may be driven by electrostatic comb drives. This design provides large displacements and has the further advantage that the force is independent of the displacement. The finite element program ANSYS was used to do the mechanical modeling. In each design, the MEMS structures on each side of the sensor are connected by a MEMS spring so that their motions are correlated. If this spring were omitted, it would by very difficult to maintain the correct phase relationship between the motions of the two MEMS structures. Because of the spring, there are two basic in-plane normal modes. One in which their motion is in phase and the other in which they are 180 degrees out of phase. The latter occurs at a higher frequency because, for this mode, the connecting spring must be compressed. Thus, the higher of the two frequencies for each design is for the 180 degree phase difference normal mode used to modulate the magnetic field.","It is preferable that the magnetic sensor  is responsible for most of the 1\/f noise and not some other part of the sensor system. This feature of the embodiments of the invention greatly reduces the 1\/f noise of the magnetic sensor . However, it does not contribute to the reduction of the 1\/f noise of the flux concentrators . Thus, it is preferable that the 1\/f noise of the flux concentrators  be much less than the 1\/f noise of the magnetic sensor . This constraint was experimentally verified. Experimentally, the noise power spectrum was measured on spin valves, which is a type of GMR sensor, both with and without flux concentrators . The measurements were repeated with different currents passing through the spin valves. The results of these measurements are shown in FIG. 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945. hereby incorporated by reference. The curves are labeled by the value of the resistor in series with the spin valve  that limited the current, , through the spin valve . The resistance of the spin valve  is approximately 400 ohms. The noise is much higher for lower values of series resistance because the 1\/f noise is expected to increase as I. Of more significance, the noise power spectra are substantially similar for different currents passing through the spin valves  with and without the flux concentrators . This result implies that 1\/f noise of the flux concentrator  is much less than the 1\/f noise of the spin valve . The likely explanation for the result that 1\/f noise of the flux concentrator  is much less than the 1\/f noise of the spin valve  is that the flux concentrator  is structurally much larger than the spin valve . Optionally, the flux concentrator  may be on the order of approximately 1,500 times larger than the spin valve .","During operation, a constant current is sent through the spin valve magnetic sensor  and the resulting voltage is sent to the signal processing electronics (not shown). This signal is modulated by the motion of the flux concentrators , comb drives , and springs . A voltage at a predetermined drive frequency is applied to drive the motion of the flux concentrators , comb drives , and springs  (or in embodiment of , S, A). This voltage, independent of its sign, creates a force that tends to increase the overlap of the teeth of the comb drives . Because the force is independent of the sign of the applied voltage, the MEMS motion occurs at a frequency double the original predetermined drive frequency. Thus, the signal is insensitive to pickup at the predetermined drive frequency. Alternatively, the drive voltage may be a combination of a DC and an AC voltage. The voltage across the spin valve  is amplified by a broadband amplifier (not shown) and demodulated.","When the magnetic sensor  selected is a magnetoresistive element, a Wheatstone electrical bridge configuration may be used to interface with the magnetic sensor. Accordingly, the resistance of the magnetoresistive element changes because of a magnetic field, the bridge output voltage is modulated at a frequency of ftypically the resonant frequency of the suspended silicon MEMS structures, by the motion of the MEMS flux concentrators . The signal can then be amplified by a narrow band amplifier and then demodulated. The bandwidth of the amplifier only has to be broad enough to include the low frequencies in the original signal coming into the MEMS flux concentrator.","Regarding fabrication processes, one methodology is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,945. As described therein, the first step in the fabrication process of the MEMS device 1 is the deposition of the spin valves on the SOI wafer. For example, spin valves, such as those available from NVE Corporation, Minnesota, USA and having a magnetoresistance of approximately 5%, may be used. Spin valves were chosen as the magnetic sensor 10 in an embodiment of the invention disclosed in the '945 patent because they then represented a mature technology with a significant amount of 1\/f noise. As shown in FIG. 3 of the '945 patent, the spin valve 2 is generally configured as a multi-layered structure comprising a plurality of magnetic films 14. The magnetic films 14 are preferably deposited on a silicon nitride-covered wafer 13 by radio frequency (RF) diode sputtering. A magnetic field of approximately 20 Oe is applied during the deposition to induce the magnetic easy axes and pinning direction. The magnetic films 14 comprise an antiferromagnetic layer (preferably comprising CrPtMn) 15 and two thin ferromagnetic layers 16, 18 separated by a thin conducting layer (preferably comprising Cu) 17. The rotation of the magnetization of one of the ferromagnetic layers (preferably comprising CoFe) 18, the pinned layer, is hindered by exchange interactions at the interface with the antiferromagnetic layer 15. The magnetization of the other ferromagnetic layer; i.e., free layer 16 rotates in response to an applied field. The resistance of the magnetic films 14 has its minimum value when the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic layers 16, 18 are parallel. Following the deposition of magnetic films 14, the unpatterned sensor wafer 13 is annealed in forming gas at approximately 200\u00b0 C. for approximately 2 hours. Following the patterning of the device stripes, the sensor wafer 13 undergoes a sequence of annealing steps (temperature up to approximately 265\u00b0 C.) to establish the magnetization of the pinned layer 18 across the stripe, and the magnetization of the free layer 16 down the stripe. The magnetic sensors are patterned approximately 3 \u03bcm wide and approximately 88 \u03bcm long.","The flux concentrators B, C may, for example, be trapezoidal in shape and may be made by 20 DC magnetron sputtering of two repeats (i.e., double layer) of approximately 40 A Cr\/1,500 A permalloy films (Cr films and permalloy films) deposited on photoresist covered SOl wafers 6 as shown in FIG. 4 of the '945 patent. The base pressure is approximately 2\u00d71O-7 Torr. No bias voltage or substrate heating is applied during the deposition. In one method, the Cr is deposited at approximately 1.5 mTorr with approximately 60 W of DC power. The permalloy is deposited at approximately 1.25 mTorr at approximately 300 W of DC power. The deposition conditions are chosen to maximize domain size and to minimize film stress. The intervening Cr films serves to break up the magnetic and structural continuity of the permalloy films and thus suppress the formation of a stripe-like magnetic domain configuration and to achieve high magnetic permeability. The height of the flux concentrator B may be approximately 104 \u03bcm. The short side of the trapezoid configuration of the flux concentrator may be approximately 83 \u03bcm long and the longer, back side of the trapezoid configuration of the flux concentrator may be approximately 150 \u03bcm long.","The size of the flux concentrators B may be limited by the need to keep the resonant frequency of the flux concentrators B, comb drives , and springs  in the range of several kHz or higher. The values for the enhancement provided by the flux concentrators B are calculated when the separation between the MEMS flux concentrators B is at their planned maximum and minimum displacements. These values may be approximately 1.5 and 3.5, respectively.","The mechanical resonant frequencies of seven different MEMS devices  are calculated for using mechanical finite element calculations. Table 1 in the '945 patent (hereby incorporated by reference) shows the results of these calculations. The two low frequency normal modes for in plane motion are for the two concentrators to move in phase with one another or 180 degrees out of phase. Although in the embodiment shown in the '945 the desired mode was when the two MEMS structures 7 were 180 degrees out of phase, a desired mode in the embodiment pictured in  is for the two concentrators  to be in phase.","In the '945 patent, the out-of-phase mode was the desired mode because at higher frequencies because the spring  connecting the two MEMS structures  was compressed. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention described herein, both flux concentrators  are mounted on a single substrate portion and separated by the lack of permalloy. Accordingly, when in the in-phase mode, the flow of flux into the sensor  is maximized when the concentrators  are in the position shown in  and minimized when in the position shown in .","Magnetoresistance based magnetometers constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention have the potential to have a detectivity of 2 pT (pico tesla) per square root Hz at 1 Hz producible at relatively low cost (<$100), consume small amount of energy (<1 mW), large bandwidth, (0.001 Hz\u2266f\u226610 Meg Hz).","Larger modulation of the magnetic field by amplitude modulation may be limited by the amplitude of the MEMS motion and the magnetic field profile. One may increase the detectivity to approximately 2 picoTesla and amplitude of the motion of the MEMS structure from 5\u03bc to 15\u03bc by vacuum packaging, which will increase the Q from 30 to 300 and lengthening and increasing the number of teeth in comb drive. The magnetic field profile may be changed to increase the field change per micron of displacement. The combined effect of increasing the modulation amplitude and field profile may theoretically result in a detectivity of 2 pT.","The following tables include theorectical \u201cBest Compromise\u201d

the terminology \u201cflux concentrator\u201d or \u201cflux collector\u201d means an element which can absorb magnetic flux in a manner so either (a) the amount of flux per unit area or density is increased as the magnetic flux traverses the element or (b) the magnetic flux is gathered and inputted through a relatively large cross sectional area and outputted through a cross sectional area that is narrower than the input.","As used herein the terminology 1\/f-type noise refers to any noise with a power spectral density of the form\n\nS(f)\u221d1\/f\n\nwhere f is frequency and 0<a<2, with a usually close to 1. Such \u201c1\/f-type\u201d noises occur widely in nature and are a source of considerable interest in many fields.\n","As used herein the terminology \u201cspring mass combination\u201d refers to the interaction between the spring (or spring constant) and mass by which a natural resonant frequency is achieved. Similar to a harmonic oscillator system, when the movable flux concentrator is displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x according to Hooke's law: F=\u2212kx, where k is a spring constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the simple harmonic oscillator will undergo simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a substantially constant amplitude and a substantially constant frequency (which does not depend on the amplitude).","Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings.
