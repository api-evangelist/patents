title: Method and device for automating procedures for verifying equipment in an aircraft
abstract: A method for testing or evaluating the configuration of at least one equipment item in an aircraft includes receiving at least one command to test or evaluate the configuration of the at least one equipment item via a network interface of a less secure part of an on-board information system of the aircraft. The network interface is capable of exchanging data with an information system external to the aircraft. The method also includes encoding the at least one received command and transmitting the encoded command to the secured part of the information system of the aircraft. In response to reception of the encoded command, the at least one encoded test command is filtered. In response to the filtering, the encoded command is translated and executed in relation to at least one first maintenance function of the secured part.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to the maintenance operations and the functional tests performed in aircraft and more particularly to a method and a device for securely automating the procedures for verifying equipment items in an aircraft from a remote station, on the assembly line or during operation of the aircraft, by using the on-board information system as well as its topology.","To optimize the reliability of aircraft and to increase their profitability, on-line maintenance operations are frequently employed between the phases of flight.","In general, such operations consist, for example, in the case of maintenance operators, in verifying the hardware and software configuration of the aircraft systems, in analyzing the data stored in memory during the flight (continuous monitoring), in modifying certain aircraft parameters or certain software data, in launching test software applications and\/or in checking the change of software configuration following a downloading operation.","The analyzed data are often obtained from transducers and stored in memory in a central diagnosis and storage device accessible via a man-machine interface of MCDU (initials for Multi-Control Display Unit in English terminology) or OMT (initials for Onboard Maintenance Terminal in English terminology) type. This interface, via which interactive operations can be launched, makes it possible to analyze data stored in memory, to access parameters of the aircraft and more generally to execute test and maintenance functions. By way of illustration, the Airbus A320, A330 and A340 are equipped with MCDUs and the Airbus A380 is equipped with an OMT (Airbus, A320, A330, A340 and A380 are trademarks).","Access to the maintenance systems of the aircraft is generally limited to fixed physical stations installed on board in the cockpit. Thus, when the aircraft is on the ground, a maintenance operator is able to board the aircraft to access and analyze the data stored in memory, to modify the parameters thereof if necessary and to launch test applications.","In order to ensure optimized sequencing of tasks, the current devices generally require the continuous presence of an operator to verify that the operations are being conducted properly.","Alternatively, mobile stations are being used to respond to an increasing demand of the airline companies in order to shorten the time for on-line maintenance operations. Such stations, whose function is similar to that of the interfaces of MCDU or OMT type, are connected to the central diagnosis and storage device via connection ports connected to the network of the aircraft.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","105","110"]},"Device  is connected to all systems of the aircraft that generate maintenance messages, for example to control transducers (not illustrated) of the engines and to actuators of the landing gear and control surfaces.","Thus, when aircraft  is on the ground, a maintenance operator is able, with the aid of fixed station , to analyze the flight data of the aircraft and to modify the parameters thereof.","Although this solution meets the expectations of the airline companies, it is necessary to use a hard-wired link between an aircraft and a station to achieve on-line maintenance operations. Such a constraint has the effect in particular of prolonging the duration of maintenance operations and consequently increasing the costs of operating the aircraft.","To alleviate these disadvantages, there exist diagnosis systems that use a wireless communication technology, wherein the data obtained from transducers can be transmitted directly to the mobile on-line maintenance station. For example European Patent 1306305 discloses a system in which the transducers are connected to data storage and transmission devices. In this way, a mobile station is able to obtain flight data on request.","However, such a system is limited to accessing data without permitting modification of the parameters of an aircraft, and it necessitates the use of several storage and transmission devices.","Similarly, during assembly of the aircraft, the final assembly line teams rely on interactive maintenance tools to achieve all or part of the functional tests of the aircraft and configuration tracking throughout the manufacturing process until delivery of the aircraft.","However, despite the performances of the maintenance stations, means for automating certain tests do not exist.","In fact, although certain maintenance stations installed on board aircraft can be connected to a communication network for exchange of data between the aircraft and remote equipment, the network connection does not permit remote control of the applications implemented on board the aircraft or transmission of data to these applications, for security reasons.","The invention makes it possible to solve at least one of the problems mentioned in the foregoing.","The object of the invention is therefore a method for testing or evaluating the configuration of at least one equipment item in an aircraft, the said aircraft comprising an on-board information system, the said information system comprising a secured part and a less secured part, the said less secured part comprising a network interface capable of exchanging data with an information system external to the said aircraft, the said secured part comprising at least one maintenance function, this method comprising the following steps,","receiving at least one command to test or evaluate the configuration of the said at least one equipment item via the said network interface;","encoding the said at least one received command;","transmitting the said encoded command to the said secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft;","in response to reception of the said encoded command, filtering the said at least one encoded test command; and","in response to the said filtering step, translating and executing the said encoded command in relation to the said at least one maintenance function.","In this way the method according to the invention makes it possible to execute a maintenance function in a secured part of an information system of an aircraft from a remote station, without affecting the security of this part of the information system, by using the existing information system and its topology.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises a step of determining a result in response to the said execution of the said at least one command and a step of transmitting the said result to the said information system external to the said aircraft via the said communication interface, to permit a remote station to receive and analyze the result of a function executed in a secured part of an information system of an aircraft.","According to a particular embodiment, the said step of transmitting the said result comprises a step of transmitting the said result from the said secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft to the said less secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft, and a step of transmitting the said result from the said less secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft to the said information system external to the said aircraft. In this way the method according to the invention makes it possible to use the existing information system and topology of an aircraft to execute a maintenance function in a secured part of an information system of an aircraft and to obtain the result of this execution.","According to another particular embodiment, the said less secured part comprises at least one second maintenance function, distinct from the said at least one maintenance function, referred to as at least one first maintenance function, the method additionally comprising a step of evaluating the said at least one command capable of determining if the said at least one command is intended for the said secured part or for the said less secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft, the said steps of encoding, of transmitting, of filtering, of translating and of executing the said at least one command being executed if the said at least one command is intended for the said secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft. In this way the method according to the invention makes it possible to optimize the processing of commands to execute maintenance functions according to the intended recipient of these commands.","Advantageously, the method additionally comprises, if the said at least one command is intended for the said less secured part of the said information system of the said aircraft, a step of executing the said at least one received command in relation to the said at least one second maintenance function. The said at least one received command is preferably encoded prior to execution thereof.","According to a particular embodiment, the method additionally comprises an initial step of establishing a secured communication channel between the said information system of the said aircraft and the said information system external to the said aircraft in order to permit data exchange and to improve the security of data transmissions between a remote station and the information system of the aircraft.","Another object of the invention is a computer program comprising instructions capable of employing each of the steps of the method described in the foregoing, a device comprising means capable of employing each of the steps of the method described in the foregoing, as well as an aircraft comprising such a device.","According to a particular embodiment, the invention employs a system composed of the information system of the aircraft, comprising communication means such as IP communications means (initials for Internet Protocol in English terminology), and a remote station or an automatic test station situated, for example, on the ground. This system makes it possible to assure automation of tests and verification of the configuration of the logical systems of an aircraft.","The remote station or the automatic test station is connected to the on-board information system via a secured network such as an Ethernet network.","Securing of the connection can be assured, for example, by an element on the ground integrated in the network of the airline company and capable of employing a secured tunnel. The technology used preferably should make it possible to maintain a high level of security throughout the useful life of the aircraft.","To access the on-board maintenance functions from a remote station or test station, it is necessary to establish a secured connection between a server on the ground and the on-board component that is managing the communication means of the aircraft. When the tunnel is established, activities may be handled from the remote station or the test station.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","205","210","210","215"]},"Device  is connected to all of the aircraft systems that generate maintenance messages, for example control transducers (not shown) of the engines and to actuators of the landing gear and control surfaces.","An on-line remote maintenance station , located in a maintenance center , for example, is connected to device  by a communication network  and port .","Thus, when aircraft  is on the ground, during assembly or during operation thereof, a maintenance operator is able, with the aid of remote station , to analyze the data of the aircraft, to modify the parameters thereof and\/or to monitor the execution of maintenance application modules implemented therein.","Although the connection between aircraft  and network  is hard-wired in this case, wireless communication technologies such as WiMax and\/or WiFi may be used. In this case, the aircraft comprises wireless communication means capable of establishing a communication with a compatible device located on the ground, in a satellite or in any type of vehicle, this device itself being connected to network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","305"]},"The remote system comprises a remote station or a test station , such as a portable computer of the PC type (initials for Personal Computer in English terminology), and a server , making it possible to establish a data communication with the on-board information system  of the aircraft via network .","Two types of data can be processed by the remote station or the test station: the data originating from the aircraft and the command data for managing the tests.","On-board information system  of the aircraft is connected to avionic systems , for example the flight control systems, the automatic pilot and the environment monitoring systems, and to the systems  of the commercial world, known as \u201copen\u201d systems, as opposed to the avionic world, by virtue of the origin of the processed data.","Furthermore, on-board information system  comprises two parts, a highly secured part , known as confidence world, and a less secured part , known as connected world.","Less secured part  comprises a communication module  capable of receiving and transmitting data from and to network . Communication module  is connected to a maintenance application module , which itself comprises an encoding module  used for encoding data to be transmitted to secured part  of on-board information system .","Secured part  comprises a filtering module  capable of monitoring the data transmitted by less secured part .","Secured part  additionally comprises a maintenance application module , itself comprising a conversion module  capable of converting the data received from filtering module  so that they will be processable by maintenance application module .","As illustrated, maintenance application module  of less secured part  is connected to the systems of commercial world , while maintenance application module  of secured part  is connected to the systems of avionic world .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Reference {circle around ()} in this case denotes the part of the algorithm employed in the non-secured part of the information system of the aircraft, reference {circle around ()} denotes the part of the algorithm employed in the secured part of the information system of the aircraft, reference {circle around ()} denotes the functions employed in the confidence world, or in other words the avionics in this case, and reference {circle around ()} denotes the functions employed in the commercial world.","After a command (step ) has been received from a remote station or from a test station via, for example, a previously established, secured communication tunnel, a test is performed (step ) to identify the intended recipient of the received command.","If the intended recipient of the received command is situated in the confidence world, the command is encoded (step ) to make it compatible with the filter used at the input of the secured part, then is transmitted thereto (step ). The exchange of a command and\/or of data between the secured and non-secured parts is preferably achieved via a dedicated internal network.","The encoding consists, for example, in encoding the commands in the form of frames having a predetermined format and\/or characteristics. The filtering then consists in verifying this format and\/or these characteristics.","As indicated in the foregoing, when the secured part of the information system of the aircraft receives a command from the non-secured part, the received command is filtered (step ) by means of a robust filter. The commands not conforming to the predetermined criteria of the filter are rejected. The filtered commands are converted or translated (step ) by a translation module of the secured part to permit their execution by the intended maintenance function.","The requested maintenance function, for example a module for management of interactive tests or a module for management of test configuration, executes the received command or manages the execution thereof, and preferably sends a response, such as a configuration or a result, to the command translation module, which constructs a corresponding file. This file is then transmitted (step ) to the maintenance function of the non-secured part of the information system of the aircraft, which transfers the received information items to the remote station (step ).","If the intended recipient of the received command is situated in the connected world, the command is encoded (step ) in standard manner, to make it compatible with the protocols used in the systems of the connected world.","The requested maintenance function, for example a module for management of interactive tests, executes the received command (step ) or manages the execution thereof. If a response is determined, for example a configuration or a result, it is transmitted to the remote station (step ).","The algorithm illustrated in  makes it possible to employ different test and\/or verification scenarios during final assembly and\/or during operation of the aircraft.","According to a first example, the mode of operation for achieving a sequence of automatic tests in the avionics is the following (although such a sequence of tests is performed in this case on the final assembly line of the aircraft, an equivalent sequence many be used during operation of the aircraft).","A test application hosted by the remote station first sends an initialization command over the network to an element of the maintenance function hosted in the connected world. After this command has been received (step ) and the determination has been made that it is intended for the secured part of the information system of the aircraft (step ), the element of the maintenance function encodes the command to make it compatible with the robust filter (step ). The encoded command is then transmitted to the filter of the secured part (step ).","After the command has been filtered (step ), and if it has not been rejected, it is translated and transmitted to the corresponding maintenance function of the secured part in order to be executed (step ). The requested maintenance function, in this case the module for management of interactive testing, executes the received command and, in response to the initialization command, transmits its configuration to the command translator, which constructs, for example, a corresponding file.","The file is then sent to the maintenance function of the connected world (step ), which in turn transmits the file to the remote station (step ).","The remote station verifies that the resulting file conforms to the initialization command. In the affirmative, the remote station constructs the following command to initiate a test action and transmits it to the information system of the aircraft. If the result does not conform, an error message is recorded.","After a first test command has been received (step ) and the determination has been made that it is intended for the avionics (step ), the maintenance function of the non-secured part of the information system of the aircraft encodes the command (step ) to make it compatible with the filter of the secured part and transmits it thereto (step ).","After the command has been filtered (step ), it is translated in order to permit the maintenance function, in this case the module for management of interactive testing or the module for management of configuration of equipment items of the aircraft, to launch the test (step ). The target or targets executes or execute the test and, as the case may be, the maintenance function calculates the test result. The result is transmitted via the command translator, which constructs, for example, a corresponding file, to the maintenance function of the non-secured part of the information system of the aircraft (), which retransmits it to the remote station (step ).","The remote station then can analyze the test result file and record it.","To automate all of the tests of a scenario, the sequence hereinabove must be repeated for all targets in question.","The test command transmitted to the avionics may relate in particular to a test as such, for example a functional test of an equipment item of the aircraft, or to management of the configuration of equipment items of the aircraft, especially an element of the avionics.","It should be noted that several methods exist for determining the configuration of equipment items of the aircraft. A first solution consists in interrogating each target, or in other words each element being tested. Alternatively, a second solution consists in accessing a configuration file determined and recorded by the maintenance function. According to this second solution, it is not necessary to analyze the configurations of the equipment items during the test.","According to a second example, the operating mode for achievement of a sequence of automatic tests in the systems of the connected mode and commercial mode is the following (once again, such a sequence of tests is executed in this case on the final assembly line of the aircraft).","As in the foregoing, a test command comprising a test application is transmitted over the network by the remote station, to an element of the maintenance function hosted in the non-secured part of the information system of the aircraft. After the command has been received (step ) and the determination has been made that the received command is intended for the systems of the connected world (step ), the element of the maintenance function encodes the command (step ) in order to make it compatible with the protocols of the connected world.","The target of the connected world executes the test (). If a result is expected, the element of the maintenance function recovers the test result and transmits it to the remote station (step ), which can analyze the test result and record it.","In order to automate all of the tests of a scenario, the foregoing sequence is repeated for each intended target.","As indicated in the foregoing, the purpose of the filter is to filter the data received from the network, in order to transmit only the correctly formatted data to the secured part of the information system of the aircraft.","The filtering module is preferably based on the sieve principle, or in other words on an iterative mechanism, wherein several levels of filters are used to optimize the processing times. Thus it is composed of several elements making it possible to filter the received data increasingly finely in order to allow passage of only the data corresponding to valid commands.","The filtering module necessitates that a command format be defined in order that only a certain type of network frames is processed. The format and the associated transport protocol can be defined in the form of parameters, accessible to the filtering module. For example, such parameters may stipulate that the commands be received in the form of Ethernet frames, indicate the sources authorized to transmit such commands, allocate a maximum lifetime to the frames, beyond which the frames are not taken into account, and indicate the characters that can be validly used to encode a command in a frame.","By way of illustration, the filtering of Ethernet frames can be achieved in three steps.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0087"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"500"},"Firstly, each frame is analyzed by verifying, for example, source physical address  and destination physical address , especially the MAC addresses (acronym for Media Access Control in English terminology), protocol type  and signature  of the complete frame. Data  of the frame are not analyzed in this first step.","If source physical address  and destination physical address , protocol type  and signature  do not conform to the parameters of the filtering module, the frame is rejected.","On the other hand, if source physical address  and destination physical address , protocol type  and signature  conform to the parameters of the filtering module, a second filtering step is employed.","It should be noted here that the first filtering step can be applied to data other than those cited, or on the other hand to fewer data.","The second step consists, for example, in analyzing data header . In particular, this second filtering step may consist in verifying IP version  (initials for Internet Protocol in English terminology), header length , service type , total data length , identification  used to reconstitute the fragments, lifetime , also known as TTL (initials for Time To Live in English terminology), protocol  and source address  and destination address .","Once again, if all of these information items do not conform to the parameters of the filtering module, the frame is rejected. On the other hand, if all of these information items conform to the parameters of the filtering module, a third filtering step is employed.","It should be noted here also that the second filtering step may be applied to data other than those cited, or on the other hand to fewer data.","The third step consists in this case in analyzing the characters of useful data  of the frame. Thus this step makes it possible to verify that the characters necessary for construction of the command cannot be used to construct the executable code. Advantageously, all the characters of the useful data must be chosen from the ASCII table, within the values between 032 and 090, as illustrated in .","If a character of useful data  does not belong to the ASCII table, between the values 032 and 090, the frame is rejected. On the other hand, if all the characters of useful data  belong to the ASCII table, between the values 032 and 090, the frame is transmitted to the secured part of the information system of the aircraft to be processed therein.","Naturally the third step of filtering may be applied to other criteria, especially more restrictive criteria.","The purpose of translation of the filtered commands is to establish an interface between the maintenance functions and the network.","This module is preferably developed in such a way that only the commands pertaining to instructions corresponding to maintenance functions implemented in the secured part of the information system of the aircraft have an action. This means that this module knows the instructions that may be executed by each application. In other words, a list of instructions or of a sequence of instructions is preferably stored in memory beforehand. Such a list defines a set of configurations of possible sequencings of instructions. This list may also define prohibited combinations.","This configuration is constructed in such a way that the sequencing of instructions of an application is known a priori. This permits the conversion module to verify that the commands that it receives and the sequencing of the associated instructions conforms to what the application is supposed to execute. This verification permits the conversion module to reject any unexpected sequencing and in this way to ensure that dangerous operations cannot be executed.","In a particular embodiment, the conversion module uses a table of correspondence between command names and the effective functions, or in other words instruction sequences, in order to associate one or more instructions with the command names received from the remote station. It should be noted here that the instructions may have several forms. For example, they may be pointers to functions or commands interfaced with the operating system of the maintenance device. The instructions make it possible in particular to simulate an action entered by a user at the maintenance-device interface accessible in the aircraft.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0103","num":"0102"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":"700"},"In this case correspondence table  comprises two columns: a column  containing the command names and a column  containing the list of instructions associated with each command.","Line  illustrates an example of a command to test a flight management device, referred to as FMU (initials for Flight Management Unit in English terminology). In this case the name of the command that can be used by a maintenance operator from a remote station is TEST:FMU. As shown, this command corresponds to execution of the instruction sequence comprising the instructions Set_Param(a, b, c), AutoTest_FMU and AutoTest_FMU.","After a command has been analyzed and declared to be in conformity, the conversion module transmits the corresponding instructions to the application in question. The application executes the instructions and in general returns a response. This response is received by the conversion module, which constructs a response message, preferably signed.","By way of illustration, returning to the example illustrated in , the operating mode for execution of instructions corresponding to the command TEST:FMU is the following,","the operator enters the command TEST:FMU at the remote station;","the command TEST:FMU is transmitted to the information system of the aircraft via a communication network;","the command received by the aircraft is encoded then filtered;","the instruction sequence corresponding to the filtered command is identified, in this case being the instructions Set_Param(a, b, c), AutoTest_FMU and AutoTest_FMU;","these instructions are transmitted by a software layer of API type (initials for Application Programming Interface in English terminology) to the intended applications (as if the command had been generated by keystrokes at a fixed station);","the intended applications execute the instructions in conformity with the command and transmit the results to the conversion module via the software layer of API type; and,","the conversion module forms a response message, for example by constructing a screen page or part of a screen page comprising the results, signs the response message to attest to the origin and integrity of the furnished information, and transmits the response message to the remote station via the communication network.","In the case of automatic tests, it is also possible to use a software application implemented on the remote station to generate a concatenation of commands in order to create a complete test scenario.","A device adapted for employment of the invention or part of the invention is illustrated in . Device  is, for example, a computer or a microcomputer.","In the present case, device  is provided with a communication bus , to which there are connected:","a central processing unit or microprocessor  (CPU, Central Processing Unit);","a read-only memory  (ROM, the acronym for Read Only Memory in English terminology), which may be provided with the programs \u201cProg\u201d, \u201cProg\u201d and \u201cProg\u201d;","a random-access memory or cache memory  (RAM, the acronym for Random Access Memory in English terminology), comprising registers capable of recording variables and parameters created and modified in the course of execution of the aforesaid programs; and","a communication interface , capable of transmitting and receiving data.","Optionally, device  may also be provided with:","a screen , for visualizing data and\/or for acting as a graphical interface with the user who will be able to interact with the programs according to the invention, with the aid of a keyboard and of a mouse , or of another pointing device such as a light pen, a touch screen or a remote control;","a hard disk , which can comprise the aforesaid programs \u201cProg\u201d, \u201cProg\u201d and \u201cProg\u201d and data processed or to be processed according to the invention; and","a memory card reader  capable of receiving a memory card  and reading or writing therein data processed or to be processed according to the invention.","The communication bus permits communication and interoperability among the different elements included in device  or connected thereto. The depiction of the bus is not limitative and, in particular, the central unit is capable of communicating instructions to any element of device  directly or via another element of device .","The executable code of each program permitting the programmable device to employ the process according to the invention may be stored, for example, on hard disk  or in read-only memory .","According to one variant, memory card  may contain data, especially signature keys, as well as the executable code of the aforesaid programs, which code will be stored on hard disk  once it has been read by device .","According to another variant, it will be possible for the executable code of the programs to be received at least partly via interface  to be stored in a manner identical to that described in the foregoing.","More generally, it will be possible for the program or programs to be loaded into one of the storage means of device  before being executed.","Central unit  will command and direct the execution of the instructions or portions of software code of the program or programs according to the invention, which instructions are stored on hard disk  or in read-only memory  or else in the other aforesaid storage elements.
