{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Not applicable.","The present invention relates to user interface improvement, and in particular, to improving the efficiency of a user by presenting relevant application components.","Unless otherwise indicated herein, the approaches described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.","The business user nowadays is facing various knowledge intensive tasks, which are performed in a heterogeneous application environment. On the one hand, this environment comprises common office applications (e.g., email, text processing software, presentation software, etc.) that are used for generic communication and authoring tasks. On the other hand, a crucial part of the working environment is formed by business applications (e.g., customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, etc.) that are used for specific business tasks. A large amount of information is exchanged through the first type of applications resulting in actions in the second type of applications\u2014e.g. emails are sent with important documents and trigger a task for generating a report, etc.","Given the above background, it has been observed that the following problems arise. First, users cannot (or can only hardly find) the right functionality for performing the necessary business tasks in the business applications. Second, some functionality of the business applications is never used, because the users do not know that it exists and they perform the corresponding operations manually with increased effort.","It is theorized that the reason for these problems is the complexity and specificity of business applications, and most importantly the lack of connection between the unstructured information (from email, documents, presentations) to the formal functionalities in the business applications. Herewith a method is proposed, which can be applied to any software application, to enable straightforward access from generic desktop applications and information sources to relevant information resources and user interface components of the business applications.","Embodiments of the present invention improve the efficiency of users in a user interface environment. Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward proactive user assistance in the context of knowledge intensive work. Particularly, the focus is set on the transition between unstructured work (e.g., in common office applications such as email and text processing applications) on the one hand, and structured work (e.g., in business applications, where various business transactions and processes can be triggered and managed) on the other hand.","The method according to an embodiment is based on the observation that each functionality in a business application, which is accessed directly by a business user, manifests in some user interface (UI). The method according to an embodiment uses the UI to assess the relevance and applicability of a given application (or application component) for a given user context, and to suggest this application (or application component) to the business user for performing their task. In the following the term \u201cuser context\u201d refers to all opened user working applications, documents etc. on the desktop level. The phrase \u201capplication component\u201d (or simply \u201cUI component\u201d) is used in the following, whereas this term can denote also a complete application (e.g., when it refers to the top-level component in that application).","The user working context may be captured through so called context sensors in terms of visible text on desktop level. Then the text is searched for strings, which occur as titles or labels in functional areas of the business applications. Depending on the key words found, relevant components of the business application are determined. A relevance score is computed for these components and used to order them in a suggestion list. The user can then access these components directly in a shortcut-like manner to perform their business task.","In one embodiment the present invention includes a computer implemented method of presenting relevant application components to a user of a computer system. The method includes capturing text displayed in open applications, determining key terms in the captured text based on a key terms catalog, and determining potentially relevant components by using the key terms to search a user interface dictionary. The user interface dictionary corresponds to a map between user interface strings and user interface components. The method further includes computing relevance scores for potentially relevant components, and presenting to the user the relevant components that correspond to relevant ones of the potentially relevant components, according to the relevance scores.","The method may also include creating the user interface dictionary, and creating the key terms catalog based on the user interface dictionary. The user interface dictionary may be created at design time, at runtime, or manually.","The text may be captured by monitoring application events, mouse events and keyboard events.","According to an embodiment, a computer program, embodied on a non-transitory recording medium, controls a computer system to present relevant application components to a user of the computer system. The computer program includes a capturing component, a first determining component, a second determining component, a computing component, and a presenting component. The capturing component is configured to control the computer system to capture a text displayed in open applications. The first determining component is configured to control the computer system to determine key terms in the captured text based on a key terms catalog. The second determining component is configured to control the computer system to determine potentially relevant components by using the key terms to search a user interface dictionary. The user interface dictionary corresponds to a map between user interface strings and user interface components. The computing component is configured to control the computer system to compute relevance scores for the potentially relevant components. The presenting component is configured to control the computer system to present to the user the relevant components, where the relevant components correspond to relevant ones of the potentially relevant components according to the relevance scores.","According to an embodiment, a computer system presents relevant application components to a user of the computer system. The computer system includes a client computer and an application server computer. The application server computer is coupled to the client computer via a network. The application server is configured to capture text displayed in open applications, to determine key terms in the captured text based on a key terms catalog, to determine potentially relevant components by using the key terms to search a user interface dictionary, and to compute relevance scores for the potentially relevant components. The client computer is configured to present to the user the relevant components, which are those that correspond to relevant ones of the potentially relevant components according to the relevance scores.","Embodiments of the present invention may be used to enhance any application with UI, for direct, shortcut-like access to relevant functionalities for the current user working task. For example, receiving an email with texts Sales Report, Q1, 2010 would result in a direct link to an application component for creating reports in an enterprise system in a side-bar component. As a result, the user can directly find and navigate to the required enterprise system screen from a contextual side bar.","The following detailed description and accompanying drawings provide a better understanding of the nature and advantages of the present invention.","Described herein are techniques for presenting relevant application components to a user. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous examples and specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention as defined by the claims may include some or all of the features in these examples alone or in combination with other features described below, and may further include modifications and equivalents of the features and concepts described herein.","In this document, various methods, processes and procedures are detailed. Although particular steps may be described in a certain order, such order is mainly for convenience and clarity. A particular step may be repeated more than once, may occur before or after other steps (even if those steps are otherwise described in another order), and may occur in parallel with other steps. A second step is required to follow a first step only when the first step must be completed before the second step is begun. Such a situation will be specifically pointed out when not clear from the context.","In this document, the terms \u201cand\u201d, \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\/or\u201d are used. Such terms are to be read as having the same meaning; that is, inclusively. For example, \u201cA and B\u201d may mean at least the following: \u201cboth A and B\u201d, \u201conly A\u201d, \u201conly B\u201d, \u201cat least both A and B\u201d. As another example, \u201cA or B\u201d may mean at least the following: \u201conly A\u201d, \u201conly B\u201d, \u201cboth A and B\u201d, \u201cat least both A and B\u201d. When an exclusive- or is intended, such will be specifically noted (e.g., \u201ceither A or B\u201d, \u201cat most one of A and B\u201d).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","108","108"]},"The presentation tier  generally includes one or more client computers . The client computers  generally provide a graphical user interface for users to interact with the other parts of the system . The user interface may be implemented by a browser, for example as a Java application.","The application tier  generally includes one or more application servers . The application servers  generally implement the business logic for processing interactions between the users and the underlying data. This business logic is generally referred to as \u201cthe application\u201d or \u201cthe application program\u201d. The application tier may implement various applications to perform various functions, such as invoicing, inventory control, supply chain management, etc. Various of the application servers  may perform different functions. For example, one of the application servers  may be used for prototyping or development, while the others may be used for business intelligence production activities.","The database tier  generally includes one or more database servers . The database servers  generally implement a database management system that stores and manipulates the underlying data and related metadata. This database management system is generally referred to as \u201cthe database\u201d or \u201cthe database system\u201d or \u201cthe database program\u201d. The database servers  may implement various types of database systems, including DB2, Informix, MaxDB, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server\u2122.","Although many separate devices are shown in each tier, such is mainly for illustration purposes to show scalability. For example, a single database server may be used in the basic configuration, but as the amount of data in the databases increases, the number of database servers  may be increased. As another example, a single application server may be used in the basic configuration, but as the amount of business logic processes increases, the number of application servers  may be increased.","The system  may be implemented in a variety of operating systems, for example, UNIX (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, Linux), Microsoft Windows, IBM Series i (former iSeries, AS\/400) and IBM zSeries (former S\/390). The various devices in the various tiers may implement different operating systems. For example, a client computer  may run Microsoft Windows\u2122 and an application server  may implement Linux. Note that various devices generally implement both an operating system program and another program, which are distinct. For example, a client computer  may implement Microsoft Windows\u2122 (operating system) and Microsoft Internet Explorer\u2122 (user interface program). An application server  may implement Linux (operating system) and an invoicing system (application program). A database server  may implement Linux (operating system) and Oracle database (database program).","The SAP Web Application Server\u2122 is a specific example of an implementation of the system . An embodiment of the present invention generally involves an application program (at the application server ) and a user interface program (at the client computer ), as detailed below.","As mentioned above, an embodiment is based on the observation that each functionality in a business application, which is accessed directly by a business user, manifests in some user interface (UI). The method uses the UI to assess the relevance and applicability of a given application (or application component) for a given user context and to suggest this application (or application component) to the business user for performing their task.","In the following, the term \u201cuser context\u201d refers to all opened user working applications, documents, etc. on the desktop level. The term \u201capplication component\u201d (or simply \u201cUI component\u201d) is used in the following to mean both one or more elements of an application, as well as to denote a complete application (e.g., when it refers to the top-level component in that application).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","200","100"]},"At , a user interface dictionary is created for application components. In general, the user interface (UI) dictionary corresponds to a map between user interface strings and user interface components. Before explaining the various possible ways to create the dictionary, first the dictionary structure is explained.","The UI dictionary can be generally described as a map that assigns visible UI strings (e.g., component titles, labels, etc.) to the respective UI components. For example, a panel with title \u201cAddress\u201d will be stored in the dictionary as a value for the key \u201cAddress\u201d.","If a UI string contains an expression with multiple words, various configuration options can be enabled during the UI dictionary creation to achieve different levels of precision for the dictionary. For example, it can be specified whether all words of such a string should be included in the dictionary or only the expression as a whole. In the first case, a panel with title \u201cPost code\u201d for example will be added as a value for 3 keys \u201cPost\u201d, \u201ccode\u201d, \u201cPost code\u201d. In the second case for example, the panel will be added only as a value for key \u201cPost code\u201d.","As a given text may occur in multiple UI components, the dictionary enables a one-to-many relationship from a given string to relevant components. For example, the dictionary may be implemented as a set of database tables or simply as a hash table with key\u2014the label text, and value\u2014a collection of relevant components:\n\nUIDictionary(KEY)=[COMP1, COMP2, . . . , COMP\n","The purpose of the presented method is to capture user working context and suggest relevant application components for performing the related business tasks. Therefore according to one embodiment, only accessible components may be stored in the UI dictionary, to keep its size moderate and to optimize performance and memory consumption. In the following description, the term \u201caccessible\u201d means that the components can be directly opened in the desktop environment (e.g. through an uniform resource location [URL] link). For example, in a web-based application this can be enabled through deep linking where a URL link can open the web application at a specific page showing specific components.","The UI dictionary can be constructed at design time of the applications (or application components), at runtime, or manually. These three ways are detailed in subsequent sections. A consideration for constructing the dictionary in any case is that it should be possible to trace the component hierarchy of the business application, i.e. to trace the parent\/child components of a given component. This is useful for the reasoning and relevance assessment of UI components.","To support relevance assessment of UI components for a given key term, a so called relevance score can be computed during UI dictionary construction for each UI component in an application. The relevance score of a component is a parameter that helps to order the components with respect to their relevance for a given key term. The final goal of the method is to suggest the accessible component with the highest relevance score for all detected keywords altogether.","One possible way to manage a component's relevance score is to provide a mapping (e.g., hash map, etc.) in each UI component (or custom component wrapper class), assigning the key term strings as keys to an integer value RELEVANCE_SCORE. Most programming languages have well defined hierarchies for their UI classes (e.g. for java see <hxxp:\/\/www.falkhausen.de\/en\/diagram\/html\/java.awt.Components.html>). So one possible way to compute the relevance score is as follows:","a) If the component that contains a given key term is accessible, it receives 1 to their relevance score for that key term.","b) If the component is not accessible, the parent hierarchy is traversed upwards starting from that component and the first encountered accessible component receives 1 to their relevance score for that key term.","For example, if an accessible panel has two nested inaccessible panels, with titles \u201cTask activation\u201d and \u201cTask delegation\u201d, and the UI dictionary has been configured to include all words of a UI string expression, the parent panel will have relevance score 2 for the key \u201cTask\u201d. If during the context detection (see the following sections) the term \u201cTask\u201d is encountered, this will lead to suggesting the parent panel which comprises a broader functionality set for a given concept (\u201cTask\u201d). (For example, \u201csuggesting\u201d according to an embodiment involves displaying relevant resources in a side bar, ordered by their relevance scores.) The user can then decide which functionality precisely they want to use (activation or delegation).","On the other hand, if the panel with title \u201cTask delegation\u201d is accessible, it will have relevance score 1 for \u201cTask\u201d and 1 for \u201cTask delegation\u201d (in case that the UI dictionary has been configured to include all words of a UI string expression). So if the term \u201cTask delegation\u201d is encountered during context detection (see the following sections), the panel with title \u201cTask delegation\u201d will have relevance score 2 altogether, whereas the parent panel will only have relevance score 1 for \u201cTask\u201d from the inaccessible sub-panel with title \u201cTask activation\u201d. As a result the panel with title \u201cTask delegation\u201d will be suggested with higher relevance score than the parent panel.","Relevance scores for the final suggestion may be refined additionally through the text analysis so that the relevance scores from the UI dictionary creation need not be final. This is discussed in more detail further in the document.","Design Time Construction","A design time construction of the UI dictionary may take place when the user interface is constructed in a given development environment (e.g. Eclipse). When component labels are created, a UI description document will be respectively generated\/updated. This document can be in any format with the only requirement, that it should allow tracing the component hierarchy. A further aspect is that labels in all supported locales should be considered.","For example, the UI description can be an extensible markup language (XML) file in the form shown in TABLE 1, where components that have the \u201curl\u201d attribute are considered accessible and the others not:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":"<component name=\u201dCOMPONENT_NAME\u201d url=\u201dSOME_URL\u201d>"}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<label text=\u201dLABEL_TEXT_EN\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<label text=\u201dLABEL_TEXT_DE\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"<component name=\u201dSUB_COMPONENT_NAME\u201d >"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<label text=\u201dLABEL_TEXT\u201d>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/component>"]},{"entry":[{},"..."]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<\/component>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Also a resource description framework (RDF) or web ontology language (OWL) format can be chosen for the UI description if some advanced reasoning needs to be supported later on.","When the system for proactive user assistance is started, this UI description document can be parsed to create the UI Dictionary structure and compute the component relevance scores as discussed in the previous section.","Runtime Construction","Regarding a runtime construction of the UI dictionary, note that most programming languages have well defined hierarchies of their UI classes (e.g. for java see <hxxp:\/\/www.falkhausen.de\/en\/diagram\/html\/java.awt.Components.html>). This allows accessing the component hierarchy of an application at runtime (e.g., when the application is initialized), going through all components that contain visible text (e.g., labels, buttons, titles, etc.) and generating the UI dictionary of an application dynamically by considering the texts in all available locales. In applications with many UI components a low priority background thread may be started to perform this dictionary creation in order to optimize system performance.","Manual Construction","Regarding manual construction of the UI dictionary, note that this may be the most simple but also laborious way to construct it. This manual process can be performed by browsing through an application and manually or semi automatically, creating a UI description document for the various application components. This way of UI Dictionary creation is suitable for implementing small proof-of-concept scenarios without intervention in the application development environment (as with design time construction) or in the application as such (as with runtime construction). A manual construction can be performed e.g. by modeling the UI in an ontology (RDF or OWL format) by using tools like Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (<hxxp:\/\/protege.stanford.edu\/>) or by simply typing a XML UI description file (see, e.g., TABLE 1).","According to an embodiment, the UI dictionary may be created manually as an OWL ontology using the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool <hxxp:\/\/protege.stanford.edu\/>. When the application for proactive user assistance (Java based) is started, the ontology may be parsed through Jena functionality (see <hxxp:\/\/jena.sourceforge.net\/>) to generate the UI dictionary as a hash table with keys\u2014UI component titles (class labels from the ontology above), and values\u2014an ArrayList of accessible components. For the values, a custom component class is used, which contains hash tables with keys\u2014the UI strings, and values\u2014relevance scores (see above). The custom component class may also have the accessible URL as member parameter.","At , the key terms catalog is created based on the user interface dictionary. The computer system  may create the key terms catalog by performing text analysis, as further detailed below.","In order to enable the transition from unstructured to structured application resources, various text analysis techniques may be used. Concretely, the method includes looking for UI strings of UI components, which are defined as keys in the UI dictionary, in the visible text of the active applications on user desktop level. These UI strings may be defined as key terms in a key terms catalog. The key terms catalog can be derived directly from the UI dictionary (see ), it can be created based on a UI description document (see TABLE 1), or it can be created manually.","The format of the key terms catalogue depends on the selected text analysis application. For example, the SAP BusinessObjects\u2122 Text Analysis framework (<hxxp:\/\/www.sap.com\/solutions\/sapbusinessobjects\/large\/eim\/textanalysis\/index.epx>) enables the creation of name catalogues with key terms, which are exported in XML format (see TABLE 2) and can be compiled to proprietary name catalog files.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 2"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<?xml version=\u201c1.0\u201d encoding=\u201cUTF-8\u201d ?>"},{"entry":"<catalog name=\u201cContext\u201d>"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<entity_category name=\u201cContext\u201d>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<entity_name canonical=\u201cEMEA\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<entity_name canonical=\u201cSAP Research\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<entity_name canonical=\u201cSAP Research Management\u201d>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"175pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<variant name=\u201cSAP Research Management Team\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<variant name=\u201cSAP Research Mgmt.\u201d\/>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"<\/entity_name>"]},{"entry":[{},"<entity_name canonical=\u201cTravel\u201d\/>"]},{"entry":[{},"<entity_name canonical=\u201cTravel Management\u201d\/>"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"203pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":[{},"<\/entity_category>"]}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"<\/catalog>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"According to an embodiment, the key terms catalog may be created in the SAP BusinessObjects\u2122 Text Analysis framework and more specifically in the ThingFinder\u2122 Name Catalog Workbench.

The name catalog is compiled and the compiled file may be provided for use by the application for proactive user assistance through the ThingFinder\u2122 Java\u2122 application programming interface (API).","At , the text displayed in the applications open to the user is captured. For example, the computer system  may capture the text by monitoring application events, mouse events and keyboard events.","More specifically, for capturing the visible text in the opened user applications, a set of context sensors can be used. The context sensors may be installed and running as standalone applications. The context sensors listen for application, mouse, keyboard and other events on the operating system level.

This functionality runs as an .exe on the local (client) computer and listens for application, mouse, keyboard and other events on the operating system level. This system enables, for example, capturing text, email fields, attachment titles, etc. from a currently selected email in Microsoft Outlook\u2122; capturing visible text in Microsoft Word\u2122, PDF (portable document format) documents and web browsers; etc. The system transmits the captured content over CORBA (common object request broker architecture) IIOP (internet inter-orb protocol) to the Java\u2122 application for proactive user assistance.","At , key terms in the captured text are determined based on the key terms catalog. For example, the computer system  may determine the key terms by performing text analysis on the captured text based on the key terms catalog.","More specifically, this step may performed by calling the text analysis functionality on the extracted visible text. Depending on the text analysis software, the confidence level of the found terms, the number of occurrences, etc. can be provided in the result. In any case, the result should deliver a collection of all key terms that were found in the visible text on desktop level.","According to an embodiment, the SAP BusinessObjects Text Analysis tool may be used in this step. More specifically, the ThingFinder\u2122 Java\u2122 API is used to call the text analysis functionality of the SAP BusinessObjects Text Analysis\u2122 framework on the content, transmitted through the context sensors. The developed text analysis name catalog is used for the key term search.","At , potentially relevant components are determined by using the key terms to search the user interface dictionary. For example, the computer system  may determine the potentially relevant components according to the user interface dictionary being keyed according to the plurality of key terms.","More specifically, the collection with found key terms from the text analysis may be used to get all relevant (accessible) components for these key terms from the UI dictionary. Recall that the key terms match the key in the dictionary, where the values are collections with relevant components.","According to an embodiment, the search may performed by iterating through the ThingFinder\u2122 result set from the key terms search and getting the component ArrayLists from the UI dictionary hash table by using the found key terms as keys.","At , relevance scores are computed for the potentially relevant components. The computer system  may compute the relevance scores in a number of ways: according to the number of occurrences of the key terms for a given component in the analyzed text provided by the context sensors, according to a hierarchical user interface component structure, or according to the number of occurrences of the key terms for a given component in the analyzed text that are additionally weighted according to the hierarchical user interface component structure, etc. The ratings are generally influenced by the following: 1) how many key terms that are relevant for a given component were found in the captured text\/context information; and 2) what is the number of occurrences of each of the found key terms in the analyzed text\/context information.","More specifically, to optimize the suggestion of relevant components, an overall relevance score is computed for each component. The computation depends also on the capabilities of the text analysis software. The purpose is to finally determine the components that are most relevant for the current user working context and can potentially best serve the user in performing their tasks. Thereby it should be considered that a component can have a relevance score for more than one key term, a key term can have various number of occurrences in a given text, and a key term can be detected with various confidence levels (e.g., considering substrings, etc.).","One way to compute the overall relevance score for a component is as follows. The overall component relevance score may be computed as the sum of component relevance scores for all associated key terms, that is",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["R","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"n"},"mo":"\u2062","msub":{"mi":["r","ci"]}}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0076"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["r","c"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["r","h"]},{"mi":["c","j"]}],"mo":["+","+"],"mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"m"},"mo":"\u2062","mn":"1"}}}},{"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}}]}}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["R\u2014overall component relevance score,","r\u2014overall component relevance score for key term i with 1 to n enumerating all key terms for which a component is relevant,","r\u2014overall component relevance score for a given key term,","r\u2014current component relevance score for key term based on the component hierarchy (see  above), and","c\u2014confidence level of key term occurrence (optional depending on text analysis software) with 1 to m enumerating all key term occurrences."]}},"According to an embodiment, the computation of the relevance scores may be performed according to the formulas above by iterating through the obtained ArrayLists with relevant components.","At , relevant components are presented to the user.

The accessible relevant components may be directly openable in the user interface environment or directly openable in the user interface environment according to a uniform resource location link.

This can happen for example in a side bar or simply in a console, whereas it is preferable to enable direct access to the UI components, e.g. through links or buttons. A side bar can be implemented as a standalone application on desktop level or it can be integrated also in other applications (including office applications). Additional filtering criteria can be provided, e.g. to specify that only components with relevance score above a given threshold should be displayed.","According to an embodiment, the relevant components may be suggested by providing the URL link from the custom component instances (see ) in the Java\u2122 console, ordered by the relevance score.

One alternative configuration is that the application server  creates the UI dictionary during runtime, i.e. when loading application components, eventually derives a key terms catalog from the dictionary, and stores them in memory. The client computer  captures the context through the context sensoring component , transmits it to the application server , and receives the evaluated suggestions (the relevant components ) as output. This alternative may be implemented when the \u201cdatabase\u201d per se is eliminated, for example when storage is performed in memory of the application server  or when the application server  implements an in-memory database. Another alternative configuration is when the UI dictionary  and the key terms catalog  are created manually and stored on the client computer , or they are created on the application server  and downloaded to the client computer .

The method enables users to get an easy short-cut-like access to the most relevant components of business applications based on the inferred user context on the desktop level. The context is determined through the visible text of various office applications on the user desktop and can change dynamically at any time. This will trigger also change in the suggestion of the relevant components so that the user will always have links to the most relevant business applications\/application components at any time. Embodiments of the present invention work well when the business applications allow deep linking, i.e. direct shortcuts to internal UI screens\/components.
