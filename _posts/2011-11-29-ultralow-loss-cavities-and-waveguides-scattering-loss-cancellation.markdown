title: Ultralow loss cavities and waveguides scattering loss cancellation
abstract: A waveguide system includes a first waveguide having surface roughness along at least one surface and a second waveguide substantially identical to the first waveguide and having substantially identical surface roughness along a corresponding side. The first and second waveguides are separated from each other by a predetermined distance and are configured to receive respective first and second light signals having antisymmetric modes. The predetermined distance between the first and second waveguide tends to cause cancellation of at least far-field polarization radiation emanating from the first and second waveguides and resulting from the surface roughness.

The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.","This application relates to waveguides and in particular waveguides that reduce radiation losses due to optical scattering.","Currently a limitation of the performance of optical microcavities and waveguides is posed by lithographically formed roughness generated through the etch process which defines the sidewalls of waveguides and microcavities, including both microring and photonic crystal cavities. This lithographically formed roughness tends to scatter the light out of the guided optical modes generating optical losses that may be detrimental to the performance of the optical waveguides and cavities. While lithographic roughness can be improved somewhat by using highly controlled lithographic processes there is often no practical way to achieve the low loss level that is desirable for certain highly desirable applications in the context of integrated photonics.","The present invention is embodied in a waveguide system including a first waveguide having surface roughness along at least one surface and a second waveguide substantially identical to the first waveguide and having substantially identical surface roughness along a corresponding surface. The first and second waveguides are separated from each other by a predetermined distance and are configured to receive respective first and second light signals having antisymmetric modes.

In the examples described below, each waveguide includes at least a lower waveguide and an upper waveguide separated by a cladding material. Light is coupled into the waveguide system such that it propagates through the waveguide in an anti-symmetric mode. In one example embodiment, light propagating through the lower waveguide is primarily in the transverse magnetic (TM) mode while light propagating through the upper waveguide is primarily in the transverse electric (TE) mode. As described below with reference to , the effect of this construction is essentially to cancel the radiation fields generated by the polarization currents of the two waveguides, greatly reducing polarization radiation emitted by the waveguides, at least in the far field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIGS. 6 and 6A","FIGS. 6A and 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B"],"b":["602","604","608","612","602","606","610","610","606","604","608","612","606","610","616","620","618","622"],"sub":"2"},"The described materials are exemplary. The waveguide system may be formed from other materials commonly used to form semiconductor waveguides, for example, alternating layers of indium phosphide (InP) and Indium Gallium Arsenide phosphide (InGaAsP). Alternatively, multiple layers of deposited amorphous materials such Silicon Nitride, or Bismuth Oxide may be used to form the waveguide system. In addition, dual or multiple layers of crystalline silicon can be used as the core material with a silica cladding formed through use of double or multiple layer silicon on insulator materials (SOI).","The item  shown in  is a photo resist mask pattern that is used to form the waveguide in the compound structure. In a typical fabrication process, an etchent may be applied to the semiconductor wafer as shown in  to selectively remove portions of the semiconductor wafer that are not covered by the mask . This removal operation may be down to stop etch layer (not shown) formed between the layers  and . During the etching process, unevenness along the edges of the mask may cause vertical ridges, such as the ridges  and  shown in , on the side surfaces of the waveguide. Alternatively, the pattern may be transferred to a third material, such as nickel which acts as a robust hard-mask during the lithography process. An example process for forming waveguide systems using such a third material is described in an article by T.

As shown in , light may propagate through the two waveguides \u2032 and \u2032 in a symmetric mode () or in an anti-symmetric mode (). Because the roughness on both waveguides \u2032 and \u2032 is substantially identical, as it results from the etch process that defines both waveguides, the roughness produced dipole moments may be identical and perfectly in phase in the case of symmetric mode as shown in  or identical and 180\u00b0 out phase in the case of the anti-symmetric mode shown in . This feature of the waveguide system may be used to effectively cancel the scattering induced radiation emanating from the waveguide, at least in the far field.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 10","FIG. 10"],"b":["1002","1006","1004","1002","1006","1002","1006","1002","1006","1010","1002","1012","1006","1002","1006","1002","1006"]},"The separation of the waveguides  and  depends on the wavelength of the light being transmitted through the waveguides. Coherent interference between the radiation patterns of the waveguides  and  have some impact on the radiation losses regardless of the separation. However, the largest effect is anticipated where the dipole moment of the scattering system (consisting of the roughness from multiple waveguides) cancels, or is near cancellation. When the dipole moment cancels, or nearly cancels, only the quadripole and higher order multipole moments remain. These moments tend to have much poorer radiation efficiency, and therefore yield lower propagation losses. Broadband cancellation of the of the dipole moment most often occurs when the waveguide separation is smaller than an optical wavelength.","As illustrated in , however, the structure of the two waveguides in the anti-symmetric mode may not be identical to that of a single waveguide or to the structure waveguides operating in the symmetric mode. This is because the waveguides operating in the anti-symmetric mode may have a lower effective index of refraction and, thus, less confinement of the optical beam than either a single waveguide or a waveguide system operating in the symmetric mode. For a linear waveguide, this effect may be compensated by forming thicker waveguides.

The vertical mode profile impacts the propagation constant and the lateral mode confinement. Thus, in order to recover identical external coupling to the microcavity while reducing the roughness induce scattering losses, the layer thickness hole radius and hole spacing may need to change. In particular it may be desirable to increase the layer thickness to achieve the same modal confinement in order to achieve strong Bragg reflection within the photonic lattice. Furthermore because vertical mode confinement is closely linked to the effective index of refraction and the lateral confinement, it may be desirable to make a small adjustment of the design of the device to ensure proper coupling between photonic crystal cavity and photonic crystal waveguide. For a particular device, such an adjustment may be achieved in a straight forward manner using finite time domain and finite element modeling techniques.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 17","b":["1702","1704","1706","1702","1706"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 18","b":["1802","1804","1806","1808","1806","1808","1810","1812"]},"To adapt the microring design from a single layer to a dual layer system employing the anti-symmetric super mode, it may be desirable to increase the layer thickness to achieve the same modal confinement that is desirable to implement tight bends within the microring. In addition because the vertical mode confinement is closely linked to the effective index of refraction and the lateral confinement, it may be desirable to implement a small correction in the ring bus coupling gap and the waveguide width. For a particular device, this modification can be achieved in a straightforward manner using finite time domain and finite element modeling techniques.","While two embodiments of the invention, a microring resonator device and a photonic crystal cavity device have been described, the subject invention has much broader application and may be used in any optical device having waveguides that are subject to unwanted polarization radiation due to roughness along the waveguide surfaces. To reduce this radiation, the device may be formed as two substantially identical vertically parallel devices having substantially identical waveguides separated by a small distance. Input light to the device is desirably mode-converted to propagate through the vertically parallel devices in an antisymmetric super mode. It may also be desirable to mode convert the light at the output of the device to provide an output signal having, for example, both TE and TM modes.","Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to specific embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the details shown.
