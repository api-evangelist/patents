title: Apparatus, systems and methods for online, multi-parcel, multi-carrier, multi-service parcel returns shipping management
abstract: The present invention provides a computer system (the “System”, or the “Return System”) that is configured and programmed to provide online stores with a fast, simple, convenient way for eCommerce customers of an online store to return merchandise purchased from that store from within that online store. The Return System provides multi-carrier shipment rating, shipment labeling, shipment tracking, shipment tracking management reports, returns analysis and returns management reporting In an exemplary embodiment, the Return System has three major components: 1.) A Returns Manager Subsystem that provides a user interface to each Merchant to setup the Merchant's account, setup the Merchant's return policy and rules, and to monitor the status and movement of return shipments; 2.) A Consumer Returns Subsystem (also sometimes referred to as a “Customer Returns Subsystem”) that provides each consumer using the Returns System with an online user interface that leads the consumer through the returns process, displays the return policies and rules to the consumer, provides shipping document to ship the return package if appropriate, and permits the consumer to track their return shipments; and 3.) a Returns Processing Subsystem that, in the exemplary embodiment, provides background shipping and tracking functionality. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the Online Merchant integrates the Merchant's online system with the Returns Processing Subsystem. In another exemplary embodiment, the Returns Processing Subsystem is provided as an independent web-based application service (referred to as a “Return Merchant Service System”) operated by a common provider. In such an embodiment, the Merchant's system interacts with the Return Merchant Service System through Application Program Interfaces (“API”).

As with traditional brick and mortar purchases, eCommerce purchasers sometimes desire to return one or more of the items purchased. eCommerce purchasers are sometimes dissatisfied with the procedure with which eCommerce merchants provide for returning eCommerce-purchased merchandise.","Electronic Commerce returns and exchange processing has been inefficient for both the consumer and the online merchant. Electronic Commerce consumers have experienced slow, inconvenient, clumsy returns and exchange processes online. The experience contrasts sharply with consumer expectations that returning a product online should be as easy as ordering it online.","Many eCommerce merchandisers use a return authorization system for processing eCommerce-purchased merchandise returns. Unfortunately, return authorizations can often be difficult for the consumer to obtain and can take a long time to receive. In some cases, online stores require customers to call a customer service center to request a return authorization. Calling customer service for a return authorization is inconsistent with an online shopper's preference for doing business online.","Some online merchants, on the other hand, require shoppers to compose a return email request. As yet another alternative, some online merchants provide return instructions on the back of a packing slip, but may not accept return of every item in the shipped order.","After authorizing a return, the online merchant mails out an Authorized Return Service label, such as a UPS Authorized Return Service label. This return authorization process results in a slow return and refund or exchange.","Refunds for returned items are often cumbersome and can take weeks to appear in the returning shopper's payment card accounts. Exchange requests can take even longer, especially if the exchange item is out of stock.","Once a return is authorized and the customer has all of the necessary paper work, returning the item is not necessarily an easy matter for the consumer. Even if the returning customer has retained the box and packing materials for the item to be returned, most online stores do not provide an easy way for customers to pass the return package to a carrier. Some merchants provide UPS call tags inside each box they ship.","It would sometimes be more convenient for customers to return or exchange merchandise at a brick and mortar store. However, physical brick and mortar stores may not accept returns from their online siblings.","eCommerce-purchased merchandise returns can also be a problem for online merchants. An inefficient returns and exchange process that causes individual customer dissatisfaction may result in online shopper defection to online stores that provide higher-quality return and exchange services.","The various methods mentioned above of providing returns and exchange services are inefficient for both the merchant and the returning consumer. Processing return and exchange requests by telephone requires the online merchant to provide expensive facilities, staff, and training. Furthermore, a customer service call center cannot match the convenience of the Internet for an online shopper. Return requests by email, telephone, and paper forms are collected with manual processes and\/or in non-standard formats. This makes generating returns reports an expensive data-collection chore which is subject to the judgment of individual customer service reps.","Further, the manual returns and exchange processes described above do not necessarily provide online merchants with returns information in a timely manner. For example, merchants may not know a return is coming until the returned package arrives. The return might be due to defective merchandise or poor packaging that caused breakage. While the first return shipment is in transit, the merchant continues to ship defective or poorly-packaged merchandise.","Each online merchant has its own policy regarding returns and exchange processing. For example, many merchants are willing to pay for all return shipping to provide high-quality service. Other merchants are willing to pay for some return shipments, but not for expensive or ill-justified returns. Still other merchants want to accept all or some returns but are not willing to pay for their return shipment.","According to one commentator, \u201c[t]here's no easy way to solve the problem [of returns]. Internet companies fall apart on this.\u201d (Melissa Barnes, The Yankee Group, in Internet World, Aug. 15, 1999.) Therefore, in order for eCommerce to prosper, a solution to managing eCommerce returns must be provided.","The present invention provides a computer system (the \u201cSystem\u201d, or the \u201cReturn System\u201d) that is configured and programmed to provide online stores with a fast, simple, convenient way for eCommerce customers of an online store to return merchandise purchased from that store from within that online store.","In an exemplary embodiment described herein, the Return System has three major components: 1.) A Returns Manager Subsystem that provides a user interface to each Merchant to setup the Merchant's account, setup the Merchant's return policy and rules, and to monitor the status and movement of return shipments; 2.) A Consumer Returns Subsystem (also sometimes referred to herein as a \u201cCustomer Returns Subsystem\u201d) that provides each consumer using the Returns System with an online user interface that leads the consumer through the returns process, displays the return policies and rules to the consumer, provides shipping document to ship the return package if appropriate, and permits the consumer to track their return shipments; and 3.) a Returns Processing Subsystem that, in the exemplary embodiment, provides background shipping and tracking functionality. In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the Online Merchant integrates the Merchant's online system with the Returns Processing Subsystem.","In another exemplary embodiment, as described herein below, the Returns Processing Subsystem is provided as an independent web-based application service (referred to below as a \u201cReturn Merchant Service System\u201d) operated by a common provider, sometimes referred to herein as \u201ciShip.com\u201d.","The above-described components are sometimes collectively and\/or separately referred to herein as the System, and\/or as the Return System. References to the Return System should be understood by someone with ordinary skill in the art to refer to the appropriate component and\/or components of the system. It should be understood by someone with ordinary skill in the art that reference herein to Merchant setup, monitoring, tracking and other Merchant functions and interactions with the Return System are provided through the Returns Manager Subsystem of the Return System; and that reference to Consumer input, monitoring, tracking, and other Consumer functions and interactions with the Return System are provided through the Consumer Returns Subsystem of the Return System.","It should be further understood by someone with ordinary skill in the art that use of the System component terms described above is for illustrative purposes only and is not a limitation of the invention. Each of the above-described components can be integrated with the other as a single system without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Further, functions from each of the above-described Returns Manager and Consumer Returns components can be separately provided by a processing subsystem, such as the Returns Processing System, with communication interfaces with each of the other subsystems and with the system databases without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Without departing from the spirit of the invention, it should be understood by someone with ordinary skill in the art that in an alternative embodiment of the invention, the main components of the Return System can perform various levels of processing.","Each Merchant that wants to offer its customers with in-store access to the Return System  first accesses the Returns Manager Subsystem User Interface of the System to set up the Merchant's Account, and to establish rules governing the Merchant's returns, exchanges and refunds policy. The Return System  then provides a Customer Returns Subsystem and User Interface in the Merchant's online store to the Merchant's customers with which to facilitate the return shipping of merchandise.","The System provides each online store (sometimes referred to herein as eCommerce Provider or Merchant) with the capability to specify the store's individualized returns, exchange, and refund policies. The System enforces a consistent, standardized, and automated returns policy for each online store.","Among the returns policy options available through the System, customers can be issued an immediate, automated return authorization. Other returns policy options allow each online store to specify whether or not shipping charges are to be paid by the store or by the customer. The System further provides customers with the ability to print a return shipping label on a printer attached to the customer's personal computer directly from the online store.","The System provides for the return of items to different locations, including the online store's main warehouse, to secondary facilities, or to sibling retail locations.","The System further provides for the return of items through multiple carriers or through retail shippers, such as Mail Boxes Etc., thereby offering customers choices and insulating the online store from carrier labor strikes.","In the Merchant's online store, a customer makes a purchase, which is subsequently shipped to the customer (the \u201cConsumer\u201d). The Consumer if dissatisfied with the ordered item, wants to return it. To do so, the Consumer returns to the Merchant's online store, accesses the Consumer's order history for that Merchant, and arranges to return the item or items from the Merchant's online store.","The System collects, according to each online store's specification, consumer reasons for returning items and stores this information in a centralized database of return information. The System analyzes and reports the return data, and issues refunds to customers in accordance with the online store's refund policy.","The Return System  provides each participating Merchant with tracking capabilities for returned parcels. The Return System provides notification and tracking reports for inbound returns, allowing the store to prepare its receiving dock, and to respond to the return reason if appropriate such as by adjusting inventory or shipping practices to avoid continued potential for returns.","Because return shipping is arranged from within the online store, the System provides the returning consumer with the ability to immediately convert a return to an exchange, or into an additional order.","A Return Merchant Service System component of the computer System embodying the present invention interfaces and interacts with a Merchant's system to provide each subscribing eCommerce Merchant with various shipment management functions through Application Program Interfaces (\u201cAPI\u201d) and web-based user Merchant interfaces, including but not limited to: shipment rating, shipment labeling, shipment tracking, shipment tracking management reports, returns analysis and returns management reporting. The present invention provides each Merchant's customers with pricing of shipping rates for various shipping options, processing of returns requests, printing of shipping, returns, or traveler labels at the customer's own laser printer, and tracking of each return shipment.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document, including but not limited to the renderings of graphic user interface displays in the FIGURES, contains material which is subject to copyright protection by Stamps.com, Inc.

View inbound returning merchandise shipments in summary or in detail; 2.) Track shipments for multiple carriers with only one tracking number; 3.) Analyze return patterns and trends; 4.) Administer the returns process; 5.) Setup account names and access privileges; 6.) Establish the parameters for automatic enforcement of their store's return policy; 7.) Build return shipping options; 8.) Build questions to determine why customer is returning merchandise; 9.) Build return policy exceptions; 10.) Build automated Email responses; 11.) Build integration links between the merchant's site and the Returns Manager Subsystem.","A Customer Returns User Interface component of the computer System embodying the present invention provides each customer of an eCommerce Merchant (for which the Return Policy Engine has been installed and the necessary parameters established) with a User Interface with the relevant eCommerce Merchant's online store with which the customer interacts to return or exchange an item of merchandise.","Different types of embodiments for the Customer Returns Subsystem and User Interface features of this invention include, among others: 1.) a Customer Returns Desktop application with a Returns Back Office application; 2.) Customer Returns Integrated\u2014a web enabled application and user interface integrated into the Merchant's site; and 3.)

To do this, the System generates executable code which it distributes with certain displayable frames to the Web Browser Client. This distribution of code for purposes of regenerating the Graphic Array differs from the initial generation of the Graphic Array as was described above. For example, in the embodiment of the invention depicted in through , in the initial development of the Graphic Array, the System distributes the functions that initially generate the Graphic Array as follows: the Shipper entering shipping information , displaying errors to the Shipper that insufficient shipping information has been provided and prompting the Shipper for additional information , and displaying the Graphic Array , are all processed by the Web Browser at the Client; all other functions and processes depicted in through are performed by one or more of the System Servers.","Distribution to the Web Browser Client by the System of executable code that regenerates the Graphic Array provides the capability to dynamically reflect in the Graphic Array any changes that the Shipper may enter to the various Shipper Parcel Specifications; the Graphic Array immediately displays the new information without requiring the Shipper to request a recalculation, such as by clicking on a \u201cRegenerate\u201d button or the like.","To facilitate regeneration of the Graphic Array, the System generates executable code which it distributes with the frame, such as the frame that is displayed to the user for collecting the Parcel Specifications, to the Web Browser Client. A displayable frame is a set of information for display on the client display device. For example, in , in one embodiment of the invention, a first frame of the screen depicted in comprises the Title \u201cRates & Times\u201d , the instruction \u201cClick on the price to select a delivery date, time and carrier.\u201d , the legend \u201cDate you expect to ship your package:\u201d , the input field for the Expected Shipping Date , the legend \u201cI'll ship the package from:\u201d and the input field for the Shipping Location ; a second frame of the screen depicted in comprises the Graphic Array.","As the System generates the display of each frame, the System generates executable code which it distributes with, e.g., the Rate & Times frame, to the Web Browser Client. Thereafter, the Web Browser Client uses the executable code to automatically regenerate the display of the Graphic Array each time the Shipper makes changes to the Shipper Parcel Specifications. In one embodiment of the dynamic regeneration aspect of the invention, the executable code distributed to the Web Browser Client uses JavaScript.","In some cases, the executable code sent to the Web Browser Client provides the information and the capability to regenerate the Graphic Array without any further communication with the Server. In other cases, the Web Client Browser must return control to the Server so that the Server can access data maintained by or accessible by the Server; the Server then regenerates the Graphic Array or otherwise provides the Web Browser Client with the information necessary to regenerate the Graphic Array.","In an exemplary embodiment of the automatic dynamic regeneration aspect of the invention, the executable code distributed to the Web Browser Client contains the logic to apply Carrier Rules to Shipper Parcel Specification changes. For instance, Shipper changes to certain Service Options, e.g., - as depicted in , would be automatically processed by the Web Client Browser and the Web Client Browser would regenerate the Single Day Rate Graphic Array depicted therein to reflect the Shipper changes. In one such automatic dynamic regeneration embodiment, only those functions that do not require further access to the relevant Carrier's database are distributed to the Web Browser Client.","It should be noted that, according to the automatic dynamic regeneration aspect of the invention, if after the Shipper views the Graphic Array the Shipper enters changes to any of the factors with which the System calculates the rates and develops the Graphic Array, the System uses a similar logic flow to regenerate the Graphic Array as was explained above in relation to through ","The dynamic regeneration capability is used to automatically regenerate response screens in many places throughout the System. For instance, as was mentioned above, as in the case of , if the Shipper changes Origin Zip Code and\/or Ship Location Type, the System will automatically regenerate a list of possible Drop Off Location choices.","C.
