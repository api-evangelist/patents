title: Quinoline-oxazoline compounds and their use in oxidation synthesis
abstract: 

such that when Xis N R2 is Z and R1 is absent, and when Xis N either R1 or R3 is Z and R2 is absent. R1 and R3 through R12 are independently H or a pendant moiety which does not interfere with coordination of either N in the quinoline compound with a coordination center. These compounds can be complexed with a suitable coordination center such as catalytically active palladium and can be highly useful in catalytically oxidizing alkenes with high regioselectivity.

The United States government has certain rights to this invention.","Conversion of alkenes to ketones can be conventionally accomplished by ozonolysis or by Tsuji-Wacker oxidation. Such conversion processes can be useful in a wide variety of industrial and synthetic chemistry applications as solvents, intermediates, or the like. In particular, Tsuji-Wacker oxidation, which is a palladium-catalyzed conversion of a terminal olefin to a methyl ketone, has widespread synthetic applications, owing to an extensive substrate scope and the orthogonal reactivity of olefins and ketones. However, a major limitation in the scope for Wacker oxidation chemistry is for allylic alcohols and their protected variants. Oxidation of theses substrates yields a high utility acyloin product, which is an attractive synthon for asymmetric synthesis. However, previous reports of Wacker oxidations on protected allylic alcohols using Tsuji-type conditions found diminished selectivity for the desired methyl ketone and frequently yielded 1:1 formation of the corresponding aldehyde.","The current approach to accessing the methyl ketone products from allylic alcohols is a two-step procedure, which generally utilizes stoichiometric amounts of mercury, palladium, and copper. Although this method allows for access to acyloin products in good yields, the method also results in high metal loadings and toxic byproducts. Therefore, existing techniques have limitations which reduce their desirability in commercial use.","In light of the problems and deficiencies note above, the present invention provides a quinoline compound having the formula:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0005"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"24.38mm","wi":"33.78mm","file":"US08263774-20120911-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"where one of Xand Xis N and the other is C and one of R1, R2 and R3 is Z wherein Z is an oxazoline radical having the formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0007"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"17.70mm","wi":"22.35mm","file":"US08263774-20120911-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 "]},"These compounds can be complexed with a suitable coordination center such as catalytically active palladium.

While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that various changes to the invention may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, as claimed, but is presented for purposes of illustration only and not limitation to describe the features and characteristics of the present invention, to set forth the best mode of operation of the invention, and to sufficiently enable one skilled in the art to practice the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is to be defined solely by the appended claims.","In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used.","The singular forms \u201ca,\u201d \u201can,\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to \u201ca moiety\u201d includes reference to one or more of such groups and reference to \u201cexposing\u201d refers to one or more such steps.","As used herein with respect to an identified property or circumstance, \u201csubstantially\u201d refers to a degree of deviation that is sufficiently small so as to not measurably detract from the identified property or circumstance. The exact degree of deviation allowable may in some cases depend on the specific context.","As used herein, \u201caryl\u201d refers to aromaticity of compounds which can be carbocyclic or heterocyclic, including single and multiple ring systems.","As used herein, \u201cderivatives\u201d of side groups are intended to cover substituted groups where one or more hydrogens is replaced by a corresponding side group. The replacement side groups can be exemplified generally by alkyls, aryls, alkoxy, non-aromatic cyclics, silyls, amino, and the like. As long as functionality of the compound is maintained no particular limitation on the specific nature of the derivative is intended.","As used herein, \u201cketone\u201d refers to a carbonyl bonded to two carbon atoms. As such ketones also include acyloins. For example, protected allylic alcohols can be converted to acyloin ketones in accordance with the present invention.","As used herein, a plurality of compositional elements and\/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member.

It is to be understood that such range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. For example, a numerical range of about 1 to about 4.5 should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited limits of 1 to about 4.5, but also to include individual numerals such as 2, 3, 4, and sub-ranges such as 1 to 3, 2 to 4, etc. The same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value, such as \u201cless than about 4.5,\u201d which should be interpreted to include all of the above-recited values and ranges. Further, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristic being described.","In the present disclosure, any steps recited in any method or process claims may be executed in any order and are not limited to the order presented in the claims.

After 1 h the reaction mixture was worked up in the standard way and the product was isolated to confirm that the product was indeed the methyl ketone. Each of H NMR, C NMR, and GC-MS analysis all indicate exclusive formation of the methyl ketone in accordance with the published NMR data, with no aldehyde product observed. Further, dodecane was observed in the NMR spectra.","Evaluation of Enantiomeric Excess Retention:","Finally, to ascertain the applicability of this method to target synthesis, enantioenriched protected allylic and homoallylic alcohols were oxidized under the optimal conditions with no loss of enantiomeric excess according to the following equations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0115","num":"0112"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00038","num":"00038"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00038","he":"59.86mm","wi":"75.95mm","file":"US08263774-20120911-C00038.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"To 2 mL brown screw cap vials was weighed AgSbF(0.012 mmol and 0.006 mmol respectively) followed by a specified volume of a Pd(quinox)Cl(0.005 mmol and 0.002 mmol respectively) standard solution and the mixtures were stirred for \u02dc15 min. 70 wt % TBHP(1.2 mmol, 172 \u03bcL) was added to the vials and stirred for an additional 10 min, at which time the enantiomerically enriched substrates (0.1 mmol, 98% ee and 92% ee respectively) were added as standard solutions so that the concentration of the reaction would be 0.1 M.

Of particular interest is the exceptional performance of the Quinox ligand, which is rapidly synthesized in two steps, as compared with the other bidentate nitrogen ligands evaluated. The ligand framework is also highly modular, which can allow effective design of substrate and reaction choices.","The foregoing detailed description describes the invention with reference to specific exemplary embodiments.
