The incidence of cardiovascular problems is likely to continue its steady rise as the \u201cBaby Boomer\u201d generation ages and as obesity and diabetes rates continue to rise. Therefore, development of better therapies is of utmost importance.","Hydrogen sulfide (HS) is a recognized endogenous signaling molecule that has been shown to modulate immune and mitochondrial function, act both directly and indirectly as an antioxidant, and increase blood flow by a variety of mechanisms. In addition, hydrogen sulfide is a potent anti-inflammatory agent and modulator of cell death. This plethora of properties makes hydrogen sulfide an ideal candidate for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancers, inflammatory disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, neurodegenerative disease, AIDS, and other pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress, an imbalance in redox homeostasis, and\/or immune dysfunction.","Whereas the main physiological roles of HS are in signaling and cytoprotection in normal (i.e., non-transformed) cells and tissues, it is now clear that in transformed (i.e., malignant) cells, HS displays prooxidant and proapoptotic effects. These effects constitute the basis for developing a novel therapeutic and\/or prophylactic approach to treat conditions associated with uncontrolled cell growth such as cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases.","Hydrogen sulfide is produced endogenously from cysteine by the enzymes cystathionine beta-synthase, cystathionine gamma-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Hydrogen sulfide prodrugs can provide an exogenous source for hydrogen sulfide in the body, however, currently used hydrogen sulfide prodrugs contain no more than 57% bioactive sulfur (sulfur capable of being converted into hydrogen sulfide in vivo). On the other hand, it has become increasingly clear that sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS, also known as sodium hydrosulfide), which contains 57% bioactive sulfur, releases hydrogen sulfide in a sudden and uncontrolled manner when injected into the body of a mammal, whereas it is highly unlikely that cells or tissues are ever exposed to HS generated in such manner. Therefore, there is a need to identify hydrogen sulfide prodrugs that are safe and effective, are active when orally administered, release HS in a controlled and sustained manner, and have high bioavailability for treatment of cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, neurodegenerative disease, AIDS, and other pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress, an imbalance in redox homeostasis, and\/or immune dysfunction.","The invention features a composition including 90-99.9% (w\/w) elemental alpha sulfur and 0.01-10% (w\/w) highly polar components.

The addition is desirably made over 3-5 minutes and an effort should be made to keep the powder from forming lumps. Dissolve 7.090 kg of NaHS.xHO in 15 L of distilled water contained in the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel fitted with the low-torque stirrer. Filter the NaHS solution through 3 pieces of Whatman #1 filter paper under reduced pressure using a Kitasato-Buchner assembly. Collect the filtrates in a 19 L vessel. It should be noted that only a very small amount of impurities is usually retained on the filter papers.","Next, rinse the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel and transfer the filtered NaHS solution from the 19 L vessel to the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel. Add 30 L of distilled water to the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel that contains the filtered NaHS solution. Pour 1.458 kg of concentrated sulfuric acid (98%) into a stirred mixture of 2.25 kg ice and 2.25 kg distilled water contained in a 10 L vessel. The next two steps should take place simultaneously and should last 40 minutes. Pour, at once, 600 ml of NaSOsolution into the auxiliary reaction vessel, which contains the stirred NaHS solution, and start adding (from an addition funnel) the dilute sulfuric acid solution (5.958 kg) into the same vessel with good stirring. Stirring should create a vortex that goes all the way down to the propeller. Wearing a full-face mask (fitted with an acid-absorbing cartridge), add 2.5 kg of ice to the main reaction vessel containing the NaSOsolution. Start pouring concentrated sulfuric acid (4.95 kg) in small portions and under brisk stirring. Alternate acid additions with ice additions so as to prevent the solution from heating up. Measure the temperature of the solutions in both reaction vessels. The temperature of the solution in the 200 L main reaction vessel (NaSOplus HSO) should be about 0\u00b0 C. and the solution in the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel (NaHS plus a bit of NaSOplus HSO) should be between 30-35\u00b0 C. Charge 5 kg ice into the 200 L reaction vessel (NaSOplus HSO) and then run into it the solution contained in the 80 L auxiliary reaction vessel (NaHS plus a bit of NaSOplus HSO) under brisk stifling (24.5-25 on speed scale shown in display). This operation should take about 10 minutes and stifling should create a vortex that goes all the way down to the propeller. Upon mixing the 2 solutions, the reaction mixture should go from colorless to canary yellow, fluidity increases, there is some frothing, and a yellowish precipitate separates. Measure the final temperature of the reaction mixture as well as its pH. The temperature should be between 25-30\u00b0 C. and the pH should be close to 3. Continue stirring briskly for 90 minutes. Stirring should create a vortex that goes all the way down to the propeller.","Allow the reaction mixture to stand undisturbed during 24 hours at room temperature. At the end of this stage the yellowish precipitate should lie at the bottom of the vessel in the form of a relatively compact mass. Without perturbing the precipitate, transfer as much as possible of the liquid phase to a different vessel by decantation or siphoning. Transfer the material remaining in the reaction vessel (about 20 L) to a 40 L plastic or glass container and stir during 1 hour to obtain a homogeneous slurry. Filter the slurry through a #1 Whatman filter paper using a Buchner-Kitasato assembly. Wash the filter cake with 1 L of distilled water or until the filtrate shows no acidity. Washing should be done before the filter cake develops cracks in order to prevent channeling. Immediately after washing keep applying vacuum during 10 more minutes. Over-drying will lead to a highly compact filter cake and will bring about great difficulties in subsequent steps. Use of a rubber or plastic filter dam (or similar device) is recommended. Transfer the relatively dry filter cake to a 10 L plastic container and add 7 L of pure anhydrous ethanol. Stir until all the solid is suspended and keep stifling 1 hour. If the suspension is too thick add more anhydrous ethanol. Filter the suspension through a #1 Whatman filter paper, wash the filter cake with 200 ml of anhydrous ethanol, place the rubber dam on top and keep applying vacuum for no longer than 10 minutes. Over-drying will lead to a highly compact filter cake and will bring about great difficulties in subsequent steps. Transfer the filter cake to large glass or stainless steel trays for room-temperature air drying. Allow to dry for about 4 days or until constant weight and absence of ethanol odor. The dry product is a material that consists of easily friable lumps and an impalpable powder. Disaggregate the lumps and sift to make sure that the material goes through a 325 standard sieve.","Procedure I yields a product (SG-1002) containing about 99% zerovalent sulfur and about 1% highly polar components (e.g., sodium sulfate and traces of sodium polythionates and sodium thio sulfate).","In some embodiments, variations of Procedure I may be used to obtain similar materials. Such procedures include but are not limited to the following:","Procedure II","Use sodium sulfide instead of sodium hydrogen sulfide and adjust the amounts of reactants according to rules well known to those skilled in the art, such as increasing the amount of acid, following the process detailed in Procedure I.","Procedure III","Use sodium sulfite instead of sodium metabisulfite and adjust the amount of reactants according to rules well known to those skilled in the art, following the process detailed in Procedure I.","Procedure IV","Use sodium sulfide instead of sodium hydrogen sulfide and sodium sulfite instead of sodium metabisulfite and adjust the amount of reactants according to rules well known to those skilled in the art, following the process detailed in Procedure I.","Procedure V","Use concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated sulfuric acid with mole-per-mole replacement and following the process detailed in Procedure I.","Procedure VI","Use concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated sulfuric acid with mole-per-mole replacement and following the process detailed in Procedure II.","Procedure VII","Use concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated sulfuric acid with mole-per-mole replacement and following the process detailed in Procedure III.","Procedure VIII","Use concentrated hydrochloric acid instead of concentrated sulfuric acid with mole-per-mole replacement and following the process detailed in Procedure IV.","Procedure IX","Use potassium salts instead of sodium salts and adjust the amount of reagents according to rules well known to those skilled in the art, and following the process detailed in Procedure I.","In some embodiments, the reactants used in the procedure can include any compound comprising sulfur in the minus two oxidation state and another compound comprising sulfur in the plus four oxidation state, and optionally an acid and\/or catalyst(s).","In other embodiments, vacuum-aided filtration may be replaced by pressure-aided filtration and\/or centrifugation. In other embodiments, closed reactors may be used, a heat-exchange cooling system may be substituted for ice addition, spray drying may substitute air drying, and one and\/or more steps (e.g., washing with alcohol) may be omitted. It should be understood that embodiments involving a larger or smaller scale of operation are also within the scope of the present invention.","Characterization of Highly Bioavailable Zerovalent-Sulfur-Rich Compositions","The standard yield of dry, sifted product is 2.7 kg of an impalpable, odorless, fluffy, light yellow, microcrystalline powder with the following properties:\n\n","The composition obtained by adhering to Procedure I consists of microcrystals rich in zerovalent sulfur; its solubility in carbon disulfide is lower than that of alpha-sulfur (rhombic sulfur) and contains measurable amounts of sodium and oxygen. X-ray diffraction patterns of the composition are consistent with that of alpha sulfur.","The methods used to obtain the data described herein include the following. The solubility of the composition in carbon disulfide was obtained by adding 6 mL of carbon disulfide to 0.500 g of the final product and determining the weight of the residue. Zerovalent sulfur content was measured by sulfitolysis not correcting for the fact that sulfitolysis converts all sulfur atoms in Sinto thiosulfate but only (n\u22121) sulfur atoms in NaOS\u2014SSONa. Sodium content was determined by Galbraith Laboratories, USA (GLI procedure ME-70). Particle size distribution was measured using a Partica LA-950 laser diffraction particle size analyzer from Horiba Instruments.","Without being limited by any hypothesis, it is likely that the high bioavailability of the above material is associated with the hydrophilic nature of the crystal surfaces, which in turn may be related to the presence of highly polar groups such as SONa and\/or \u2550SONa. These groups might be those present in polythionate molecules (NaOS\u2014S\u2014SONa, e.g., where n=1, 2, or 3), thiosulfates, or sulfates. Highly polar groups such as SONa may be associated with molecules of water of hydration and may, under some circumstances, undergo cationic exchange, yielding, e.g., SOH groups. Further, the hydrophilicity of the surface of this unique microcrystalline material is in stark contrast with the hydrophobic nature of the surface of crystals of pure alpha- or beta-elemental sulfur. Pure alpha- or beta-elemental sulfur in contrast, is completely soluble in carbon disulfide. Also without being limited by any hypothesis or theory, it is likely that the low bioavailability of ordinary alpha sulfur is directly related to the hydrophobic nature of its surface.","In some embodiments, the composition can be micro- or nanosized, comprising particles rich in alpha sulfur but always modified so as to possess hydrophilic surfaces. Similar compositions also within the scope of the present invention can be obtained by any chemical, electrochemical, mechanochemical, sonochemical, photochemical, microwave-assisted, biochemical and\/or biotechnological processes known in the art. Compositions comprising elemental beta sulfur and surface modifying polar groups further constitute embodiments of the present invention. As established, elemental alpha sulfur is converted into beta sulfur when heated and vice versa.","Determination of Zerovalent Sulfur Content in the Highly Bioavailable Zerovalent Sulfur-Rich Compositions","In one aspect, the zerovalent sulfur content of the composition of the invention can be determined using the method described herein to measure the percentage (w\/w) of zerovalent sulfur in alpha sulfur, sodium thiosulfate, and sodium polythionates. The sulfitolysis method for determining zerovalent sulfur content described herein does not correct for the fact that sulfitolysis of polythionate molecules stops at the trithionate as shown in equation (ii), therefore, one of the zerovalent sulfur atoms present in each polythionate molecule escapes sulfitolysis and is not converted into thiosulfate (equation (ii)). However, since the sodium content of the composition disclosed herein is small, the error introduced in the calculation of % zerovalent sulfur is correspondingly small. A detailed analysis of sulfitolysis is described in Koh et al., 6:3-14, 1990.","The sulfitolysis reactions equation (i) and (ii) proceed as in the volumetric method for quantitative determination of elemental sulfur in aromatic hydrocarbons reported by Morris et al., 20:1037-1039, 1948. The sulfitolysis method described herein is improved compared to the method of Morris et al. in several ways, including the use of n-hexadecyl pyridinium chloride as a sulfitolysis catalyst.\n\nS+8SO\u21928SO\u2003\u2003Equation (i)\n\nOS\u2014SSO+(1)SO\u2192(1)SO+OS\u2014S\u2014SO\u2003\u2003Equation (ii)\n","The reagent solutions and methods of preparation of the solutions are shown in Table 6.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0107"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00006","num":"00006"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 6"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Reagent Solution","Preparation of Solution"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Sodium sulfite (15% w\/w)","Weigh 150 grams of anhydrous chemically"]},{"entry":["aqueous solution","pure sodium sulfite and dissolved in"]},{"entry":[{},"850 mL distilled water."]},{"entry":["Formaldehyde aqueous","\u2014"]},{"entry":["solution (37%)",{}]},{"entry":["6N HCl","Measure 250 mL of concentrated hydro-"]},{"entry":[{},"chloric acid (approximately 12N) and"]},{"entry":[{},"dilute to 500 mL with distilled water."]},{"entry":["KI (10% w\/w in water)","Weigh 50 grams chemically pure KI and"]},{"entry":[{},"dissolve in 450 mL distilled water."]},{"entry":["0.200N KIO","Weigh 7.134 grams of high purity"]},{"entry":[{},"anhydrous KIOdissolve in 100 mL"]},{"entry":[{},"distilled water and dilute to 1 L"]},{"entry":[{},"with distilled water."]},{"entry":["Hexadecylpyridinium","Weigh 1 gram solid monohydrate and"]},{"entry":["chloride monohydrate","dissolve in 99 mL distilled water."]},{"entry":["(1% w\/w) solution in water",{}]},{"entry":["Soluble starch (5 g\/L,","Weigh 1 gram soluble starch, add 10 mg"]},{"entry":["aqueous solution)","red mercuric iodide, add cold water to"]},{"entry":[{},"form a paste, then add 200 mL boiling"]},{"entry":[{},"water and boil for 1 or 2 minutes while"]},{"entry":[{},"stirring.

Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include, but are not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, prion disorders, multiple system atrophy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyloidoses.","Other Pathological Conditions Associated with Oxidative Stress and\/or an Imbalance in Redox Homeostasis","Highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention may be useful in treating other conditions associated with oxidative stress including but not limited to autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, fragile X syndrome, sickle cell disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, osteoarthritis cataract, macular degeneration, toxic hepatitis, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, oxidative stress from dialysis, renal toxicity, kidney failure, ulcerative colitis, bacterial infection, viral infections, such as HIV and AIDS, herpes, ear infection, upper respiratory tract diseases, hypertension, balding and hair loss, over-training syndrome related to athletic performance, eczema, scleroderma, atopic dermatitis, polymyositis, and dermatitis herpetiformis.","In preferred embodiments, the compositions of the invention can be formulated for topical administration and\/or enteral administration to treat conditions such as psoriasis, athlete's foot, and\/or rosacea. In some embodiments, the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention may be useful in healing wounds by influencing the stages of wound healing including but not limited to hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling. In another embodiment, the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention also enhance athletic performance by increasing one or more of the factors of: endurance, energy, strength, visual acuity, and\/or coordination.","In another preferred embodiment, the compositions of the invention can be formulated for enteral administration to treat male infertility. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the etiology of sperm dysfunction via induction of peroxidative damage to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, oxidative stress affects the integrity of the sperm nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, leading to DNA strand breaks, aberrant recombination, and\/or defective packing, as well as chromatin cross-linking. The observation of correlations between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by washed human sperm suspensions and their fertilizing capacity is consistent with the clinical significance of oxidative damage to human spermatozoa; this significance is bolstered by the demonstration of loss of functional competence and high rates of DNA damage of human spermatozoa directly or indirectly exposed to hydrogen peroxide. When the source of ROS is intracellular, many of the classical antioxidants that are effective against extracellular oxidative stress (e.g., NAC and hypotaurine) prove useless.","The high susceptibility toward irreversible oxidative damage of mammalian sperm cells may be attributed to: (i) the particularly high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins of their membranes, (ii) the lack of adequate repair mechanisms for oxidative damage, derived from a dearth of cytosolic antioxidant enzymes associated with the loss of most of their cytoplasm upon spermiation, (iii) the fact that mature post-epididymal sperm cells possess highly condensed nuclear chromatin (due to the replacement of histones by protamine, with increased disulfide bond formation); this compactness contributes to silencing the paternal chromosomes, which are unable to engage in transcriptional activation by ROS, (iv) the fact that sperm cells are particularly rich in highly active mitochondria, because they need a constant supply of energy to support their motility. Spermatozoa were the first cells found to generate significant levels of ROS and these characteristics increase the probability of mitochondrial membrane damage by leaked ROS, (v) the fact that native cysteine-rich-secretory proteins (CRISPs) contain unusually high numbers of thiolic (unoxidized) cysteine residues, which renders them especially sensitive to inactivation by oxidants.","HS may be used by cells to synthesize L-cysteine, which can then serve as a building block in protein synthesis, as described in Predmore et al., 17:119-140, 2012. Sulfur-deficient diets, however, are common and may lead to cysteine deficiency-especially in males and consequently to deficits in the biosynthesis of important cysteine-rich proteins such as CRISPs. The CRISPs are found only in vertebrates, within the male reproductive tract. CRISPs have been implicated in many aspects of spermatogenesis, as well as in the actual process of fertilization as reported in Koppers et al., 13:111-117, 2011, and down-regulation of CRISP-2 mRNA by a factor of 4.3 in asthenospermic patients was recently reported in Jing et al., 17:203-207, 2011.","Srilatha et al., 4:1304-1311, 2007, have described some pioneering studies that provide evidence for the endogenous formation of hydrogen sulfide and its proerectile relaxant effect on the corpus cavernosum of mammals, as well as on the effects of hydrogen sulfide in female sexual function. The first set of results was corroborated by an international team that included Louis J. Ignarro who won the Nobel Prize in 1998 for his work on demonstrating the signaling properties of nitric oxide. There is also evidence that oxidative stress is implicated in erectile dysfunction in diabetic rodents as described in Bivalacqua et al., 2:187-197, 2005 and interventions based on administration of tetrahydrobiopterin and up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes may be useful as described in Deng et al., 610:213-227, 2010 and Minhas et al., 3:889-897, 2002. Moreover, recent work discusses the effects of endogenous and exogenous HS on the physiological control of penile tone and the possibility of developing new therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) that target this pathway.","Sparatore et al., 4:109-121, 2011 developed an HS-donating derivative of sildenafil (ACS6) with possible clinical indications in ED, benign prostatic hypertrophy and low urinary tract symptoms. The HS released by ACS6 inhibits both phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) expression activity, hence this mechanism may constitute the basis of a new and effective approach to the treatment of patients suffering from ED, benign prostatic hypertrophy and lower urinary tract symptoms. In fact, studies performed by Shukla et al., 103:1522-1529, 2009 showed that ACS6 and sildenafil citrate relaxed cavernosal smooth muscle equipotently and ACS6 inhibited superoxide formation and expression of p47(a subunit of NOX) more than sildenafil citrate. It was concluded that ACS6 not only promotes erection, but also affords effective protection from oxidative stress through up-regulation of glutathione (GSH) synthesis.","Furthermore, in an investigation of the effect of NaHS on pregnant rat uterine contractility in vitro, Sidhu et al., 88:198-203, 2001 found that this \u201chydrogen donor\u201d produced significant dose-dependent decreases in uterine spontaneous contractility.","Showell et al., 1:CD007411, 2011 assessed the effects of oral antioxidants on men with documented sperm DNA damage and\/or with impaired semen parameters on the basis of clinical trials wherein the participants were randomly assigned to antioxidant versus placebo, an alternative antioxidant, or no treatment. The outcomes considered were: 1) life birth rate per couple randomized, 2) pregnancy rate per couple, 3) miscarriage rate per couple, or spontaneous abortion, 4) stillbirth rate per couple, 5) level of sperm DNA damage after treatment, 6) sperm concentration, 7) sperm motility, and 7) adverse effects. The 44 trials analyzed in this review involved 2876 couples, carried out over an average duration of treatment of 4.1 months, and included the following antioxidants: vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, magnesium, zinc, zinc plus vitamin E, zinc plus vitamin E plus vitamin C, combined antioxidants plus minerals (e.g., vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, folic acid, lycopene, and garlic oil), L-acetylcarnitine, L-carnitine, L-acetyl carnitine plus L-carnitine, pentoxifylline, ethyl cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, and docosahexenoic acid. The study concluded that antioxidant supplementation in sub-fertile males may improve the outcomes of live birth and pregnancy rate for sub-fertile couples undergoing treatment (ART cycles). Further head-to-head comparisons are necessary to identify the superiority of one antioxidant over another. These results indicate that there is currently only limited scientifically acceptable evidence that antioxidant supplementation improves outcomes for sub-fertile couples or the available forms of treatment have mostly produced only marginally satisfactory responses, even in the best of proper trials and that many drugs are being used without any rationale. According to Cavallini et al, 8:143-157, 2006, no drug can be defined as unquestionably effective for the treatment of male idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","The highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition of the invention was used in a clinical trial conducted by Mexican researchers (see Example 8) and the results were highly encouraging for several reasons including: a treatment duration of only 2.5 months versus an average of 4.1 months for all trials described in Showell et al., 1:CD007411, 2011, and a single-component formulation instead of an un-optimized miscellaneous mixture of 7-10 or more presumably active ingredients.","Oxidative stress is associated with an increase in the production of oxidizing species (e.g., superoxide, peroxides, free radicals) and\/or a significant decrease in effectiveness and\/or levels of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione. The highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention when administered will desirably act to restore the cysteine and glutathione levels thus restoring the redox homeostasis in the body.","Diabetes","Compositions of the invention may also be useful for treating diabetes and its complications. Diabetes can be any metabolic disease in which a person has high blood sugar, either because the body does not produce enough insulin, or because cells do not respond to the insulin that is produced. Non-limiting examples of diabetes includes, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, congenital diabetes, cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, steroid diabetes, latent autoimmune diabetes of adults, and monogenic diabetes. Complications associated with diabetes include but are not limited to hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, nonketotic hyperosmolar coma, cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetes-related foot problems (e.g., diabetic foot ulcers), and diabetic retinopathy.","Cancers","Other conditions that may be treated using highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention include cancers. Cancers are generally characterized by unregulated cell growth, formation of malignant tumors, and invasion to nearby parts of the body. Cancers may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Cancers may be a result of gene damage due to tobacco use, certain infections, radiation, lack of physical activity, obesity, and\/or environmental pollutants. Cancers may also be a result of existing genetic faults within cells to cause diseases due to genetic heredity. Screenings may be used to detect cancers before any noticeable symptoms appear and treatment may be given to those who are at higher risks of developing cancers (e.g., people with a family history of cancers). Examples of screening techniques for cancer include but are not limited to physical examination, blood or urine tests, medical imaging, and\/or genetic testing. Non-limiting examples of cancers include: bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney or renal cell cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, wasting disease, and thyroid cancer.","Transplants","The zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition of the invention are expected to be effective in treating ischemia-reperfusion injury from reconstructive and transplantation procedures. Water dispersions of fine particles of the zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition can be used to treat flaps of tissue from plastic or reconstructive surgery and solid organs from transplants in order to prevent\/minimize ischemia-reperfusion injury and to protect the mitochondria during the operative procedures. Exemplary tissues and organs to be treated using the composition of the invention have active metabolism and increased mitochondrial function and are susceptible to reperfusion injury after brief periods of ischemia and include but are not limited to; skeletal muscle, the heart, the liver, large intestine, small intestine, the brain, the skin, the limbs (e.g., arms, legs, feet, hands).","Pharmaceutical Compositions and Treatment Methods","The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions that contain the highly bioavailable zerovalent sulfur-rich compositions or a combination of one of the highly bioavailable zerovalent sulfur-rich compositions described herein and a second therapeutic agent (e.g., an antiplatelet drug, a \u03b2 blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB), a statin, fibrates, biguanides, blood pressure lowering agents, cytokines, cholesterol lowering agents, erectile dysfunction drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-thrombosis drugs, anticancer drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, and\/or dietary supplements).","A composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and\/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for parenteral, intranasal, topical, oral, or local administration, such as by a transdermal means, for prophylactic and\/or therapeutic treatment. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered parenterally (e.g., by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection), or by oral ingestion, or by topical application or intraarticular injection at areas affected by the vascular or cancer condition. Additional routes of administration include intravascular, intra-arterial, intratumor, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, intraepidural, as well as nasal, ophthalmic, intrascleral, intraorbital, rectal, topical, or aerosol inhalation administration. Sustained release administration is also specifically included in the invention, by such means as depot injections or erodible implants or components. Thus, the invention provides compositions for parenteral administration that comprise the above mentioned agents dissolved, colloidally dispersed, or suspended in an acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier, e.g., water, buffered water, saline, PBS, and the like. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, wetting agents, detergents and the like.","The therapeutic composition may be in the form of a solution, colloidal dispersion, a suspension, an emulsion, an infusion device, or a delivery device for implantation or it may be presented as a dry powder to be used as such or to be reconstituted with water or another suitable vehicle before use. The composition can be in the form of a tablet, capsule (e.g., hard gelatin capsule and soft gelatin capsule), liquid, or sustained release tablet for oral administration; or a liquid for intravenous, intrathecal, subcutaneous or parenteral administration; or a cream or ointment for topical administration, or a polymer or other sustained release vehicle for local administration.","Methods well known in the art for making formulations are found, for example, in \u201cRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\u201d (20th ed., ed. A. R. Gennaro A R., 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa.). Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, sterile water, saline, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated napthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide\/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers may be used to control the release of the substances. Nanoparticulate formulations (e.g., biodegradable nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes) may be used to control the biodistribution of the substances. Other potentially useful delivery systems include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, intrathecal pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. The concentration of the substance in the formulation varies depending upon a number of factors, including the dosage of the drug to be administered, and the route of administration.","To administer a composition of the invention by certain routes of administration, it may be necessary to coat the composition with, or co-administer the composition with a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the composition may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et al., 7:27-41, 1984). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable colloidal solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art and is included in the invention except where any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active substance. Supplementary active substances can also be incorporated into the compositions.","Therapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a suspension, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline\u00ae), polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, formulated at different percentages (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50% by weight in a dispersion medium described herein). The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin. Colloidal dispersions may be stabilized through addition of agents well known in the art.","The compositions of the invention may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous dispersions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably between 5 and 9 or between 6 and 8, and most preferably between 7 and 8, such as 7 to 7.5. The resulting compositions in solid or semisolid form may be packaged in multiple single dose units, each containing a fixed amount of the composition, such as in a sealed package of tablets or capsules. The composition in solid form can also be packaged in a container for a flexible quantity, such as in a squeezable tube designed for a topically applicable cream or ointment.","Preferred formulations of the invention include but are not limited to: preparation of hard gelatin capsules containing 100-400 mg of a highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition of the invention, preparation of a suspension of about 5-20% (5.5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 8%, 10%, 15%, 17%, or 19%) of highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition of the invention and petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline\u00ae) or polyethylene glycol, or a colloidal dispersion of about 5-20% (5.5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 8%, 10%, 15%, 17%, or 19%) of highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition of the invention in water or oil.","Sterile injectable colloidal suspensions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, optionally followed by sterilization microfiltration. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic or prophylactic situation. For example, the compositions of the invention may be administered once or twice weekly by subcutaneous injection or once or twice monthly by subcutaneous injection.","It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subjects to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, optionally in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specifications for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active substance and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active substance for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.","When the substances of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given alone or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 1 to 100% (more preferably, 10 to 100%, such as 90 to 100%) of active ingredient, optionally in combination with one more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.","The compositions containing an effective amount can be administered for prophylactic or therapeutic treatments. In prophylactic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient with a clinically determined predisposition or increased susceptibility to development of cardiovascular diseases, hyperproliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), inflammatory diseases, diabetes, dyslipidemia, neurodegenerative diseases, AIDS, and other pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress, an imbalance in redox homeostasis, and\/or immune dysfunction. Compositions of the invention can be administered to the patient (e.g., a human) in an amount sufficient to delay, reduce, or preferably prevent the onset of the clinical disease. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient (e.g., a human) already suffering from a cardiovascular disease, hyperproliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), an inflammatory disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, a neurodegenerative disease, AIDS, and other pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress, an imbalance in redox homeostasis, and\/or immune dysfunction, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the condition and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this purpose is defined as a \u201ctherapeutically effective dose,\u201d an amount of a compound sufficient to substantially improve some symptom associated with a disease or a medical condition. For example, in the treatment of a cardiovascular disease, hyperproliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), an inflammatory disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, a neurodegenerative disease, AIDS, and other pathological conditions associated with oxidative stress, an imbalance in redox homeostasis, and\/or immune dysfunction, an agent or substance which decreases, prevents, delays, suppresses, or arrests any symptom of the disease or condition would be therapeutically effective. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent or substance is not required to cure a disease or condition but will provide a treatment for a disease or condition such that the onset of the disease or condition is delayed, hindered, or prevented, or the disease or condition symptoms are ameliorated, or the term of the disease or condition is changed or, for example, is less severe or recovery is accelerated in an individual.","The compositions and formulations of the present invention may be used in combination with either conventional methods of treatment or therapy or may be used separately from conventional methods of treatment or therapy. When the substances and formulations of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to an individual. Alternatively, pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention include a combination of a substance or formulation of the present invention optionally in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, as described herein, and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent known in the art.","The formulated agents can be packaged together as a kit. Non-limiting examples include kits that contain, e.g., two pills, a pill and a powder, a suppository and a liquid in a vial, two topical creams, etc. The kit can include optional components that aid in the administration of the unit dose to patients, such as vials for reconstituting powder forms, syringes for injection, customized IV delivery systems, inhalers, etc. Additionally, the unit dose kit can contain instructions for preparation and administration of the compositions. The kit may be manufactured as a single use unit dose for one patient, multiple uses for a particular patient (at a constant dose or in which the individual compounds may vary in potency as therapy progresses); or the kit may contain multiple doses suitable for administration to multiple patients (\u201cbulk packaging\u201d). The kit components may be assembled in cartons, blister packs, bottles, tubes, and the like.","Dosage","The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions of the present invention employed, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of absorption of the particular agent being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, substances, and\/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian can start doses of the substances of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a composition of the invention will be that amount of the substance which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Preferably, the effective daily dose of a therapeutic composition may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms.","Preferred therapeutic dosage levels are between about 800 mg to about 1600 mg (e.g., 800, 850, 900, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1450, 1500, 1550, and 1600 mg) of active zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition per day administered orally to adults of average weight afflicted with most of the symptoms, syndromes and pathological conditions described herein, Preferred prophylactic dosage levels are between about 100 mg to about 1200 mg (e.g., 110, 140, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 460, 700, 750, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, and 1150 mg). In cancer, AIDS, and some chronic or refractory pathologies, the preferred oral dosage levels are 2400 mg per day or higher (e.g., 2450, 2500, 3000, 3500, 4000, 8000 mg, 1 g) for an adult of average weight. For children afflicted with cancer, the dose may be titrated (e.g., the dose may be escalated gradually until signs of gastrointestinal toxicity appear, such as diarrhea or nausea). In preferred embodiments, the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention are extremely safe for oral administration and most patients can tolerate higher dosages as treatment progresses.","In other embodiments, the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention are safe for topical administration. Acceptable dosage forms for topical administration can be formulated as creams, lotions, pastes, gels, and\/or ointments containing the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions.","Final dosage forms suitable for administration to human subjects may comprise one of the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions as pharmacologically-active agent or further comprise other active agents such as alpha-lipoic acid, carnitine, carnitine tartrate, carnitine fumarate, coenzyme Q10, selenium, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, potassium alpha-ketoglutarate, diethyl alpha-ketoglutarate, oxaloacetic acid, sodium oxaloacetate, diethyl oxaloacetate, 2-oxo-3-(ethoxycarbonyl)-pentanodioc acid diethyl ester, L-cystine, paracetamol, a sulfa drug, an NSAID, a corticosteroid, taurine, a vitamin, a prebiotic, another anticancer drug, including but not limited to another mitocan (e.g., a drug targeting the mitochondrial electron transport chain), alkylating agents (e.g. procarbazine, dacarbazine, altretamine, cisplatin), methotrexate, purine antagonists (e.g., mercaptopurine, thioguanine, cladribine, pentostatin), pyrimidine antagonists (e.g., fluorouracil, cytarabine, azacitidine), plant alkaloids (e.g., vinblastine, etoposide, topotecan), hormonal agents (e.g., tamoxifen, flutamide), antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitomycin, bleomycin), and mitocans (e.g., sodium dichloroacetate and 3-bromopyruvic acid).","Medical Food","The present invention also relates to highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions as medical food for daily intake and for maintaining and promoting general health. Evidence indicates that daily ingestion by an adult of average weight of about 800 mg of the highly bioavailable zerovalent sulfur-rich composition described herein during extended periods is safe and beneficial to health because it brings about a marked reduction in the frequency and severity of digestive and respiratory infections (e.g., of viral and bacterial origin) and allergic episodes. Daily intake of the composition of the invention is also associated with a greatly reduced probability of being afflicted by cancer, AIDS, a neurodegenerative condition, stroke, diabetes and its complications, cardiovascular disease, and confers protection from cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, gastric, and hepatic damage caused by xenobiotics including, drugs such as paracetamol, corticosteroids, NSAIDs and antiretrovirals, toxins and poisons (e.g., cyanide, thallium, methanol). Daily intake of the composition of the invention can also result in faster growth of hair and nails, firmer skin, a prebiotic-like effect, and a sense of general wellness.","In one aspect, highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions of the invention are used as a paravitamin to provide a supplemental source of cysteine and its derivatives. Cysteine and its derivatives (e.g., glutathione, taurine, taurine conjugates with bile acids, hydrogen sulfide, and sulfate ions) play a role similar to that of vitamins. Like antioxidative vitamins, cysteine and its derivatives play a role in the oxidant\/antioxidant balance and indirectly in the regulation of metabolic processes. Cysteine supplementation on top of the normal diet can have various beneficial effects, for example, cysteine supplementation can lead to an increase in muscle function, immune function, plasma albumin concentration and a decrease in TNF-\u03b1 concentration. Supplementation can also restore the body's reservoirs of cysteine and glutathione levels which are driving forces behind multiple ageing-related processes.","In another aspect, the paravitamins are medical foods providing a minimum amount of calories and maximum amount of a bioavailable form of sulfur intended for humans not receiving enough sulfur in their diets. Studies from a preliminary clinical trial showed that in 120 men and women participants given the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition as a paravitamin, most participants noticed faster growth of hair and nails. Furthermore, evidence obtained from in vivo experiments showed that in mammals, hydrogen sulfide, sulfane sulfur, and glutathione levels are increased in blood and tissues upon administration of the highly-bioavailable sulfur-rich compositions as paravitamins.","In preferred embodiments, the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition is rapidly and efficiently converted into hydrogen sulfide in the body, which in turn is largely transformed into L-cysteine. L-cysteine may be used as a building block in the synthesis of peptides enzymes, and other proteins and small sulfur-containing biomolecules (e.g., keratin which constitutes 14% of hair and nails, e.g., glutathione, a tripeptide needed for regulating and potentiating immune function and for cellular protection from oxidants, electrophiles, e.g., taurine, which is essential for cardiovascular function, development, and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, the central nervous system, it is a major constituent of bile; has many fundamental biological roles such as conjugation of bile acids, antioxidant, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, and modulation of calcium signaling, e.g., sulfate, which is necessary for the synthesis of cartilage and for detoxification of many drugs including but not limited to corticosteroids and acetaminophen).","In another embodiment, the zerovalent sulfur-rich composition is transformed and stored as sulfane sulfur. Sulfane sulfur is conveniently used by the body as highly versatile precursor of hydrogen sulfide which readily releases hydrogen sulfide whenever and wherever this species is needed to activate protective genes, block inflammation, and protect cells from free-radical damage.","In yet another preferred embodiment, the maximum human life span may be increased beyond the previous limit by providing compositions of the invention as paravitamins, glutathione levels will be restored to a normal level in the cells of the immune system thereby normalizing the function of the immune system and restoring health and well-being.","Antidotes","The present invention also relates to highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich compositions as antidotes for various poisons and drug overdose.

These examples are set forth merely for illustrative purposes and many other variations may be used.","Experimental Methods","Human Blood Samples from Heart Failure Patients","Serum samples were obtained from a cardiac tissue and blood biorepository at the University of Louisville. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Louisville. The samples procured after informed consent from patients with advanced heart failure undergoing LV assist device placement. Additional serum samples from control patients were obtained from a commercial vendor (Innovative Research).","Experimental Animals","CSE deficient (KO) mice (C57\/Sv129 background) and cardiac restricted (\u03b1MHC) CSE Tg mice (C57BL\/6J background) were developed as described in Levy et al., 322:1561-1566, 1990; Heineke et al., 7:589-600, 2006. Male C57BL\/6J mice 8-10 weeks of age were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). All experimental protocols were approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University School of Medicine and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1996), and with federal and state regulations.","Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) Protocol","To create pressure overload, the TAC procedure was performed in 10-14 week old mice. Mice were anesthetized with Ketamine (100 mg\/kg) and Xylazine (8 mg\/kg) and the core body temperature was maintained in normal range (36-37\u00b0 C.). Mice were then orally intubated and placed on a rodent ventilator to maintain respiration during the surgical procedure. The second intercostal muscle was incised to visualize the aortic arch. Following identification and dissection of the aortic arch, 7-0 silk suture was placed around the aortic arch between the brachiocephalic trunk and the left carotid artery and ligated around a 27 G blunt needle. The needle was immediately removed after ligation. The chest was surgically closed and mice were put in a recovery chamber with 100% oxygen along with a surgical warming pad to maintain core body temperature within normal limits. At the end of the experimental protocol (i.e., 6 or 12 weeks following TAC surgery) mice were euthanized and heart, lung and blood samples were collected.","Hydrogen Sulfide Donor","A zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition (SG-1002, containing about 99% zerovalent sulfur, melting between 119 and 120\u00b0 C.) was administered in the diet to mice to achieve dosages of 20 mg\/kg\/day in C57BL\/6J mice or 40 mg\/kg\/day in CSE KO mice at one week prior to TAC procedure and was continued up to 12 weeks following TAC. In addition, some C57BL\/6J mice receiving SG-1002 diet were placed on the control diet at 1 week or 3 weeks following TAC.","Echocardiography","At 2 days prior to TAC procedure, baseline transthoracic echocardiogram was performed using 30-MHz probe on a Vevo 2100 (Visualsonics) under anesthesia with isoflurane (0.25 to 0.50%) supplemented with 100% O. Following TAC procedure, echocardiography was also performed in the same manner for up to 12 weeks. To determine cardiac structure and function, intraventricular septal end diastolic dimension (IVSd), LV end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), LV end systolic dimension (LVESD), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were analyzed from M-mode images.","Measurement of Hydrogen Sulfide and Sulfane Sulfur","Hydrogen sulfide and sulfane sulfur levels were measured in heart and blood according to methods known in the art. For heart tissue, the amount of HS is reported as nmol\/mg wet weight. For the blood, the amount of HS is reported as \u03bcm.","Western Blot Analysis","Western blot analysis was performed as described in Li et al., 51:169-187, 2011. Equal amounts of protein were loaded into lanes of polyacrylamide-SDS gels. The gels were electrophoresed, followed by transfer of the protein to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked and probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0 C. Immunoblots were next processed with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-chicken, or anti-mouse, Cell Signaling) for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoblots were then probed with an ECL+Plus chemiluminescence reagent kit (GE Healthcare) to visualize signal, followed by exposure to X-ray film (Denville Scientific). The film was scanned to make a digital copy and densitometric analysis was performed to calculate relative intensity with ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health (version 1.40 g) using the Rodbard function. The membranes were incubated with the phospho-specific antibody first. Membranes were then stripped and incubated with the total-specific antibody. Results are presented as the ratio of the expression of phosphorylated protein to total protein. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For each membrane the relative intensity of each band was normalized to the value of the weakest band (smallest intensity). The values for each individual sample were averaged to obtain one value for each sample. The values for each group were then averaged and subsequently normalized to the mean of the control group (Sham).","Myocardial Measurement of NO Metabolites","Nitrite (NO) and nitrate (NO) analysis of cardiac tissue was determined by ion chromatography (ENO20 Analyzer, Eicom) as previously described in Li et al., 51:169-187, 2011.","Serum Measurements of VEGF and BNP","Serum levels of VEGF (VEGF ELISA kit, R&D Systems) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (BNP EIA kit, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) were determined by ELISA at 6 and\/or 12 weeks following TAC.","Cardiac Mitochondrial Respiration Assay","The myocardial mitochondria were isolated and mitochondrial respiratory capacity was assessed using methods known in the art. Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and hearts were quickly excised and placed in ice-cold isolation buffer (300 mM sucrose, 20 mM Tris, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl, and 1% fat free BSA). Hearts were finely chopped and homogenized with a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Okla.) on low to medium speed for \u02dc10 s. Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at 2,500 rpm. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 9,000 rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 rpm and repeated two additional times. The final pellet was suspended in 100 \u03bcL isolation buffer. Protein concentration was determined by a Lowry protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). The Oconsumption of isolated mitochondria (500 \u03bcg\/mL) was monitored using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Hansatech Instruments, Amesbury, Mass.). Mitochondria were incubated in respiration buffer (100 mM KCl, 25 mM sucrose, 5 mM KHP0, 1 mM MgCl, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glutamate, and 2.5 mM malate), and the respiratory capacity was assessed by measuring state 3 (i.e., ADP-dependent) and state 4 (i.e., ADP-independent) respiration. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) was calculated as the ratio of state 3 and state 4 respiration rates.","8-Isoprostane Assay","Concentrations of 8-isoprostane in the plasma and heart were determined by 8-isoprostane EIA kit according to manufacture instruction (Cayman Chemicals, Michigan).","Histology","For histological analysis, hearts were collected at the indicated times, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5 \u03bcm heart sections from each group were stained with Masson's trichrome and Picrosirius Red (to detect fibrosis). Digital images of the slides were then captured and analyzed using ImageJ. For each heart, we analyzed multiple sections taken from the mid-ventricle and then averaged these numbers to obtain a single % fibrosis\/LV measurement for each animal.","Statistical Analysis","All data are expressed as mean\u00b1SEM. Statistical significance was evaluated using unpaired Student's t test for comparison between 2 means and ANOVA (1-way or 2-way) for comparison among 3 or more means using Prism 5 (Graph Pad Software Inc). For the ANOVA, if a significant result was found, the Tukey (1-way ANOVA) or Bonferroni (2-way ANOVA) test was used as the posthoc analysis. For all data, a value of p<0.05 denotes statistical significance.","Clinical Studies and Statistical Analysis","A prospective, randomized, double blind study evaluated and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Nuevo Le\u00f3n University Hospital (Monterrey, Mexico) with registration number BR09-001 was conducted. The study included patients who attended the Reproductive Biology Clinic of the University Hospital from July 2009 to September 2010 who desired to be pregnant and met the inclusion criteria. Patients between 20 and 45 years of age with a diagnosis of idiopathic oligoasthenozoospermia wishing to participate in the study after signing informed consent were included. The diagnosis of oligoasthenozoospermia was reached by performing two semen analyses on different dates with an interval of three weeks in between. To make the diagnosis, the results of the semen analyses needed to report less than 25% type A sperm motility or less than 50% type A+B sperm motility as detailed in the World Health Organization Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Semen-Cervical Mucus Interaction, 4ed. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999. Type A Motility comprised rapid progression; type B motility comprised medium progression; type C mobility comprised slow or clumsy progression; and type D mobility comprised immotile. Oligozoospermia was defined as a concentration of less than 20 million sperm per milliliter, according to the criteria of the World Health Organization. Oligoasthenozoospermia was defined as the presence of oligozoospermia and asthenozoospermia in the same patient. In each semen analysis, morphology was manually assessed using Kruger strict criteria.","Infertile patients with normal findings on semen analysis, patients who were chronic smokers or those who had been taking antioxidants in the last 6 months prior to study entry were excluded. Patients with chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes or high blood pressure or with hormonal abnormalities were also excluded. All study subjects who did not comply with medication given as prescribed, who discontinued the drug or were hypersensitive to it were eliminated.","A complete medical history and physical examination was obtained for all patients. All study participants underwent a second semen analysis to confirm the diagnosis after a sexual abstinence of 3 to 5 days. This semen analysis was considered baseline (sample 1). On a second visit this new semen analysis was reviewed to confirm oligoasthenozoospermia and one of the 3 substances to be taken was randomly prescribed for 75 days. The substances given were 1.5 g of hydrogen sulfide prodrug as an antioxidant, 50 mg of resveratrol as an antioxidant, and 1.5 g of microcrystalline cellulose as a placebo.","Randomization of the substance given to each patient was performed by placing in a drawer at random all the containers having exactly the same color, size, and shape with the three separate substances (hydrogen sulfide prodrug, resveratrol, and placebo) without any kind of reference as to the content. Each container had a label with a serial number. The attending physician and the patient were unaware of the contents of the container. A third researcher had a log and database for each label and the contents of the container. Each patient was asked to take a container at random and the container number was recorded in the patient's medical record. At the end of the study, before statistical analysis, we obtained the relationship between the numbers on the labels and the contents, grouping patients according to the substance. Each patient was given a treatment adherence form (a patient log) in order to count the days of medication and record adverse events, if these occurred, including the type and frequency.","The patients were scheduled one month after starting treatment (third visit) in order to document adverse effects and adherence to treatment. If the patient did not attend the event data were collected by phone.","In the next scheduled consultation (fourth visit), carried out 75 days after starting treatment; adherence was verified and adverse effects were reported. For this visit, the patients presented with 3 to 5 days of sexual abstinence for post-treatment semen analysis (sample 2). Sperm concentration and motility were evaluated, and carried out entirely with an automated IVOS (Integrated Visual Optical System) device and manually confirmed by lab technicians, who were blinded to the treatment group that each patient in. The morphology of each semen analysis was manually assessed, according to Kruger criteria.","Traditional descriptive data, such as measures of central tendency (means, median and mode) and in the case of quantitative variables, measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation and coefficient of variation) were studied for each variable, together with the frequencies observed in qualitative variables.","The study subjects were divided according to the group assigned and the statistical variables mentioned were analyzed. The results of each variable by group using hypothesis tests for means (x) and proportions, according to each type of variable (quantitative and qualitative, respectively) at a confidence interval of 95%, with a statistically significant p<0.05, were also compared and evaluated.","Previous studies suggest that both exogenous and endogenously derived HS exhibit potent cytoprotective effects in models of acute myocardial I\/R and ischemia-induced heart failure. However, the role of endogenous HS in pressure overload-induced heart failure has not been fully elucidated. In the current study, a number of novel findings regarding the role of CSE-derived HS on the severity of heart failure following TAC have been identified and important insights into the mechanism by which oral HS therapy attenuates TAC-induced heart failure are provided.","Circulating sulfide levels (free HS and sulfane sulfur) in 20 heart failure patients and 24 aged-matched controls were examined. The detailed description of these patients is given in Table 7. As shown by the representative gas chromatograph peaks and summarized data in , free HS levels were significantly lower in the heart failure patients as compared to the controls (p=0.049), whereas sulfane sulfur levels trended to be lower in the heart failure patients  and D; p=0.054). Next, the effects of TAC-induced heart failure on the myocardial expression of the three known HS-producing enzymes were examined, as well as the levels of circulating and myocardial sulfide levels at 6 weeks of TAC. The analysis revealed that the expression of CBS was unaltered (). However, CSE expression was upregulated in the vehicle mice compared to the sham (; p<0.001), whereas 3-MST expression was significantly downregulated compared to Sham levels (; p<0.01). Interestingly, free HS and sulfane sulfur levels were significantly lower in the blood (p<0.01) and heart (p<0.001) of TAC+Vehicle mice when compared to Sham-operated mice ().",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0177","num":"0186"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00007","num":"00007"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"14pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 7"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},{},"Control","Heart Failure"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Number","24","20"]},{"entry":[{},"Age (average years)","51 \u00b1 10","53 \u00b1 13"]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Gender",{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":[{},"Males (%)","16","(67%)","18","(90%)"]},{"entry":[{},"Females (%)","8","(33%)","2","(10%)"]},{"entry":[{},"NYHA Classification",{},{},{},{}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"5"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"right"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"III (%)","\u2014","5","(25%)"]},{"entry":[{},"IIIb (%)","\u2014","2","(10%)"]},{"entry":[{},"IV (%)","\u2014","13","(65%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"5","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"To investigate the role of endogenous HS in pressure overload, we performed TAC surgery in CSE KO mice and evaluated cardiac structure and function using echocardiography were performed. Initially, it was confirmed that CSE KO mice exhibited lower free HS and sulfane sulfur levels in the blood and heart compared to WT mice (; p<0.05). CSE KO mice exhibited significantly greater cardiac enlargement and pulmonary edema at 12 weeks following TAC compared to WT mice (). Both groups showed similar degrees of increased IVSd thickness from 1 week to 12 weeks following TAC (). However, CSE KO mice exhibited significant LV cavity dilatation, as seen by increases in both LVEDD and LVESD, and exhibited exacerbated cardiac dysfunction from 3 weeks to 12 weeks following TAC compared to WT mice (). Despite the increased cardiac structure and functional changes in the CSE KO mice, no difference in the mortality was observed after TAC when compared to the WT mice ().","Overexpression of CSE has been shown to increase HS production in the heart without alteration in CBS expression. In the present studies, no alteration in cardiac CBS expressions in CS-CSE Tg mice were observed, but CS-CSE Tg mice exhibited less 3-MST expression compared to WT mice (). It was examined whether overexpression of CSE specifically within the cardiac myocyte would attenuate cardiac hypertrophy and\/or dysfunction following TAC using CS-CSE Tg mice. CS-CSE Tg mice exhibited significantly less cardiac enlargement and pulmonary edema, as assessed by the ratio of heart and lung weights to tibia length (mg\/cm) when compared to WT controls (). Furthermore, echocardiography analysis revealed that while CS-CSE Tg mice exhibited no difference in IVSd thickness when compared to WT mice, they did exhibit less cardiac dilatation and dysfunction from 6 weeks to 12 weeks following TAC (). Again, no difference in mortality was observed between the two groups ().","Together, this data indicates that endogenous HS generated enzymatically by CSE plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiac function following pressure overload-induced hypertrophy independently of the regulation of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.","Next, the effects of administration of oral HS therapy on pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction () were examined in wild-type C57BL\/6J mice. For these experiments we administered SG-1002 (20 mg\/kg\/day) in the chow. Initial studies found that SG-1002 treatment partially restored free HS and significantly restored sulfane sulfur levels in the blood (; p<0.05 vs. TAC+Vehicle) and heart (; p<0.05 vs. TAC+Vehicle). Gross morphologic analysis at 12 weeks following TAC, revealed that hearts from vehicle mice enlarged to a greater extent compared to SG-1002 treated mice (). This was confirmed by heart weight\/tibia length ratios, which found that the hearts of both vehicle and SG-1002 treated mice, were significantly increased compared to Sham mice at 6 and 12 weeks following TAC (; p<0.001). However, SG-1002 treated mice showed significantly less of an increase compared to vehicle mice (; p<0.001). In addition, SG-1002 treated mice displayed significantly less pulmonary edema when compared to vehicle mice at both time points (). Moreover, circulating BNP levels as an indication of heart failure severity following TAC were evaluated. BNP levels increased significantly (p<0.01) in vehicle mice at 6 and 12 weeks compared to sham mice, but SG-1002 treatment significantly inhibited BNP (p<0.01 vs. TAC+Vehicle) levels following TAC (). Echocardiography analysis () revealed that SG-1002 treatment did not alter the increase in IVSd thickness following TAC (), but did prevent cardiac dilatation (; p<0.01 vs. TAC+Vehicle) and cardiac contractile dysfunction (; p<0.001 vs. TAC+Vehicle) from 6 weeks to 12 weeks following TAC. Histological analysis of Masson's Trichrome and Picrosirius Red stained sections at 12 weeks following TAC revealed extensive areas of intermuscular and perivascular fibrosis in hearts from TAC+Vehicle mice (; p<0.01 vs. sham). Although fibrosis was evident in the sections taken from TAC+SG-1002 heart, it was significantly less when compared to the TAC+Vehicle hearts (p<0.001 for Masson's Trichrome and p<0.01 for Picrosirius Red). Finally, SG-1002 treated mice exhibited a better, but not statistically significant improved survival rate compared to vehicle mice (80% vs. 61%, p=0.23) ().","Further analysis revealed that the administration of SG-1002 to CSE KO mice slightly, but not significantly, increased free HS levels in the blood and heart, whereas administration of SG-1002 did significantly increase sulfane sulfur levels in both the blood (p<0.001) and the heart (p<0.05) as compared to CSE KO mice fed a control diet (). The administration of SG-1002 also completely diminished LV cavity dilatation in CSE KO mice when compared to CSE KO mice fed a control diet (; p<0.05). Interestingly, SG-1002 treated CSE KO mice maintained cardiac ejection fraction following TAC as compared to not only control diet-fed CSE KO mice but also WT mice at 12 weeks following TAC (; p<0.001 vs. CSE KO+TAC and p<0.05 vs. WT+TAC). However, no difference in mortality was observed between the CSE KO groups ().","Together, the results up to this point indicate that endogenous HS bioavailability is markedly attenuated in heart failure following pressure overload even though CSE and CBS expression levels are maintained or upregulated. Moreover, augmentation of HS levels by genetic or pharmacological approaches prevents the transition from compensated to decompensated cardiac hypertrophy.","Experiments were then conducted to determine how withdrawal of SG-1002 from the chow would affect the development of cardiac dilatation and dysfunction after TAC. For these experiments, SG-1002 was administered in the chow for 1 week and then subjected different groups of mice to 6 weeks of TAC: (1) Mice received SG-1002 in the chow for 6 weeks following TAC, (2) Mice received SG-1002 in the chow for 1 week following TAC and then received normal chow for 5 weeks; (3) Mice received SG-1002 in the chow for 3 weeks following TAC and then received normal chow for 3 weeks. Echocardiography analysis revealed that all three groups of mice displayed similar degrees of increased IVSd thickness, as well as similar LVEDD diameters from 1 week to 6 weeks following TAC (). Withdrawal of SG-1002 after 1 week of TAC resulted in a larger increase in L VESD and a larger decrease in ejection fraction at 6 weeks of TAC when compared to the non-withdrawal group (; p<0.01 vs. SG-1002). Withdrawing SG-1002 at 3 weeks of TAC resulted in a non-significant increase in both of these parameters at 6 weeks of TAC when compared to the non-withdrawal group. These data indicate that the withdrawal of SG-1002 early following the onset of pressure-overload does not prevent the development of cardiac dilatation and dysfunction, suggesting that the benefits of SG-1002 are achieved when the diet is maintained throughout the follow-up period.","The serine\/threonine kinase Akt regulates cardiac growth, myocardial angiogenesis, and survival in cardiac myocytes. SG-1002 treatment was examined to see whether activation Akt phosphorylation was activated in the heart following TAC. Representative Western blots for Akt phosphorylation status in the heart at 6 weeks following TAC are shown in . SG-1002 treatment did not alter total Akt expression in the heart () but did significantly increase the expression of phosphorylated Akt at threonine residue 308 (Akt-P) (p<0.001) and serine residue 473 (Akt-P) when compared to vehicle mice (; p<0.001). Next, SG-1002 treatment was examined to determine if VEGF, a potent angiogenic and cytoprotective cytokine in the myocardium was upregulated. At 6 weeks following TAC, SG-1002 treated mice showed significantly greater VEGF protein expression levels in the heart (; p<0.01 vs. Sham and p<0.05 vs. TAC+Vehicle), but not in the systemic circulation ().","Nitric oxide (NO) generated from endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is known to promote vascular and myocardial cell cytoprotection during ischemic conditions. To investigate the potential involvement of eNOS in SG-1002 induced cardioprotection following TAC, the expression and the phosphorylation status of eNOS at serine residue 1177 (eNOS-P) were assessed by Western blot analysis in the hearts of Sham, vehicle, and SG-1002 treated mice.","There were no differences in total eNOS expression in the heart among all groups ( E-F). However, the eNOS activation site (eNOS\u2014P) exhibited significantly greater phosphorylation following SG-1002 when compared to Sham and TAC+Vehicle mice (; p<0.01). Furthermore, SG-1002 treatment increased cardiac NOx (nitrite and nitrate) levels, following TAC compared to Sham mice ( G-H; p<0.05), which is indicative of increased NO bioavailability following HS therapy. Myocardial expression of both nNOS and iNOS in mice subjected to TAC that received either vehicle or SG-1002 () was also investigated. nNOS expression in the both vehicle and SG-1002 treated mice trended to be higher than the Sham, but did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, iNOS expression in the TAC+Vehicle group was upregulated compared to the Sham group (p<0.01), but SG-1002 mice diminished this upregulation (p<0.01 vs. TAC+Vehicle).","Mitochondrial energetic failure is considered one of the central pathological mechanisms in heart failure resulting from cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, respiratory function of isolated mitochondria obtained from mouse hearts at 6 weeks following TAC was investigated. A significant decrease in State 3 respiration rates (; p<0.01) and RCR (; p<0.001) was observed in the TAC+Vehicle mice compared to the Sham mice. However, SG-1002 treatment preserved mitochondrial respiratory function when compared to TAC+Vehicle mice (p<0.05 for State 3 and p<0.01 for RCR). No difference in State 4 respiration was observed among any of the study groups ().","Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to impaired ATP production and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that can result in increased apoptosis. Therefore, 8-isoprostane levels were examined as a marker of antioxidant deficiency and oxidative stress in both the plasma and heart at 6 weeks following TAC. Both the TAC+Vehicle and TAC+SG-1002 treated mice exhibited higher plasma levels of 8-isoprostane compared to sham mice (; p<0.05). However, TAC+Vehicle mice exhibited significantly higher 8-isoprostane levels in the heart compared to sham mice (p<0.001), whereas the administration of SG-1002 attenuated the TAC-induced increase in 8-isoprostane levels (; p<0.05 vs. TAC+Vehicle). Next, cardiac Nox4 expression was assessed as another marker of oxidative stress. At 6 weeks following TAC, myocardial NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression was significantly upregulated in the TAC+Vehicle mice compared to Sham mice (; p<0.01). However, SG-1002 treatment significantly inhibited the upregulation of Nox4 (p<0.01 vs. TAC+Vehicle). Additional analysis revealed that SG-1002 treatment resulted in an upregulation in the expression of the antioxidant heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) in the heart following TAC (; p<0.01 vs. Sham and TAC+Vehicle).","The examples described in examples 1-7 provide several lines of evidence to support the idea that sulfide levels may be an important predictor of heart failure severity. First, in agreement with previous clinical studies, further evidence is provided showing that circulating levels of sulfide are lower in heart failure patients. Second, data is provided showing that this is mirrored in an experimental model of pressure overload-induced heart failure, as evidenced by the finding that both myocardial and circulating levels of free HS and sulfane sulfur are significantly reduced after TAC. Third, it is demonstrated that a deficiency in endogenously produced HS results in an exacerbation of cardiac dysfunction following TAC, whereas genetic overexpression of CSE significantly preserved left ventricular function. Finally, chronic administration of a nHS donor provides protection against the adverse remodeling associated with TAC by increasing circulating and cardiac sulfide levels. While the mechanisms responsible for the heart failure-induced decline in sulfide levels are currently not known, this finding strongly suggests that a deficiency of HS may contribute to the pathophysiology and progression of heart failure. These findings also suggest that increasing the bioavailability of HS with oral HS donor therapy significantly preserves cardiac function in the setting of heart failure.","One of the main findings of the current study is that administration of SG-1002 significantly preserved cardiac function following TAC. Given that HS is a physiological gas that freely diffuses into multiple intracellular compartments independently of specific receptors, it can be postulated that HS targets multiple pathological cascades simultaneously. One potential target is VEGF, which is among the most potent angiogenic and cytoprotective cytokines. Givvimani et al., 110:1093-1100, 2011 previously reported that sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS) in the drinking water augmented angiogenesis via increasing VEGF expression and inhibition of antiangiogenic factors (angiostatin and endostatin). Short-term Akt activation in inducible transgenic mice induces physiological hypertrophy with maintained vascular density, whereas deficiency in Akt results in exacerbated cardiac dysfunction due to lack of exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In this study, SG-1002 treatment was demonstrated to activate a VEGF-Akt-eNOS-NO signaling pathway at 6 weeks following the induction of TAC (a time point when cardiac hypertrophy and left ventricular dysfunction are significant).","An increase in oxidative stress and\/or a deficiency in the endogenous antioxidant reserve can also cause contractile dysfunction. The cardioprotective effects of HS against myocardial I\/R are mediated by antioxidant signaling. In addition, HS directly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. Therefore, endogenous HS may directly and\/or indirectly contribute to modulation of oxidative stress in the setting of pressure overload-induced hypertrophy. Here, it was demonstrated that HS attenuates the TAC-induced increase in oxidative stress, as evidenced by the finding that SG-1002 decreases cardiac 8-isoprostane levels. In terms of mechanism, it was determined that SG-1002 attenuates the TAC-induced upregulation of Nox4, a member of the NADPH oxidase family that is a major source of ROS-related cardiac dysfunction in the setting of pressure overload. It was also determined that SG-1002 upregulated the expression of HO-1 and preserved mitochondrial respiratory function. Since, mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction in the heart leads to metabolic remodeling, deficit cardiac energetics, and increased oxidative stress, the preserved mitochondrial respiratory function observed in the current study could be an additional mechanism to explain the inhibition of oxidative stress by HS following TAC.","It has been generally thought that HS and NO exert their biological effects via independent signaling pathways. Recent experimental evidence suggests that there is crosstalk between the HS and NO signaling pathways, which could provide synergistic and additional regulatory effects. For example, HS upregulates NO production in endothelial cells through the activation of eNOS in an Akt-dependent manner. Likewise, NO has been shown to enhance the production of HS from vascular tissue and more recently, Coletta et al., 109:9161-9166, 2012, demonstrated that NO and HS are mutually required for the control of vascular function. Therefore, another major finding of the current study is the evidence that exogenous HS therapy very potently activates eNOS and increases NO bioavailability within the myocardium. This is important for two reasons: (1) it further corroborates the evidence that there is crosstalk between the HS and NO systems and (2) provides evidence for the first time that HS increases the bioavailability of NO in an in vivo model of disease. Consequently the activation of eNOS by SG-1002 may serve as an important mechanism for the observed protective effects against TAC. In terms of its effects on hypertrophy, NO produced from eNOS has been shown to have antihypertrophic effects in the heart as evidenced by the findings that eNOS KO mice have hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy and exhibit exacerbated cardiac dysfunction due to pressure overload induced hypertrophy compared to WT mice. Moreover, cardiac specific overexpression of eNOS prevents isoproterenol induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, in sharp contrast, Takimoto et al., 115:1221-1231, 2011 suggested that pressure overload results in eNOS-uncoupling resulting in increased myocardial oxidant production and exacerbated cardiac function. In spite of this, physicians have been successfully using drugs which are able to activate eNOS, (i.e. ACE-1, ARB, and \u03b2-blockers) in the treatment of heart failure. Therefore, controversy still remains in regards to the utility and effectiveness of NO-based therapies in the treatment of heart failure, which warrants further investigation to resolve these issues. Additionally, both NO and HS are known to increase HO-1 levels, an enzyme that produces carbon monoxide (CO). This suggests that the activation of one of the endogenously produced gases can lead to the activation of the other two. Under these conditions, the three gases have the ability to synergize to produce antiapoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertrophic effects, which ultimately can lead to cardioprotection.","The findings of the current study indicate that preserving sulfide levels during the development of pressure overload-induced heart failure preserves cardiac function and prevents the transition from compensated to decompensated cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, the current study indicates that administration of a novel oral HS donor facilitates these protective effects by activating a VEGF-Akt-eNOS-NO signaling pathway significantly increasing NO bioavailability (). This cardioprotective signaling cascade ultimately results in the inhibition of oxidative stress, attenuated cardiac fibrosis, preservation of mitochondrial respiration, and preserved left ventricular function. The study suggests that endogenously produced HS plays an important role in the preservation of cardiac function in heart failure and that oral HS therapy may be a therapeutic option for the treatment of LV dysfunction in the setting of pressure overload-induced hypertrophy.","Between July 2009 and September 2010, a total of 435 men, of which 125 (28.73%) had oligoasthenozoospermia were evaluated at the University Center for Reproductive Medicine. Seventy-two patients who agreed to enter the study were recruited; of these 18 were eliminated for various reasons (five did not present a combination of oligozoospermia and asthenozoospermia in the second semen analysis before treatment, eight had a chronic degenerative disease, three were chronic smokers, and two had taken antioxidants two months before the study). Fifty-four patients were included in the study who started treatment. Three dropped out (one mentioned \u201cstrange\u201d smelling sweat, one referred nausea and flatulence during the first three days of ingestion of the hard gelatin capsules, each containing 400 mg of SG-1002 (5 capsules per day) and one argued that there were too many capsules to take per day). When the patients were seen at the end of the 75 days of treatment, four did not attend despite insisting by telephone.","Information from 47 patients who complied with the protocol was analyzed. Mean age of the patients was 34.23 years, with 32 years being the most frequent. Patients were divided into three groups (hydrogen sulfide prodrug, resveratrol and placebo), maintaining a similar relationship between groups. Sixteen patients were included in the resveratrol group, 16 in the hydrogen sulfide prodrug group, and 15 in the placebo group. Two evaluations were made, a baseline sample and after treatment. In each of the two evaluations, variables such as concentration, motility, and morphology in fresh semen and post-capacitation were analyzed. The baseline characteristics of the three groups were similar. The average age of patients in each group was 34.6 years for hydrogen sulfide prodrug group, 35 years for the resveratrol group, and 33.07 years for the placebo group.","Mean sperm baseline concentration was 10.84 million per milliliter, with 0.5 million per milliliter being the lowest concentration and 19.9 million per milliliter, the highest concentration. The mean concentration in the first sample was 11.02, 10.9 and 10.64 million per milliliter for the hydrogen sulfide prodrug, resveratrol, and placebo groups, respectively. As for sperm motility recorded at baseline, A+B type motility had a mean of 13.43%, 14.43%, and 8.33% for the hydrogen sulfide prodrug, resveratrol and placebo groups, respectively. The morphology recorded in sample 1 was also similar in the three groups: 31.6% for the hydrogen sulfide prodrug group, 32.06% for the resveratrol group, and 30.06% for the placebo group with no statistically significant difference. The mobile forms recovered (MFR) obtained post-sperm capacitation were 0.579, 0.40 and 0.371 million for the hydrogen sulfide prodrug, resveratrol and placebo group, respectively (Table 8).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0198","num":"0207"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00008","num":"00008"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 8"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Characteristics of the first sample in the three groups"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Hydrogen sulfide",{},{}]},{"entry":["Characteristic","prodrug","Resveratrol","Placebo"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Sperm concentration","11.02 \u00d7 10","10.9 \u00d7 10","10.64 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":["Motility A + B (%)","13.43","14.43","8.33"]},{"entry":["Normal morphology","31.6","32.06","30.06"]},{"entry":["(%)",{},{},{}]},{"entry":["MFR","0.579 \u00d7 10","0.40 \u00d7 10","0.371 \u00d7 10"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Note:"},{"entry":"statistical analysis was performed using x"},{"entry":"MFR: Mobile Forms Recovery, post sperm capacitation"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00007"},"sup":"a"}},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"left","id":"FOO-00008"},"sup":"b"}}]}}]}}},"The data obtained from the first samples of the placebo group were compared with data obtained from the hydrogen sulfide prodrug.

In one study, the patient was 11 years old. The baseline condition was characterized as osteoblastic osteosarcoma of the left distal femur, presented with a pathological fracture and important tumor-related swelling and loss of function of the adjacent joint. The patient's physical examination was remarkable for the presence of a soft tissue mass and redness at the site of the primary tumor. No evidence of lung metastasis was recorded. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with no apparent clinical response.

By the end of the second week the patient began to feel better, blood sugar levels regularized even though the patient continued use of glibenclamide every 12 hours. The breathlessness improved by the third week. By the eighth week sugar levels were stable and the use of glibenclamide was reduced to one tablet per day without impact. Shortness of breath with exercise decreased just as chest pain. At the end of the fourth month a ventricular ejection fraction study came above 40% and the patient felt better and had better tolerance for exercise.","A trial was conducted on a 44 year old obese male patient with type 2 diabetes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes since he was 30 years old. Since then he has been taking glibenclamide with regular sugar control. At the age of 41 he started noticing regular coughing, shortness of breath, and orthopnea. He had a heart attack at the age of 42 and his ejection fraction after that was less than 40%. He started a treatment regimen of six hard gelatin capsules (each containing 400 mg SG-1002) per day of the highly bioavailable zerovalent-sulfur-rich composition. The treatment regimen lasted for three months. By the third week the patient began to feel better, blood sugar levels regularized even though the patient continued to use glibenclamide. Lack of air began to improve by the end of the seventh week. At the end of the third month the patient only took glibenclamide in the mornings but his glycaemia was practically normal.","While the invention has been described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, it will be understood that it is capable of further modifications and this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention following, in general, the principles of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure come within known or customary practice within the art to which the invention pertains and may be applied to the essential features hereinbefore set forth.","All publications, patents and patent applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1H","FIGS. 1A-1D","FIGS. 1E-1F","FIGS. 1G-1H"],"sub":["2","2","2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A-2F","FIG. 2A","FIG. 2B","FIG. 2C","FIG. 2D","FIG. 2E","FIG. 2F"],"sup":["\u2020","\u2021","#"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":["FIGS. 3A-3F","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3B","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3D","FIG. 3E","FIG. 3F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4H","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D","FIG. 4E","FIG. 4F","FIG. 4G","FIG. 4H"],"sub":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5C","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B","FIG. 5C"],"sub":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIGS. 6A-6H","FIG. 6A","FIG. 6B","FIG. 6C","FIG. 6D","FIGS. 6E-6F","FIGS. 6G-6H"],"sub":"2","sup":["Ser473","Thr308","Ser473 ","Thr308 ","Ser1177 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIGS. 7A-7F","FIG. 7A","FIG. 7B","FIGS. 7C-7D","FIG. 7E","FIG. 7F"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":["FIGS. 8A-8D","FIG. 8A","FIGS. 8B-8D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A-9D","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B","FIG. 9C","FIG. 9D"],"sub":["2","2","25 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":["FIGS. 10A-10C","FIG. 10A","FIG. 10B","FIG. 10C"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIGS. 12A-12D","FIG. 12A","FIG. 12B","FIG. 12C","FIG. 12D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIGS. 13A-13D","FIG. 13A","FIG. 13B","FIG. 13C","FIG. 13D"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0067","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 14"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
