{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["Example embodiments relate to controlling power transitions in transmitter systems, and in particular for such transmitter systems in communication networks having non-constant amplitude envelope modulation.","Examples of network systems which may incorporate non-constant amplitude envelope modulation include those which operate according to Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)-related standards, example of which include 3GPP, WCDMA, HSPA, LTE, etc., as would be understood in the art. In many UMTS-related standards, there are transition periods wherein transmit power changes from one desired power level to another.","It may be difficult to monitor power at these transition periods. For example, some existing UMTS systems and devices use a root-mean-squared power calculation in order to monitor power. In order to do so, sampling along continuous capture times may be required to gather adequate statistics for performing the power calculations. However, such sampling may be difficult as there may not always be sufficient capture times available. This becomes especially difficult during power transition periods where the power is constantly changing.","Further, power detection and control of some UMTS systems and devices may require relatively complicated circuits or systems.","It would be advantageous to address some of the above-noted difficulties. Other difficulties of existing systems may also be appreciated in view of the foregoing.","Some example embodiments generally relate to dynamic control of an antenna system, for example to enable and disable performance of antenna diversity, such as receive diversity.","In accordance with an example embodiment, there is provided a method for controlling a transmitter power control system in communication networks that include a modulation scheme having a non-constant amplitude envelope. The method includes: generating a transmission signal and transitioning the transmission signal from a first specified power level to a second specified power level and having a transition period therebetween, and generating a constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal during the transition period.","The method may further include generating a non-constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal at the first specified power level, switching to the constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal during the transition period and generating the non-constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal at the second specified power level.","In accordance with another example embodiment, there is provided a transmitter power control system for use in communication networks that include a modulation scheme having a non-constant amplitude envelope. The transmitter power control system includes: a transmitter unit for generating a transmission signal and configured for transitioning the transmission signal from a first specified power level to a second specified power level and having a transition period therebetween, the transmitter unit generating a constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal during the transition period.","In accordance with a further example embodiment, there is provided a computer program product including a computer readable medium storing instructions in the form of executable program code for causing the computer device to perform the described methods.","Some embodiments described herein generally relate to computer devices such as handheld electronic devices. Examples of handheld electronic devices include mobile communication devices such as pagers, cellular phones, Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices and other satellite navigation devices, smart phones, wireless organizers and personal digital assistants. Some embodiments may also be applied to notebook computers such as wireless-enabled notebook computers.","Reference is now made to  which illustrates a mobile communication device  in which example embodiments can be applied. The mobile communication device  is a two-way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities, and the capability to communicate with other computer systems, for example, via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device , in various embodiments the device may be a data communication device, a multiple-mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication, a handheld mobile device such as a smartphone, mobile telephone or a PDA (personal digital assistant) enabled for wireless communication, or a computer system with a wireless modem.","The mobile communication device  includes a rigid case (not shown) housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device  are constructed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The mobile communication device  includes a controller including at least one processor  (such as a microprocessor) which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor  interacts with device subsystems such as a communication subsystem  for exchanging wireless (e.g. radio frequency) signals with a wireless network  to perform communication functions. The processor  interacts with additional device subsystems including a display (screen)  such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen, input devices  such as a keyboard and control buttons, flash memory , random access memory (RAM) , read only memory (ROM) , auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems , data port  such as serial data port, such as a Universal Serial Bus (USB) data port, speaker , microphone , short-range communication subsystem , and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in  perform communication-related functions, whereas other subsystems may provide \u201cresident\u201d or on-device functions.","The device  may include a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch-sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch-sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch-sensitive input device and the processor  interacts with the touch-sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.","The processor  operates under stored program control and executes software modules  stored in memory such as persistent memory, for example, in the flash memory . As illustrated in , the software modules  include operating system software  and software applications. A transmitter control module  may, among other things, be implemented by the operating system  or through a stand-alone software application , or components (e.g., the DSP ) of the communication subsystem , or combined together in one or more of the operating system , applications  and communication subsystem . In some example embodiments, the functions performed by the transmitter control module  may be realized as a plurality of independent elements, rather than a single integrated element, and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts between the operating system  and other software applications .","Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules  or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM  is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory, this is merely one example, and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.","The software applications  may include a range of applications, including, for example, an address book application, a messaging application, a calendar application, and\/or a notepad application. In some embodiments, the software applications  include an email message application, a push content viewing application, a voice communication (i.e. telephony) application, a map application, and a media player application. Each of the software applications  may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements (e.g. text fields, input fields, icons, etc.) in the user interface (i.e. the display screen ) according to the application.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  also includes a removable memory card  (typically comprising flash memory) and a memory card interface . Network access typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device  via the memory card , which may be a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card  is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface  of the mobile communication device  in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .","The mobile communication device  stores data  in an erasable persistent memory, which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments, the data  includes service data comprising information required by the mobile communication device  to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data  may also include user application data such as email messages, address book and contact information, calendar and schedule information, notepad documents, image files, and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device  by its user, and other data. The data  stored in the persistent memory (e.g. flash memory ) of the mobile communication device  may be organized, at least partially, into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example, email messages, contact records, and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.","In some embodiments, the auxiliary input\/output (I\/O) subsystems  may comprise an external communication link or interface, for example, an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device  may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks, for example, a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network (not shown). The auxiliary I\/O subsystems  may comprise a navigational tool such as a clickable trackball or thumbwheel, a digital camera, or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device  such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call, or for other purposes such as haptic feedback (touch feedback).","The serial data port  may be used for synchronization with a user's host computer system (e.g., computer  ()). The serial data port  enables a user to set preferences through an external device or software application and extends the capabilities of the mobile communication device  by providing for information or software downloads to the mobile communication device  other than through the wireless network . The alternate download path may, for example, be used to load an encryption key onto the mobile communication device  through a direct, reliable and trusted connection to thereby provide secure device communication.","In some embodiments, the mobile communication device  is provided with a service routing application programming interface (API) which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data (i.e., USB) or Bluetooth\u00ae (Bluetooth\u00ae is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG, Inc.) connection to the host computer system  using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device  to the host computer system  via a USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection, traffic that was destined for the wireless network  is automatically routed to the mobile communication device  using the USB cable or Bluetooth\u00ae connection. Similarly, any traffic destined for the wireless network  is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth\u00ae connection to the host computer system  for processing.","The short-range communication subsystem  is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device  and different systems or devices, which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example, the subsystem  may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components, or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth\u00ae communication module to provide for communication with similarly-enabled systems and devices.","A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations, including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device  during or after manufacture. Additional applications and\/or upgrades to the operating system  or software applications  may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device  through the wireless network , the auxiliary I\/O subsystem , the serial port , the short-range communication subsystem , or other suitable subsystems  or wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed, for example, written into the program memory (i.e. the flash memory ), or written into and executed from the RAM  for execution by the processor  at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device  and may provide enhanced on-device functions, communication-related functions, or both. For example, secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .","The mobile communication device  may provide two principal modes of communication: a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode, a received data signal such as a text message, an email message, or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem  and input to the processor  for further processing. For example, a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device  may also compose data items, such as email messages, for example, using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem  over the wireless network .","In the voice communication mode, the mobile communication device  provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar, except that the received signals would be output to the speaker  and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software\/firmware (i.e., the voice communication module) and hardware (i.e., the microphone , the speaker  and input devices). Alternative voice or audio I\/O subsystems, such as a voice message recording subsystem, may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker , the display screen  may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party, duration of a voice call, or other voice call related information.","The mobile communication device  also includes a battery  as a power source, which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged, for example, through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery  provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device , and the battery interface  provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface  is coupled to a regulator (not shown) which provides power V+ to the circuitry of the mobile communication device . A battery level indicator (not shown) may also be included for detecting and indicating the remaining batter power.","In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate, reference is made to  which shows in block diagram form a communication system  in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system  comprises a number of mobile communication devices  which may be connected to the remainder of system  in any of several different ways. Accordingly, several instances of mobile communication devices  are depicted in  employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices  are connected to the wireless network  which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)  and a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)  or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments, the mobile communication devices  are configured to communicate over both the WWAN  and WLAN , and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments, the wireless network  may comprise multiple WWANs  and WLANs .","The WWAN  may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example, but not limitation, the WWAN  may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations  (one of which is shown in ) where each of the base stations  provides wireless Radio Frequency (RF) coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN  is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, the WWAN  conforms to a modulation scheme having a non-constant amplitude envelope, for example UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems). The WWAN  may also be configured for one or more additional wireless network types for communication with other devices, such as: Mobitex Radio Network, DataTAC, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), GPRS (General Packet Radio System), TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), iDEN (integrated Digital Enhanced Network), EvDO (Evolution-Data Optimized) CDMA2000, EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution), HSPDA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access), LTE (Long Term Evolution), IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX), or various other networks. Although WWAN  is described as a \u201cWide-Area\u201d network, that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMAN) and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.","The WWAN  may further comprise a wireless network gateway  which connects the mobile communication devices  to transport facilities , and through the transport facilities  to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines, the public Internet, a virtual private network, or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system  may be operated, for example, by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation, university, or governmental department, which allows access to a network  such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources, or the wireless connector system  may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments, the network  may be realised using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.","The wireless network gateway  provides an interface between the wireless connector system  and the WWAN , which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices  and other devices (not shown) connected, directly or indirectly, to the WWAN . Accordingly, communications sent via the mobile communication devices  are transported via the WWAN  and the wireless network gateway  through transport facilities  to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system  are received by the wireless network gateway  and transported via the WWAN  to the mobile communication devices .","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  comprises a wireless network which, in some embodiments, conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards (sometimes referred to as Wi-Fi) such as, for example, the IEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and\/or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN  in other embodiments such as, for example, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.16e (also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or \u201cWiMAX\u201d), or IEEE 802.20 (also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access). The WLAN  includes one or more wireless RF Access Points (AP)  (one of which is shown in ) that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.","The WLAN  may be a personal network of the user, an enterprise network, or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider (ISP), a mobile network provider, or a property owner in a public or semi-public area, for example. The access points  are connected to an access point (AP) interface  which may connect to the wireless connector system  directly (for example, if the access point  is part of an enterprise WLAN  in which the wireless connector system  resides), or indirectly as indicated by the dashed line if  via the transport facilities  if the access point  is a personal Wi-Fi network or Wi-Fi hotspot (in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system , such as a virtual private network (VPN), may be required). The AP interface  provides translation and routing services between the access points  and the wireless connector system  to facilitate communication, directly or indirectly, with the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  may be implemented as one or more servers, and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system  manages communications, including email communications, to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system  also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices  which may connect to the wireless connector system .","The wireless connector system  allows the mobile communication devices  to access the network  and connected resources and services such as a messaging server  (for example, a Microsoft Exchange\u2122, IBM Lotus Domino\u2122, or Novell GroupWise\u2122 email server), and a content server  for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization's internal servers, and application servers  for implementing server-based applications such as instant messaging (IM) applications to mobile communication devices .","The wireless connector system  typically provides a secure exchange of data (e.g., email messages, personal information manager (PIM) data, and IM data) with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments, communications between the wireless connector system  and the mobile communication devices  are encrypted. In some embodiments, communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES) encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure, two-way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some embodiments, the private encryption key is stored only in the user's mailbox on the messaging server  and on the mobile communication device , and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices  is encrypted by the wireless connector system  using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox. The encrypted data, when received on the mobile communication devices , is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly, data sent to the wireless connector system  from the mobile communication devices  is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data, when received on the wireless connector system , is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user's mailbox.","The wireless network gateway  is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device  over the WWAN  to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system  then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server , content server  or application servers . Conversely, the wireless connector system  sends data packets received, for example, from the messaging server , content server  or application servers  to the wireless network gateway  which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces  of the WLAN  provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device , the wireless connector system  and network connection point such as the messaging server , content server  and application server .","The network  may comprise a private local area network, metropolitan area network, wide area network, the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these, alone, or in combination.","The mobile communication device  may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system  using a computer , such as desktop or notebook computer, via the network . A link  or data connection may be provided for exchanging information (including synchronization data) between the mobile communication device  and computer  connected to the wireless connector system . The link  may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short-range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection, Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, Firewire\u2122 (also known as an IEEE 1394 interface) connection, or other serial data connection, via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device  and computer . The short-range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network (PAN) interface. A personal area network is a wireless point-to-point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short-range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared (IR) connection such as an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) connection, a short-range radio frequency (RF) connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 or the Bluetooth\u2122 special interest group, or IEEE 802.15.3a, also referred to as UltraWideband (UWB), or other PAN connection.","It will be appreciated that the above-described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only, and that the above-described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings herein may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the intended scope.","Systems and method in accordance with example embodiments for controlling power transitions in transmitter systems will now be described, with reference to , which shows a graph  illustrating example transmitted power signals within the WWAN  (). In example embodiments the WWAN  conforms to a modulation scheme having a non-constant amplitude envelope, for example UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems). Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) is a standard for 3G wireless networks, as defined by the International Telecommunications Union. Examples of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)-related standards include 3GPP, WCDMA, HSPA, and LTE, as would be understood in the art. As illustrated in , UMTS may include a communication scheme wherein time intervals are separated into a number of slots (collectively or individually referred to as ), illustrated as first slot , second slot , and third slot . Slot boundaries , are also shown for separation of the slots . In UMTS, each slot  has a length of about \u2154 milliseconds, and which include 2560 chips in each slot . UMTS also provides that 15 slots form a 10 millisecond frame (i.e., 38,400 chips per frame). Typically, each slot  includes a specified power level to be transmitted , which comprises the aggregate of a specified data payload power level requirement  and a specified control signal (or merely \u201csignal\u201d) power level requirement . As shown in , a first specified power level corresponds to first slot , a second specified power level corresponds to second slot , and a third specified power level corresponds to third slot . In UMTS, the specified data payload is typically referred to as Dedicated Physical Data Channel (DPDCH), while the specified control signal is referred to as Dedicated Physical Control Channel (DPCCH).","Within each slot , the signal to be transmitted at the specified power level may for example be transmitted for a duration of 2368 chips. Between slots, there are first and second transition periods , wherein the transmitted power level to be transmitted changes from one power level to another. An example typical transition period, as shown, is 192 chips which corresponds to about 50 microseconds (comprised of two 96 chips or 25 microsecond periods at opposing sides of the slot boundary ). In existing UMTS systems, there may be no specific requirements regarding monitoring or controls during the transition periods. It is recognized herein that, since UMTS typically does not have any specific protocol or scheme that must be followed during the transition periods , there may be opportunities to manipulate the transmitted signal, for example for monitoring and control during the transition periods .","For example, an example mean power of a conventional transmitted signal  from a conventional device is shown in  for use in UMTS systems. Such existing devices may use a root-mean-squared power calculation in order to monitor and control the power of the transmitted signal . In order to do so, sampling along continuous capture times may be required by the device to gather adequate statistics for performing the power calculations. However, such sampling may be difficult as there may not always be sufficient capture times available. This becomes especially difficult during power level transition periods wherein the power level is constantly changing.","Another example difficulty with existing devices is that, during the first transition period , there may be an overshoot , as shown, which may last for the duration of the entire slot , when compared to the desired target power level . This may waste power-generating resources which is generally now desired. Similarly, at the third slot , there may be an overshoot or undershoot of the transmitted signal  (due to the errors in estimation) with respect to the desired target power level . This may lead to additional inefficiencies in the transmitted power.","Referring again to , in some example embodiments, the mobile communication device  using the communication subsystem  is enabled for controlling power transitions for use in UMTS-implemented systems. Generally, the mobile communication device  may be configured for generating a transmission signal and transitioning the transmission signal from a first specified power level to a second specified power level and having a transition period therebetween. The mobile communication device  may be configured for generating a non-constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal at the first specified power level, switching to a constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal during the transition period, and generating the non-constant amplitude envelope modulation of the transmission signal at the second specified power level. Examples of constant amplitude envelope modulation include QPSK, MSK, GMSK, FSK, GFSK, as would be understood in the art.","In example embodiments, the communication subsystem  may generally be used for enabling wireless communications to be transmitted, and in some embodiments received, by the mobile communication device . The communication subsystem  may for example be used by any of the various subsystems of the mobile communication device  which may require wireless communications. The communication subsystem  includes an antenna system including a receiver unit , a transmitter unit , and associated components, local oscillators (LOs) , and a processing module such as a digital signal processor (DSP) . The DSP  acts as a controller or local controller for the communication subsystem , and may be in communication with the transmitter control module . The receiver unit  is associated with antenna element , while the transmitter unit  is associated with antenna element . As would be understood in the art, the antenna elements ,  may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device , and formed of at least some conductive material for receiving or transmitting (or both) of electromagnetic signals. Although antenna elements  and  are illustrated separately, in some example embodiments at least some of the antenna elements ,  are shared by both receiver and transmitter, and enabled for both transmitting and receiving. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication, the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem  depends on the wireless network  in which mobile communication device  is intended to operate.","The mobile communication device  may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations  (or, in some embodiments, fixed receiver base stations) of the wireless network  within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device  may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network  after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna elements  through the wireless network  are input to the receiver unit , which may perform such receiver functions as signal amplification, signal combining, frequency down conversion, filtering, channel selection, etc., as well as analog-to-digital (A\/D) conversion, as would be understood in the art. A\/D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner, signals to be transmitted are processed, including modulation and encoding, for example, by the DSP . These DSP-processed signals are input to the transmitter unit  for digital-to-analog (D\/A) conversion, frequency up conversion, filtering, amplification, and transmission to the wireless network  via the antenna . The DSP  not only processes communication signals, but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example, the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver unit  and the transmitter unit  may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .","Reference is now made to , which shows in detail an example transmitter power control system  to be used in the communication subsystem , in accordance with an example embodiment. Similar reference numbers may be used for convenience and ease of reference. As shown, the transmitter power control system  includes a power amplifier  between the transmitter unit  and the antenna element , wherein the transmitter unit  receives a signal to be transmitted from the DSP . The power amplifier  may be used to receive a signal and amplify the signal for transmission using the antenna element . The transmitter power control system  also includes a closed feedback loop  from the power amplifier  to the transmitter . It is also understood in the art that the power amplifier  may also include some internal feedback loop (to control the output), which would be considered a separate feedback. In example embodiments, it can be understood that the transmitter power control system  may be implemented by digital components, analog components, or a combination or sub-combination of digital and analog components.","The transmitter unit  may also be configured for various modes of processing of the signal to be transmitted. As shown, the transmitter unit  may include a non-constant amplitude envelope modulation module  and a constant amplitude envelope modulation module . In example embodiments, the transmitter unit  is enabled to perform a non-constant amplitude envelope modulation on the transmitted signal as well as a constant amplitude envelope modulation, and may be configured to switch between modulation types. The feedback loop  may for example be used to facilitate constant amplitude envelope modulation. In example embodiments, the transmitter unit  may also perform some aspects of the DSP , or vice versa.","Reference is now made to , which shows in detail another example transmitter power control system  to be used in the communication subsystem , in accordance with another example embodiment. In this example embodiment (when compared to ), a separate power detect unit  may be used. Similar reference numbers may be used for convenience and ease of reference. As shown in , the transmitter power control system  includes the power amplifier  between the transmitter unit  and the antenna element , wherein the transmitter unit  receives a signal to be transmitted from the DSP . The power detect unit  receives an amplified signal from the power amplifier  which may be used for monitoring of the signal. The transmitter power control system  also includes a closed feedback loop  from the power detect unit  to the transmitter .","Reference is again made to , which shows an example transmitted signal  transmitted by the mobile communication device  in accordance with an example embodiment. Similar to the above-noted conventional transmitted signal , within each slot  there is a specified power level to be transmitted , , . Again, there are first and second transition periods , between slots . At the first slot , the transmitter  of the mobile communication device  generates the transmitted signal  using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation, so that there is suitable communications within UMTS systems. At the first transition period , the transmitter  generates the transmitted signal  using constant amplitude envelope modulation. This may include \u201cswitching\u201d to a constant amplitude envelope modulation mode. Since the signal is modulating using constant amplitude envelope, this may for example assist in monitoring (e.g., calculation of transmitted power) and control of the transmitted signal . In other words, the amplitude envelope is known, and for example sampling for root-mean-square values over a period of time may not be required. In addition, such a transmitted signal  using constant amplitude envelope modulation may be possible as many UMTS systems may not have any specific protocol or scheme that must be followed during the transition period ","Continuing with the example, at the second slot , the transmitter  generates the transmitted signal  using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation. At the second transition period , the transmitter  generates the transmitted signal  once again using constant amplitude envelope modulation. At the third slot , the transmitter  generates the transmitted signal  using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation. Such a process may continue and repeat, as appropriate.","In some instances, it can be appreciated that as little as one RF sample (or chip sample) may be used to gain an accurate power calculation of the transmitted signal .","It can also be appreciated that, during constant amplitude envelope modulation, there are further opportunities for spectral shaping processes to be performed by the DSP  or transmitter . In an example embodiment, additional spectral filtering processes may be performed onto the spectral shape of the transmitted signal. In other example embodiments, spectral shaping techniques as in GSM may be used on the transmitted signal.","It can further be appreciated that, in some example embodiments, only the mobile device  may need be configured to implement aspects of the above-described embodiments. Thus, in such embodiments, a WWAN  implementing UMTS may not require modification and may, in fact, be unaware of any such implementations from the transmissions of the mobile device .","Reference is now made to , which shows an example operation  as performed by the communication subsystem  in accordance with an example embodiment. At process , the transmitter unit  operates by generating a transmitted signal using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation. At process , the transmitter unit  determines whether there is a change to a new specified power level. At process , the transmitter unit  continues to operate under non-constant amplitude modulation until the transition period at the slot boundary is reached. Thus, at process , it is determined whether the slot boundary is reached. If not, the transmitter unit  continues to operate at process  until the slot boundary is reached. If so, at process , the transmitter unit  operates at the slot boundary (i.e., the transition period) by generating a transmitted signal using constant amplitude envelope modulation. At this stage, the power level of the transmitted signal may for example be readily monitored and calculated as constant amplitude envelope modulation is being used here. At process , the transmitter unit  may determine whether a predetermined interval of the transition period  of the slot has elapsed, for example after 192 chips or about 50 microseconds, and if so returns to operation using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation (process ).","In an alternate embodiment, referring again to process , the transmitter unit  may instead determine whether the new specified power level is reached, which may for example occur prior to the end of the slot boundary transition period, and if so proceed to process , i.e., operation using non-constant amplitude envelope modulation. Other triggers may also be used in other embodiments.","While the operations  have been described as occurring in a particular order for exemplary purposes, it will be appreciated to persons skilled in the art that some of the processes or steps may be performed in a different order provided that the result of the changed order of any given step will not prevent or impair the occurrence of subsequent steps. Furthermore, some of the steps described above may be combined in other embodiments, and some of the steps described above may be separated into a number of sub-steps in other embodiments.","Variations of the example embodiments are possible. For example, some example embodiments may be applied to any transmitter power control system, which may or not be implemented by the mobile communication device .","While some aspects have been described in terms of methods, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the those aspects are also directed to various apparatus such as a handheld electronic device including components for performing at least some of the aspects and features of the described methods, be it by way of hardware components, software or any combination of the two, or in any other manner.
