title: Apparatus for producing gaseous vapor baffle
abstract: An apparatus that produces a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates an undersea sonar system from acoustic noise. The apparatus allows for craft carrying undersea sonar systems to travel at relatively high speeds while substantially isolating the undersea sonar systems from acoustic noise interference produced by propulsion systems, hull appendages, waves and bubbles. The apparatus has a support strut that has one end that is joined or attached to the hull of a craft. A sonar pod is attached to the other end of the support strut. The support strut has a ventilation duct and a plurality of ventilation ports. A cavitator is attached to the support strut and produces a sheet cavity as the craft travels in the water. Pressurized air or other gases are injected into the ventilation duct which then exit through the ventilation ports and into the sheet cavity. The pressurized air or gas exiting the ventilation ports expands the sheet cavity to form a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates the sonar pod from acoustic noise.

Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to an apparatus that produces gaseous vapor baffling.","2. Description of the Prior Art","Many of today's ships and surface vessels operate at speeds exceeding 30 knots. However, when ships and vessels travel at these speeds, acoustic noise is generated from bubbly wakes, noisy propulsion devices and appendages. If these ships or vessels have sonar arrays attached to their hulls, or are towing sonar arrays in their wakes, the operation of such sonar arrays are adversely affected by the aforementioned acoustic noise. Specifically, the turbulent flow of water over the fairing structure of the sonar array generates pressure fluctuations on the fairing structure. Both turbulent boundary layers and turbulent wakes contribute to this type of structural excitation. The sonar array can experience these pressure fluctuations directly when the flow over the sonar array is turbulent, or indirectly when these pressure fluctuations propagate through the fairing structure or the support strut supporting the sonar array and into the sonar array. Fluctuating cavitation bubbles and collapsing vapor bubbles also produce significant noise that propagates through support struts and other structures connected to the sonar array. Noise generated by the vessel propulsion system also generates a significant amount of acoustic noise. Blade tonals, cavitation bubbles, and entrained air all generate noise that propagates through the environment to the sonar array. Similarly, breaking bow-waves, hull slapping, ship machinery noise, and other ship related noise sources also can affect operation of the sonar array. Furthermore, a mechanical path from the noise source through the structure supporting the sonar array exacerbates the acoustic noise problem. Thus, the ability of these sonar arrays to detect obstacles, marine mammals, debris and mines is significantly degraded as a result of the acoustic noise interference.","The prior art reveals several sonar systems, sonar support systems and particular design configurations for water craft. Soderman U.S. Pat. No. 3,910,215 discloses a hydrofoil that is pivotally mounted to a vehicle to allow the hydrofoil to absorb shocks. Dewitt U.S. Pat. No. 3,915,106 discloses a hydrofoil incorporating a ventilation system for introducing air into the flow over the hydrofoil. Andersen U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,584 discloses a transducer array mounted in a fairing. Archibald U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,863 discloses a sonar support system that has a sonar array mounted in a hydrofoil that is supported on a strut that is coupled to a ship. Bobst U.S. Pat. No. 5,524,568 discloses the use of a ventilation system to inject air at a plurality of spaced-apart aperture arrays formed in the hull of a boat. Seaman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,296 discloses a transducer array mounted in a hydrofoil-shaped fairing. Nesbitt U.S. Pat. No. 6,095,076 discloses the use of flexible struts to support hydrofoils. Lang U.S. Pat. No. 6,167,829 discloses the injection of air to form a gas cavity over a marine vehicle component such as a hydrofoil. Air is injected at either end of the component. None of these prior art patents disclose, teach or suggest the apparatus of the present invention which employs a novel technique to reduce acoustic noise interference with undersea sonar arrays or systems that are joined or attached to the underside of a ship or vessel.","Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a gaseous vapor baffle that can be used to provide isolation from acoustic noise.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates a sonar array from acoustic noise.","A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a gaseous vapor baffle that is relatively inexpensive to manufacture.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for producing a gaseous vapor baffle that minimizes hydrodynamic noise by maintaining laminar flow over the sonar array and to physically isolate the sonar array from portions of the sonar array support structure that are subjected to relatively large pressure fluctuations.","Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the ensuing description.","The present invention is directed to an apparatus that produces a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates an undersea sonar system from acoustic noise. The apparatus allows for craft carrying undersea sonar systems to travel at relatively high speeds while substantially isolating the undersea sonar systems from acoustic noise interference produced by propulsion systems, hull appendages, waves and bubbles. The apparatus comprises a support strut that has one end that is joined or attached to the hull of a craft. A sonar pod is attached to the other end of the support strut. The support strut has a ventilation duct and a plurality of ventilation ports. A cavitator is attached to the support strut and produces a sheet cavity as the craft travels in the water. Pressurized air or other gases are injected into the ventilation duct which then exit through the ventilation ports and into the sheet cavity. The pressurized air or gas exiting the ventilation ports expands the sheet cavity to form a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates the sonar pod from acoustic noise. The impedance mismatch between the gaseous vapor baffle and the water isolates the sonar pod from acoustic noise.","In one aspect, the present invention is directed to an apparatus for producing a gaseous vapor baffle, comprising a support strut which has a ventilation duct, at least one ventilation port, and a portion that is configured to be joined to a craft. The apparatus further comprises a cavitator joined to the support strut to produce a sheet cavity that intersects the support strut when the craft travels through a liquid medium, and a device to generate pressurized gas and inject the pressurized gas into the ventilation duct of the support strut. The pressurized gas exits the ventilation port and expands the sheet cavity to form a gaseous vapor baffle as the craft travels through the liquid medium.","In a related aspect, the present invention is directed to a sonar system that comprises a support strut which has a ventilation duct therein, at least one ventilation port, and a portion that is configured to be joined to a craft. The sonar system further comprises a cavitator joined to the support strut to produce a sheet cavity that intersects the support strut when the craft travels through a liquid medium, and a device to generate pressurized gas and inject the pressurized gas into the ventilation duct of the support strut. The pressurized gas exits the ventilation port and expands the sheet cavity to form a gaseous vapor baffle as the craft travels through the liquid medium. The sonar system further comprises a noise isolation device joined to a portion of the support strut, and a sonar device joined to the noise isolation device such that the sonar device is below the gaseous vapor baffle when the craft is traveling through the liquid medium, and wherein the noise isolation device reduces the propagation of acoustic noise from the support strut to the sonar device. The gaseous vapor baffle functions as a barrier that substantially isolates the sonar system from acoustic noise produced by the operation of the craft, movement of the craft through the liquid medium, and the result of turbulent flow upon the apparatus or portions thereof.","Referring to , there is shown craft . Craft  includes hull  which has exterior surface  that is exposed to liquid medium  (e.g., ocean water). The apparatus of the present invention is generally indicated by reference number . In this embodiment of the invention, apparatus  is joined or attached to hull . Although the present description is in terms of apparatus  being joined, attached or coupled to the hull of a craft, it is to be understood that apparatus  can be joined or attached to other types of water-oriented vehicles or devices. Accordingly, as used herein, the term \u201ccraft\u201d shall include ships, pleasure boats, research vessels, towed sonar support structures, tow drogue, submarines and any other vessel, device or vehicle configured to travel on or through a liquid medium or body of water (e.g. oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, etc.) Apparatus  generally comprises support strut , cavitator  and sonar pod . Sonar pod  comprises sonar array  and other sonar components which are not shown, but which are well known in the art. Sonar array  can be of any standard design known in the art, including cylindrical, spherical and conformal designs. In a localization system, sonar array  will typically operate at relatively high frequencies and, consequently, will be relatively small in size, typically several feet in diameter. Sonar pod  further includes acoustically transparent fairing structure  which encloses sonar array  and reduces hydrodynamic noise, but does not eliminate such hydrodynamic noise.","In one embodiment, support strut  is attached, joined or coupled to mount . Mount  is attached to exterior surface  of hull . In one embodiment, support strut  is removably attached to mount . In another embodiment, support strut  is permanently fixed to mount . However, it is to be understood that support strut  can be attached to hull  by any suitable technique. Support strut  supports the remaining components of apparatus . Support strut  has a substantially streamlined design so as to minimize drag and acoustic noise generation. In one embodiment, support strut  is extendable so as to increase or decrease the distance between hull  and sonar pod . Support strut  comprises first portion A and second portion B. First portion A extends downward in a generally vertical orientation. Second portion B extends outward from first portion A and is angulated with respect to first portion A. In one embodiment, second portion B is generally perpendicular to first portion A. However, second portion B may be angulated to other suitable degrees of angulation. Second portion B extends to distal end . Support strut  comprises ventilation duct  (shown in phantom) which extends throughout support strut . Support strut  also has therein cables, connectors and other signal components, all of which not being shown but which are known in the art, that extend to sonar pod , for transferring signals to and from sonar pod . Support strut  further comprises at least one ventilation port , and, preferably a plurality of ventilation ports  that are located in second portion B. In one embodiment, ventilation ports  are consecutively arranged in a linear formation.","Apparatus  further includes mechanical isolation system  that controls the acoustic path from craft  to sonar pod . In one embodiment, mechanical isolation system  is an active acoustic noise isolation system well known in the art. In another embodiment, mechanical isolation system  is a passive acoustic noise isolation system, also well known in the art. Mechanical isolation system  prevents any acoustic noise that is propagating through support strut  from penetrating sonar pod .","Cavitator  is configured to generate a sheet cavity in response to movement of craft  through the liquid medium (e.g. ocean, river, etc.). In one embodiment, cavitator  is configured as a substantially flat plate that is positioned substantially normal to the direction of travel of craft . Other cavitator configurations are discussed in the ensuing description. Preferably, cavitator  is positioned forward of sonar pod  so as to create a sheet cavity that extends over and sufficiently far aft of sonar pod . This sheet cavity forms an initial baffle from acoustic noise emanating from craft  or resulting from turbulent flow. Apparatus  further includes pressurized air or gas source . In a preferred embodiment, pressurized air or gas source  is located within craft . Pressurized air or gas source  injects pressurized air or other gases through inlet  in mount  and into ventilation duct . The pressurized air or gas exits ventilation ports  and enters the sheet cavity produced by cavitator . As a result, the pressurized air or gas significantly expands the sheet cavity produced by cavitator  to form gaseous cavity . Gaseous cavity  extends aft of cavitator . The pressure and amount of the air or gas injected into ventilation duct  can be varied in accordance with the size of cavitator  and the speed of craft . As the speed of the craft decreases, ventilation rates are increased so as to maintain the desired size of gaseous cavity . Gaseous cavity  functions as a gaseous vapor baffle that isolates sonar pod  from acoustic noise resulting from the operation of craft , the movement of craft  through the liquid medium, or turbulent flow. Gaseous cavity  intersects with support strut  at a location above mechanical isolation system . However, any acoustic noise produced by the intersection of gaseous cavity  and support strut  is prevented from propagating to sonar pod  by mechanical isolation system .","As a result of mechanical isolation system  and gaseous cavity , there is no direct path between the noise sources of craft  and sonar pod . The noise produced by cavitator  and gaseous cavity  are minimal because the flow separating from cavitator  is laminar (no fluctuating edge forces) and gaseous cavity  closes as a plurality of relatively large air bubbles. Thus, apparatus  substantially eliminates the acoustic and structural path between craft  and sonar pod  thereby isolating sonar pod  from noise produced by the craft as well as turbulence-related noise. An important advantage of apparatus  is that it allows craft  to operate at relatively high speeds with relatively low sonar array noise.","In an alternate embodiment of the invention, cavitator  is configured as a lifting foil. When cavitator  is configured as a lifting foil, there are several advantages. For example, a lifting foil cavitator lifts and stabilizes the tow ship and creates relatively less impedance when the ventilation function of strut  is not used. The actual structural configuration of cavitator  depends upon the length of support strut  and volume flow rate of gas injected into gaseous cavity . In another embodiment of the invention, cavitator  is configured to have a wedge-shaped design. In yet a further embodiment, cavitator  is configured as a hydrofoil.","In an alternate embodiment, craft  has a retractable host platform (not shown) to which apparatus  is joined or attached. Such a configuration allows apparatus  to be retracted into craft . Although the foregoing description is in terms of apparatus  being attached or joined to the hull of a craft, it is to be understood that apparatus  can be utilized in other scenarios. For example, apparatus  can be part of a towed array system wherein support strut  is attached to a tow drogue and the tow drogue is pulled by a surface ship or an aircraft.","The principles, preferred embodiments and modes of operation of the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification. The invention which is intended to be protected herein should not, however, be construed as limited to the particular forms disclosed, as these are to be regarded as illustrative rather than restrictive. Variations and changes may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, the foregoing detailed description should be considered as exemplary in nature and not as limiting the scope and spirit of the invention as set forth in the attached claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing features of the present invention will become more readily apparent and may be understood by referring to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment of the present invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
