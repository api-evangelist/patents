The Appendix is subject to the \u201cCopyright Notice and Authorization\u201d stated above.","The present invention may be used to track the ingestion\/administering\/vending of single medicine packages or Multi-Unit Dose Packages or Multi-Unit Drug Packages (MUDPs). An MUDP contains one dosage of medicines that are prescribed for a specific treatment regimen. That is, there are a plurality of different medicines in an MUDP, and there may be one or pills of each medicine to obtain the desired dosage. All of the different medications in an MUDP packet are meant to be taken at the same time. MUDPs are typically created using specialized robotic machinery. However, the scope of the present invention includes MUDPs that are manually packaged in simple plastic packets or the like.","An MUDP typically includes a label that describes its contents, or it may include human or machine readable indicia (e.g., an ID number) that functions as a pointer in a database memory that stores its contents. The label may also include patient identifying information. The machine readable indicia may be a bar code or QR code that identifies the patient, date, and medication. The examples described below relate to MUDPs, but the scope of the present invention includes single medicines or packages that include only one medicine type per package.","Two example implementations of the present invention are described below.","I. Implementation 1",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},"1. A network of portable medication vending devices (PMVDs)  for use by individual patients in a home environment, designated as through . In a typical scenario, there is one PMVD  per patient, and thus there will typically be one PMVD  per home. The PMVDs  may also be used in other environments, such as nursing homes or hospitals, wherein each resident or patient may have its own PMVD  in his or her respective housing unit or hospital room. The word \u201cpatient\u201d is used herein to designate the individual whose medications are present in the PMVD . The word \u201cuser\u201d is used herein to designate an individual who physically interacts with the PMVD . In most instances, the patient will be the user, but a caregiver may also be a user, especially if the patient is unable to operate the PMVD . Each PMVD  has a unique IP address. It is well-known in the art to assign unique IP addresses to physical devices, such as conventional vending machines, and any suitable assignment scheme may be used.","2. A host site  that includes one or more databases , an electronic translation engine , and an electronic medication administration record (e-MAR or eMAR) . The one or more databases  includes a table that associates the IP address of a PMVD  to a specific patient so that any data received from the PMVD  will be associated with the correct patient, and so that any data that needs to be sent to the patient will be routed to the correct PMVD .","The electronic translation engine  has the overall function of receiving vending machine data in a conventional vending machine data format, such as DEX data or MDB data (described in more detail below) and converting the data to a format that can be directly input into the eMAR . The IP address\/patient identity information in the database  is used to identify which patient the eMAR data belongs to so that the appropriate patient record within the eMAR  can be updated. More specifically, the electronic translation engine  includes a first electronic translator  and a second electronic translator . The first electronic translator  performs a conversion of the DEX data or MDB data into HL7 data. (HL7 is an abbreviation of Health Level Seven, which is a standard for exchanging information between medical applications. HL7 defines a format for the transmission of health-related information.) The second electronic translator  converts the HL7 data into eMAR data. There is no standard eMAR format, and it varies from system to system. However, a typical eMAR will include patient ID information (e.g., name, medical record number) and medication details (drug name, dosage strength, frequency to be taken, date\/time that each medication was taken).","The first electronic translator  also includes database  which is described below with respect to .","In an alternative embodiment, there is only one electronic translator which directly converts the DEX data or MDB data into eMAR data. However, the two-step conversion process has enhanced versatility because the HL7 data may be used for many other purposes, such as for communications with other healthcare systems that may need to know about patient medication events. Also, electronic translators for converting HL7 data into eMAR data are well-known in the prior art. Thus, the software for the overall conversion process may be simplified by performing the MDB\/DEX to HL7 conversion by the first electronic translator , and then adding a conventional second electronic translator  to the output of the first electronic translator .","In one preferred embodiment, the eMAR  includes data fields for patient ID, date, schedule of prompts, and vended medications. The date field is shown in simplified form in . The actual eMAR  includes more granular date information. The schedule of prompts field stores dates\/times that a prompting signal should be sent to the patient's PMVD to prompt the patient that it is time to take medication. The vended medications field stores dates\/times that a signal is received from a PMVD  indicating that a vending event occurred. The vended medications field is also shown in simplified form in . The actual eMAR  includes more granular vended medications data, including exactly which medications were taken at the date\/time that a signal is received from a PMVD  indicating that a vending event occurred, as will be discussed in more detail below.","The patient ID field preferably includes the patient's medical record number, either as the entire field or part of the field. If the patient's medical record number is not contained within the patient ID field, another database table will need to be maintained by the host site  so that the eMAR can be properly populated.","A conventional paper-based medication administration record (MAR) functions as a recording of the medications taken by a patient, typically during the patient's stay in a health care facility. A health care professional typically signs or initials the MAR upon witnessing or administering the medication. In an eMAR, the signature or initials are electronically recorded, but the concept is the same as a paper-based MAR. These types of MARs have a field for recording \u201cdispensed medications.\u201d","In the present invention, a \u201cdispensed medications\u201d field is optional. However, the eMAR  needs to include a \u201cvended medications\u201d field. As discussed in more detail below, there are two steps involved in the medication lifecycle. The first step in the lifecycle is a dispensing step which occurs when a pharmacist or similarly qualified individual fills the PMVD  with prescribed medications. This step is conventionally referred to as \u201cmedication dispensing,\u201d wherein specific medication(s) are delivered to a patient in fulfillment of a prescription. Typically, the medications are physically handed to the patient, but in the present invention, the medications are loaded into the PMVD , thereby completing the dispensing step. The second step in the lifecycle is a vending step wherein the PMVD  releases the previously dispensed medications to the patient. In a conventional vending machine, the release of a product from a vending machine is typically referred to as a dispensing event, but in the context of the present invention, it is referred to as a vending event, because the dispensing event occurred when the PMVD  was loaded with the medications.","Referring again to a conventional eMAR, the step of administering medications to a patient is typically considered to be the dispensing event, and is the only event recorded in a conventional eMAR. That is, a conventional eMAR typically does not capture the event that occurs when a hospital pharmacy or the like releases patient medications to the health care professional for subsequent delivery to, and ingestion by, the patient. Of course, the pharmacy may capture this event for its own inventory records, and for patient billing purposes. Consider, for example, a typical hospital scenario wherein a hospital-based pill dispensing cart is filled at a hospital pharmacy, and is then moved from room to room to dispense the medications to the patients, the conventional eMAR being populated with data as the patients receive their medications.","The \u201cvended medications\u201d field in the eMAR  thus defines a different paradigm than the conventional field of an eMAR that records dispensed medications. However, the \u201cdispensed medications\u201d field of a conventional eMAR and the \u201cvended medications\u201d field of eMAR  relate to the same patient medication ingestion event (i.e., when the patient is presumed to have ingested the medications, and what medications are presumed to have been ingested). Accordingly, when the first electronic translator  receives a signal from a PMVD  that a vending event has occurred, the outputted HL7 signal corresponds with a medication ingesting event so that the \u201cvended medications\u201d field of the eMAR  can be properly populated.","The eMAR  may optionally include a \u201cdispensed medications\u201d field for recording when a pharmacy dispensed the medications and what medications were dispensed. For example, a pharmacy computer  may send data HL7 data to the second electronic translator  when a prescription is filled, or the pharmacy computer may send the data directly to the eMAR in a form that the eMAR can accept. Furthermore, the schedule of prompts stored in the eMAR may be set by the pharmacy computer based on the prescription.","The eMAR  also includes a field (not shown) that contains contact information for entities who should be contacted if a medication dose is missed, such as a physician, caregiver, or family member.","The host site  also includes a host server  (host computer ) for facilitating communications into and out of the host site .","While only one eMAR  is shown in , there may be a plurality of eMARs , each eMAR storing records for different patients. Thus, the host server  may need to determine which eMAR the incoming vending event data needs to be routed to. Alternatively, there may be a single eMAR , which, in turn, populates a replicated set of patient data at a plurality of different remotely located eMARs that store records for different patients.","In an alternative embodiment, the eMAR  is substituted by an electronic record that provides similar functionality as an eMAR, such as an electronic medication chart or electronic drug chart which may be separate from, or part of, an electronic medical record, and which can directly or indirectly (via an additional electronic translator) accept eMAR data. The eMAR  is thus one specific type of the electronic record. If the eMAR  is substituted by an electronic record, there may be a plurality of such electronic records, each electronic record storing records for different patients, in the same manner as described above with respect to the multiple eMAR  embodiment.","3. An electronic network , such as the Internet, allows for communications between the PMVDs  and the host server .","4. A plurality of caregiver computers , designated as through , that allow patient caregivers to query the e-MAR  and receive alerts if any medications are not vended in accordance with the schedule. The caregiver computer  may be any conventional computer with a browser-based user interface. The user interface is preferably accessed via a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SAS) model, so that no special software needs to be present in the caregiver computer  to allow for its use. A userid and password is associated with each patient so that the caregiver is given access only to the patient records in the eMAR that match the appropriate patient. The caregiver may be a patient's medical care provider, or the caregiver may be a family or friend. Thus, as used herein, the caregiver includes persons who are monitoring the patient, regardless of whether they are actually rendering formal medical care to the patient.","5. A plurality of pharmacy computers , designated as through , that allow pharmacists to communicate the contents of PMVDs  that they fill (dispense) with medications to the database  in the first electronic translator  of the host site . The pharmacy computer  may be any conventional computer with a browser-based user interface. The user interface is preferably accessed via a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SAS) model, so that no special software needs to be present in the pharmacy computer  to allow for its use.","PMVD ","The PMVD  may have a vending mechanism that is similar to snack food-type vending machines, except in a much smaller form factor. In one well-known type of vending machine, the goods to be vended are placed in slots or compartments formed from turns of helical coils. The goods rest on a shelf disposed parallel to the helical coil. Each of the helical coils is connected to a motor that, upon operation of the push-button panel that selects the goods, causes rotation of the helical coil about a longitudinal extension axis. This causes the goods to move forward in the turns while resting on the shelf. As the goods reach the final end of the helical coil, they are pushed beyond an end edge of the shelf and drop into a lower portion of the machine, such as a hopper where the goods can be retrieved. One example of this type of vending machine is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 8,052,010 (Borra), which is incorporated by reference herein. The helical coils can also be arranged vertically, so no shelf would be necessary. In the present invention, the goods are MUDPs which are loaded into the PMVD . FIGS. 10 and 11 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,963,201 (Willoughby et al.) shows a similar idea for dispensing MUDPs using vertically arranged helical coils. U.S. Pat. No. 7,963,201 is incorporated herein in its entirety.","In one example, the PMVD  may have three vending column or slots, one for vending a morning MUDP, one for vending a noon MUDP, and one for vending an evening MUDP. The PMVD  is preferably loaded at a pharmacist who records in a database record for the patient which MUDPs were placed in each of the compartments defined by the vending columns or slots.","The individual slots or compartments formed from turns of helical coils are not to be confused with the vending columns, which are also referred to in the vending industry as \u201cslots.\u201d To avoid confusion, the individual slots or compartments are referred to hereafter as \u201ccompartments.\u201d",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":["FIGS. 2-2","FIGS. 2-2","FIGS. 2-2"],"b":["12","12","12","12","12"]},"The compartments may be physical, as in the example of , or they may be virtual, wherein the compartments are defined by predetermined locations within a column or tray.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIGS. 2-2"],"b":["50","12","12","12"]},"Slot 1 (COL 1): 31 MUDPs, each MUDP including 1 pill of medicine A, 1 pill of medicine B, and 2 pills of medicine C.","Slot 2 (COL 2): 31 MUDPs, each MUDP including 1 pill of medicine D, 1 pill of medicine E.","Slot 3 (COL 3): 31 MUDPs, each MUDP including 1 pill of medicine A, 1 pill of medicine B, and 2 pills of medicine C.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":"12"},"When a vending event occurs, such as the vending of an MUDP from slot 1 (column 1) of the PMVD  having IP address ABCDEF, the vending event is received by the first electronic translator , which accesses database tables  and , and can determine which patient the vending event relates to, and which medicines were vended. In this example, if the vending event occurred in the morning, the medicines will be 1 pill of medicine A, 1 pill of medicine B, and 2 pills of medicine C, dispensed to patient 1234. This data may then be converted into an HL7 format, and subsequently converted into eMAR data for populating the \u201cvended medications\u201d field of eMAR  for patient 1234. In this manner, one vending event may result in the recordation of multiple medications having been vended. Thus, multiple records may be populated in the eMAR  (one record for each medicine).","Vending Events","Vending machine data is preferably communicated using a conventional vending machine data format, such as DEX data or MDB data. DEX (Data Exchange) is a format for collecting audit and event data from vending machines. MDB (multidrop bus) is an internal communication protocol to allow subparts of a vending machine to properly interface with a vending machine controller (VMC). FIGS. 9A-9C of U.S. Pat. No. 6,505,095 (Kolls) illustrate the use of a VMC with MDB and DEX, and the corresponding description of these figures explains many of the details for formatting vending machine data for external communication and use. U.S. Pat. No. 6,505,095 (Kolls) is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, DEX and MDB each have published standards that describe, in detail, how they function.","For example, Chapter 4.7 of a document entitled Data Transfer Standard EVA DTS 6.1, published by the European Vending Association in April 2008, which is part of the DEX standard, provides a DEX Data Transfer Example on page 13 that includes at least the following information:","1. The ID of the vending machine that is communicating its vending activity","2. All vending activity that occurred since the last interval data reset, by column (there are five columns in this example, designated COL1 through COL 5)","This example shows a typical DEX data transfer between a Data Carrier and Vending Machine Device. The Data Carrier is a device for collecting data from the Vending Machine Device and transmitting the data remotely.","The current standards for MDB is Version 4.0 published April 2009 by National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["12","28","70","72","74","28","28","28"]},"Regardless of which machine data format is used, the outgoing messages will include at least (1) the IP address of the PMVD , the slot\/column of the vending event, and (3) the time of vending.","HL7","As discussed above, HL7 defines a format for the transmission of health-related information. HL7 has published standards and HL7 3 is the current standard. Additional information regarding HL7 is available at http:\/\/www.hl7.org\/.","HL7 communicates via HL7 messages which are made up of a sequence of messages having segments, fields, and message types.","Admissions Message Segments include a Patient Identification Segment (PID). The PID includes one or more forms of patient ID numbers, and a patient medical record number.","Pharmacy order segments include complete information regarding medication types, dosages and dispensing schedules. While these messages are conventionally meant to be used in conjunction with pharmacy orders, not for representing vended medications, HL7 messages may be created that contain pharmacy orders, but which are used in the present system to represent vended medications.","By using HL7 messages having Admissions Message Segments and Pharmacy order segments and the data in databases  and , the first electronic translator  may create HL7 messages that fully describe which patient received vended medications and which medications were vended.","Additional Considerations",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0070"},"figref":"FIGS. 2-2","b":["12","12","12"]},"As shown in , the PMVD  preferably includes at least one electronic display screen to display text and\/or graphics, at least one speaker for delivering audio, and at least one button, keypad, or swipe card device that enables the patient to activate the PMVD  so as to initiate a vending event. The text and\/or graphics and speaker are used to prompt the patient to initiate a vending event in accordance with the schedule of prompts stored in the eMAR . In the example described above, medication must be taken three times per day, such as at 8:00 am, 12 noon, and 6:00 pm.","The PMVD  has an internal clock and at least one reliable power source, and preferably has a backup power source which can sustain functionality of the PMVD  for extended periods of time so as to ensure the continuity of care. For example, the PMVD  may receive power from a standard electrical outlet and may include an automatically rechargeable backup battery that automatically takes over power functions upon disruption of electrical power, and automatically reverts to standby mode upon resumption of power. Caregivers, pharmacies, and physicians may also be provided with the ability to remotely turn off all power to the PMVD .","As discussed above, the PMVD  may communicate with the host server  via an electronic network , such as the Internet. The communication may be wired or wireless. The wireless communication may be any conventional form of such communication, including short range wireless signals, such as Bluetooth\u00ae signals.","The PMVD  may have a conventional full keypad that may be used to enter security code (e.g., a Personal Identification Numbers (PIN)) for initiating a vending event, or there may be a simple, dedicated key, such as the \u201c#\u201d or \u201c*\u201d key that must be pressed for initiating the vending event. The keypad may also be used to input information such as patient blood pressure readings, blood glucose levels, and the like. In this manner, the PMVD  may also be used to prompt a patient to take and record their blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and other similar vital signs. This can allow a physician or other healthcare professional to diagnose conditions remotely and in real-time. The PMVD  can also be programmed to have different prompts depending on the vital sign measurement. For example, if a patient enters a glucose reading above a certain level, the PMVD  may announce, \u201cTake your diabetes medicine now,\u201d or \u201cCall your physician immediately.\u201d If the medicine is insulin, the PMVD  may also be programmed to announce, \u201cYour insulin is in refrigerator.\u201d","The PMVD  may have the ability to read identification (ID) cards or other similar devices belonging to patients and caregivers. When a patient (and possibly the caregiver) enters a PIN or swipes their user ID card, the PMVD  may ask, \u201cDo you want the 8:00 AM meds?\u201d Also, different user IDs, ID devices, and security settings may allow for different levels of functionality. For example, a caregiver's security setting may allow the user to vend missed doses. However, the patient's security setting may not allow the user to vend missed doses.","After the PMVD  receives a prompt and communicates the prompt (visually and\/or audibly), the PMVD  may also periodically communicate reminders (visually and\/or audibly) until the patient initiates a vending event. The reminders will continue for whatever preprogrammed period of time is set by the pharmacist or other authorized entity. The reminders will stop when it is determined that the patient should no longer take the missed dose. After the reminders are stopped, the patient will be locked out of initiating a vending event until the next scheduled vending event occurs. When the next vending event occurs, the patient will receive the next vended MUDP from a different vending slot in the example discussed above. The PMVD  may also be programmed to allow a physician to override the lockout so that the patient may take a missed dose past the lock out time if the physician deems that it is safe to do so.","As discussed above, a caregiver may log into the eMAR  and view the vending medications, noting any missed medications. The PMVD  and\/or the eMAR  may also electronically send medication alerts to the patient caregiver via email, SMS (text messages), or automated phone messages.","The vending example discussed above provides a PMVD  that can accept 31 MUDPs to be loaded into three vending slots to allow for three vending events per day. However, the PMVD  may have any suitable number of vending slots to accommodate more or less than three vending events per day. To increase the versatility of the PMVD , it may have five vending slots, and anywhere from one to all five of the slots may be filled for a particular patient's needs. The PMVD  may also be filled with a 32 day supply of medication. The extra day(s) would be a safeguard if a patient spills of drops their medications.","If all of the MUDPs contain the same medication, there may be more flexibility in the vending process. For example, the MUDP can be vended from any available slot that is not empty since there would be no need to associate different vending slots with different time periods.","In an alternative embodiment, the PMVD  has a waste bin that received missed doses. Thus, after the predetermined period of time in which the reminder message is stopped, the missed dose is vended into the waste bin, instead of being left in the vending region, such as the slots of the helical coils.","The PMVD  may optionally include a scanner  that can read a bar code or QR code printed on an MUDP as the MUDP is vended. This information may act as a backup to the process described above wherein the databases  and  are used to correlate a vending event to the appropriate information that is needed to populate the eMAR . Such a scanner may be required to comply with some health care regulations.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 1"],"b":["60","62","3","24","50","50","16","20","20","20"]},"Medications such as Tylenol\u00ae which are taken only when needed (i.e., PRN meds), and not taken on a regular schedule, are kept outside of PMVD . PRN meds may be packaged in blister packs so they can be easily counted, tracked and billed. Although PRN meds may be kept outside of the PMVD , the PMVD  can still play an instructing role by prompting a patient when to take a non-packaged medication. For example, the PMVD  can have an audio prompt such as, \u201cIf you are experiencing pain, you should take your Tylenol now.\u201d The pharmacy can input information into the PMVD  which shows that a PRN med can be taken every six hours. Then, the PMVD  will prompt the patient (e.g., by announcement or text message) every 6 hours.","There is preferably a \u201cdouble lock\u201d system for Controlled Dangerous Substances (CDS). For example, when it is time for a patient to take a CDS, the PMVD  will dispense an empty package labeled, \u201cYou need to take Ritalin\u00ae.\u201d The Ritalin (a CDS) is kept in a safe place outside of PMVD  so that no one is tempted to tamper with the PMVD  to gain access to a CDS.","Insurance companies do not normally pay for remote monitoring devices. For example, pharmacies are not reimbursed for blood glucose monitors which have the ability to report back to a central database. However, if the PMVD  is tied to an eMAR, it can be a very effective tool to assist doctors in inexpensively improving patient health and safety, and insurance companies may pay for this functionality. Consider the following examples:","A physician can see their patient's blood glucose readings, when the patient took insulin, and how much insulin was taken.","A psychotic patient gets arrested and misses his medications for two days. The patient's physician and caregivers are notified of the missed medications immediately after each missed dose.","In one preferred embodiment, an automated method is provided for recording contents of medication packages vended from a plurality of vending machines in an electronic record, such as an eMAR, that stores records for a plurality of patients who are associated with respective vending machines. The electronic record includes (i) a patient ID field, (ii) a vended medications field, and (iii) time of medication vending, the vending machine including (i) an IP address, (ii) a vending machine controller (VMC), (iii) one or more vending slots or columns, each slot or column holding a medication package to be vended, and (iv) a vending machine data format interface connected to an electronic network for communicating vending machine data, the vending machine's IP address, and the time of vending events. The vending machine data includes the vending slot or column that medications were vended from. In use, the method operates as follows:\n\n","In one preferred embodiment, there are a plurality of different slots or columns in the vending machine, and each slot or column contains medication packages with different medication contents.","In one preferred embodiment, the medications are vended in multi-unit dose packages (MUDPs), the contents of each MUDP being stored in the second database. A single vending event thereby causes the electronic record to record that a plurality of medications were vended.","In one preferred embodiment, the vending machine slots or columns are filled by a pharmacy during a medication dispensing process, and the pharmacy electronically populates the second database with the contents of the medication packages in each of the slots or columns of the respective vending machines.","In one preferred embodiment, the vending machine data format interface is a data exchange (DEX) interface, and the vending machine data is DEX data. In another preferred embodiment, the vending machine data format interface is a multi-drop bus (MDB) interface, and the vending machine data is MDB data.","End of Details of Implementation 1","II.

Doses have a dose time and a date. When the current time and date falls within the dosing window, as defined by the dose date and time plus a vending window beyond the dose time (currently 2 hours), then the dose is considered pending. When a dose is pending, the \u201cDispense My Meds\u201d button is displayed along with a multi-tonal audio sound. If no dose is in a pending state, then the doses are listed with their current status (dispensed, queued or --). Where \u201c--\u201d signifies that the dosing window has closed and the dose was not dispensed.","If the consumer taps the \u201cDispense My Meds\u201d button, the vending of the medication packet begins. The dose motor pairing in the vending machine is determined with the intermediate web services when the schedule POST is sent from the eMAR web service. When it's time to vend a particular dose, the vending service algorithm retrieves the dose actuator(s) paired with the particular dose and reviews the current inventory level for 1) to ensure that there is an inventory item to vend and is online, and 2), if there is more than one actuator paired, that it vends from the particular actuator that has the largest inventory level greater than zero and is online. This provides 2 benefits, 1) that upon the failure of a motor in a multiple pairing situation, that the other can act as a failover until the vending machine can be serviced and repaired. Once the particular actuator address is resolved, the vending instruction is then communicated to the Global Vending Controller (GVC) board over serial communication using a USB cable. This instruction in general is !SEL_LF where SEL represents the 3 digit selection number pertaining to the actuator address that is recognized by the GVC board.","Schedule Translation Mapping","Translating the HL7 formatted schedule information begins with parsing the message segments to extract the data and determine the consumer, and their respective schedule.

If so, the appropriate entry is made in the table indicating that the medications for that patient were vended, and thus, presumed to have been taken. The actual time of vending may be used for more granular compliance monitoring.","In IMPLEMENTATION 2, no prompts are sent to the vending machines from the Medherent web services since the vending machine has already been pre-programmed to generate its own prompts in accordance with the dose schedule. However, the table knows the time of prompts and uses this information as described above to identify a vending event for the patients being monitored in the eMAR.","Furthermore, in IMPLEMENTATION 2, no patient personalized information or medication details are communicated to Medherent web services. Thus, if the communicated information was intercepted by an unauthorized entity, the information could not be used to readily identify the patient or any of the medications that the patient has taken. Even if the unauthorized entity was able to determine the actual patient name from the Patient ID by gaining access to medical records other than the eMAR, the unauthorized entity would still not be able to determine what medications the patient has taken.","In an alternative embodiment, the vending machine communicates only the Patient ID to Medherent web services, without the scheduled dose time. In this embodiment, if the eMAR locates a record for the Patient ID, then it infers from the actual time what the scheduled dose time should be, and uses that information to complete the same process described above. For example, if the vending event is detected at 8:02 am and there is a scheduled dose time at 8:00 am, and no other scheduled dose time near 8:00 am, then it can be inferred that the scheduled dose time is 8:00 am.","In another alternative embodiment, a machine number of the vending machine or a static IP address of the tablet is sent in place of the Patient ID, and a translation table equivalent to database table  of  is used to identify the Patient ID. The process then proceeds as described in either of the embodiments above (i.e., with or without the scheduled dose time).","In addition, any unique identifier of the patient can be used in place of the patient ID used by the Medherent system. Again, a translation table would be required in this embodiment to obtain the Patient ID needed for the eMAR from the unique identifier.","The following specifications can be used for one preferred embodiment of hardware\/software components.
