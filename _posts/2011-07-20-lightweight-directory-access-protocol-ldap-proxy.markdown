{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an internet standard that provides for communication with an LDAP information directory. It runs directly over the transmission control protocol\/internet protocol (TCP\/IP) and is used to access a standalone directory or a directory service in compliance with the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) standard. Because of its standardization, the LDAP directory can be accessed across many different platforms as long as the LDAP protocol is used for communicating with the server hosting the LDAP directory.","In some implementations, these LDAP directories are configured to support heavy read accesses. For instance, LDAP directories are well suited for storing information relating to the following: contact information of employees within a company, an employee organizational chart; personal information for employees within a company; business contact information for a company, and any other information relating to individuals and organizations.","LDAP is based on a client-server model, wherein the LDAP protocol defines operations used to search and update information within the LDAP directory. For example, a client may access the LDAP directory to perform, in part, searching, creating, updating, deleting, and renaming operations.","Access to the LDAP directory is through an established connection between the client and the LDAP directory. Before any connection is made, LDAP provides for an authentication mechanism used for controlling access to the LDAP directory. During the authentication process, the client submits a distinguished name and password so that the LDAP server can determine if that client has the proper permissions for accessing the LDAP directory. If the user associated with the distinguished name does not have the proper permissions, then access to the LDAP directory is denied, and the LDAP server will not execute the requested operation. On the other hand, if the user does have the proper permissions, then the user is granted access to the LDAP directory, and the operation is executed.","The authentication process provided under LDAP is some cases may not be sufficient to protect client information. In those cases, a strong authentication method for authentication may be necessary to further control access to the LDAP directory. For instance, strong authentication may encompass a two factor or multi-factor authentication, wherein two or more security categories or methods are used to authenticate the user.","However, LDAP does not immediately support strong authentication beyond secure socket layer (SSL) which can be used preliminarily to secure communications before and during the authentication process. That is, LDAP and the LDAP server are typically configured to provide single factor authentication in which the username is matched with a static password. This is unsatisfactory in many situations where additional security over information is needed before access to information is granted.","Systems and methods of authenticating a user to an LDAP directory using an LDAP proxy are presented. In one embodiment, computer implementation of a method for authentication includes: at an LDAP proxy server, receiving a BIND request from a client, wherein the BIND request is for authenticating a user associated with a username to an LDAP server, and wherein the BIND request comprises a password comprising a first factor security code and a second factor security code; stripping the second factor security code from the password; reconfiguring the BIND request with the password that is stripped of the second factor security code; forwarding the reconfigured BIND request to the LDAP server for authentication of the username using the first factor security code; performing authentication of the second factor security code; and positively authenticating the username to the LDAP server when the first factor security code and the second factor security code are authenticated in connection with the username. In particular, the client device is configured to direct LDAP calls, such as BIND requests for authentication, to the LDAP proxy instead of directly to the LDAP server supporting the LDAP directory.","For instance, in some embodiments, a one-time password is stripped as the second factor security code from the password in the computer-implemented method. Authentication of the user is verified when the first factor security code and the second factor security code both are validated in connection with the username. After proper authentication, the user associated with the username is provided access to the LDAP server. On the other hand, the user associated with the username is not authenticated when either of the first factor security code or the second factor security code is not authenticated in connection with the username. Thereafter, after authorization, non-BIND calls associated with the username are forwarded to the LDAP server. Furthermore, responses to non-BIND calls coming from the LDAP server are forwarded to the client devices making the calls.","In some embodiments, a system includes a tangible, non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon, computer-executable instructions that, when executed causes the computer system to perform a method for authentication, comprising: receiving a BIND request from an identity manager, wherein the BIND request is for authenticating a user associated with a username to an LDAP server, and wherein the BIND request comprises a password comprising a first factor security code and a second factor security code; stripping the second factor security code from the password; reconfiguring the BIND request with the password that is stripped of the second factor security code; forwarding the reconfigured BIND request to the LDAP server for authentication of the username using the first factor security code; performing authentication of the second factor security code; and positively authenticating the username to the LDAP server when the first factor security code and the second factor security code are authenticated in connection with the username.","In particular, the identity manager provides a third party service for authenticating to the LDAP server. As such, the system provides another layer between the LDAP server and the identity manager controlling access to the LDAP directory. For instance, the computer implemented method as executed by the system strips a one-time password as the security code from the password field. In that manner, the first factor and the second factor security codes are separated. Authentication of the user is verified when the first factor security code (e.g., username and reusable password) and the second factor security code (e.g., one-time password) both are validated in connection with the username. After proper authentication, the user associated with the username is provided access to the LDAP server. On the other hand, the user associated with the username is not authenticated when either of the first factor security code or the second factor security code is not authenticated in connection with the username. Thereafter, after successful authentication non-BIND calls associated with the username are forwarded to the LDAP server. Furthermore, responses to non-BIND calls coming from the LDAP server are forwarded to the client devices making the calls.","In one embodiment, a computer system comprises a processor coupled to memory having stored therein instructions that, if executed by the computer system, cause the computer to execute a method for authentication, comprising: at an LDAP proxy server, receiving a BIND request from a client, wherein the BIND request is for authenticating a user associated with a username to an LDAP server, and wherein the BIND request comprises a password comprising a first factor security code and a second factor security code; stripping the second factor security code from the password; reconfiguring the BIND request with the password that is stripped of the second factor security code; forwarding the reconfigured BIND request to the LDAP server for authentication of the username using the first factor security code; performing authentication of the second factor security code; and positively authenticating the username to the LDAP server when the first factor security code and the second factor security code are authenticated in connection with the username.","Thus, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, authorization of a user is performed through implementation of a strong authentication proxy server that is able to parse a password field and separate out first factor and second factor security codes for purposes of performing authentication. As such, methods and systems for two factor LDAP authentication are disclosed.","These and other objects and advantages of the various embodiments of the present disclosure will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the embodiments that are illustrated in the various drawing figures.","Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

In some other embodiments, the implementation of an LDAP proxy that remotely coordinates the performance of first and second factor authentication solutions eliminates the need for incorporating a second factor authentication solution internally within the systems of a third party authentication and authorization services. Furthermore, the implementation of an LDAP proxy that remotely coordinates the performance of first and second factor authentication solutions can be quickly deployed since it is able to communicate with various third party managers operating on disparate software platforms through the common LDAP standard.","Embodiments of the present disclosure are described within the context of a data or file storage system, such as, an LDAP directory.

At a high level, the storage system organizes files into a database for storage, organization, manipulation and retrieval by one or more requesting computing systems. Providing secure access to the information stored in the LDAP directory is important for efficient implementation of management and security polices within a file system of data infrastructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["310","330","305","310","305","310","305","330","310","305","305"]},"In particular, the identity manager  is configurable to implement a multi-factor authentication solution, such as, a two factor authentication solution. Many times, the third party identity manager is initially configured to implement a first factor solution using the LDAP authentication mechanism as provided by the LDAP server supporting the LDAP directory . That is, the LDAP server is able to authenticate using a first factor authentication mechanism, such as, verifying that a username and a reusable password  are associated and present on an access list.","However, the LDAP server is unable to authenticate using any other second factor authentication solution over the LDAP authentication channel established to perform the first factor authentication solution. As such, the identity manager  is configured to support the second factor authentication solution. Because each identity manager  is built on a different software platform, each additional authentication factor solution may be internally built within the software platform performing authentication and authorization. For instance, a proprietary second factor solution must be internally integrated within the software platform of the identity manager . This may be accomplished through a second factor solution plug-in  to integrate the second factor solution that is written on one platform or language with the existing and different software platform and language of the identity manager . In particular, an on-site software engineering team will incorporate the second factor solution plug-in  into the existing software platform of the identity manager . This entails learning the specific language and calls (e.g., application programming interface [API] calls) that are implemented by the platform of the identity manager  and interfacing these with the plug-in . Successful integration within the existing software platform may take three to five months to fully incorporate the second factor solution within the platform performing authentication and authorization services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 4A","FIG. 3"],"b":["310","305","400","410","420","430","305","420","310","430","310","320","305"]},"As shown in , the two factor solution as implemented by identity manager  receives information related to the first and second factor authentication solutions separately. In particular, the reusable password, as a first factor solution, is provided separately from the one-time password, as a second factor solution.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","520","520"]},"As shown in , a third party identity manager  provides authentication and authorization services in association with a corporate Active Directory or LDAP directory or user store . For instance, the third party identity manager  uses LDAP for authentication\/authorization, and can be used to control access to protected resources like web applications, networks, or host applications. In embodiments, the multi-factor strong authentication methods are implemented through an LDAP proxy  located behind the identity manager , as will be further described below. As such, a user  wishing to access protected resources must first authenticate itself using the third party identity manager . That is, the user  establishes communication with the third party identity manager , and upon authorization by the strong authentication LDAP proxy  in association with the back-end LDAP directory , the user  is therein provided access to protected resources. In one case the user  delivers identifying information, such as, a username that identifies the user , and first and second factor security codes.","As shown in , the identity manager  provides the interface with the user , and controls access to protected resources through the implementation of the strong authentication LDAP proxy . That is, line  provides a militarized zone indicating multi-factor authentication solutions provided by the identity manager  and the strong authentication LDAP proxy must be performed before the user  is able to access protected resources. In that manner, the strong authentication LDAP proxy  acts as a gateway to protected resources, through the implementation of multi-factor authentication solutions using LDAP.","Embodiments of the present invention are able to integrate with existing third party identity manager solutions through the use of an LDAP proxy without changing the user interface of the identity manager. This seamless integration is accomplished by incorporating a two factor authentication solution within a single password field both for purposes of receiving the information at the identity manager  from user , and for delivering the information from the identity manager  to the LDAP proxy over an LDAP channel. For instance, first and second factor security codes are combined into one password field as handled by the identity manager. In that manner, the software platform for the identity manager  need not be changed in most cases, and only slightly modified in other cases. That is, the software platform is already configured with recognizing a password field in a BIND request. Although that field is intended to support one password, embodiments of the present invention are able to take advantage of the field, and incorporate the delivery of two passwords or security codes in the password field. In most cases, the password field is configured to accept lengthy passwords (e.g., 32 bytes of information) though users typically only use a small portion of the maximum length given. In that manner, two passwords are easily fitted within the password field. In those cases where the password field is not large enough, it may be modified to accept lengthier passwords, such that first and second factor security codes may fit within its given length.","In particular,  is a diagram illustrating a combined field entry for a first factor security code (e.g., reusable password) and a second factor security code (e.g., one-time password) in a two factor authentication solution that is implemented by the identity manager  of . As shown, information for the two factor authentication solution is provided by user  in two fields of a message B: a username field , and a combined password field . The combined password field  includes the first factor security code and the second factor security code. As such, in one implementation, the user  enters both first and second factor security codes in field  for use in first and second factor authentication solutions.","As shown in , the identity manager  passes the first and second factor security codes to the strong authentication LDAP proxy  over an LDAP channel. That is, the identity manager need not be reconfigured since it already is able to communicate LDAP requests, calls, and operations using LDAP. In one embodiment, the LDAP proxy  is a BIND request sniffer, and is able to determine when a request to authenticate a user is made, and to pass on relevant information to each of the validating services. For instance, the strong authentication LDAP proxy  is able to separate out the first factor security code from field  and send the first factor to the LDAP directory  for performing LDAP authentication. In addition, the LDAP proxy  is able to separate the second factor security code from field  and send the second factor security code to validation service  (e.g., a web service) for performing a second factor authentication method. In that manner, the LDAP proxy  is able to act as a gateway for providing access to the LDAP directory  to the user and\/or a client representing the user or providing access to the LDAP directory for the user. In particular, the LDAP proxy  only opens access to the LDAP directory  when both the first factor and the second factor have been authenticated and verified.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"],"b":["520","520","500","505","530"]},"As shown, the LDAP proxy  includes an interface  for communicating with a client device (such as, a third party authentication and authorization service, or user device, etc.), and for communicating with an LDAP server that supports an LDAP directory. For instance, interface  is configured to receive an LDAP compatible BIND request, from the client device, such as, an identity manager. The BIND request is used for authenticating a user to the LDAP server. In addition, the BIND request includes a password that comprises both a first factor security code and a second factor security code.","The LDAP proxy  also includes a parser  that is able to identify the BIND request from all the requests (e.g., LDAP requests, calls, and operations) from the identity manager. These requests may originate from a device associated with a user making the BIND request for access to the LDAP directly. In particular, parser  is able to strip the second factor security code from the password. That is, parser  is able to identify both the first factor security code and the second factor security code for purposes of performing strong authentication.","In addition, the LDAP proxy  includes a BIND request reformatting module . Specifically, the BIND request originally received and intended for the LDAP server is reformatted and\/or reconfigured to include the stripped password, such that the second factor security code is not included in the reformatted BIND request. In that manner, the forwarding module  is able to forward the reformatted BIND request to the LDAP proxy for authentication purposes.","The LDAP proxy  includes a second factor authentication module . In one implementation, module  performs the second factor authentication locally and internally in the proxy . In other implementations, module  delivers the second factor security code along with other identifying and relevant information (e.g., username) to a local enterprise validation service, such as, over a local area network (LAN) connection to the validation service, that performs the second factor authentication. For instance, the enterprise validation service may be a remote authentication dial in user service (RADIUS) that provides authentication and authorization management for controlling access to a network. In still another implementation, module  delivers the second factor security code along with other identifying and relevant information to another third party validation service over a communication network.","Also, the LDAP proxy  includes a user\/client authentication module  for authenticating the client to the LDAP server supporting the LDAP directory. In particular, module  authenticates the client and username of the client when both the first factor security code and the second factor security code are authenticated using their respective authentication and validation methods and services.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0072","num":"0071"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 5 and 6"],"b":["700","700","520"]},"In block , an LDAP compatible BIND request is received from a client. In one implementation, the BIND request is received from a third party authorization service providing access to the LDAP directory. The BIND request is delivered, communicated, and\/or formatted using LDAP, and is intended for purposes of performing authentication by the LDAP server supporting the LDAP directory. Specifically, the BIND request is used for authenticating a user associated with a \u201cusername\u201d to an LDAP server. Of particular import, the BIND request includes a password that is a combination of a first factor security code and a second factor security code. That is, in the message containing the BIND request, in the field or space designated for a password, the information contained therein includes both the first and second factor security codes. As such, in embodiments of the present invention, the LDAP proxy server is easily integrated with existing third party authentication software platforms, since second factor security code information is transferred using the standard BIND request that is compatible with LDAP and understood by the third party authentication and authorization system, such as, an identity manager.","In one embodiment, for purposes of integration, the third party identity manager is reconfigured to communicate with the LDAP proxy. In one implementation, the third party identity manager is reconfigured to point or redirected to the LDAP proxy instead of the LDAP server. As such, the LDAP proxy acts as a gateway between the client (e.g., identity manager and the user behind the identity manager) and the LDAP server supporting the LDAP directory. In that manner, all LDAP calls, requests, and\/or operations from the client are directed to the LDAP proxy and not the LDAP server. Further, the LDAP proxy knows the end-point addresses (e.g., internet protocol [IP] addresses) of the LDAP server and any other validation service used for performing the second factor authentication.","At block , the LDAP proxy is configured as a BIND request sniffer. That is, the BIND request used to authenticate a user, as forwarded from the client, is identifiable by the LDAP proxy from all other LDAP calls, requests, and\/or operations. Typically, these calls, request, and\/or operations are made over an LDAP channel specifically used for LDAP communication between two devices.","More particularly, the LDAP proxy is configured to strip the second factor security code from the password or information contained in the password field of the BIND request. In one embodiment, the second factor security code is a one-time password that is stripped. Specifically, the one-time password provides a password that is valid for only one transaction or communication session. Coordination between the user and the authentication service implementing the one-time password is necessary so that both have or can obtain the same one-time password for verification purposes. In other embodiments, the second factor security code may support any other authentication method or system, to include as examples, various formats (e.g., time or hashed based) of one-time passwords, digital certificates, digital keys, biometric information, etc.","At block , the originally received BIND request is now reconfigured and\/or reformatted with the password that is stripped of the second factor security code. As such, the reconfigured BIND request does not include the second factor security code (e.g., the one-time password). In that manner, the reconfigured BIND request includes a security code that is now understood by the LDAP server when performing its authentication and validation services used for validating the user behind the client. For instance, the reconfigured BIND request includes information related to performing the first factor authentication, such as, a username and a reusable password.","At block , the reconfigured BIND request is forwarded to the LDAP server for authentication of the username using the first factor security code using the standard LDAP authentication service. That is, the LDAP proxy makes a BIND request, using the reconfigured BIND request, to the corporate LDAP directory on behalf of the client. As such, the first factor security code is validated using the enterprise LDAP directory service. Using the example of a username and password as a first factor security code, the LDAP server knows permissible username\/reusable password associations and is able to perform an authentication process based on the provided first factor information to authenticate the username and corresponding user for LDAP directory access. In that manner, the original BIND request intended for authentication by the LDAP server has been intercepted by the LDAP proxy, reconfigured to include the proper security code information, and once reconfigured, forwarded to the LDAP proxy for authentication purposes.","At block , second factor authentication is performed using the second factor security code. In one implementation, the second factor authentication process is performed internally, or by a third party service. For instance, second factor authentication may be performed by a validation server, wherein the LDAP proxy makes or delivers an authentication request to the validation server over a channel using the stripped second factor security code (e.g., one-time password). In one implementation, the LDAP proxy delivers the second factor security code along with other identifying and relevant information (e.g., username) to a local enterprise validation service, such as, over a local area network (LAN) connection to the RADIUS validation service, that performs the second factor authentication. In still another implementation, LDAP proxy delivers the second factor security code along with other identifying and relevant information to another third party validation service over a communication network (e.g., internet). In that manner, the second factor authentication is performed by a web service over a cloud network.","In one embodiment, the first factor authentication process and the second factor authentication process are performed serially. In another embodiment, the first factor authentication process and the second factor authentication processes are performed in parallel.","At block , results from both authentication processes are analyzed to determine if the username corresponding to a user is authenticated for access to the LDAP directory. In particular, the username is negatively authenticated when either of the first factor security code or the second factor security code is not authenticated in connection with the username. As such, the username and corresponding user are denied access to the LDAP server.","On the other hand, the username is positively authenticated to the LDAP server when the first factor security code and the second factor security code are both authenticated in connection with the username. For instance, when both validation or authentication of the first factor security code (e.g., username and reusable password) is received from the LDAP server, and validation or authentication of the second factor security code (e.g., one-time password) is received from the validation server, then the username corresponding to a user is given authorization to access the LDAP server.","In another embodiment, the proxy server acts as a pass-through gateway for all non-BIND requests. Specifically, LDAP compatible calls, requests, and\/or operations that are not BIND requests are recognized by the LDAP proxy as coming from the now authenticated user corresponding to the username, and the LDAP proxy forwards these messages to the LDAP server for execution. In addition, all responses coming from the LDAP server and associated with those LDAP calls, requests, and\/or operations that are not BIND requests are returned to the client (e.g., identity manager), or delivered directly to the device associated with the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 8","FIGS. 5 and 6"],"b":["800","800","700","800","520","600"]},"As shown in , the LDAP client  represents a user that is trying to access a LDAP directory. Authentication of the LDAP client  is necessary and is performed through an identity manager  that provides an authentication and\/or authorization solution. In particular, the LDAP client  sends username, LDAP password, and a second factor security code in a message  to the identity manager. The LDAP password and the second factor security code in message  is provided in one field for inclusion in a BIND request, as previously described. As such, the identity manager  is configured to generate and send a BIND request to the LDAP proxy , instead of the LDAP server . This is because the password information provided in the BIND request is packaged to include both the LDAP password, as a first factor security code, and the second factor security code (e.g., one-time password). In one embodiment, the LDAP proxy  is configured using the open source LDAP (OpenLDAP) protocol and\/or stand-alone LDAP daemon (SLAPD) for server configuration, as an implementation of LDAP.","The LDAP proxy  sniffs all LDAP package data units (PDUs) and recognizes the BIND request. The LDAP proxy  is able to split the LDAP security code and the second factor security code. The BIND request , now stripped of the second factor security code, is delivered to the corporate LDAP directory or active directory service, as supported by the LDAP server , on behalf of the identity manager. An LDAP BIND response  is returned from the LDAP server  to the LDAP proxy .","Upon successful first factor validation by the LDAP server , the LDAP proxy  makes a RADUS authentication request  to a validation server . The request  includes the second factor security code that was stripped from the original BIND request. A RADIUS authorization response , positive or negative, is returned to the LDAP proxy . Upon successful second factor validation in the RADIUS response , the username corresponding to the user is validated for access to the LDAP directory.","As such, with successful first and second factor validations, the LDAP proxy  responds with a positive authorization message to the identity manager . Thereafter, the LDAP proxy  forwards all other LDAP request types (e.g., calls, requests, operations, etc.) to the corporate LDAP server. In addition, the LDAP proxy  forwards all non-BIND responses, sent from the LDAP server , to the identity manager .","Thus, according to embodiments of the present disclosure, two factor authentication systems and methods are described as implemented through an LDAP proxy server, wherein the LDAP proxy splits or separates a second factor security code form the password of a BIND request, and authenticates the first factor security code against the standard LDAP service, and validates the second factor security code using a validation service (e.g., RADIUS\/web service, etc.).","While the foregoing disclosure sets forth various embodiments using specific block diagrams, flowcharts, and examples, each block diagram component, flowchart step, operation, and\/or component described and\/or illustrated herein may be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, using a wide range of hardware, software, or firmware (or any combination thereof) configurations.
