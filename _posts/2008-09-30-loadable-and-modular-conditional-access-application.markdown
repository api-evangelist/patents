{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["This invention relates generally to conditional access systems, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for a loadable and modular conditional access application.","Streaming media content is media content that is constantly received by, and normally rendered to, an end-user while being delivered by a streaming media content provider. Providers of streaming media content, such as the MPEG (moving picture experts group) streams in television (including, but not limited to direct broadcast satellite television) or IPTV (Internet protocol television), typically protect the streaming media content to prevent copying or storing of the content and distribution of that content over channels that are not under the control of the providers. Conditional Access Systems (CAS) may be utilized to protect streaming media content.","Typically, the streaming media content is encrypted. In some streaming media content distribution systems which encrypt content utilizing a CAS, encrypted keys that may be utilized to decrypt the streaming media content, referred to as entitlement control messages (ECM), are distributed in-band with the streaming media content. In order to utilize the ECM to decrypt the streaming media content, the ECM are typically decrypted utilizing an EMM (entitlement management message) key. EMM keys may be distributed out-of-band of the streaming media content and\/or in-band with the streaming media content. ECM keys are typically set to expire in a much shorter time period than EMM keys.","In an embodiment, a CAS (Conditional Access System) device may receive streaming media content that has been encrypted utilizing a CAS. The streaming media content may include information identifying the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content. The CAS device may determine the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content by analyzing the information included in the streaming media content. The CAS device may analyze the information included in the streaming media content while parsing the streaming media content. The CAS device may load a CAS module. The CAS module may comprise a Java Card (including, but not limited to, Java Card 3.0) application. Java Card may be implemented utilizing an applet model, a servlet model, an extended applet model, or other Java Card model and the Java Card application may comprise an applet, a servlet, extended applet, or other Java Card platform application. The CAS module may be associated with the CAS. The CAS module may decrypt the received streaming media content. The CAS device may then transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to a rendering device. The CAS device may also be operable to receive unencrypted streaming media content, load a CAS module, encrypt the streaming media content associated with the CAS module, and transmit the encrypted streaming media content. The CAS device may be further operable to load a CAS module, encrypt and\/or decrypt media content stored on the CAS device, and stream the media content to the rendering device.","The CAS device may include a processing unit, a storage medium operably coupled to the processing unit, a first interface operably coupled to the processing unit, and a second interface operably coupled to the processing unit. The storage medium may be operable to store one or more CAS modules associated with one or more CAS. The first interface may be operable to receive streaming media content that has been encrypted utilizing a CAS. The processing unit may be operable to load a CAS module associated with a CAS that has been utilized to encrypt streaming media content received utilizing the first interface. The processing unit may be operable to utilize the CAS module to decrypt the streaming media content and transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to a rendering device via the second interface.","The CAS device may also be operable to receive an additional CAS module associated with an additional CAS via the first interface. The processing unit may be operable to store the additional CAS module associated with the additional CAS in the storage medium.","In an alternative embodiment, the CAS device may comprise a pluggable component operable to interface with the rendering device when the pluggable component is plugged into the rendering device.","In another alternative embodiment, the CAS device may receive streaming media content that has been encrypted utilizing a first CAS. The streaming media content may include information identifying the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content. The CAS device may determine the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content by analyzing the information included in the streaming media content. The CAS device may analyze the information included in the streaming media content while parsing the streaming media content. The CAS device may load a first CAS module. The first CAS module may be associated with the first CAS. The first CAS module may decrypt the received streaming media content. The CAS device may load a second CAS module. The CAS device may load the second CAS module base on information included in the streaming media content. The second CAS module may be associated with a second CAS. The CAS device may transmit the unencrypted streaming media content from the first CAS module to the second CAS module. Optionally, the CAS device may also transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to a rendering device. The second CAS module may encrypt the unencrypted streaming media content utilizing the second CAS. The CAS device may then transmit the encrypted streaming media content to a rendering device.","It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not necessarily restrictive of the present disclosure. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate subject matter of the disclosure. Together, the descriptions and the drawings serve to explain the principles of the disclosure.","In order to securely handle cryptographic keys, some streaming media content distribution systems which encrypt content utilizing a CAS (conditional access system) may utilize a CAS device (including, but not limited to, smart cards). The CAS device may be coupled to a rendering device. A rendering device may comprise any device for rendering the streaming media content including, but not limited to, a set-top box and\/or a set-top unit (a device that connects to a television and an external source of signal, turning the signal into content which is then displayed on the television screen), a digital computer, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a television, a home theater system, a digital media receiver, a media extender, a HDD (hard disk drive) media player, a cable converter box, and\/or a digital video recorder. EMM (entitlement management message) keys may be stored and processed within the CAS device. The EMM keys may be utilized within the CAS device to decrypt ECM (entitlement control message) keys. The decrypted ECM keys may be exported to the rendering device, where they may be utilized for a short period of time to decrypt received streaming media content.","CAS devices, however, do not conventionally handle the streaming media content itself and\/or decrypt the streaming media content within the CAS device and transmit the decrypted streaming media content to the rendering device. As such, CAS applications are conventionally implemented partially in a CAS device and partially in a rendering device. Thus, rendering devices must typically be equipped with built-in security capabilities and must typically be able to process output from a CAS device. However, CAS are typically closed systems, typically proprietary and not publicly disclosed. Most CAS are not interoperable and CAS devices and rendering devices equipped for content encrypted with one CAS may be inoperable with encrypted with another CAS. Thus, conventional CAS devices and rendering devices may be unable to receive streaming media content from more multiple providers that utilize different CAS to encrypt content or switch from a first provider that utilizes one CAS to encrypt content to another provider that utilizes another CAS to encrypt content.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","101","104","101","104","103","104","101","104","101","101","101","102","102","101","101","102","102","102","102","101","103"]},"By way of example, a rendering device  may receive streaming media content provided by a streaming media content server across the Internet. The streaming media content may have been encrypted utilizing the CAS. The rendering device may transmit the encrypted streaming media content to a CAS device  which may be coupled to the rendering device. The CAS device  may parse the encrypted streaming media content and determine based on information included in the encrypted streaming media content that the encrypted streaming media content has been encrypted utilizing the CAS. The CAS device  may load a CAS module  associated with the CAS, decrypt the streaming media content utilizing the CAS module , and transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to the rendering device. The rendering device may then render the unencrypted streaming media content. The rendering device may render the unencrypted streaming media content by displaying video of the streaming media content (such as on a television, cathode-ray tube display, liquid crystal display, high definition television, flat screen television, or other display device) and\/or by playing audio from the streaming media content (such as through one or more speakers, headsets, and\/or earphones).","The CAS module  may comprise a Java Card application (including, but not limited to, Java Card 3.0 developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and detailed at the web site java.sun.com\/javacard\/3.0\/ which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). Java Card may be implemented utilizing an applet model, a servlet model, an extended applet model, or other Java Card model and the Java Card application may comprise an applet, a servlet, an extended applet, or other Java Card platform application. Java card is a technology that allows small Java-based applications (applets) to run securely on smart cards and\/or similar small memory foot print devices. Java card is the lightest version of Java and is targeted for embedded devices. Java Card 3.0, along with advances in smart card technology, may for the first time provide the CAS device  with the processing ability to handle the streaming media content itself.","The CAS may include at least one of an analog conditional access system including, but not limited to, Eurocrypt\u2122 conditional access system, Nagravision\u2122 conditional access system, Videocypher\u2122 conditional access system, and\/or Videocrypt\u2122 conditional access system and\/or a digital conditional access system including, but not limited to, Nagravision Cardmagedon\u2122 conditional access system, Nagravision Aladin\u2122 conditional access system, Biss\u2122 conditional access system, Conax\u2122 conditional access system, Cryptoworks\u2122 conditional access system, Irdeto\u2122 conditional access system, Keyfly\u2122 conditional access system, Mediaguard\u2122 conditional access system, Videoguard\u2122 conditional access system, Powervu\u2122 conditional access system, Ras\u2122 conditional access system, Digicipher\u2122 CAS, and Viaccess\u2122 conditional access system. The CAS may utilize RAS encryption algorithm, data encryption standard (DES) encryption algorithm, 3 DES encryption algorithm, blowfish encryption algorithm, international data encryption algorithm (IDEA), software-optimized encryption algorithm (SEAL), advanced encryption standard (AES) encryption algorithm, and RC4 encryption algorithm.","The CAS device  may also be operable to receive unencrypted streaming media content, load a CAS module , encrypt the streaming media content associated with the CAS module , and transmit the encrypted streaming media content. By way of example, a user of a rendering device may utilize a CAS device , coupled to the rendering device, to protect their own streaming media content prior to distribution or storage. The CAS device  may be further operable to load a CAS module , encrypt and\/or decrypt media content stored on the CAS device , and stream the media content to the rendering device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","101","101","101","201","202","201","203","201","204","201","202","101","203","202","201","202","101","202","202"]},"The first interface  may be operable to receive streaming media content that has been encrypted utilizing a CAS. The streaming media content may include information identifying the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content. The processing unit  may determine the CAS that has been utilized to encrypt the streaming media content by analyzing the information included in the streaming media content. The processing unit  may analyze the information included in the streaming media content while parsing the streaming media content. The processing unit  may be operable to load a CAS module associated with a CAS that has been utilized to encrypt streaming media content received utilizing the first interface . The processing unit  also may be operable to utilize the CAS module to decrypt the streaming media content and transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to a rendering device via the second interface .","The CAS device  may also receive an additional CAS module associated with an additional CAS via the first interface . Like with the one or more CAS modules referred to above, the processing unit  may store the additional CAS module in the storage medium .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","101","301","101","301","101","101","301","301","101","101"]},"By way of example, the CAS device  may comprise a pluggable component that is operable to interface with the rendering device  via a USB (universal serial bus) and\/or a USB 2.0 interface. In such a case, the CAS device  may interface with the rendering device  when the CAS device  is plugged into a USB and\/or USB 2.0 port of the rendering device .","By way of another example, the CAS device  may comprise a contact smart card that is operable to interface with the rendering device  via a card acceptance device (e.g., a smart card reader). Contact smart cards may have a contact area. When inserted into a card acceptance device, the contact area may make contact with electrical connectors that can read information from the chip and write information back. In such as case, the CAS device  may interface with the rendering device  when the CAS device  is plugged into a card acceptance device of the rendering device . Alternatively, the CAS device  may comprise a separate integrated circuit device incorporated into the rendering device .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","101","104","104","101","101","101","102","102","102","101","101","102","102","102"]},"The first CAS module  may then decrypt the received streaming media content.

Java Card may be implemented utilizing an applet model, a servlet model, an extended applet model, or other Java Card model and the Java Card application may comprise an applet, a servlet, an extended applet, or other Java Card platform application. The second CAS module  may be associated with a second CAS (i.e. the second CAS module  is able to encrypt and\/or decrypt streaming media content utilizing the second CAS). The CAS device  may transmit the unencrypted streaming media content from the first CAS module  to the second CAS module . The first CAS module  and\/or the second CAS module  may include one or more APIs (application programming interfaces) for transmitting information between the modules. Optionally, the CAS device  may also transmit the unencrypted streaming media content to a rendering device . The transmission between the first CAS module  and the second CAS module  may authenticate the first CAS module  and\/or the second CAS module . As the transmission between the first CAS module  and the second CAS module  does not leave the CAS device , the transmission may be secure.","Further, the second CAS module  may encrypt the unencrypted streaming media content utilizing the second CAS. For example, the second CAS module  may be associated with the Nagravision\u2122 CAS (i.e. the CAS module  is able to encrypt and\/or decrypt streaming media content utilizing the Nagravision\u2122 CAS). The second CAS module  may then encrypt the unencrypted streaming media content utilizing the Nagravision\u2122 CAS. The CAS device  may then transmit the encrypted streaming media content to a rendering device . The rendering device  may be configured to utilize and\/or store streaming media content encrypted with the Nagravision\u2122 CAS. If the rendering device  is configured to render streaming media content encrypted with the Nagravision\u2122 CAS, utilizing the CAS device  to convert received streaming media content encrypted utilizing the Videoguard\u2122 CAS to streaming media content encrypted with the Nagravision\u2122 CAS enables the rendering device  to render the streaming media content without requiring that the streaming media content be unencrypted outside of the CAS device .","By way of another example, a rendering device, which is coupled to the CAS device , may receive streaming media content that has been encrypted utilizing the Digicipher\u2122 CAS. The Digicipher\u2122 encrypted streaming media content may include an MPEG-2 stream which may include encrypted content and encrypted keys Ks (ECMs). Keys Ka (EMMs) may have been received separately in a secure container compliant with the Digicipher\u2122 CAS or may have been included in the encrypted streaming media content. The rendering device may transmit the streaming media content to the CAS device . The CAS device  may parse the streaming media content and determine based on information included in the streaming media content that the streaming media content was encrypted utilizing the Digicipher\u2122 CAS. The CAS device  may load a first CAS module  wherein the first CAS module  is associated with the Digicipher\u2122 CAS. The first CAS module  may decrypt the received streaming media content. The CAS device  may load a second CAS module  associated with Project DReaM\u2122 (a digital rights management system). The CAS device  may load the second CAS module  based on information included in the streaming media content. The CAS device  may transmit the unencrypted streaming media content from the first CAS module  to the second CAS module .

The CAS device  may then transmit the DReaM\u2122 encrypted streaming media content to a rendering device . The rendering device may be configured to utilize and\/or store streaming media content encrypted with Project DReaM\u2122.
