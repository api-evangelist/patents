Further, this application is the National Phase application of International Application No. PCT\/KR2009\/005796, filed Oct. 9, 2009, which designates the United States and was published in English. Each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety into the present application.","Exemplary embodiments relate to a method for installing a smart card applet, and more particularly, to a system and a method for installing a smart card applet, in which the smart card applet is installed in a smart card equipped with a USIM (universal subscriber identity module) function and managed according to the request of the user through the OTA (over the air) mode employing HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) based on an SCWS (smart card web server).","Recently, with the development of communication technologies, USIM cards have been extensively used to provide 3G mobile communication services. In addition, various technologies have been suggested to install various applets in one USIM card and to manage the applets.","The applets executed in the USIM card are issued through the connect mode in which a card is inserted into a contact reader when the card is initially manufactured or through the wireless network by SMS (short message service) OTA.","In the case of the SMS OTA, the applets having a large size of 2-3 Kbytes may not be issued due to the limitation in the size of the short message (140 bytes). For this reason, the applets are mainly issued through the connect mode as the card is manufactured.","However, recently, a large scale smart card has been developed, so there are limitations in terms of time and efficiency to install various services satisfying various needs of the user in the large scale smart card when the large scale smart card is manufactured. Thus, in order to effectively use the large scale smart card, large scale applets must be issued and managed according to the needs of the user after the large scale smart card has been manufactured.","Exemplary embodiments may provide a system and a method for installing a smart card applet, in which applets can be installed and managed according to the request of the user from a remote region by calling a RAM servlet serving as a gateway between an SCWS (smart card web server) and a RAM having the actual applet installation function through the OTA (over the air) mode employing HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol).","According to one or more embodiments, there may be provided a system for installing a smart card applet, the system including: a remote server for requesting establishment of a communication channel between the remote server and a smart card by transmitting an OTA (over the air) message to the smart card and transmitting applet installation information to the smart card through the communication channel; a terminal for relaying communication between the remote server and the smart card installed in the terminal through a web browser stored in the terminal; and the smart card for transmitting a message in response to the OTA message transmitted thereto from the remote server to establish the communication channel with respect to the remote server based on HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol) and installing the applet based on the applet installation information transmitted thereto through the communication channel.","According to one or more embodiments, there may be provided a smart card including: an SCWS (smart card web server) for establishing a communication channel between a remote server and the smart card based on HTTP by transmitting a message in response to an OTA message transmitted thereto from a remote server and receiving applet installation information from the remote server through the communication channel; a RAM (remote application management) servlet for receiving identity information included in the applet installation information and identifying the remote server based on the identity information; and a RAM for receiving an applet installation code included in the applet installation information and installing the applet based on the applet installation code.","According to one or more embodiments, there may be provided a method for installing a smart card applet, the method including: requesting, by a remote server, establishment of a communication channel between the remote server and a smart card by transmitting an OTA message; establishing, by the smart card, the communication channel based on HTTP by transmitting a message in response to the OTA message; transmitting, by the remote server, applet installation information to the smart card through the communication channel; and installing, by the smart card, the applet based on the applet installation information received from the remote server through the communication channel.","According to one or more embodiments, there may be provided a method for installing a smart card applet, the method including: establishing, by a SCWS, a communication channel based on HTTP by transmitting a message in response to an OTA message received from a remote server; calling, by the SCWS, a RAM servlet when an applet installation request message is received from the remote server; identifying, by the RAM servlet, the remote server based on identity information included in the applet installation request message; transmitting, by the SCWS, an applet installation code to the RAM servlet when the applet installation code is received from the remote server after identification of the remote server has been completed; and installing, by a RAM, the applet when the applet installation code is received from the RAM servlet.","According to the system and the method for installing the smart card applet of the present invention, the applets can be installed and managed according to the request of the user from a remote region by calling the RAM servlet serving as the gateway between the SCWS (smart card web server) and the RAM having the actual applet installation function through the OTA (over the air) mode employing HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol).","Hereinafter, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},"As shown in , the system includes a remote server  transmitting an OTA message to request establishment of a communication channel with respect to a smart card  and transmitting applet installation information through the communication channel, a terminal  that relays communication between the remote server  and the smart card , and the smart card  that establishes the communication channel with respect to the remote server  through the SCWS (smart card web server) function based on the USIM (universal subscriber identity module) and installs the applet based on the applet installation information transmitted from the remote server  through the communication channel.","The remote server  transmits the OTA message using the SMS to the terminal  equipped with the smart card  to request the establishment of the communication channel. In addition, the remote server  transmits applet installation information, such as identity information and an applet installation code, to the smart card  through the established communication channel.","The terminal  transmits the OTA message to the smart card  installed in the terminal  by using the SMS. The terminal  has a gateway (not shown) for protocol conversion to relay the communication between the smart card  and the remote server . That is, the terminal  converts the connection protocol to the smart card , such as a USB (universal serial bus) protocol, into HTTP by using the gateway so that an HTTP message can be transmitted between the remote server  and the smart card  through the web browser.","The smart card  is equipped with the USIM and transmits a message in response to the OTA message transmitted from the remote server , thereby establishing a communication channel based on HTTP.","In addition, the smart card  installs the applet based on the applet installation information transmitted from the remote server  through the established communication channel. In more detail, the smart card  invokes an applet installation environment, which is mapped to a URL (uniform resource locator), based on the URL included in the applet installation information. That is, the smart card  identifies the remote server  based on identity information included in the applet installation information transmitted from the remote server  and requests the applet installation code to the remote server  after the identification has been completed to install the applet based on the applet installation code transmitted from the remote server . Meanwhile, the smart card  previously shares a code key with the remote server  and coding is performed by using the SHA-1 algorithm based on the code key and the ICCID (integrated circuit card identity) value of the card to perform the result comparison, thereby identifying the remote server .","As described above, according to the system for installing the applet in the smart card of the present invention, the applet can be issued by using the HTTP OTA based on the HTTP after the card has been manufactured, so that a large scale applet can be installed in the card within a short period of time and the applet can be easily managed.","Hereinafter, the structure of the smart card  will be described in detail with reference to .","Referring to , the smart card  includes an SCWS (smart card web server) , a RAM servlet  and a RAM (remote application management) .","The SCWS  establishes the communication channel by transmitting a message in response to the OTA message transmitted from the remote server  and transmits the message by calling the RAM servlet  based on the applet installation information transmitted from the remote server  through the communication channel. In more detail, the SCWS  receives the OTA message in the form of the short message from the remote server  and establishes the communication channel based on the HTTP. In addition, the SCWS  receives the applet installation information from the remote server . In detail, the SCWS  receives the applet installation request message based on the URL from the remote server  and calls the RAM servlet , which is mapped to the URL, to transmit identity information included in the applet installation request message to the RAM servlet . Further, the SCWS  transmits the applet installation code transmitted from the remote server  to the RAM servlet  in response to the request from the RAM servlet . Preferably, when transmitting the applet installation code to the RAM servlet , the SCWS  divides the applet installation code according to the settings of the user, which is established by taking the size of the code into consideration. The applet installation request message is transmitted from the remote server  in the form of an HTTP message. In addition, a command message defined in ETSI 102.226 and 3GPP TS 23.048, such as a USIM Toolkit command or an open platform command for remote applet management, is included in the body of the HTTP message. Based on the above, the SCWS  extracts the actual command message included in the body of the HTTP message for applet installation and transmits the actual command message to the RAM servlet . Meanwhile, the SCWS  has no function of directly calling the RAM  that actually installs the applet. Thus, the SCWS  calls the RAM servlet  serving as a gateway between the SCWS  and the RAM  based on the URL included in the applet installation request message, thereby providing the applet installation environment for the RAM .","The RAM servlet  is called by the SCWS  based on the URL and receives identity information included in the applet installation request message to identify the remote server . In detail, the smart card  previously shares a code key with the remote server  and coding is performed by using the SHA-1 algorithm based on the code key and the ICCID (integrated circuit card identity) value of the card to perform the result comparison, thereby identifying the remote server . When the identification for the remote server  has been completed, the RAM servlet  requests the SCWS  to transmit the applet installation code, so that the RAM servlet  is called again by the SCWS  to receive the applet installation code. Further, the RAM servlet  calls the RAM  and transmits the applet installation code to the RAM  such that the RAM  can install the applet.","Hereinafter, the software stack structure of the smart card  having the above configuration will be described with reference to .","In order to realize the java-based operating system, the smart card  may include a card operating system (COS), a java virtual machine, and an application programming interface (API)\/global platform. The COS provides environment for controlling and operating the hardware and communication network of the smart card . In addition, the java virtual machine and the API\/global platform provides an environment to enable the multiple installation of the java-based applets. Further, the smart card  includes an issuer security domain (ISD) to ensure security of applications installed in the smart card  and a card application toolkit (CAT) framework to support access identification of mobile communication. In addition, the smart card  supports the UICC API to check basic information of the card by accessing the file system of CAT execution environment.","The SCWS , the RAM servlet  and the RAM  are operated based on the above stack structure. That is, the SCWS  provides a servlet container to support the operating environment for the RAM servlet  corresponding to the servlet. In addition, the RAM  may install or delete the applet by using the ISD or identification function of other security domains (not shown) upon the request from the SCWS  transmitted through the RAM servlet .","As described above, the smart card  having the above structure according to the present invention can issue the applets by using the HTTP OTA through the SCWS  after the smart card  has been manufactured, so large scale applets can be installed in the card within a short period of time and the applets can be easily managed.","Hereinafter, the interface between the terminal and the smart card according to the present invention will be described with reference to .","First, a method of operating the system for installing the smart card applet according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to . For the purpose of convenience, the same reference numerals will be used to refer to the same elements throughout the drawings.","The remote server  requests the establishment of the communication channel to the smart card  by transmitting the OTA message (S). Preferably, the remote server  transmits the OTA message to the terminal  equipped with the smart card  by using the SMS to request the establishment of the communication channel.","Then, the smart card  transmits the message in response to the OTA message transmitted from the remote server  to establish the communication channel with respect to the remote server  (S and S). Preferably, the smart card  establishes the communication channel based on the HTTP.","After that, the remote server  transmits the applet installation request message to the smart card  through the established communication channel (S).
