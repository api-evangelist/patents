The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. Copyright 2006, Inceptor, Inc.","The present invention relates generally to the enhancement of Web page delivery. More specifically, the invention relates to techniques to increase visibility of Web sites, control visitor redirections, and analyze traffic. Thus, the invention has application in the field of electronic commerce.","The ability to manage and control the typical Web site has become an increasingly demanding task. This is due to the complex nature of Web sites and their use of various technologies that provide dynamic content with the aid of complex content management systems utilizing database systems. These Web sites are designed to provide the optimal experience for the human user. This is often done by using sophisticated graphics and multimedia to provide a highly visual and personalized experience for visitors. For the online marketer, all these factors provide a difficult environment for them to do their job of ensuring high visibility of their Web site, analyzing customer behavior and then acting on that behavior in a timely and responsive fashion.","From the situation described above, three primary factors for which help is required may be identified: visibility, control and analysis.","\u201cVisibility\u201d involves all the points of presence that a Web site provider has on the Internet that allow visitors to find links to the provider's Web site. This could include:\n\n","In each case a Universal Resource Locator (URL) or Web address is provided that allows visitors to click on and find a page within the provider's Web site.","Search engine visibility is extremely difficult as search engines typically use programs called \u201cspiders\u201d to visit Web sites, parse the text and then determine what terms, known as a keyphrase, best describes a provider's Web site. Such a process precludes search engines from seeing the bulk of most Web sites as they are only able to see the text on static Web pages and not the dynamic content held in databases nor the content held in graphics and multimedia. This situation leads search engines to often misrepresent or under-represent Web sites and the content they hold. To compound the problem, each search engine uses different criteria for ranking making it even more difficult to find a single page structure that appeals to them all. This also has an impact on the available number of pages that visitors doing searches could be directed to in order to find the content they are after. The visibility problem has been dealt with in the past by creating \u201cdoorway\u201d pages for both people and search engines to enter through, but while this is a refinement of the problem it does not solve the problem as a balance between what the search engines see and what people see must still be struck.","\u201cControl\u201d relates to the ability, when directing visitors to a provider's Web site, to send them to the appropriate \u201clanding point\u201d. That is, send them to the most appropriate page rather than just to the Home page of the Web site. This is often a difficult task, especially when it is desired to change the page to which to direct visitors. In some cases, this is just not possible. For example, with search engines, if a page is indexed, the URL to which visitors will be directed cannot be \u201cchanged\u201d at all. Similar cases with varying degrees of difficulty can be made for banner advertisements, affiliate links and promotional emails.","\u201cAnalysis\u201d is most important to judge the success of the Visibility and Control aspects of the process with respect to driving quality traffic to some known goal in a provider's Web site such as a sale for example. Thus, analysis in this case should provide the maximum amount of information between source and sale. While analysis of Web traffic is quite common, it is limited in its ability to easily identify the source of the traffic and also in how well integrated it is with the Visibility and Control aspects. Having determined successes and deficiencies, it is necessary to be able to easily and in real time make changes to the Visibility and Control aspects. If possible, some situations should be handled automatically. Existing solutions track traffic once it comes to a provider's site but only determine its source with a great deal of work and often requiring changes to the Web site to do so. These solutions have no integration with the Visibility and Control aspects.","In one aspect, the present invention is a method of enhancing web page delivery, comprising the steps of: receiving a request for a web page content from a requester; identifying the requestor as either a human visitor or a search engine spider; and redirecting identified human visitors to a web page in an existing web site. The system may, for identified search engine spiders, dynamically generate one or more web pages optimized for the particular search engine spiders, and return generated web pages to the identified search engine spider.","Different web pages may be dynamically generated depending upon the particular search engine spider identified as the requestor. Updateable templates are merged with user entered data or information stored in a catalog database to dynamically generate the one or more web sites. In another aspect, the present invention is an apparatus for practicing the methods described above.","In one aspect, the invention is a system (e.g., a method, an apparatus, and computer-executable process steps) for dynamically generating web pages for search engine spiders while redirecting human visitors to a web page in an existing web site.","Preferred embodiments of the system of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The system is described below in terms of both overall methodology and a physical implementation in an actual working software application, termed the \u201cInformation Exposition and Control Engine\u201d, or more briefly \u201cthe IXC Engine\u201d. The system is intended to be integrated with technology that delivers Web pages and is invoked during the initial stages of the Web page delivery process.","A. High Level Description","The IXC Engine leverages the hypertext transfer protocols to control where a requested web page is held. Accessing a Web page typically is accomplished by the following steps:\n\n","During this interaction, the Web server may perform other actions. This may include communicating to the Web browser that the desired page no longer exists at that Web site and indicating the new location for the page. This may be a permanent or a temporary relocation. In either case, the Web browser will accept this new location and send another request for the desired page and the new location. In this scenario, the steps of accessing the desired page could comprise:\n\n","The IXC Engine uses this ability to handle requests and issue relocation responses to not only control where requests are sent, but also to generate Web page contents when needed. The remainder of this section discusses how this technique furthers the enhanced Web page delivery objective of the invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12"]},"Note that search engine search results  are obtained by presenting to search engines  (via their spider programs) optimized virtual Web pages  especially tailored for each of the search engines . The optimized virtual Web pages  result in URLs that point back to IXC Engine  via a network such as the Internet.","IXC Engine  interacts (via a browser not depicted) with a customer or prospect  when the customer or prospect clicks on a link  that has been created through the IXC Engine  and then distributed across the Internet via Banners , Affiliate Links , search engine results  or E-mails . Whenever a customer or prospect  clicks on one of these links , they are redirected to the appropriate page on an actual web site .","All actions taken, whether the actions are visits by search engine spiders or redirections, are logged and reported to an Online Marketer  who configures the IXC Engine via graphical user interface . Customer or prospect  navigation through Online Marketer's Web site  can also be tracked and reported through image tags placed on each web page.","B. Lower Level Description","Below are described the primary processes of an embodiment of the invention: a main process shown in ; a perform action process as shown in ; a redirect and track process as shown in ; a select redirect process as shown in ; and an optimized dynamically generated page process as shown in . Describing these as separate processes is for ease of explanation only, and is meant by no means to be limiting. Indeed, one skilled in the art should easily envision other program structures not organized into five processes that still fall within the scope of the present invention.","Several definitions will aid in the description:\n\n","Main Process","Main process  is depicted in , and may be comprised of the following steps:\n\n","Perform Action Process","The individual steps which comprise the Perform Action Process  are illustrated in detail . In this process, the required actions are determined and performed. The steps which comprise this process are as follows:\n\n","Redirect & Track Process","In this process, the appropriate redirection and tracking actions are determined and performed.  depicts the steps in this process:\n\n","Step \u2014If redirection is required, then perform \u201cSelect Redirect\u201d process (shown in ).\n\n","It should be noted that using a redirect for an image allows Web site providers to place image markers on their Web site that will redirect to an invisible image but produce traceable logs indicating which pages each visitor visits. A cookie\/redirect image pair can be used to identify a visitor and log the visitor's path through a Web site. The visitor is identified only by the information held in the cookie that is nothing other than a unique number.","Select Redirect Process","In this process, a detailed redirection is selected.  depicts the steps of this process:\n\n","Optimized Dynamically Generated Page","In this process, optimized web pages for search engines are generated.  depicts the steps in this process.\n\n","Configuring and Reporting","To assist in operating IXC Engine , it is necessary to have a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI)  to configure the settings. For example, GUI  is employed in changing the redirect URL for simple redirects and the specifications for more complex redirections.","A reporting module operated through GUI  may report all information captured throughout the previously described processes, and access the real time state information mentioned for Active Routing. From the captured information it is possible to:\n\n","All of the information described above can be generated in simple report formats in real time to show the most up-to-date state information. Aggregation of all the data, or select portions such as groupings of traffic channels data, may be performed to provide this information on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Consequently, a detailed \u201cmedia-mix\u201d analysis can be performed to provide accurate cost benefit analysis across all traffic channels based on cost of acquisition (e.g. cost of banner advertisements) and their value (e.g. value of each sale where a sale is marked as a conversion).","A real time tracking interface is also provided to allow selective tracking and monitoring of URLs. Monitoring allows a person, such as an online marketer , to see the number of visits to a particular page and if appropriate the value of the conversion.","C. Description of a Preferred Embodiment","This section includes a description of a preferred physical embodiment of the inventive system. Each of the process steps described in the previous section are not all described again, but instead some specific examples are provided in order to demonstrate in specific terms how the invention might operate.","The Plug-In","A plug-in is required when IXC Engine  is operating on the same Web server as the web site  to which it is redirecting traffic. This plug-in is needed to differentiate which requests are coming to IXC Engine  and which should be passed onto the Web site . This is determined by the URL requested. If the URL requested is one used by IXC Engine , then it is handled by IXC Engine , otherwise it is handled by the Web server as it would have normally.","A preferred deployment is to operate IXC Engine  on a separate dedicated Web server using a subdomain of the actual web site's domain name. That is, if the domain name used by the web site was www.inceptor.com, then the domain is inceptor.com and a subdomain could be www2.inceptor.com. Different Web servers may use subdomains of the same domain and still share cookies associated with the same domain. This is important when using cookies between web servers for the purpose of identification and ongoing tracking across those web servers.","Identifying Agents and Spiders","The ability to differentiate agents and spiders and thus identify human visitors (customers or prospects ) is accomplished by examining the User-agent tag and the IP address of the HTTP request. Signature database  stores both pieces of information and accepts frequent updates to keep this data fresh. An example of an extract from signature database  is shown below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0135"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"147pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"user-agent$TV36_Mercator_n2s7_A-1.0:","AltaVista"]},{"entry":[{},"user-agent$TV36_Mercator_n2s7_B-1.0:","AltaVista"]},{"entry":[{},"ip$128.177.243.*:","AltaVista"]},{"entry":[{},"ip$128.177.244.*:","AltaVista"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"Here, an AltaVista spider is recognized by its user-agent tag holding the phrases \u201cTV36_Mercator_n2s7_A-1.0\u201d or \u201cTV36_Mercator_n2s7_B-1.0\u201d, or alternatively be recognizing it has an IP address between 128.177.243.1 and 128.177.243.255 or between 128.177.244 and 128.177.244.255. User-agent tags and IP addresses may also be identified explicitly to identify visitors as human and respond accordingly.","Associated Username and Password","It is also possible to take some traffic and assign it a username and password to allow it to access secure parts of a Web site. This occurs as part of the redirection process by providing the required user-id and password as used in a HTTP authentication process.","Generating Dynamic Pages","A key feature in the process of generating optimized dynamic pages, usually for search engine spiders, is the use of templates. Templates dictate how information is presented and thus what information is needed either from a database or from the provider of Web site  through GUI . Each template has placeholders for dynamic content placed in careful locations within an HTML (Hyperlink Text Markup Language) page. Some of the typical pieces of information required include:\n\n","When using templates to publish data from a database (the \u201chidden web\u201d), it is also important that the database fields are mapped to the template's placeholders with any additional manipulation functions being made available. To enhance this capability, IXC Engine  may leverage the versatility of the Perl programming language. Perl scripts can be used in the templates to allow the greatest flexibility in adding features and manipulating data to generate the most appropriate HTML pages for each search engine.","It should also be noted that the flexible nature of the templates and their application allows for non-HTML pages to also be generated from the data provided. This may include pages of the following format:\n\n","All pages created may also be presented to non-spider traffic. For example, a Web provider could generate a WAP version and make this available to human users browsing through their mobile phones. These can be identified by the user-agent string used by WAP-browsers.","The following is an excerpt from a template:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0152"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<HTML lang=\u201c<# system$language #>\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<HEAD>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<META HTTP-EQUIV=\u201cContent-Type\u201d CONTENT=\u201ctext\/html;"},{"entry":"charset=<# system$charset #>\u201d"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<META name=\u201cdescription\u201d content=\u201c<#"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003user$MetaDescription1 #>\u201d>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$MKW_tag #><# system$MetaRefresh #>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<TITLE><# user$Title1 #><\/TITLE>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/HEAD>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<BODY>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<center>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<H1> <# user$KeyPhrase1:capital #> <\/H1>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<H2> <# user$KeyPhrase1:permutation:capital #> <#"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003system$PageRandPunc"},{"entry":"#> <# user$KeyWordConcept1 #> <\/H2>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/center>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<p><b><# user$KeyPhrase1:capital #><\/b>:"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<i><# system$text:sentence"},{"entry":"#><\/i>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<h2><# user$KeyPhrase1:capital #> <#"},{"entry":"user$KeyWordConcept2:capital #><\/h2>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$Image1 #>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<h3><# user$KeyWordConcept3:capital #><\/h3>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$first_paragraph #>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<h2><# user$KeyWordConcept4:capital #><\/h2>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$linklist #>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$other_paragraphs #>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<# system$DomainLink #><\/BODY>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003<\/HTML>"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"A key feature of the IXC Engine  is that the templates may be updated (along with the spider signatures) automatically and remotely and that the templates drive the data requirements from both the GUI and the database perspective.","Redirection","As has been outlined in the preceding part of this application, there are multiple ways that a redirection can be determined. Before covering these in detail, the redirection process itself is covered as the same mechanism is used throughout the system.","The Redirection Process","IXC Engine  leverages the HTML standards for Server Response Codes. To explain this process, assume that the IXC Engine  controls (it may or may not generate a Web page depending on its use) the URL: http:\/\/www2.example.com\/offer.htm and redirects human users who request this page to: http:\/\/www.example.com\/bargain.htm. To perform a redirection, IXC Engine  performs the following actions (it is assumed that IXC Engine  is operating on a Web server that handles the subdomain www2.example.com):\n\n","The definition of this particular response code, in the working model, falling within the category of \u201cClient Request Redirected, further action necessary\u201d, is as follows: Moved Temporarily\u2014The requested URL has moved, but only temporarily. The Location header points to the new location. Immediately after receiving this status code, the client should use the new URL to resolve the request, but the old URL should be used for all future requests.","The temporary nature of the redirection ensures that multiple accesses from the same source of traffic will always request the original URL and not cache the redirect URL. This is important, as the IXC Engine allows for the redirect URL to be changed at any time with real time effect. As soon as this URL is changed the next person to request the original URL will be redirected to the newly entered redirect URL.","This same principle is used for all redirections. What will change is how this redirect URL is determined.","Additional information can be added to the redirection URLs which can identify the source of the redirected traffic (e.g. which search engine or which email campaign). This information then enriches the weblogs stored in the web server  rather than only having this information stored in the IXC Engine's logs. This enhances the information stored in the standard web logs used in all web servers.","Determining Redirect URLs","Given the basic principle of redirection described above, a number of mechanisms are available for determining the redirect URL. There are essentially two classes of redirect determination tasks\u2014static and active. Within each of these classes several approaches are available. Static approaches available include:\n\n","For Active Routing URLs, a list of static URLs are made available (entered by the administrator of the software). The available methods for determining which URL to use to redirect a visitor include:\n\n","To reinforce these descriptions, several examples are now provided for the scenarios described above.","Simple Example","For each URL provided by IXC Engine , a static URL is assigned. This may easily be looked up as described in Step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0080","num":"0181"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"98pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":[{},"IXC URL","Simple Redirect URL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"http:\/\/www2.example.com\/","http:\/\/www.example.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},"offer1.htm","bargain.html"]},{"entry":[{},"http:\/\/www2.example.com\/","http:\/\/www.example.com\/"]},{"entry":[{},"banner\/test01.html","prod\/may.html"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In both examples, a URL is mapped to a redirect URL.

It has two parts: the Match Path and the Redirect Specification. The Match Path matches the incoming URL that is, the IXC URL. This allows extensive use of the IXC URL as it can have additional information added to it and then incorporated into the redirect URL.
