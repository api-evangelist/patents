{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to multimedia metadata and, more particularly, to techniques for multimedia metadata security.","Digital images and video may contain embedded metadata including, for example, an owner's name, location, time of day, camera settings, and other image associated attributes. For example, some digital cameras and other devices may use the Exchangeable Image File format (EXIF) to store metadata in an image, video, or audio file. The use of such metadata is increasing with an increase in the use of digital cameras, cell phones, PDAs, and other devices. Such metadata may be useful to search for and\/or organize images or video by location, time, name, etc. However, digital images and\/or video are frequently not secured and may be shared (e.g., posted to the Internet on a social networking site or a photo sharing site.) Users may not be aware of the metadata associated with their images and\/or video and may not understand implications and potential vulnerabilities of making metadata and images or video publicly available. A malicious user could use this information to stalk someone. A criminal could search for public social networking profiles (e.g., Facebook profiles) in an area, download the images and try to figure out the times of day that a person is out of their house, etc. In addition to criminal threats, a user loses further privacy by publicly exposing not only the image but also the date, time, and name associated with the image or other media file.","Deleting such metadata may lose all of the benefits of the metadata. Making all of the metadata publicly available may create all of the vulnerabilities described above.","In view of the foregoing, it may be understood that there may be significant problems and shortcomings associated with current multimedia metadata security technologies.","Techniques for multimedia metadata security are disclosed.

The article of manufacture may comprise at least one non-transitory processor readable medium and instructions stored on the at least one medium. The instructions may be configured to be readable from the at least one medium by at least one processor and thereby cause the at least one processor to operate so as to receive an indication that multimedia metadata has been created for a multimedia file, and encrypt multimedia metadata stored in a body of the multimedia file.","In yet another particular embodiment, the techniques may be realized as a system for multimedia metadata security comprising one or more processors communicatively coupled to a network, wherein the one or more processors are configured to receive an indication that multimedia metadata has been created for a multimedia file, and encrypt multimedia metadata stored in a body of the multimedia file.","The present disclosure will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments thereof as shown in the accompanying drawings.

Networks  and  may translate to or from other protocols to one or more protocols of network devices. Although networks  and  are each depicted as one network, it should be appreciated that according to one or more embodiments, networks  and  may each comprise a plurality of interconnected networks.","Storage devices A()-(N), B()-(N), and\/or ()-(N) may be network accessible storage and may be local, remote, or a combination thereof to server A or B. Storage devices A()-(N), B()-(N), and\/or ()-(N) may utilize a redundant array of inexpensive disks (\u201cRAID\u201d), magnetic tape, disk, a storage area network (\u201cSAN\u201d), an internet small computer systems interface (\u201ciSCSI\u201d) SAN, a Fibre Channel SAN, a common Internet File System (\u201cCIFS\u201d), network attached storage (\u201cNAS\u201d), a network file system (\u201cNFS\u201d), optical based storage, or other computer accessible storage.

Servers A and B may be hosts, such as an application server, which may process data traveling between clients , , and  and a backup platform, a backup process, and\/or storage. According to some embodiments, servers A and B may be platforms used for backing up and\/or archiving data. One or more portions of data may be backed up or archived based on a backup policy and\/or an archive applied, attributes associated with the data source, space available for backup, space available at the data source, or other factors. According to some embodiments, servers A and E may be websites such as, for example, social network sites.","According to some embodiments, clients , , and\/or  may contain one or more portions of software for multimedia metadata security such as, for example, multimedia metadata security module . As illustrated, one or more portions of multimedia metadata security module  may reside at a client. One or more portions of multimedia metadata security module  may reside at a network centric location. For example, server A may be a server, a firewall, a proxy server, a gateway, a search engine, or other network element that may perform one or more actions to provide multimedia metadata security. According to some embodiments, network  may be an external network (e.g., the Internet) and server A may be a gateway, a proxy server, a search engine, and\/or a firewall between one or more internal components and clients and the external network.","According to some embodiments, multimedia metadata security module  may be implemented in several portions which may be co-located or located remote from one another. According to one or more embodiments, multimedia metadata security may be performed by a third party (e.g., a service provider and\/or a security software vendor). Results of multimedia metadata security may be provided to one or more clients.","According to some embodiments, clients , , and  may be digital cameras, smartphones, PDAs, desktop computers, laptop computers, servers, other computers, or other devices coupled via a wireless or wired connection to network . Clients , , and  may receive data from user input, a database, a file, a web service, and\/or an application programming interface. Clients , , and  may be capable of creating digital media such as images, video, and\/or audio which may contain embedded metadata. Metadata may be embedded in one or more formats such as, for example, the Exchangeable Image File format (EXIF), IPTC Information Interchange Model, and Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP). Clients , , and  may also be platforms which may edit, manage, and\/or view digital media created on one or more platforms.","As discussed above, multimedia metadata security may be implemented at one or more levels including a client level (e.g., a smartphone, digital camera, desktop, etc.), a network level (e.g., a gateway, a firewall, etc.), a server level (e.g., a social media site, a photo sharing site, a company server, etc.), a third party service provider, or a combination of levels. Multimedia metadata security may include encryption, decryption, and data rights management. For example, a digital camera or a device containing a digital camera may contain a module that may encrypt metadata embedded in an image (e.g., EXIF data) when an image is created and\/or modified. According to some embodiments, metadata may be embedded in an image or other media file in an unencrypted format and may be encrypted prior to distribution or transfer from a device (e.g., uploading of an image to a website). Digital image metadata may be encrypted with a unique key for each file. According to some embodiments, different portions of metadata may be encrypted differently. For example, a name may encrypted differently from a location or date information (e.g., different keys may be used). Some portions of metadata may not be encrypted (i.e., they may not be considered sensitive). According to some embodiments, a key, which may be used to access the digital data, may be encrypted and associated with the metadata (e.g., stored in an EXIF tag encrypted with the user's primary key).","A component providing encryption may also embed in or associate with the digital file information used to access decryption resources. For example, a URL, a network address, or other information may be provided to which a decryption request may be made. According to some embodiments, decryption requests may be made to a local resource or a resource associated with a file type (e.g., a local decryption tool or a decryption service associated with a file type).","Encryption of digital media file metadata may occur not only when an image is created but also or instead during other events. For example, network storage may encrypt metadata of a digital image upon receipt. A social networking site may encrypt metadata associated with digital media upon upload. A video or photo editing, organizing, sharing and\/or distribution tool may encrypt metadata upon saving, receipt, or transfer of an image or video (e.g., iPhoto, Photoshop, etc.). Digital media metadata security may be provided as part of a component used to import or manipulate digital media on a device or storage. According to some embodiments, digital media metadata security may be provided as a service (e.g., by a third party solution provider) and may be implemented as a security package monitoring file types at a client, a server, storage, and\/or network level. Digital media metadata security may be performed continuously (e.g., encryption at creation of a digital media file), periodically, on demand, or during other increments or events. According to some embodiments, one or more portions of metadata may be removed from a file and may be provided to a requestor based upon authentication and\/or application of one or more rules.","In addition to encryption clients , , and , servers A and B, or another platform or service may allow the creation of one or more rules, policies, access lists, groups, or other data structures governing access to digital media metadata. For example, a data rights management service may provide access to EXIF data. A data rights management service may be provided by a local component or module. According to at least one embodiment, a data rights management service may be provided as a web service. Users may sign up for the service and integrate it with their photo software, smartphone, digital camera, or other client device or application. According to some embodiments, the service may be integrated with a website such as, for example, a social media site or a photo sharing site. This component may provide different areas of functionality. It may allow a user to create access control rules for their digital media (e.g., photos) metadata. Exemplary rules and access control may include permission and\/or denial based upon an access requestor's email address. For example, a digital image owner may create a rule specifying a list of email addresses permitted to access one or more portions of digital image metadata. A data rights management service may be integrated with one or more social networks to create more complex rules. For example, integration with a social network may allow creation of or association with access lists of a social network (e.g., provide access to image metadata for people on my friends list but not to people on my co-workers list). A data rights management service may provide different levels of granularity to allow access controls to specific types of information (e.g., allow access metadata associated with time and name information, but not location information). As another example, a user may limit access to images and\/or image metadata based on content of the metadata as it is related to a requestor by one or more rules. For example, a user may associate a requestor with a work location, a home location, or a school location. A requestor associated with a location may view metadata and\/or images associated with the location. A user may also specify a time range for an event (e.g., a concert, a sporting event, or a vacation). One or more contacts of a user may be associated with those timeframes and may be able to view the corresponding metadata of images and\/or the images themselves. Another exemplary rule may create a general schedule and may permit certain requestors to view metadata of images and\/or the images themselves if the image metadata has dates and\/or locations that correspond to the permitted access. For example, a work schedule and\/or location may be specified and contacts identified as co-workers may be permitted to access metadata and\/or images that correspond to the work schedule and\/or location. Image metadata corresponding to non-work schedules and\/or locations may be visible only to another group of contacts (e.g., friends and\/or relatives).","A data rights management service may provide functionality to an encryption or securing component. For example, a data rights management service may improve the security of the sensitive data by being the sole owner of a user's primary encryption key. A data rights management service may expose a service that an encryption component may use to generate a new key for each image. As discussed above, an encryption component may use such a key to encrypt the sensitive data and the key may be encrypted with a user's primary key and stored associated with the metadata of an image file (e.g., in an EXIF tag). A data rights management service may also provide a URL, network address, or other access information for an encryption component to embed in the metadata data so that viewers of the file can initiate a decryption request.","Clients , , and , servers A and B, or another platform or service may also provide decryption functionality. Decryption functionality may include or access one or more authentication or verification services such as, for example, Open Authorization (OAuth), OpenID, a digital certificate, and email verification. According to at least one embodiment, when a decryption request is made a requestor may send an encrypted version of the key for an image (e.g., from an EXIF tag in the image). The identity of the requestor may be established (e.g., via email verification, or OAuth\/OpenID integration with a social network or internet service.) Once the identity of the requestor is established, access rules may be applied to the request. For example, an id, email address, name, of other indicia of the requestor may be cross referenced with the access control rules created by the creator of the media. If a requestor is unknown or not allowed to decrypt the data, then the call fails. If a requestor is allowed to decrypt the data, the requestor may be provided with the unencrypted form of the key to be used in decryption.","According to some embodiments, a unique name or id may be associated with each image. In these embodiments, an encrypted key may not be stored associated with the image. In these embodiments, a requestor may send the unique name or id associated with the image and, upon authentication and\/or application of one or more rules, the requestor may receive the key to decrypt the image. According to some embodiments, an requestor may send the entire image containing the encrypted metadata and upon authentication and\/or application of one or more rules, the requestor may receive the image containing the unencrypted metadata.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","200","212","200","214","217","218","220","222","224","226","228","230","232","233","234","237","238","235","290","235","239","240","242","246","212","228","247","212","230","248","212","250","252"]},"Bus  allows data communication between central processor  and system memory , which may include read-only memory (ROM) or flash memory (neither shown), and random access memory (RAM) (not shown), as previously noted.

Different levels of granularity of access controls to specific types of information may be permitted (e.g., allow access metadata associated with time and name information, but not location information). If no rules are to be implemented, the method may continue at block . If rules are to be implemented, the method may continue at block .","At block , one or more rules may be implemented. According to some embodiments, data rights management may be provided as a service and rules may be implemented at a central location. For example, a service provider may provide a web interface allowing the creation and management of one or more rules. Data rights management may be provided as a web service and may be integrated with other websites (e.g., third party social networking and\/or photo sharing sites).","At block , image metadata may be encrypted. Digital image metadata may be encrypted with a unique key for each file. According to some embodiments, different portions of metadata may be encrypted differently. For example, a name may encrypted differently from a location or date information (e.g., different keys may be used). Some portions of metadata may not be encrypted (i.e., they may not be considered sensitive). According to some embodiments, a key, which may be used to access the digital data, may be encrypted and associated with the metadata (e.g., stored in an EXIF tag encrypted with the user's primary key).","An encryption process may also embed in or associate with the digital file information used to access decryption resources. For example, a URL, a network address, or other information may be provided to which a decryption request may be made.","At block , the method may end.","Referring to , there is depicted a method  for multimedia metadata security in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. At block , the method  may begin.","At block , a request may be received to access multimedia metadata. A request may be local (e.g., from a view utility of a digital camera storing an image or from an photo application of a computer storing an image). A request may also be from a remote requestor (e.g., via a web service from a social networking or photo sharing website.)","At block , a requestor may be authenticated and\/or verified. Authentication and\/or verification services may include one or method such as, for example, Open Authorization (OAuth), OpenID, a digital certificate, and email verification.","At block , it may be determined whether a requestor has been authenticated and\/or verified. If a requestor has been authenticated and\/or verified the method may continue at block . If a requestor has not been authenticated and\/or verified, the method may end at block .","At block , it may be determined whether any rules exist and\/or apply. A requestor may be identified by an email address, an id, and\/or other verified attributes and the verified attributes of the requestor may be matched against one or more rules (e.g., an id may be mapped to an access list or an email address may be mapped to a friends list). If any rules exist and\/or apply the method may continue at block . If rules do not exist and\/or apply (e.g., an image owner permits a default level of access for image metadata to all authenticated and\/or verified requestors) the method may continue at block .","At block , the metadata permitted by the rules may be provided to the requestor. If the rules deny access to metadata no metadata will be provided.","At block , access to the data may be provided to the requestor.","At block , the method may end.","At this point it should be noted that multimedia metadata security in accordance with the present disclosure as described above typically involves the processing of input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This input data processing and output data generation may be implemented in hardware or software. For example, specific electronic components may be employed in a multimedia metadata security module or similar or related circuitry for implementing the functions associated with multimedia metadata security in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. Alternatively, one or more processors operating in accordance with instructions may implement the functions associated with multimedia metadata security in accordance with the present disclosure as described above. If such is the case, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that such instructions may be stored on one or more processor readable storage media (e.g., a magnetic disk or other storage medium), or transmitted to one or more processors via one or more signals embodied in one or more carrier waves.","The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
