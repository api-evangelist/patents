It is also responsible for ocular and periocular infections and endophthalmitis and has been implicated in periodontal and dental infections. Dental probing and treatment has lead to the dissemination of in the bloodstream, which is a recognized cause of endocarditis in relation to damaged or prosthetic heart valves. also plays a role in inflammatory acne, since antimicrobial therapy directed against results in improvement, while the development of antibiotic resistance in is associated with relapse. The common form of acne, known as acne vulgaris, affects up to 80% of the population at some time in their lives, making it the most common skin infection. There is also a strong association between severe forms of acne and joint pain, inflammation of the bone (osteitis) and arthritis. In patients suffering from this condition, known as SAPHO (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis) syndrome, isolates of have been recovered from bone biopsy samples, as well as synovial fluid and tissue.","Two distinct phenotypes of , types I and II, have been identified based on serological agglutination tests and cell-wall sugar analysis.

The initial event in acne inflammation is the disruption of follicular epithelium by this overgrowth of , allowing the bacteria in the comedo to come in contact with the host immune systems, triggering granulomatous inflammation (typical inflammatory acne). stimulates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins-1\u03b2, -8, -12, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, via toll-like receptor 2.","Acne vulgaris is one of the most common skin diseases that can result in severe inflammatory lesions that are highly associated with infection. and have been recognized as major skin bacteria that cause the formation of acne vulgaris. In addition, these bacteria have the ability to synthesize lipases that degrade sebum triglycerides into free fatty acids which trigger inflammatory responses. Treatment of acne should be started as early as possible to minimize the risk of scarring and adverse psychological effects. Many antibiotics have been used for acne treatment, but these antibiotics in general are non-specific, short lasting and normally are applied when acne lesions have already occurred (such as in late stages of acne). Development of anti-acne vaccines can prevent acne progression from the early stages and increase the specificity of treatments as described herein.","Acne vulgaris is a multi-factorial disease associated with polymicrobial infection, hormone regulation and immune responses. The inflammatory stage of acne vulgaris is usually of greatest concern to the patient. Inflammatory lesions may lead to scarring and adverse psychological effects. Vaccines, which selectively suppress the -induced inflammation, will minimize the risk of changing the homeostasis of body hormones and resident skin microbes.","Hemolysis is a virulence factor employed by numerous bacterial pathogens to degrade, invade host cells, and resist the host immune attack. This is achieved through various mechanisms targeting the cell membrane: enzymatic, pore-forming, or surfactant. When is grown on a sheep blood agar plate in close proximity to beta-hemolytic microorganisms, such as () and , it synergistically enhances hemolysis similar to the classical Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson (CAMP). CAMP reactions are induced by the combination of CAMP factor co-hemolysin, which is a pore-forming toxin, and sphingomyelinase (SMase) derived from the other bacterial partner. CAMP factor itself has only weak hemolytic activity on the erythrocytes, but pretreating the cells with SMase enhances its activity. SMase initially hydrolyzes sphingomyelin on the cell membrane of erythrocytes to ceramide, which renders the cells susceptible to the hemolytic activity of CAMP factor. The entire genomic sequence of includes numerous genes whose products are involved in degrading host molecules, and five genes encoding CAMP factor homologs of () have been found in the genome information. This comprehensive analysis of proteins by a proteomic technique utilizing isotope-coded protein labels coupled to NanoLC-MS analysis revealed that one of the CAMP factor homologs (accession number: gi\/50842175, incorporated herein by reference), showing 42% identity in nucleotide sequence to the CAMP factor, is produced at higher concentrations by bacteria cultured under anaerobic condition than under aerobic conditions. These data suggest a physiological significance for the CAMP factor for ","The CAMP factor from binds to the Fc region of IgG and IgM molecules, similar to the binding of IgG by protein A (Jurgens et al., 1987), and partial amino acid sequence similarity between the CAMP factor protein of and protein A has been demonstrated (Ruhlmann et al., 1988). Evidence is presented of differences amongst types IA, IB and II in the expression of proteins with sequence similarity to the CAMP co-haemolysin.","The disclosure demonstrates that secretes CAMP factor, which is shown to act synergistically with bacterial sphingomyelinase (SMase) to lyse erythrocytes. Furthermore, the disclosure demonstrates that recombinant CAMP factor alone induced cell death in human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and murine macrophage (RAW264.7) cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. For example, intradermal injection of mouse ears with CAMP factor induced significant ear swelling. In addition, host acid SMase (ASMase) was released\/secreted from HaCaT and RAW264.7 cells when the cells were co-cultured with -induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines was significantly neutralized by including either a selective ASMase inhibitor, anti-ASMase antibodies or anti-CAMP factor antiserum. Intradermal injection of mouse ears with live attracted numerous macrophages, which strongly express ASMase, resulting in an increase in soluble ASMase in the ear after challenge. Most notably, vaccination of ICR mice with CAMP factor yielded protective immunities against -induced inflammation and the development of skin lesions. In addition, the combination of vaccinating with CAMP factor and locally injecting anti-ASMase IgG synergistically reduced -induced ear swelling. These data demonstrate that benefits from host enzymes that amplify its pathogenicity; may utilize host ASMase to enhance the toxicity of its CAMP-factor, which may contribute to its evasion of host immune defenses, degrade host tissues, and spread the pathogen.","The complete genome sequence of is known and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The disclosure establishes a proteome of by comparing the differential expression of proteins between anaerobic and aerobic conditions (see examples and Table 1). This analysis revealed a number of genes that were upregulated. The disclosure further provides additional data on three secretory virulence factors (CAMP factor, lipase, and sialidase) associated with -induced host cell damage and inflammation.","The anti-vaccines provided by the disclosure benefit subjects suffering from polymicrobial associated diseases including acne vulgaris, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, joint, nervous system, and cranial neurosurgery infections, and implanted biomaterial contamination.","In addition to vaccine targets, three secretory virulence factors (CAMP factor, lipase, and sialidase) as well as killed-serve as candidates for development of anti-drugs.

The vaccines of the disclosure were demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The vaccines reduced inflammation caused by ","The disclosure further demonstrates that targeting secretory virulence factors is an effective strategy to decrease -induced inflammation.","The vaccines of the disclosure can be used alone or with systemic antibiotic therapy.","A \u201cpolynucleotide\u201d generally refers to any polyribonucleotide (RNA) or polydeoxyribonucleotide (DNA), which may be unmodified or modified RNA or DNA. Polynucleotides include, without limitation, single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single-stranded and double-stranded regions, single-stranded and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is a mixture of single-stranded and double-stranded regions. Polynucleotides also include hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single-stranded and double-stranded regions.

chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids other than those normally encoded by a codon.","Polypeptides include amino acid sequences modified either by natural processes, such as post-translational processing, or by chemical modification techniques that are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in the literature and are known in the art. Modifications may occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. Such modifications may be present to the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from post-translation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, biotinylation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cystine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. Examples of polypeptides useful in the methods and compositions of the disclosure comprise the polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID Nos: 2, 3, 7 and 9 and human ASMase as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 11, antigenic fragment thereof, and antigenic fragments comprising 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 7, 9 and 11. Such polypeptides and fragments thereof are useful for immunization and to raise antibodies. Antigens comprising polypeptides of the disclosure are useful for generating an immune response in a subject.","An immune response is generated to an antigen through the interaction of the antigen with the cells of the immune system. The resultant immune response may be broadly distinguished into two extreme categories, being humoral or cell mediated immune responses (traditionally characterized by antibody and cellular effector mechanisms of protection, respectively). These categories of response have been termed Th1-type responses (cell-mediated response), and Th2-type immune responses (humoral response). Extreme Th1-type immune responses may be characterized by the generation of antigen-specific, haplotype-restricted CTLs, and natural killer cell responses. In mice, Th1-type responses are often characterized by the generation of antibodies of the IgG2a subtype, while in the human these correspond to IgG1 type antibodies. Th2-type immune responses are characterized by the generation of a broad range of immunoglobulin isotypes including in mice IgG1, IgA, and IgM.","The driving force behind the development of these two types of immune responses is cytokines, a number of identified protein messengers which serve to help the cells of the immune system and steer the eventual immune response to either a Th1 or Th2 response. Thus, high levels of Th1-type cytokines tend to favor the induction of cell mediated immune responses to the given antigen, while high levels of Th2-type cytokines tend to favor the induction of humoral immune responses to the antigen. It is important to remember that the distinction of Th1 and Th2-type immune responses is not absolute. In reality, an individual will support an immune response which is described as being predominantly Th1 or predominantly Th2. Traditionally, Th1-type responses are associated with the production of the INF-\u03b3 and IL-2 cytokines by T-lymphocytes. Other cytokines often directly associated with the induction of Th1-type immune responses are not produced by T-cells, such as IL-12. In contrast, Th2-type responses are associated with the secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b2(TNF-\u03b2.","The disclosure provides antigens that are immunoprotective. Such antigens can be delivered in a number of ways to the host so as to stimulate a protective immune response against . The antigens can be delivered via an attenuated vector that results in presentation via MHC class I (e.g., such vectors include , non-virulent or another attenuated bacterial vector such as BCG, ). The term \u201cattenuated,\u201d when used with respect to a bacteria, means that the bacteria has lost some or all of its ability to proliferate and\/or cause disease or other adverse effect when the bacteria infects an organism. For example, an \u201cattenuated\u201d bacterium may be unable to replicate at all, or be limited to one or a few rounds of replication, when present in an organism in which a wild-type or other pathogenic version of the attenuated bacteria can replicate. Alternatively or additionally, an \u201cattenuated\u201d bacterium might have one or more mutations in a gene or genes that are involved in pathogenicity of the bacteria. Many genes, loci, or operons are known, mutations in which will result in an attenuated bacteria. Examples of attenuated bacteria used as live vaccines include carrying a mutation in its galE or htrA gene, and carrying mutations in its ctxA gene.","Microorganisms which are used to express the for use in immunoprotective compositions include, without limitation, sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp., sp. and (see e.g. U.S. Pat.

Such viral vectors useful in the methods and compositions of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, Vaccinia, Avipox, Adenovirus, AAV, Vaccinia virus NYVAC, Modified vaccinia strain Ankara (MVA), Semliki Forest virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and herpes viruses. Naked DNA vectors can also be used in addition to antigenic proteins alone or in combination with an adjuvant. The naked DNA can be taken up and expressed by cells of the vaccinated subject resulting in the induction of an immune reaction to the expressed polypeptide.","Examples of suitable viral vectors include herpes simplex viral vectors, vaccinia or alpha-virus vectors and retroviruses, including lentiviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. In one embodiment, these vectors are replication defective virus vectors. Gene transfer techniques using these viruses are known to those skilled in the art. Retrovirus vectors, for example, may be used to stably integrate the polynucleotide of the disclosure into the host genome, although such recombination may not be advisable. Replication-defective adenovirus vectors by contrast remain episomal and therefore allow transient expression.","In one embodiment, the adenovirus used as a live vector is a replication defective human or simian adenovirus. Typically these viruses contain an E1 deletion and may be grown on cell lines that are transformed with an E1 gene. Suitable Simian adenoviruses are, for example, viruses isolated from Chimpanzee. Examples of viruses suitable for use in the disclosure include C68 (also known as Pan 9) (U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,716, incorporated herein by reference) and Pan 5, 6 and Pan 7 (WO 03\/046124 incorporated herein by reference). Thus, these vectors can be manipulated to insert a heterologous polynucleotide coding for an antigen such that the product is expressed. The use formulation and manufacture of such recombinant adenoviral vectors is set forth in detail in WO 03\/046142, which is incorporated by reference.","The disclosure also contemplates the use of plant systems for expression of antigens of the disclosure. The plant tissue or purified polypeptide may be used for immunization. For example, agroinfiltration is a method by which transient expression of genes or production or protein is accomplished in a plant. In the method a suspension of is delivered to a plant leaf, where the transfers a desired coding sequence (e.g., a CAMP polynucleotide) to plant cells. A strain of is transformed with a polynucleotide comprising the coding sequence of interest. Subsequently the strain is grown in culture the is then injected into a plant tissue (e.g., the airspaces inside the leaf through stomata. Once inside the leaf polynucleotide is then transiently expressed. Many plants can be transformed by this method, but the most common ones are and ","In addition, the disclosure envisions immunization utilizing a combination of antigens and\/or vectors. The disclosure contemplates a homologous or heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy. The heterologous strategy may include priming with one vector, e.g. expressing one or more proteins, and boosting with another vector, e.g., adenovirus expressing the same protein or proteins, or vice versa. Boosting may also include immunizing with a protein or proteins or fragments thereof in an adjuvant. The specific examples provided herein demonstrate the delivery of the antigens to an animal host utilizing various vaccination strategies and the resulting immunoprotection against challenge.","The disclosure comprises several types of vaccines. One group of vaccines comprises an attenuated bacterial vector expressing one or more antigens. Other vaccines of the disclosure comprise antigens (e.g., polypeptide or fusion polypeptides) in a suitable adjuvant. Another group of vaccines of the disclosure comprise a viral vector (e.g., adenovirus) expressing one or more antigens.","Each vaccine is administered, e.g. transdermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intranasally, inhaled, or even orally to a mammalian host. The vaccine can be administered as part of a homologous or heterologous prime-boost strategy. Most importantly, the vaccine protects the mammalian hosts against infection with ","A \u201cvaccine\u201d as used herein refers to a composition of matter comprising a molecule that, when administered to a subject, induces an immune response. Vaccines can comprise polynucleotide molecules, polypeptide molecules, and carbohydrate molecules, as well as derivatives and combinations of each, such as glycoproteins, lipoproteins, carbohydrate-protein conjugates, fusions between two or more polypeptides or polynucleotides, and the like. A vaccine may further comprise a diluent, an adjuvant, a carrier, or combinations thereof, as would be readily understood by those in the art.","A vaccine may be comprised of separate components. As used herein, \u201cseparate components\u201d refers to a situation wherein the vaccine actually comprises two discrete vaccines to be administered separately to a subject. In that sense, a vaccine comprised of separate components may be viewed as a kit or a package comprising separate vaccine components. For example, in the context of the disclosure, a package may comprise a first immunogenic composition comprising an attenuated bacterial vector and a second antigenic composition comprising an attenuated viral vector comprising the same or different antigens (e.g., CAMP factor, a lipase, or a sialidase).","A vaccine \u201cinduces\u201d an immune response when the antigen or antigens present in the immunogenic compositions\/vaccine cause the vaccinated subject to mount an immune response to that antigen or antigens. The vaccinated subject will generate an immune response, as evidenced by activation of the immune system, which includes the production of vaccine antigen-specific T cells, vaccine antigen-specific B cells, vaccine antigen-specific antibodies, and cytokines. The resulting immune response may be measured by several methods including ELISPOT, ELISA, chromium release assays, intracellular cytokine staining, FACS analysis, and MHC tetramer staining (to identify peptide-specific cells). A skilled artisan may also use these methods to measure a primary immune response or a secondary immune response.","An \u201cantigen\u201d is a substance capable of generating an immune response in a subject exposed to the antigen. Antigens are usually polypeptides and are the focus of the host's immune response. An \u201cepitope\u201d or \u201cantigenic determinant\u201d is that part of an antigen to which T cells and antibodies specifically bind. An antigen may contain multiple epitopes. Antigens of the disclosure comprise extracellular or immunogenic polypeptides (e.g., lipase, CAMP Factor and those set forth in Table 1). In specific embodiments, the polypeptides comprises an antigenic fragment of a polypeptide comprising the sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 7 or 9 and antigenic fragments of human ASMase of SEQ ID NO:11 or fragments that have at least 80%-99% identity to an antigenic fragment of SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, 7, 9 and 11.","In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises an antigenic fragment of a CAMP factor. An antigenic fragment typically comprises at least 6 amino acid (e.g., 6-10, 10-12, 12-20, 30-50 or more amino acids). Typically the antigenic fragment is a fragment of the protein found on the surface of the protein and is comprises a soluble domain. In one embodiment, the antigenic fragment may be part of a fusion protein comprising one or more non-contiguous sequence of the protein (e.g., non-contiguous sequence of CAMP factor of ). In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises an antigenic domain of a polypeptide comprising SEQ ID NO:7. In one embodiment, the vaccine comprises a polypeptide comprising a sequence at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:7. In yet another embodiment, the vaccine comprises a polypeptide having a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:7 or a fragment thereof of at least 6 amino acids and which is capable of producing antibodies that specifically bind to a CAMP factor (e.g., a polypeptide consisting of SEQ ID NO:7).","A vaccine can include killed and disrupted . As described more fully below the killing and disruption results in the release of various antigens that may not be secreted unless cultured in an anaerobic environment. Thus, in one embodiment, the disclosure contemplates culturing under anaerobic conditions followed by killing and\/or disruption of the bacterial and preparing a vaccine from the disrupted preparation. The disrupted preparation may be further purified to enrich an antigen or antigens in the immunogenic compositions. In another embodiment, the anaerobically cultured are killed by gamma irradiation or other methods known to those of skill in the art and the whole bacterial cell used in an immunogenic preparation.","A priming vaccine used in some embodiments of the disclosure comprises a CAMP Factor, lipase or sialidase antigen. The priming vaccine comprises an antigenic epitope of a antigen, the full length antigen, a vector comprising a polynucleotide encoding the antigen and the like. In one embodiment, the priming vaccine comprises a polynucleotide encoding an antigen under control of a foreign promoter within a bacterium, plant cell or virus. The polynucleotide of the priming vaccine is present in a suitable delivery vector such as a plasmid or other vector such as a bacterial, plant cell or viral vector. The polynucleotide may be under the control of a suitable promoter such as a promoter derived from the HCMV IE gene. The priming vaccine is administered in an amount effective for priming an immune response to the antigen. As used herein, \u201cpriming\u201d of an immune response occurs when an antigen is presented to T cells or B cells. As a result, primed cells can respond to the same antigen again as memory cells in a second, subsequent immune response. Thus, priming generates both the primary immune response and establishes immunological memory. One skilled in this art appreciates that a primary immune response represents the adaptive immune response upon initial exposure to an antigen in a particular context such as in the pathogen or in a vaccine. However, it will also be appreciated that the disclosure is not limited to use of the priming vaccine in the context of immunologically naive individuals. Rather, priming may also occur in individuals who have been exposed to the antigen but who have not received the priming vaccine.","The priming immunogenic (vaccine) composition may be administered once prior to administration of the boosting immunogenic (vaccine) composition. In another embodiment, the priming vaccine may be administered several times.","The boosting vaccine used in the method of the disclosure may comprise at least one antigen (e.g., CAMP Factor, lipase or sialidase antigen polypeptide or fragment thereof) corresponding to the antigen of the priming vaccine. In addition, the boosting vaccine may comprise (in addition to the priming antigen) a different antigen or vector comprising the antigen or coding region thereof. In one embodiment, the boosting vaccine comprises a polypeptide antigen to enhance the immunogenicity of the subject to . For example in one embodiment, the boosting vaccine comprises a antigen expressed in a viral vector. The antigen can be selected from the group of antigen listed as upregulated in Table 1 including, but not limited to, CAMP Factor, lipase, sialidase antigens, fragments or combinations thereof.","The boosting vaccine is administered in an amount effective for \u201cboosting\u201d a primed immune response to the antigen. As used herein, \u201cboosting\u201d an immune response means to induce a secondary immune response in a subject that has been primed (i.e., already exposed) by an initial exposure to an antigen. A secondary immune response is characterized by the activation and expansion of specific memory T cells and B cells. Thus, boosting a specific immune response augments the primed immune response by inducing immune cells to proliferate and differentiate upon subsequent exposure to that antigen. The boosting vaccine may achieve one or more of the following effects: induces CD4+ T cells, induces anti-antibodies (e.g., antibodies to the antigen in the vaccine), boosts the activity of the CD8+ T cells primed by the priming vaccine, and induces additional CD8+ T cells not originally identified in the initially primed immune response. The boosting vaccine may also induce CD4+ T cells and induce anti-antibodies (e.g., anti-CAMP factor antibodies).","The existence of an immune response to the first dose of the immunoprotective composition may be determined by known methods (e.g., by obtaining serum from the individual before and after the initial immunization, and demonstrating a change in the individual's immune status, for example an immunoprecipitation assay, or an ELISA, or a bactericidal assay, or a Western blot, or flow cytometric assay, or the like) prior to administering a subsequent dose. The existence of an immune response to the first dose may also be assumed by waiting for a period of time after the first immunization that, based on previous experience, is a sufficient time for an immune response and\/or priming to have taken place. Boosting dosages of an immunoprotective composition can be administered as needed.","Certain vaccine adjuvants are particularly suited to the stimulation of either Th1 or Th2-type cytokine responses. Traditionally, the best indicators of the Th1:Th2 balance of the immune response after a vaccination or infection includes direct measurement of the production of Th1 or Th2 cytokines by T lymphocytes in vitro after restimulation with antigen, and\/or the measurement of the IgG1:IgG2a ratio of antigen specific antibody responses. Thus, a Th1-type adjuvant is one which stimulates isolated T-cell populations to produce high levels of Th1-type cytokines when re-stimulated with antigen in vitro, and induces antigen specific immunoglobulin responses associated with Th1-type isotype.","The disclosure further relates to antibodies for the prevention and\/or treatment of a infection. In a first embodiment, an antibody is raised against a antigen of the disclosure. Such antibodies are produced by administering an antigenic composition comprising an antigenic polypeptide (e.g., a CAMP Factor), a vector expressing an antigenic polypeptide or a purified preparation of a antigen as a vaccine.","Antibodies (such as anti-CAMP Factor or anti-ASMase antibodies) according to the disclosure will be administered in one or more dosages, and the amount needed will depend on during which phase of the disease the therapy is given as well as on other factors. In order to produce such antibodies, the antigenic composition (such as an antigenic fragment of an CAMP factor or ASMase) according to the disclosure will be administered to a subject in order to induce the production of the above described antibodies. The antibodies can be monoclonal antibodies. Once obtained, such novel antibodies may be produced by conventional techniques and used in therapy. In general, a monoclonal antibody to an epitope of an antigen can be prepared by using a technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules from continuous cell lines in culture and methods of preparing antibodies are well known to the skilled in this field (see e.g. Coligan (1991) Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley\/Greene, NY; Harlow and Lane (1989) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY; and Goding (1986) Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice (2nd ed) Academic Press, New York, N.Y.). In addition, such antibodies may be humanized using techniques known in the art. Furthermore, the antibody may include antibody fragments known in the art.","Passive immunization is the induction of immunity acquired by the transfer of antibodies from another individual (A Keller and Stiehm, 2000). There are many advantages of passive immunization. (a) Unlike active immunization (vaccines), biological effects of passive immunization are immediate and can be of value, as in cases where symptoms have already occurred. Thus, the modality using passive neutralization of CAMP factor may benefit patients who have already developed acne. (b) No cell-mediated immunity and no direct bactericidal effect that will have low impact on microbe commensalisms. (c) No adjuvant-derived side effects are induced. (d) The administered dose can be adjusted based on the severity of disease. (e) It can be easily combined with other therapies. Additionally, unlike active immunization, which requires time to induce protective immunity and depends on the host's ability to mount an immune response, passive antibody can theoretically confer protection regardless of the immune status of the host (Casadevall, 2002). The disclosure demonstrates that passive immunization targeting secretory CAMP factors instead of bacterial surface proteins can neutralize the virulence without directly killing bacteria, lowering the risk of creating drug-resistant and altering the commensalisms of ","As demonstrated herein, a synergistic effect can be seen in the treatment of a infection by immunizing with an antigenic CAMP factor peptide or polypeptide and also contacting the subject with an antibody to ASMase or an ASMase inhibitor. For example, the disclosure contemplate treating or preventing a infection using (a) a vaccine comprising a CAMP factor peptide or polypeptide, (b) an anti-ASMase antibody, (c) an ASMase inhibitor, and (d) any combination of the foregoing. Again, as used herein a CAMP factor peptide or polypeptide does not necessarily refer to the origin of the peptide or polypeptide but rather to (a) the sequence, which will have some degree of identity to the wild-type CAMP factor; and (b) the ability of an antibody developed against such a sequence to recognize","For therapeutic purposes, the antibody is formulated with conventional pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable vehicles for administration, conveniently by injection. Vehicles include deionized water, saline, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose solution, Hank's solution, and the like. Other additives may include additives to provide isotonicity, buffers, preservatives, and the like. The antibody may be administered parenterally, typically intravenously or intramuscularly, as a bolus, intermittently or in a continuous regimen.","Methods for ameliorating in a subject by administering to the subject a antigen(s) (e.g., a CAMP Factor protein, polypeptide, peptide) or a vector comprising a antigen alone or in combination with an anti-SMase (e.g., an anti-ASMase) antibody or inhibitor thereof, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, are also provided. In addition, methods for ameliorating in a subject, by administering to the subject antibodies that bind to antigens or to an ASMase, in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, are also provided.","Attenuated vaccines can be administered directly to the mammal. The immunogenic compositions and vaccines obtained using the methods of the disclosure can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions for administration in any suitable manner. One route of administration is oral. Other routes of administration include rectal, intrathecal, buccal (e.g., sublingual) inhalation, intranasal, and transdermal and the like (see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,938). Although more than one route can be used to administer a particular composition, a particular route can often provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route.","The immunoprotective compositions to be administered are provided in a pharmaceutically acceptable solution such as an aqueous solution, often a saline or buffered solution, or they can be provided in powder form. There is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure. See, e.g., Lieberman, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Vols. 1-3 (1998); Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1985) and similar publications. The compositions may also include an adjuvant. Examples of known suitable adjuvants include alum, aluminum phosphate, aluminum hydroxide, and MF59 (4.3% w\/v squalene, 0.5% w\/v Tween 80, 0.5% w\/v Span 85)\u2014these are the only ones currently licensed for use in humans. For experimental animals, one can use Freund's, N-acetyl-muramyl-L-threonyl-D-isoglutamine (thr-MDP), N-acetyl-nor-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (CGP 11637, referred to as nor-MDP), N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanine-2-(1\u2032-2\u2032-dip-almitoyl-sn-glycero-3-hydroxyphosphoryloxy)-ethylamine (CGP 19835A, referred to as MTP-PE), and RIBI, which contains three components extracted from bacteria, monophosphoryl lipid A, trehalose dimycolate and cell wall skeleton (MPL+TDM+CWS) in a 2% squalene\/Tween 80 emulsion, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The effectiveness of an adjuvant may be determined by measuring the amount of antibodies directed against the immunogenic antigen.","The concentration of immunogenic antigens of the disclosure in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely, e.g., from less than about 0.1%, usually at or at least about 2% to as much as 20% to 50% or more by weight, and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, and the like, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.","Formulations suitable for oral administration can comprise (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the recombinant bacteria or polypeptide suspended in diluents, such as buffered water, saline or PEG 400; (b) capsules, sachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as lyophilized powder, liquids, solids, granules or gelatin; (c) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (d) suitable emulsions. Tablet forms can include one or more of lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphates, corn starch, potato starch, tragacanth, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, fillers, binders, diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, dyes, disintegrating agents, and pharmaceutically compatible carriers. Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient, carriers known in the art. It is recognized that the attenuated vaccines, when administered orally, must be protected from digestion. This is typically accomplished either by complexing the vaccines with a composition to render it resistant to acidic and enzymatic hydrolysis or by packaging the vaccines in an appropriately resistant carrier such as a liposome or enteric coated capsules. Means of protecting the attenuated bacteria or antigen from digestion are well known in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions can be encapsulated, e.g., in liposomes, or in a formulation that provides for slow release of the active ingredient.","The vaccines, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations (e.g., they can be \u201cnebulized\u201d) to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like.","The dose administered to a subject, in the context of the disclosure should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic and\/or prophylactic response in the subject over time. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular vaccine employed and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or vascular surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular vaccine in a particular subject.","In determining the effective amount of the vaccine to be administered in the treatment or prophylaxis of an infection or other condition, the physician evaluates vaccine toxicities, progression of the disease, and the production of anti-vaccine antibodies, if any.","The compositions are administered to a subject that is at risk from acquiring an infection caused by or to prevent or at least partially arrest the development of the infection and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a \u201ctherapeutically effective dose\u201d or \u201ctherapeutic effective amount.\u201d Amounts effective for therapeutic use will depend on, e.g., the antigen composition, the manner of administration, the weight and general state of health of the subject, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Single or multiple doses of the antigen compositions may be administered depending on the dosage and frequency required and tolerated by the subject, and route of administration. In addition, a booster may be administered in the same or different formulation. For example, the method contemplates administration of a first composition comprising a antigen in an attenuated bacterial vector and a second composition comprising a antigen in an attenuated non-bacterial vector. The second composition may be administered simultaneously or subsequent to administration of the first immunogenic composition.","In particular embodiments, a therapeutically effective dose of the immunoprotective composition is administered to a subject. Amounts of live attenuated bacteria or non-bacteria expressing the or other antigens present in the initial immunization generally range from about 5\u00d710to 5\u00d710organisms per subject, and more commonly from about 5\u00d710to 5\u00d710organisms per subject.","The immunoprotective compositions are typically administered to an individual that is immunologically naive with respect to . Usually, 2-4 doses of an immunological composition of the disclosure may be sufficient, however additional doses may be required to achieve a high level of immunity. Additional booster doses may be given every 1-5 years, as necessary, to maintain a high level of immunity.","In general, administration to any individual should begin prior to the first sign of disease, or possibly at the first sign of possible or actual exposure to ","The vaccines of the disclosure can be packaged in packs, dispenser devices, and kits for administering vaccines to a mammal. For example, packs or dispenser devices that contain one or more unit dosage forms are provided.

For example, the label may state that the active compound within the packaging is useful for treating a particular infectious disease or for preventing or treating other diseases or conditions that are mediated by, or potentially susceptible to, a mammalian immune response.","The following specific examples are meant to be illustrative and non-limiting. Those of skill in the art will recognize various modification and substitutions that can be made in the compositions and methods that follow. Such modification and substitutions do not depart from the disclosure and are encompassed herein.","The disclosure indicates that injection of (ATCC 6919; 10CFU) into ICR mouse ears induced an increase in the ear thickness () and gramulomatous response (, B). One day after injection, was surrounded by a densely packed granulomatous infiltrate (). immigrated to hair follicles and aggregated in the sebaceous glands two days after injection ( D, E). Although ears injected with (ATCC 12228; 10CFU) had a minor swelling, this swelling can be rapidly subsided within four days. Thus, the disclosure provides a model for measurement and testing of agents that effect . For example, the mouse ear model of the disclosure can be used to test the cytotoxicities of virulence factors of . Additionally, the model is useful for evaluating the anti-inflammatory effects of vaccines.","When is grown on a sheep blood agar plate in close proximity to beta-hemolytic microorganisms, such as () and , it synergistically enhances hemolysis similar to the classical Christie, Atkins, Munch-Peterson (CAMP). CAMP reactions are induced by the combination of CAMP factor co-hemolysin, which is a pore-forming toxin, and sphingomyelinase (SMase) derived from the other bacterial partner. CAMP factor itself has only weak hemolytic activity on the erythrocytes, but pretreating the cells with SMase enhances its activity. The entire genomic sequence of includes numerous genes whose products are involved in degrading host molecules, and five genes encoding CAMP factor homologs of () have been found in the genome information. This analysis of proteins by a proteomic technique utilizing isotope-coded protein labels coupled to NanoLC-MS analysis revealed that one of the CAMP factor homologs (accession number: gi\/50842175, incorporated herein by reference), showing 42% identity in nucleotide sequence to the CAMP factor, is produced at higher concentrations by bacteria cultured under anaerobic condition than under aerobic conditions. These data suggest a physiological significance for the CAMP factor for ","SMases have been widely isolated and characterized from bacteria, yeast, and various tissues and biological fluids of mammalians. In spite of low identity between bacterial and mammalian SMases, the amino acid sequences share a number of conserved residues, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. The disclosure demonstrates that benefits from a host SMase that amplifies its CAMP factor-mediated pathogenicity. The disclosure show a host SMase in CAMP factor-mediated pathogenicity of both in vitro and in vivo, and the synergistic potential of a vaccine treatment targeting CAMP factor and local injection with IgG against a host SMase in -associated inflammatory acne vulgaris.","A tissue chamber model was used to detect pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial growth. The tissue chamber model was first described and extensively characterized in the guinea pig and then adapted to the mouse. This model accurately mimics bacterial infections in vivo. Because bacteria are inoculated directly into the chamber, with no adherence and invasion step through epithelia, the minimal infective dose of which is required for a persistent infection reflects virulence. The host response is mediated exclusively by phagocytes and comprises antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, and apoptosis. A tissue chamber model was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of anti-vaccines. A tissue chamber () was subcutaneously implanted into abdominal skin of ICR mice for 7 days.","After implantation of tissue chambers, (20 \u03bcl; 10CFU) or PBS (50 \u03bcl) were injected into tissue chambers. Three days after bacterial injection, tissue chamber fluids were harvested for detection of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-2. Compared with PBS-injected mice, the level of MIP-2 was significantly increased by three and two folds in - and -mice, respectively (). In vivo survival (colonies) of can be detected on MHB agar plates after spreading the tissue chamber fluids on plates ().","In humans multiplies in anaerobic environment where sebum accumulate in clogged follicles. It has been demonstrated that the level of lipase production was increased markedly by in the absence of oxygen. In an effort to identify the virulence factors which were highly expressed under anaerobic conditions, a comprehensive quantitative proteome analysis was performed on in the presence or absence of oxygen. Identified virulence factors were selected as vaccine candidates. Changes in the abundances of individual protein species in O-grown as compared to no-O-grown were analyzed using a nongel-based isotope-coded protein label (ICPL) method. 342 proteins were identified and sequenced by LTQ MS\/MS. 152 of 342 proteins were successfully labeled with ICPL. 23 proteins were identified as up- or down-regulated under anaerobic or aerobic conditions (Table 1). Two secretory virulence factors (CAMP factor and lipase) were highly expressed under anaerobic conditions ( and B). Two internal peptides (SYSEKHLGVAFR (SEQ ID NO:1) and DLLKAAFDLR (SEQ ID NO:2)) of lipase and CAMP factor were presented, respectively ( and D). Although it is well known that lipase is involved in the pathogenesis of acne lesions, the role of CAMP factor in acne development is totally unknown. More recently, it was reported that CAMP factor of behaved as a pore-forming toxin. Thus CAMP factor was selected as a target for the development of vaccines.","Treatment of sialidase increases the susceptibility of human sebocytes to . A variety of sialidases have been uncovered in the genome of . Three sialidases were selected from genome for cloning, including a cell wall-anchored sialidase (accession # gi|50843035; (SEQ ID NO:12 and 13, polynucleotide and polypeptide, respectively), a secreted sialidase B (accession# gi|50842171; SEQ ID NO:14 and 15, polynucleotide and polypeptide, respectively) and a sialidase-like protein (accession# gi|50843043; SEQ ID NO:16 and 17, polynucleotide and polypeptide, respectively). The cell wall-anchored sialidase (accession # gi|50843035) exhibits the strongest enzyme activity in removing the sialic acids from the surface of human SZ95 sebocytes. In addition, the selected sialidase is a surface protein that potentially serves as an excellent target for vaccine development. Thus, this protein was selected to investigate immunogenicity. The cell wall-anchored sialidase contains an LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motif in the C-terminal domain. Although it is known that sialidase of shares identities (\u02dc30%) with sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18) (accession#Q02834) of and a cell wall surface anchor family protein (accession# Q04M99) of serotype 2, the immunogenicity of sialidase of was unexplored.","A gene encoding sialidase was PCR amplified from template DNA prepared from . Specific primers including the sense and anti-sense primer were designed. The PCR products were inserted into a pEcoli-Nterm 6\u00d7HN plasmid and expressed in BL21 (DE3)]. After IPTG induction, over-expressed sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein from was detected in a Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gel at approximately 53.1 kDa molecular weight. The sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein was purified using a TALON resin column. The sialidase expression was confirmed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation\u2014Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF MS) as well as NanoLC-MS\/MS sequencing. Purified sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein was in-gel digested with trypsin prior to NanoLC-MS\/MS analysis. Nineteen internal peptides derived from sialidase were fully sequenced by NanoLC-MS\/MS analysis via an HCTultra PTM system ion trap mass spectrometer. The MS\/MS spectra of sequenced peptides matched well with those of sialidase (accession # gi|50843035) of . An internal peptide (VVELSDGTLMLNSR; 316-329 amino acid residue of SEQ ID NO:13) of sialidase was present. These results indicate that sialidase was expressed in BL21 (DE3) and suggest that mass spectrometry provided a powerful modality to confirm the expression of a protein that has no antibody available for western blot.","To determine the enzyme activity, purified sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein (10 \u03bcg\/ml) was added to human SZ95 sebocyte culture for 2 h to remove the sialic acids on the surface of sebocytes. The amount of surface sialic acids was determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) using the reaction of biotinylated Maackia Amurensis lectin I and streptavidin-FITC conjugate. The fluorescence of MAA labeled-sailic acids in sialidase-treated sebocytes was dramatically decreased by 63% (), whereas the fluorescence in GFP-treated sebocytes was unchanged (). The data indicated that purified sialidase retained an enzyme activity. After treatment with sialidase (10 \u03bcg\/ml) for 2 h, sebocytes (10cells) were exposed to live (10CUF) overnight. Live induced an approximately 15\u02dc20% of cell death in untreated or GFP-treated sebocytes. However, the -induced cell death in sialidase-treated sebocytes was significantly increased by 35% (), demonstrating that the treatment of sialidase increases the susceptibility of sebocytes to . It has been demonstrated that incubation of human buccal epithelial cells with the sialidase significantly increased adherence. The adherence of into sialidase-treated sebocytes was examined. The results showed that pre-treatment with sialidase (10 \u03bcg\/ml for 2 h), but not GFP, considerably increased the adherence of into sebocytes (). Accustain Gram stains indicated that the number of interacted with sebocytes was increased once surface sialic acids of sebocytes were removed by sialidase (). Therefore inhibiting the activity of sialidase or neutralizing sialidase by antibodies, siRNA, small molecules inhibitors the bind the active site, antisense and the like can be useful in providing protection against infection. Antisense molecules can be generated based upon the polynucleotide sequences provided herein.","The intact particle of has been used as a vector for intranasal and epicutaneous vaccination. To engineer vector-based vaccines targeting an anthrax spore coat associated protein (SCAP), a gene encoded SCAP was constructed into the pET15b vector (EMD Biosciences, Inc.). After IPTG induction, carrying either an empty expression vector or SCAP expression plasmid were killed by UV irradiation. For immunization, the UV-irradiated vector-based vaccine, not mixed with exogenous adjuvants, was then directly administered into the nasal cavity of mice. Sera harvested from each group (n=4) of mice three weeks after immunization was pooled. The production of anti-SCAP IgG was detected by an antigen array. The antigen microarray was created by spotting with recombinant SCAP, maltose binding protein (MBP)-tagged SCAP, and mouse IgG (positive controls). The sera from mice immunized with an empty expression vector and an vector with SCAP over-expression were hybridized on arrays. While the negative control yielded only background signals, the positive control (IgG) generated a dilution-dependent signal reduction. The experiment showed that anti-SCAP antibody was produced after immunization with vector-based vaccine (BL21 (DE3) T7\/lacO SCAP) by comparing to control serum. More importantly, the anti-SCAP antibody can be produced without boosting.","A gene encoded SCAP was also constructed into the pCAL-n-FLAG vector () followed by transformation into the BL21 strain which served as the antigen carrier. For safety concerns, transformed was destructed by gamma irradiation. ICR mice were immunized via intranasal administration with irradiated vectors encoding SCAP. Antibody production was measured via western blot by reaction with serum obtained from one month post-immunized mice. Mice were able to produce detectable levels of antibody to SCAP without any boost. Pretreatment of a nonionic surfactant (tetradecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside; TDM) (Antatrace Inc., Maumee, Ohio) on the skin surface of ICR mice at a concentration of 0.125% (in sterile water) for 15 min slightly disrupts the stratum corneum barrier but greatly enhances the epicutaneous immunization of based-tetanus toxin C fragment vaccine (BL21 nir\/B tetC). Pretreatment of TDM (0.125%) on the skin surface of ICR mice for 15 min, followed by washing and then the epicutaneous application of irradiated vectoring SCAP, these mice can produce an antibody response to SCAP. Antibody production was measured via western blot by reaction with serum obtained from one month post-immunized mice. Mice were able to produce detectable levels of antibody to SCAP without any boost. These results demonstrate that SCAP is an immunogenic anthrax protein when mice were non-invasively immunized with vector-based vaccines. The results demonstrated that TDM can disrupt the stratum corneum barrier of the skin which significantly potentiates skin immunity. The disclosure thus provides an immunization protocol to immunize with CAMP factor and sialidase.","A UV-irradiated vector-based vaccine [BL21 (DE3) T7\/lacO Sialidase] was used to test the immunogenicity of sialidase (accession # gi|50843035). A dose of UV (4,500 J\/m) was given to irradiate all , both expressing (a Sialidase-vector) and not expressing Sialidase genes (a LacZ-empty vector), as demonstrated by the inability to form colonies on LB agar plates. The amount of sialidase in vectors was not changed after UV-irradiation. ICR mice were intranasally immunized with UV-irradiated BL21 (DE3) T7\/lacO Sialidase and boosted 3 weeks after the first nasal inoculation. The production of antibody (IgG) in mouse sera was detected 3 and 6 weeks after immunization by western blot. A strong band appearing at approximately 53.1 kDa was visualized when a sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein transferred membrane was reacted with mouse serum harvested 6 weeks after immunization. No sialidase-reacted antibody production was found in LacZ-empty vector-immunized mice. ICR mice were also immunized with sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein or GFP using Freund\/(in)complete adjuvants. The antibody production was detected by western blot analysis three weeks after immunization. A strong band appearing at 53.1 kDa was visualized when the sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein was reacted with serum from sialidase-immunized mice. The antibody production was also confirmed by antigen microarray. An antigen microarray was created by printing with sialidase-6\u00d7NH fusion protein and mouse IgG (a positive control). After hybridization with mouse sera, fluorescent signals displayed in antigen microarrays indicated sialidase antibody production. The sialidase antibody was detectable in the serum harvested from mice three week after immunization. No sialidase-reacted antibody production was found in GFP-immunized mice. Data from both antigen microarray and western blot confirmed that sialidase was an immunogenic protein.","Protective Immunity of Sialidase-Based Vaccines to -Induced Inflammation.","ICR mice immunized with recombinant proteins (sialidase or GFP) using Freund\/(in)complete adjuvants () were challenged with live (10CFU). Three weeks after vaccination, one ear of mouse was subcutaneously injected with 25 \u03bcl of (10CFU) and the other ear was injected with 25 \u03bcl of PBS as a control. Injection of induced ear thickness and redness. Ear thickness was measured every day for 9 days. Ear thickness in GFP-immunized mice was rapidly elevated by more than two folds one day after challenge. The elevation of ear thickness was significantly reduced by more than 50% when mice were immunized with sialidase (). The ear redness in GFP-immunized mice was subsided 7 days after challenge, whereas the recovery of ear redness in sialidase-immunized mice was occurred 3 days after challenge. These results indicated that sialidase-immunized mice suppressed -induced ear inflammation. The production of -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines were also measured after vaccination. A tissue chamber model () was employed to detect the level of in vivo pro-inflammatory cytokines. A tissue chamber was subcutaneously implanted into abdominal skin of ICR mice 7 days before (10CFU) injection. The data indicated that tissue chamber fluid contains various immune cells including macrophages (CD11b, neutrophils (Gr-1), NK cells (CD49b) and T cells (CD3), suggesting an influx of immune cells into a tissue chamber. Three days after injection, tissue chamber fluids containing pro-inflammatory cytokines were drawn by pecutaneous aspiration. The level of MIP-2 cytokine in immunized mice was measured by ELISA. In the GFP-immunized mice, a significant increase in MIP-2 level was observed 3 days after injection. Importantly, the -induced increase of MIP-2 cytokine was reduced by 61% in the sialidase-immunized mice. These results demonstrate that sialidase-based vaccines effectively decrease ear thickness and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mice.","Pretreatment of with serum from sialidase-immunized mice significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of to human sebocytes (). The culture of sebocytes with anti-GFP serum-treated causes an approximately 30% of cell death, whereas the cell death of sebocytes was decreased to nearly 5% when cells were co-cultured with anti-sialidase serum-treated . The results indicated that sialidase-immunized mice provoked antibodies that can effectively neutralize the cytotoxicity of to human sebocytes.","The CAMP factor was up-regulated in under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. Thus, whether CAMP factor exerts a toxic effect on skin cells was examined. Keratinocytes have been known to be one of the primary targets of during acne lesions. Therefore, whether CAMP factor exerts a detrimental effect on keratinocytes in the ears of ICR mice was tested. Purified recombinant CAMP factor was obtained by using the same protocol used to clone and purify sialidase. The PCR products of CAMP factor were inserted into a pEcoli-Nterm 6\u00d7HN plasmid and expressed in BL21 (DE3 CAMP factor)]. After IPTG induction, the expression of CAMP factor-6\u00d7NH fusion protein was detected in a Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gel at approximately 36 kDa molecular weight (, lanes 1 and 2). The CAMP factor-6\u00d7NH fusion protein was purified using a TALON resin column and confirmed by NanoLC-MS\/MS sequencing. Sixteen internal peptides derived from CAMP factor were fully sequenced by NanoLC-MS\/MS analysis via an HCTultra PTM system ion trap mass spectrometer. The MS\/MS spectra of sequenced peptides matched well with those of CAMP factor (accession # gi|50842175) of . An internal peptide (AVLLTANPASTAK (SEQ ID NO:3); 147-159 amino acid of SEQ ID NO:11) of CAMP factor was presented (). Purified CAMP factor and GFP (1 \u03bcg\/\u03bcl) were subcutaneously injected into the ears of ICR mice. After one-day injection, apoptotic cells were examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Injection of recombinant CAMP factor did not induce detectable ear thickness. No apoptotic cells were detected from mice injected with GFP. Apoptotic cells are only detectable in the CAMP factor-injected mice, suggesting that CAMP factor is a toxic protein. During TUNEL assay, tissue sections of CAMP factor-injected ears were double-stained with a differentiated keratinocyte marker K10. The localization of apoptotic cells in keratinocytes suggested that CAMP factor is harmful to skin keratinocytes. To test the immunogenicity of CAMP factor, mice were immunized with a UV-irradiated vector-based vaccine [BL21 (DE3) T7\/lacO CAMP factor]. A dose of UV (4,500 J\/m) was given to irradiate all , both expressing (a CAMP factor-vector) and not expressing CAMP factor genes (a LacZ-empty vector). ICR mice were intranasally immunized with UV-irradiated BL21 (DE3) T7\/lacO CAMP factor. The anti-CAMP factor antibody (IgG) in mouse sera was detectable 3 weeks after immunization. The result suggested that anti-CAMP factor antibody can be produced without boosting if mice were immunized with an irradiated -vector-based vaccine [BL21 (DE3 CAMP factor)]. No CAMP factor-reacted antibody production was found in the LacZ-empty vector-immunized mice. The anti-CAMP factor antibody can be also produced when mice were immunized with recombinant proteins\/(in)complete adjuvants. ICR mice were immunized with CAMP factor-6\u00d7NH fusion protein or GFP using Freund\/(in)complete adjuvants following the protocols as described above. The anti-CAMP factor antibody was detectable in the CAMP factor-, but not GFP-immunized mice. These results indicated that CAMP factor is immunogenic when mice were immunized with -vector based vaccines or recombinant proteins\/(in)complete adjuvants. However, it is worthwhile to note that mice cannot produce anti-CAMP factor antibody if they were immunized with whole organism ","Protective immunity in heat-killed -immunized mice. The heat-killed was used as an inactivated anti-vaccines. After inactivating at 65\u00b0 C. for 30 min, inactivated was spread on LB agar plates. The inability to form colonies indicated that the inactivation of was completed. For immunization, heat-killed (10CFU; 50 \u03bcl) was intranasally inoculated into ICR mice for three times (first inoculation, a first boost at third week, and a second boost at the sixth week). Mice inoculated with 50 \u03bcl PBS serve as controls. The antibody production was detected by western blot ten weeks after immunization. For detection of protective immunity, ears of ICR mice immunized with heat-killed were subcutaneously challenged with live (10CFU). Ear thickness was measured for three days. The challenge of to PBS-inoculated mice induced a 1.8-fold increase in ear thickness. Importantly, the increase of -induced ear thickness was decreased by 40% in the killed--immunized mice. Similarly, the -induced ear redness was significantly suppressed in killed--immunized mice, suggesting that mice immunized with killed-produced a protective immunity to infection. The change in the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines was determined after immunization. A tissue chamber was subcutaneously implanted into abdominal skin of ICR mice for 7 days, and then (10CFU) was injected into the implanted tissue chamber. The level of MIP-2 cytokine in tissue chamber fluid was measured by ELISA three days after injection. In the PBS-inoculated mice, a significant increase in MIP-2 level was observed 3 days after injection. The increase of MIP-2 cytokine was reduced by more than 50% when mice were immunized with killed-","The methods next examined if the antibodies against sialidase and CAMP factor can be produced in killed -immunized mice. 50 \u03bcg of purified recombinant sialidase, CAMP factor as well as lysates of were subjected to a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PDVF membrane. The membrane was incubated overnight with mouse serum obtained from killed -immunized mice. Many proteins with molecular weights greater than 50 kDa reacted positively to serum obtained from the killed -immunized mice. However, neither sialidase nor CAMP factor reacted to the serum, indicating that neither sialidase nor CAMP factor is not immunogenic if mice were immunized with whole organism ","Overall, the data indicated that sialidase and CAMP factor are immunogenic when mice were immunized with -vector-based vaccines or recombinant proteins\/(in)complete Freund adjuvants. Mice immunized with killed produced antibodies against several proteins (>50 kDa), but not sialidase and CAMP factor. Mice immunized with a sialidase-based vaccine or killed produced a significant protection against live challenge.","Bacteria Culture.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0121"},"i":["P. acnes ","Brucella ","Clostridium ","S. aureus "]},"Molecular Cloning and Expression of Recombinant Camp Factor.","A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product encoding a putative protein (29-267 amino acid residues) of CAMP factor (accession number: gi\/50842175) was generated using gene-specific primers designed based on the complete genome sequence of .

These data suggest the involvements of CAMP factor and ASMase in -induced cytotoxicity.","Possible Involvement of Host ASMase in Pathogenicity In Vivo.","To examine involvement of host ASMase in pathogenicity in vivo, the ears of ICR mice were injected intradermally with or PBS, excised 24 hr after bacterial challenge, and used for the following experiments. First, the mouse ears were homogenized and the homogenate supernatant was subjected to Western blot using anti-ASMase IgG (). A single band was detected at the expected molecular weight for ASMase (\u02dc60 kDa). injection increased the amount of ASMase in the ear relative to PBS injection. To examine the localization of ASMase in the mouse ear, frozen sections were co-stained with anti-mouse CD11b IgG, a conventional macrophage marker, followed by goat anti-ASMase IgG (). This double immunofluorescent staining revealed infiltration of macrophages into the site of administration 24 hr after bacterial challenge; no CD11b+ macrophages were observed in PBS-injected control ears. ASMase was highly expressed in the infiltrating CD11b+ macrophages. Transmission electron microscopy showed colonizing and\/or phagocytosed in macrophage-like cells and in the extracellular space 24 hr after bacterial challenge (); no bacteria was observed in PBS injected ears. In addition, ruptured cell membranes were observed in the -injected ear, whereas the cell membranes of the PBS-injected ear appeared intact. These data suggest that intradermal challenge induces the infiltration of macrophages, which highly express ASMase. In addition, -induced ear swelling was significantly relieved when mice were systemically pretreated with desipramine 30 min before the bacterial challenge (), suggesting the involvement of host ASMase in -induced inflammation and the development of skin lesions.","The effect of combining CAMP factor vaccination with local injection of anti-ASMase IgG on -induced inflammation ICR mice were vaccinated with CAMP factor or GFP control. or PBS was injected intradermally into the ears of vaccinated mice. Thirty min after challenge, the left ear (received ) was locally injected with goat anti-ASMase IgG or normal goat control IgG, while the right ear was injected with an equal volume of PBS. Both the combination of GFP vaccination with local injection of anti-ASMase IgG and CAMP factor vaccination with local injection of normal IgG reduced -induced ear swelling to 202.8% and 193.5% 24 hr after bacterial challenge, respectively, in comparison with GFP vaccination combined with normal IgG injection (224.5%). By contrast, the combination of CAMP factor vaccination with local injection with anti-ASMase IgG synergistically decreased -induced ear swelling to 153.7% (). These data indicate that suppression of both of bacterial CAMP factor and host ASMase synergistically reduced -induced inflammation and skin lesions.","To determine antibody titers to CAMP factor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), purified CAMP factor (5 \u03bcg\/ml) was diluted with a coating buffer (0.015 M Na2CO2, 0.35 M NaHCOand 0.05% NaN), and coated onto a 96-well ELISA plate (Corning, Lowell, Mass.) at 4\u00b0 C. overnight. The plates were washed with PBS containing 0.1% (w\/v) Tween-20, and blocked with PBS containing 1% (w\/v) BSA and 0.1% (w\/v) Tween-20 for 2 hr at room temperature. Antisera (10,000 dilutions) obtained from mice vaccinated with over-expressing CAMP factor or GFP were added to the wells and incubated for 2 hr. Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate (Promega, Madison, Wis.) (1:5,000 dilution) was added, incubated for 2 hr, and then washed. HRP activity was determined with a OptEIA\u2122 Reagent Set (BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif.). The OD of each well was measured at 450 nm.","Therapeutic Effects of Vaccination with CAMP Factor on -Induced Inflammation.","Live (1\u00d710CFU\/20 ul) in PBS were intradermally injected in the central portion of the left ear. Twenty \u03bcl of PBS was injected into the right ear of the same mouse as a control. To examine in vivo therapeutic effects of vaccination, ICR mice were vaccinated with over-expressing CAMP factor or GFP 24 hr after bacterial challenge as described above. The ear thickness was measured using a micro caliper for 98 days and a -induced increase in ear thickness reported as % of ear thickness in PBS-injected ears.","Co-cytotoxic activity of CAMP factor and bacterial SMase. The human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, or murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, was cultured in DMEM or RPMI1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, at 37\u00b0 C. under atmosphere of 5% (v\/v) CO2 in air. For determination of co-cytotoxic activity of SMase and CAMP factor, cells (1\u00d710\/well) were preincubated in a 96-well plate at with SMase from (350 mU\/ml, Sigma) or an equal amount of PBS (vehicle control) in serum-free medium containing 10 mM MgClfor 15 min. After the pretreatment, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with CAMP factor (25 \u03bcg\/ml) or GFP as a control in 1% serum-medium for 18 hr. As a positive control for 100% cytotoxicity, triton-X was added to get a final concentration of 0.1% (v\/v) for cell lysis. After the incubation, cell viability was determined as described in Experimental procedures and cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of cell death caused by triton-X.","The hemolytic power is thought to be a virulence factor for numerous microbial pathogens to degrade tissue, invade host cells, disseminate themselves, and escape from the host immune attack. Microbial hemolysins generally possess the capacity to lyse erythrocytes in vitro, but many are toxic to other cell types as well. secretes CAMP factor as an exotoxin (). Although the hemolytic action of CAMP factor has been demonstrated on erythrocytes and artificial plasma membranes, little attention has been paid to the cytotoxicity of CAMP factor on other cell types. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of CAMP factor on host cells was examined, and its physiologic significance to the pathogenicity of , which is relevant to inflammatory acne vulgaris.","The human keratinocyte is one of the major targets of . In addition, intradermal injection of mouse ears with live induces infiltration of numerous CD11b+ macrophages ( and C). The tissue chamber model data integrated with a dermis-based cell-trapped system was used to mimic the in vivo microenvironment of acne lesions, injection of live into the intradermally-implanted tissue chamber attracts Gr-1+ neutrophils and CD11b+ macrophages into the chamber. Thus, the interaction between murine macrophage and is investigated in our model of -induced inflammation in mice. Therefore, the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, and the murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, were employed to determine cytotoxic activity of CAMP factor from in vitro. The data indicate that CAMP factor is an important virulence factor for to degrade host cells ().","Evidences obtained from a number of in vitro experiments suggest only weak hemolytic activities of CAMP factor co-hemolysin itself without SMases. CAMP factor does not have significant homology to any other pore-forming toxins. Only the full-length recombinant CAMP factor has been found to exert co-hemolytic activity on a sheep blood agar plate, but the structure-function relationship remains unclear. Lang and co-authors indicate that GBS CAMP factor binds to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the cell membrane of erythrocytes, which act as cell surface receptors for this toxin, and that the interaction supports its ability to form oligomeric pores in sheep erythrocyte membranes. Amount of GPI-anchored proteins is augmented by the reduction of sphingolipid levels on the cell membrane. Since GPI-anchored proteins are found ubiquitously in mammalian cells, the same mechanism may be involved in the cytotoxic reaction of CAMP factor on keratinocytes and macrophages. Indeed, the removal of sphingomyelin on the cell membrane by pretreating with bacterial SMase increased the cell susceptibility to CAMP factor ().","Several different forms of mammalian SMases have been identified, including endosomal\/lysosomal ASMase (a soluble enzyme), which is ubiquitous in mammalian tissues, and plasma membrane-associated, or cytosolic, neutral SMase, which is located mostly in the central nervous system. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of sphingomyelin on the cell membrane to ceramide in the same catalytic mechanism as bacterial SMases. The released ceramide, in turn, can act as a cellular signal for various activities, including apoptosis, differentiation, and proliferation. The activity of the SMases are regulated by a wide range of extracellular signaling; growth factors, cytokines, neurotransmitters, hormones, and stresses, such as ultraviolet and reactive oxygen species. Ubiquitously-expressed ASMase exerts important functions during the innate immune response to infectious pathogens. Therefore, focus was put on the interaction of host ASMase and bacterial CAMP factor as related to pathogenicity of . ASMase was released and\/or secreted from the host cells when the cells were co-cultured with (). The cytotoxicity of was neutralized in the presence of mouse anti-CAMP factor antiserum in vitro (). In addition, adding the specific ASMase inhibitor, desipramine, to co-cultured cells and significantly reduced the cytotoxicity. The data from the in vitro experiments suggest that CAMP factor is a potential virulence factor for and involvement of host ASMase in the virulence of ","There have been only a few studies showing that CAMP factor is a potential virulence of pathogen in vivo. A high dose of partially purified CAMP factor from GBS was lethal to rabbits and mice when injected intravenously. Mice that had been infected with sublethal doses of GBS developed fetal septicemia after receiving repeated injections with purified CAMP factor. The disclosure demonstrates that intradermal injection of the mouse ears with recombinant CAMP factor induced ear swelling, indicating that CAMP factor is involved in -induced inflammation and skin lesion in vivo.","To examine whether host ASMase is involved in pathogenicity and -induced inflammation, the ears of ICR mice were injected intradermally with according to a rat ear model previously described. The amount of soluble ASMase increased in the ear after injection with (). The profile of the granulomatous inflammation in the mouse ear model ( and C) is similar to that of inflammatory acne in the human hair follicle; numerous were observed inside phagosomes of an infiltrating macrophage in an inflammatory acne lesion in the hair follicle. resists killing by phagocytes and is able to survive in macrophages. GBS beta-hemolysin\/cytolysin, a pore-forming exotoxin, was demonstrated to contribute to the subversion of phagocytic host immune defenses. During the intracellular life cycle of , a pore-forming toxin named listeriolysin O is largely responsible for mediating rupture of the phagosomal membrane to allow its escape from the phagosome into the host cytosol, its replicative niche. Lysosomal ASMase is known to contribute to macrophage killing of bacteria in the early stage of phagocytosis, and is required for the proper fusion of late phagosomes with lysosomes, which is crucial for efficient transfer of lysosomal antibacterial hydrolases into phagosomes. Taken together, phagocytosed in the macrophage may take advantage of the host lysosomal ASMase to enhance the toxicity of CAMP factor to escape from phagosomes, an interaction which may be involved in the resistance against phagocytosis. Indeed, we observed a number of macrophages in the -ear, many of which had cell membrane that were ruptured by colonizing (). Infection by or triggered an early surge in the extracellular secretion and\/or release of ASMase activity from macrophages. may shrewdly utilize released and\/or secreted ASMase from macrophages to invade or to escape cells to spread cell-to-cell.","An effective vaccines for -associated inflammation as an alternative treatment for acne consist of killed-whole organism and a cell wall-anchored sialidase. Thus, the potential of CAMP factor as a target of acne vaccine development was examined. CAMP factor was highly immunogenic when vaccination was performed by an -based vaccine delivery system ( and E). The vaccination with CAMP factor elicited protective immunities to -induced inflammation. In addition, a local injection mouse ear with anti-ASMase IgG reduced -induced inflammation. The combination of CAMP factor vaccination with a local injection of anti-ASMase IgG synergistically reduced -induced ear swelling (). The data suggests the synergistic interaction of CAMP factor and host ASMase in vivo.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0170","num":"0169"},"i":"P. acnes "},"Lysosomal ASMase in macrophages play important roles during the innate immune response to infectious pathogens; the enzyme contributes to macrophage mediated killing of pathogens and lysosomal fusion with phagosomes. However, may hijack ASMase released and\/or secreted from host cells to enhance its CAMP factor-delivered pathogenicity. The synergism may contribute to its evasion of host immune defenses, degrade host tissues and spread the pathogen cell-to-cell. Recent studies have afforded abundant evidences showing that is involved not only in acne vulgaris, but also in many diseases, including endocarditis, endophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, joint, nervous system, cranial neurosurgery infections, and implanted biomaterial contamination. Treatment targeting CAMP factors and host ASMase may have a potential to be widely applied for these -associated diseases to suppress the pathogen expansion.","Plant Materials.","Japanese radish sprouts (Kaiware-daikon) (L.) was obtained from a commercial supplier (ICREST International, JCP, Carson, Calif.).
