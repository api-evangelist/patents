{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10\/753,927, filed Jan. 8, 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,010,060. The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/439,391 filed Jan. 10, 2003 entitled REAL-TIME SOFTWARE RECEIVER which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.","This invention was made with United States Government support from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) under contract number N00014-02-J-1822 and from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) under contract numbers NCC5-563, NAG5-11819, and NAG5-12089. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention.","This invention relates generally to software radio receivers, and more specifically to a software receiver for positioning systems.","A typical positioning system receiver, such as is used in the Global Positioning System (GPS), includes an antenna, a radio frequency (RF) section, a correlator, a signal tracking and demodulation component, and a component to compute the navigation solution. The antenna, which is possibly followed by a pre-amplifier, receives L-band GPS signals. The RF section filters and down converts the GHz GPS signal to an intermediate frequency in the MHz range. The RF section also digitizes the signal. The correlator separates the down-converted signal into different channels (ten or more in modern receivers) allocated to each satellite. For each satellite, the correlator mixes the Doppler-shifted intermediate frequency signal to baseband by correlating it with a local copy of the carrier replica signal and it distinguishes the particular satellite by correlating the signal with a pseudo-random number (PRN) code. Software routines cause the carrier replica and PRN replica signals to track the actual received signal, extract the navigation message, and compute the navigation solution.","Baseband mixing is a multiplication of an input signal by a complex exponential where the frequency of the complex exponential approximately matches that of the input signal. The resultant signal is centered at baseband. A complex signal can be broken down into cosine and sine signal components, resulting in separate in-phase and quadrature components. The frequency of the baseband mixed signal must be controllable to within a few millihertz in the case of a phase-locked loop for use in a precision navigation system, and the baseband mixed signal must have a continuously varying phase. In a hardware correlator, local oscillators generate cosine and sine signal components that have precise frequency control and a continuous phase. Generating cosine and sine signal components on the fly with the correct frequency and phase is too time consuming to be feasible for a software correlator. Instead, the software correlator generates cosine and sine signal components on a grid of frequencies off-line. These signal components must be stored on a time grid of points sampled at the RF front-end sampling frequency, for example, at 5.714 MHz for one particular RF front-end hardware configuration, and the signals must last for a typical accumulation period, e.g., for a 0.001 second coarse\/acquisition (C\/A) PRN code period when working with GPS L1 civilian signals. It takes tens of gigabytes of memory or more in order to brute-force store all frequencies on a one mHz grid ranging from \u221210 KHz to +10 KHz, which is the needed frequency range when tracking GPS satellites from a terrestrial receiver, and additional storage is required to store a grid of possible starting phases at each frequency point.","PRN code mixing is a multiplication of a baseband mixed signal by a prompt +1\/\u22121 PRN code or by a +2\/0\/\u22122 early-minus-late PRN code, where the code timing and frequency approximately match that of the input signal. The resultant signal is a constant in the case of prompt PRN code mixing, and an approximately linear function of the code timing error in the case of early-minus-late mixing. A receiver accumulates both of these correlation outputs. The magnitude of the prompt accumulation indicates signal strength and whether a signal has been detected, and its in-phase (real) and quadrature (imaginary) components are used to measure carrier phase and Doppler shift. The magnitude of the early-minus-late accumulation measures the code timing error; it will be zero when the timing error is zero.","The code phase of the baseband mixing signal must be controllable to within a percent or less of a PRN code chip for use in a precision navigation system. In a hardware correlator, local oscillators generate the prompt and early-minus-late PRN code replicas. A software correlator can either compute and store PRN code replicas, or compute them in real-time.","The current Global Positioning System is slated to realize expanded capabilities that include new civilian codes on the L2 frequency, a new L5 frequency, and new codes (M-code, CL and CM codes) on the L2 frequency. Some of these upgrades are slated to start within one to three years. A hardware correlator requires hardware modifications in order to use these new signals. In the near term, a receiver designer will be faced with a complex trade-off in order to decide whether the extra complexity is worth the improved performance that will accrue only very slowly as new GPS satellites replace older models. One way to avoid the complex trade-off is to use a software receiver that can receive and process new signals without the need for a new correlator chip set.","A software receiver is flexible because its software components can be easily modified. One application of a software receiver is to merge together numerous devices that use wireless digital communication protocols to form a single device. For example, a cell phone, GPS receiver, and Personal Data Assistant (PDA) could become a single device that plays the role of all three. Another use of a software receiver is to shorten development and to-market times for new wireless devices. For example, as new frequencies and codes are added to GPS, a software receiver having a software correlator simply needs to be reprogrammed, while a hardware approach would require a brand new correlator chip design. New PRN codes can be used simply by making software changes. Thus, software receiver technology lessens the risks involved for designers during the period of transition to the new signals. Furthermore, a software receiver could be reprogrammed to use the Galileo system (European GPS) or GLONASS (Russian GPS).","In the recent past, GPS software receivers have been developed that either post-process stored signals or operate in real-time. Previous real-time software receivers function with a limited number of channels (-) or require high-end computer speeds or digital signal processor (DSP) chips such as are disclosed in -, Akos et al., ION NTM 2001, 22-24 Jan. 2001, Long Beach, Calif., pp. 809-816 (Akos 2001a), and () , Akos et al., ION GPS 2001, 11-14 Sep. 2001, Salt Lake City, Utah, pp. 2851-2858, both incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.","Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to create a software receiver that operates in real-time and is not restricted to a severely limited number of channels or to a very fast processor.","Another object of the present invention is to minimize the number of sine and cosine signal components that must be stored.","A further object of the present invention is to process incoming signals through bit-wise parallelism.","A still further object of the present invention is to process over-sampled signals by use of bit-wise parallelism.","A still further object of the present invention is to use very long over-sampled PRN codes efficiently in a bit-wise parallel software receiver.","The objects set forth above as well as further and other objects are addressed by the present invention. The solutions and advantages of the present invention are achieved by the illustrative embodiment described herein below.","The software receiver system and method of the present invention enable the efficient execution of a set of algorithms, that perform software correlation on data sampled from incoming channels, on a general purpose processor. The system and method of the present invention provide for either PRN code storage or computation of PRN codes in real-time. PRN code storage is appropriate for PRN codes that have short periods, such as the GPS coarse\/acquisition codes, which are 1023 chips long. In this case, the system and method of the present invention pre-compute over-sampled replicas of entire PRN code periods and store them for orderly and efficient retrieval, such as in a table. This table can include a selection of code start times as measured relative to the sample times at which RF data are available from the receiver front end. There is a separate table for each unique PRN code.","The system and method of the present invention can also generate over-sampled versions of the prompt and early-minus-late PRN codes in real-time through use of an over-sampling function described herein. The values of the over-sampling function can be located in a specially designed table that can be generic across PRN codes. The length of the specially designed table can be independent of the length of the PRN code whose replica is being used to process a given received signal. The system and method of the present invention include techniques for efficiently calculating indices into the specially designed table that enable rapid, real-time table look-up.","The system of the present invention includes a software correlator that can mix the received signal to baseband, compute baseband\/PRN correlations through bit-wise parallelism and look-up tables using either the tabulated or real-time-generated PRN codes, and compute accumulations through bit-wise parallelism and processor instructions or look-up tables. Bit-wise parallelism allows the processing of multiple data samples simultaneously as the multiple bits of a given word of computer data. For example, for 32-bit words, the software correlator can process up to 32 samples at a time. Bit-wise parallelism can optimally operate when each signal in question can be represented by only a few bits, which is normally the case in RF digital signal processing of navigation signals.","The bit-wise parallel operations of the present invention can save computation time in comparison to integer mathematical correlation operations. If, for example, four accumulations are required per sample, integer mathematics requires six multiplications and four additions per sample (except for the last sample). At a sampling rate of, for example, 5.714 MHz this translates into 57,140 integer operations per PRN code period. In the illustrative embodiment, 33,500 bit-wise parallel operations are necessary per PRN code period when the RF signal has a 2-bit representation. This operation count is further reduced to approximately 16,750 bit-wise parallel operations per PRN code period when the RF signal has a 1-bit representation. Thus, there can be a savings of almost a factor of two to almost a factor of four in the operation count.","The system and method of the present invention also include a table of pre-computed baseband mixing sine waves, algorithms that can produce correlation accumulation outputs that are equivalent to what would be produced by a continuously variable sine wave, and a method of use of the table and algorithms. Thus, in the present invention, a relatively small set of sine wave values need to be pre-computed and saved, which can conserve computer memory and processing time.","The present invention also includes a system and method for tracking the phase of PRN code replicas in software in order to track the timing of any given \u201cchip\u201d of the PRN code replica as measured with respect to a pre-specified set of sample times at which the basic raw data comes out of the RF front end (a chip is an element of a PRN code). The PRN code phase is kept track of via a variable for each channel, that indicates the PRN code start time with respect to the RF sample times. The system and method of the present invention allow for the synchronization of the measurements of PRN code phase, carrier phase, and carrier frequency for each satellite relative to these sample times.","The method for tracking the phase of each PRN code replica and the phase of each carrier replica includes the steps of latching all the C\/A code phases, carrier phases, epoch counters, and carrier frequencies for each satellite at a pre-specified time, and computing the pseudo range to each satellite using the C\/A code phase and epoch counters. The method also includes the step of tracking and updating code and carrier phases by estimating code chipping rate and carrier Doppler shift inputs. The method further includes the step of computing the code phase at the pre-specified time for each satellite as a function of the updated code chipping rate and the pre-specified time. The method further includes the step of computing the carrier phase at the pre-specified time as a function of the updated carrier phase, the Doppler shift, and the pre-specified time. The timing of the PRN code phase (or chip location) is the most fundamental of GPS measurements for use in navigation data processing. The monitoring of these times in software allows complete control of the precision with which they can be measured, and it allows precise synchronization of these times with the measurement times of data from other sensors, such as inertial measurement units. This feature gives an enhanced ability to develop what are known as deeply coupled systems that must fuse GPS data with data from other types of sensor systems.","The software correlator of the present invention can advantageously be easily adapted to accept signals at any frequency, new PRN codes, or even signals for different types of devices. Thus, the same processing hardware could use the software correlator to implement such devices as a GPS receiver, a cell phone, or both. To allow for new codes, new frequencies, and new types of functionality, small changes can be made in the software correlator, or different versions of the software correlator can be run on the same processor. Hardware-correlator-based receivers of the prior art can deal only with frequencies and PRN codes that are hard-wired into their designs. Also, the system and method of the present invention could be implemented within systems such as GLONASS receivers, cell phones and cell base stations, pagers, wireless Ethernet (e.g. 802.11\u00d7 standards), Bluetooth\u2122, Blackberry\u00ae wireless internet devices, and satellite radio\/phones (e.g. INMARSAT\u00ae). In fact, the system and method of the present invention are applicable to any sort of telecommunication system\/device that uses spread spectrum, code division multiple access (CDMA) PRN codes for the transmission of information, either wired or wireless.","For a better understanding of the present invention, together with other and further objects thereof, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and detailed description. The scope of the present invention is pointed out in the appended claims.","The present invention is now described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which the illustrative embodiment of the present invention is shown.

DAQ system  can convert the 5.71424 MHz clock signal down to 357.14 KHz by use of, for example, a divide-by-16 counter for a 16-bit word, which can provide a signal indicating when the buffer is full.

The interface card can, for example, be a NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS\u00ae PCI-DIO-32HS digital I\/O card. Pertinent features of this card are the thirty-two digital input lines, DMA, and availability of a driver for RTLINUX\u00ae, perhaps gotten from the suite of open source drivers and application interface software for interface cards known as COMEDI (COntrol and MEasurement and Device Interface). Modifications to the conventional COMEDI driver for the PCI-DIO-32HS card include increasing the number of input bits from sixteen to thirty-two, enabling DMA, and modifying the driver to support continuous interrupt-driven acquisition.","With still further reference to , microprocessor  can be, for example, a 1.73 GHz AMD ATHLON\u2122 processor running the RTLINUX\u00ae operating system, but any operating system and processor that can accommodate real-time operations can be used. Low latency interrupt responsiveness, the ability to execute threads at regular intervals, with the kernel having a possibility of being the lowest priority thread, and reliable execution of time-critical code are among features of an operating system that could enhance the performance of the system of the present invention. The use of RTLINUX\u00ae is presented herein for illustrative purposes only.","Continuing to refer to , analogous to a hardware correlator that takes input directly from the RF front end in serial fashion, software correlator  reads from a shared memory buffer that both software correlator  and DAQ system  can access, the former to read data, and the latter to write data. The shared memory buffer can be implemented as a DMA memory space and a circular buffer. In the illustrative embodiment in which the system and method of the present invention are used in a GPS (or similar) environment, microprocessor  can store the most recent twenty-one milliseconds of signal data  () in the circular buffer, but could store more or less. The present invention does not fix the size of the circular buffer, nor the amount of RF data that can be stored there. The circular buffer allows the processing of code periods that start and stop at different times for different satellites during different iterations of a regularly scheduled program thread. DMA memory space can be written to directly by DAQ system  using a DAQ software driver, which fills the circular buffer. Communication between software correlator  and application-specific code  can be performed using operating system-provided shared memory capability. For example, the mbuff driver, included with RTLINUX\u00ae, can be used to create and manage this shared memory space. Any memory management system that accommodates real-time processing can be used. If the mbuff driver is used, kernel modules can share memory and the kernel can be restricted from swapping the shared memory space to long-term storage.","Continuing with the analogy to hardware correlation, and still referring primarily to , in hardware correlation, the correlator receives frequency and phase information from tracking and acquisition loops that are part of application code, and Numerically Controlled Oscillators (NCOs) generate signals that correspond to the written frequencies and phases. In contrast, software correlator  includes simulated carrier and code NCOs that receive their frequency commands from application-specific code . Software correlator  uses these frequency commands to reconstruct carrier replica signal  () and prompt PRN code  and early-minus-late PRN code  () which it mixes with the signal data  () resulting in fully mixed prompt integrand  and fully mixed early-minus-late integrand  ().","To further continue the analogy, a hardware correlator generates in real-time a particular C\/A code replica at the correct Doppler shifted frequency and phase. In contrast, software correlator  can generate C\/A codes off-line and store them in a memory table, the pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  (). The pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  is used to select PRN codes with the correct timing relationship to the sample times of signal data  (). The codes are then used to form correlations with baseband mixed signals  (), the result from which is summed to produce the standard in-phase and quadrature, summed prompt accumulation  () and summed early-minus-late accumulation  () that are equivalent to what would be produced by a continuously variable sine wave. These are provided to application-specific code , such as conventional GPS software that executes signal tracking and navigation functions. In a second approach, software correlator  can generate the PRN carrier replicas on-line at the code chipping rate and can use tabulated functions to re-sample the code at the sample rate of the RF front-end for purposes of calculating accumulations. Real-time over-sampled PRN code generator A () is used in place of pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  () in this latter approach. This latter method can be used with longer PRN codes, such as the new civilian GPS L2 CL codes.","With still further reference to , since the received L1 raw signal  can have an uncertain carrier phase, software correlator  computes both in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) accumulations, as defined in equations (4) and (5). Software correlator  begins the accumulation process by using carrier replica signal  (), which it gets from pre-stored carrier replica table  (). The carrier replicas in this table fall on a rough frequency grid, and they all start with a particular phase, for example a phase of zero. The baseband mixing process involves selecting a carrier replica signal  () from carrier replica table  () that is at the frequency that is as close to \u201cideal\u201d as possible. In the case of a 175 Hz grid spacing, the baseband mixing process selects a signal that is maximally within \u00b187.5 Hz of the ideal signal. The rough frequency grid can have a spacing of, for example, 175 Hz but could be larger or smaller depending on (a) the frequency range needed to cover, for example, \u00b110 Khz, (b) the amount of space available for storing pre-computed signals, and (c) other design decisions. The pre-computed signals in carrier replica table  () each may occupy 180 32-bit words in order to be guaranteed to cover the full 5,714 RF front-end samples that occur in one PRN code period for any possible code period start time within the thirty-two samples of the initial word. Thus, 180*4=720 bytes could be required for each bit of each pre-computed carrier replica signal  that is stored in the table. The sine and cosine waves of carrier replica signals  () each have 2-bit representations, which translates into a storage requirement of 2880 bytes for the carrier replica signals  at a given Doppler shift. There are 115 Doppler shifts that may be stored in order to cover the \u221210 KHz to +10 KHz range with a 175 Hz grid spacing. This translates into 323 Kbytes of storage for all of the carrier replica signals . This approach avoids the need to pre-compute sine waves with a prohibitively large number of possible frequencies and phase offsets and it avoids the need to compute sine waves in real-time. Instead, the errors created by using pre-defined sine wave replicas are compensated for by post-processing calculations, as described below.","In any case, and continuing to refer to , the resulting accumulations are",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00004","num":"00004"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["I","gjk"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u0394"}},{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","msub":{"mi":["i","k"]}},{"msub":[{"mi":["i","k"]},{"mi":["N","k"]}],"mo":"+"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}},{"msub":{"mi":["C","j"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"0.001","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":["+","-"],"mi":"\u0394"},{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mi":"jk","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":"-"}]}}}}},{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","IF"]},{"mi":["\u03c9","gjk"]}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":"\u2062","mi":"gjk"}}],"mo":"-"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"6"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["Q","gjk"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"\u0394"}},{"mo":"-","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":[{"mi":"i","mo":"=","msub":{"mi":["i","k"]}},{"msub":[{"mi":["i","k"]},{"mi":["N","k"]}],"mo":"+"}]},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"y","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["t","i"]}}},{"msub":{"mi":["C","j"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mn":"0.001","mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":["+","-"],"mi":"\u0394"},{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mi":"jk","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":"-"}]}}}}},{"mi":"sin","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","IF"]},{"mi":["\u03c9","gjk"]}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["t","i"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":"\u2062","mi":"gjk"}}],"mo":"-"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}}}],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"]}}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"7"}}]}]}}},"br":[{},{},{},{}],"sub":["gjk ","Doppjk ","0gjk ","jk","gjk","avgjk","gjk","avgjk","jk","gjk","avgjk","gjk","avgjk","avgjk "],"b":["25","19"],"figref":"FIG. 3A","in-line-formulae":[{},{},{},{}],"i":["I","I","Q","Q","I","Q"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00005","num":"00005"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["\u0394\u03d5","avgjk"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["\u03c9","gjk"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mi":"jk","mo":"+","mn":"1"}}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"},"mo":"-","msub":{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":"\u2062","mi":"gjk"}}}}},{"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"^"},"mi":"Doppjk"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mi":"jk","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":"-"},"mn":"2"}}},{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","IF"]},{"mi":"t","mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":"\u2062","mi":"gjk"}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":["-","-","+"],"msub":{"mover":{"mi":"\u03d5","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":"19"},"The validity of equations (8) and (9) is dependent on the assumption that",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"-","mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"cos","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["[","]"],"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":["1","2"]},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":["\u03c9","gjk"]},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c9","mo":"^"},"mi":"Doppjk"}],"mo":"-"}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mrow":{"mi":"jk","mo":"+","mn":"1"}},{"mover":{"mi":"\u03c4","mo":"^"},"mi":"jk"}],"mo":"-"}}]}}},{"mo":"<<","mn":"1"}],"mo":"\u2062"}}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"11"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"Note that equations (8) and (9) can be derived from equations (4) and (5) as follows.

Pre-computing involves, for each satellite, computing an entire PRN code, storing the PRN code appropriately for easy retrieval, and referencing the PRN code, possibly by means of indices that are computed based on, for example, the incoming RF signal data  (). Pre-computing can be most advantageously used when the PRN code is not very long. Generating PRN codes in real-time can be a more appropriate solution when the PRN codes are very long (and thus would require an unacceptable amount of storage), or perhaps when too many PRN codes are required for the amount of storage available, or for any other reason, but real-time PRN code generation can entail an additional computational cost. Both pre-computing and real-time determination of PRN codes are described herein with respect to a bit-wise parallel implementation.","Continuing to refer primarily to , B, and A, in order to perform bit-wise parallel operations, software correlator  () stores pre-computed carrier replica sign A () and carrier replica magnitude B () in data words. Simple representations of signal data  () and carrier replica signal  () in terms of one, two, or more bits are suitable for using bit-wise parallelism to perform the calculations described herein. Bit-wise parallel operations work with representations of the data that store successive samples in successive bits of a word. For example, thirty-two samples (bits) of the RF front-end output are stored in two N=32-bit words, signal sign A () and signal magnitude B (), or simply a single 32-bit word if signal data  consists of a single data bit. Carrier replica sign A () and carrier replica magnitude B () are stored, for example in tables, in separate words, with each 32-bit word storing thirty-two sign or magnitude bits that tabulate to thirty-two successive samples of the corresponding cosine or sine wave. Similarly, tables can store prompt PRN code  () and early-minus-late PRN code  (), which are composed of prompt PRN code sign A (), early-minus-late PRN code sign A (), and early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B (). The data words that comprise the bit-wise parallel representations of these three signal types, the original RF signal data  (), the carrier replica signal  ( and ), and the de-spreading prompt PRN code  () and early-minus-late PRN code  (), are the inputs to the calculations of software correlator  ().","Further continuing primarily to refer to , B, and A, many intermediate calculated quantities and at least three types of intermediate signals are also stored in bit-wise parallel format. First there are the in-phase and quadrature baseband mixed signals  (), whose 3-bit representations for the illustrative embodiment are stored as baseband mixed sign A (), baseband mixed high magnitude B (), and baseband mixed low magnitude C (). The second bit-wise parallel signal type is the fully mixed integrand, of which there are four signals: in-phase and quadrature fully mixed prompt integrand  () and in-phase and quadrature fully mixed early-minus-late integrand  (). The former are stored as 3-bit representations in the illustrative embodiment as fully mixed prompt integrand sign A (), fully mixed prompt integrand high magnitude B (), and fully mixed prompt integrand low magnitude C (). The latter are stored as 3.5-bit representations in the illustrative embodiment as fully mixed early-minus-late integrand sign A (), fully mixed early-minus-late integrand high magnitude B (), fully mixed early-minus-late integrand low magnitude C (), and fully mixed early-minus-late integrand zero mask D (). This representation is called a 3.5-bit representation because the sign, high-magnitude, and low-magnitude bits are ignored if the corresponding zero mask bit has the value zero. The third bit-wise parallel signal type is a value word, of which there are two types: prompt integrand value words  () and early-minus-late integrand value words  (). Each fully mixed integrand is used to construct value words, one word for each possible value that the integer integrand can take on. There are eight possible values for the integrands of the illustrative embodiment: \u22121, \u22122, \u22123, \u22126, 1, 2, 3, and 6 for the in-phase and quadrature fully mixed prompt integrands  () and \u22122, \u22124, \u22126, \u221212, 2, 4, 6, and 12 for the in-phase and quadrature fully mixed early-minus-late integrands  (). Each bit-wise parallel value word contains a one bit for each sample time when the integrand value equals the value of the value word, but it contains a zero bit for all other sample times. The storage of raw data and intermediate results in bit-wise parallel format allows the EXCLUSIVE OR operations that are involved in mixing to operate on thirty-two samples at a time if microprocessor  () has a bit-wise EXCLUSIVE OR command. Other bit-wise commands are used to perform additional software correlation operations in parallel on sets of two thirty-two samples.","At this point, the problem of over-sampling is introduced. Referring now to , the problem of over-sampling is illustrated with respect to bit-wise parallelism as follows. There is normally more than one RF data sample per PRN code chip. The three successive \u22121 values  () at sample times tto tall occur during the same PRN code chip as do the four successive +1 values  () at times tthrough t. The difference in the number of samples for the two code chips arises because the PRN code chip period is not an integer multiple of the sample period. Analogously, referring to , where sample interval \u0394t is less than actual PRN code chip length \u0394t, over-sampling is indicated because the RF sampling frequency f=1\/\u0394tis greater than the PRN code chipping frequency f=1\/\u0394t. PRN codes for CDMA signaling are sequences of +1 and \u22121 values, the elements of which are chips. Over the time intervals of interest, a carrier replica progresses through its chips at a constant chipping rate of f=1\/\u0394tchips\/second. The time interval \u0394tis the actual PRN code chip length  (). Software correlator  () normally receives PRN code, and attempts to align it with the prompt replica version of the code, prompt PRN code  (). It makes use of the signal's correlation with prompt PRN code  () and with early-minus-late PRN code  () in order to determine a chipping rate fthat tends to align prompt PRN code  () as desired. Conventional methods for determining fare well-known in the art. Chips of early code B () start and stop 0.5\u0394tseconds before the corresponding chips of prompt PRN code  (), and the chips of late code C () start and stop 0.5\u0394tseconds after prompt PRN code  (). Early-minus-late PRN code  () is the difference between early code B () and late code C (). Example segments of these four types of replica codes are depicted in .","Referring to , A, C, and D software correlator  () receives, through conventional RF front end  and DAQ system , signal data  (), the raw data  () source of which is sampled at the rate f=1\/\u0394tHz. In order to process the resulting RF signal data , software correlator  () needs prompt PRN code  () and early-minus-late PRN code  () replicas sampled at the same times as raw signal  ().  depicts sixteen sample times as vertical dash-dotted lines. Referring to , prompt PRN code  () can be represented by its prompt PRN code sign A () at the sample times. The bit value one represents +1, and the bit value zero represents \u22121. Prompt PRN code sign A (), shown at the sixteen sample times\u2014starting with three 1s, continuing with ten 0s, and finishing with another three 1s\u2014is a 16-bit word stored as the integer 2+2+2+2+2+2=57351. Early-minus-late PRN code  () requires a 1.5-bit representation. A zero mask bit is set to zero if early-minus-late PRN code  takes on the value zero, and it is set to one if early-minus-late PRN code  equals +2 or \u22122. Early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B () at sixteen sample times shown in  is equivalent to 2+2+2=12292. A 2's sign bit is set to one if early-minus-late PRN code  () equals +2 at the sample time, and it is set to zero if the code equals \u22122. The 2's sign bit is irrelevant if the corresponding early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B () bit equals zero. Early-minus-late PRN code sign A () for sixteen sample times contains X values that indicate bits whose values are irrelevant because the corresponding early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B () bits are zero. In an illustrative embodiment, all the X values become zero, thus the equivalent integer for early-minus-late PRN code sign A () is 2=4.","Continuing to refer to , an alternative to taking the prompt PRN code  and early-minus-late PRN code  from pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  is to generate prompt PRN code sign A, early-minus-late PRN code sign A, and early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B using real-time over-sampled PRN code generator A (). Shown in  are two circles and a loose arrow with a quarter circle pointer. These are the symbols for a switch and indicate the ability of the system to choose possible alternate sources of PRN code. Using the real-time over-sampled PRN code generator A includes a step of generating the PRN code chips in real-time by conventional means. For example, the GPS civilian L2 CL and CM codes are generated by a 27-bit feedback shift register (see 2 , R. D. Fontana et al., 2001, Sep. 11-14, 2001, Salt Lake City, Utah, pp. 617-631). The method further includes the steps of choosing chip values from the PRN code, where the chip values correspond to a data interval that contains the samples of a data word and where the chips have a known timing relative to the data interval, transforming the relative timing into a time grid index, and translating the PRN code chip values and the time grid index for the data interval into the PRN code's over-sampled bit-wise parallel format. These latter steps can be carried out efficiently by using a table look up function. One table each for prompt PRN code sign A, early-minus-late PRN code sign A, and early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B can include integer values that constitute the bit-wise parallel representation of the PRN code for the sample times associated with the data word in question. Indices into each 1-dimensional table are functions of (a) the time offset between the first PRN code chip and the first sample time of the given data word, and (b) the bit pattern of the PRN code chips that span the sample times of the data word. The sizes of the tables are independent of the period of the PRN code that is being over-sampled. The tables can be re-used for multiple PRN codes in a multi-channel receiver. The computation and use of the tables are discussed in more detail later.","Continuing with the description of bit-wise parallelism with respect to the operations of software correlator  (), and continuing to refer to , the specially-developed algorithms described herein make use of bit-wise parallelism so that a single programming language statement, such as a C code command, can partially process up to thirty-two samples at a time. Previously referred-to carrier replica signal  in the form of cosine and sine signals are stored as binary carrier replica sign A and carrier replica magnitude B.

Note that the period of 0.001 is applicable for accumulations that use the full 1023 chips of the C\/A code only. Any other type of code or accumulation interval may have a different period.

The only other effect of this assumption can be a small correlation power loss, which is no more than 0.014 dB if the magnitude of the Doppler shift is less than 10 KHz. The pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  should include a selection of different phases, for example fourteen, as measured relative to a signal sample spacing of, for example, 175 nsec. This translates into a code phase spacing of, for example, 12.5 nsec, which equals a pseudo range measurement digitization level of 3.8 m, or a maximum measurement error of 1.9 m. The number of phases in the pre-computed over-sampled PRN code table  is dependent upon the design of the system and no set number of phases is required by the present invention.

The length of the time period depends on the nominal accumulation period. It is set to be less than this period, normally between 50% to 90% of this period, to reduce the possibility that accumulations are missed for any channels.","Referring again to , method step  () calls for computing value words. This computation starts by performing bit-wise parallel Boolean logic for each of the possible values in the right-hand column of the prompt integrand representation in Table 6. A 32-bit prompt integrand value word  () is computed for each thirty-two samples and each row of Table 6. The prompt integrand value word  () contains ones for the sample times when the actual integrand equals the corresponding value in the right-hand column of Table 6, and zeros for the remaining times when the actual integrand does not equal this value. The prompt integrand value words  () corresponding to the possible Table 6 values are formed by method step  () as follows:\n\nMINUSONE=NOT(SIGN) AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(13)\n\nMINUSTWO=NOT(SIGN) AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(14)\n\nMINUSTHREE=NOT(SIGN) AND [HIGHMAG AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(15)\n\nMINUSSIX=NOT(SIGN) AND [HIGHMAG AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(16)\n\nPLUSONE=SIGN AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(17)\n\nPLUSTWO=SIGN AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(18)\n\nPLUSTHREE=SIGN AND [HIGHMAG AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(19)\n\nPLUSSIX=SIGN AND [HIGHMAG AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(20)\n","Continuing to refer to , B, A, and B, method steps  (),  (), and  () call for operations for the fully mixed early-minus-late integrands  () that are similar to those for the fully mixed prompt integrands  (). Early-minus-late integrand value words  () correspond to values that are double those of the prompt integrand value words  (), i.e., the MINUSSIX word becomes the MINUSTWELVE word. Also, an additional AND operation must be performed with the zero mask bits of Table 7 in order to mask out sample times when the early and late PRN codes cancel each other. Possible formulas for the method step  () computation of these early-minus-late integrand value words  () are as follows:\n\nMINUSTWO=[ZEROMASK AND NOT(SIGN)] AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(21)\n\nMINUSFOUR=[ZEROMASK AND NOT(SIGN)] AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(22)\n\nMINUSSIX=[ZEROMASK AND NOT(SIGN)] AND [HIGHMAG AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(23)\n\nMINUSTWELVE=[ZEROMASK AND NOT(SIGN)] AND [HIGHMAG AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(24)\n\nPLUSTWO=[ZEROMASK AND SIGN] AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(25)\n\nPLUSFOUR=[ZEROMASK AND SIGN] AND [NOT(HIGHMAG) AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(26)\n\nPLUSSIX=[ZEROMASK AND SIGN] AND [HIGHMAG AND NOT(LOWMAG)]\u2003\u2003(27)\n\nPLUSTWELVE=[ZEROMASK AND SIGN] AND [HIGHMAG AND LOWMAG]\u2003\u2003(28)\n\nAdditional zero masking can occur in the first and last words of an accumulation interval. This is true because the start and stop times of an accumulation interval do not normally fall at the boundaries of data words. Therefore, the bits in the first word that precede the accumulation interval may need to get zero masked as might the bits in the last word that come after the end of the accumulation interval.\n","Referring primarily to , the one bits counting operations of method step  () form the count of the number of one bits in each of the eight value words. If there are no such counting operations in the instruction set of microprocessor  (), the counting can be accomplished using a table look-up. In the case of a table look-up, prompt integrand value words  and early-minus-late integrand value words  () can be used as addresses in one bits summation table  (), and one bits summation table  () can output the number of one values (or zeros) in the address. For example, if the table look-up operation is called BITSUM, the following computations can be performed to compute one-bits counts:\n\nONESCOUNT=BITSUM(VALUEWORD)\u2003\u2003(29)\n\nwhere the output of the table ONESCOUNT is the number of one bits in the word VALUEWORD. This operation is repeated for each of the prompt integrand value words  () and early-minus-late integrand value words  () in order to accomplish method step  (). Selection of table width, for example 16-bit or 32-bit, depends on the amount of memory available and other design decisions.

An increase above two bits can make the logic more complex and may decrease the time savings over straight integer arithmetic. A decrease to a 1-bit representation can have the opposite effect. For example, if the RF front-end uses 1-bit digitization rather than 2-bit digitization while carrier replica signal  () retains its 2-bit digitization, then the operation count can decrease by a factor of almost two for the 1-bit method, which can make the logic execute about 4.2 times faster than straight integer arithmetic.","Returning to the discussion of determining PRN code, and now referring again , D, and A, the real-time generation of bit-wise parallel over-sampled prompt PRN code sign A (), early-minus-late PRN code sign A (), and early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B () can be carried out by real-time over-sampled PRN code generator A (). The inputs to this calculation are the actual PRN code chip length  (), \u0394t, the sample interval  (), \u0394t, the nominal early-to-late code delay  (), \u0394t, the end time of the first code chip relative to the first sample time, or put another way, the time lag \u0394t,  () from the first RF sample time to the end time of the first prompt PRN code chip, and prompt code chips  ().

The required table look-ups can be simplified by recognizing that the following parameters are substantially constant, for the purposes of this calculation: sampling interval  (), \u0394t, the nominal chip length, \u0394t, the early-minus-late code delay  (), \u0394t, used by software correlator  (), and the maximum number of chips that span a data word of microprocessor  ().

(48d) picks bto equal a power of two so that the integer division by bin equation (49) can be accomplished using a rightward bit shift operation. The round( ) operation in equation (49) can be accomplished as part of the division if one first adds sign(a)\u00d7b\/2 to the quantity (k\u2212k)\u00d7abefore performing the rightward bit shift that constitutes division by b. This approach can give the correct kbecause the signs of (k\u2212k) and bare both positive and because the rightward bit shift has the effect of rounding the signed division result towards zero.

Thus, the same hardware could use the software correlator  () to implement such devices as a GPS receiver, a cell phone, or both. To allow for new codes, new frequencies, and new types of functionality, small changes can be made in the software correlator  (), or different versions of the software correlator  () can be run on the same processor. The changes involve using a different baseband mixing frequency and a different PRN code in the correlation, and perhaps changes that would provide the new signals of interest to the software correlator  (). In order for the present invention to work with signals at different frequencies, new PRN codes, or signals for different devices, two fundamental changes need to be made. First, the baseband mixing frequency must be tailored to that of the signal data , which also involves pre-computing and storing sine and cosine tables at this new frequency. Second, new pre-computed over-sampled PRN code tables  () must be constructed. The size of the new tables should match the over-sampled accumulation period, or at least one over-sampled period of the PRN code. As an alternative to generating new pre-computed over-sampled PRN code tables  (), the new PRN codes can be generated in real-time by over-sampled PRN code generator A (). Also, the system and method of the present invention could be implemented within systems such as GLONASS receivers, cell phones and cell base stations, pagers, wireless Ethernet (e.g. 802.11\u00d7 standards), Bluetooth\u2122, Blackberry\u00ae wireless internet devices, and satellite radio\/phones (e.g. INMARSAT\u00ae). In fact, the system and method of the present invention are applicable to any sort of telecommunication system\/device that uses spread spectrum, code division multiple access (CDMA) pseudo random number codes for the transmission of information, either wired or wireless.","Referring now to , navigation calculations require measured values of the PRN code phase , carrier phase, and carrier frequency. The measurements for all tracked satellites must be taken at exactly the same time. A time interval counter (TIC) function provides a periodic timing scheme to synchronize these measurements at time t. At time t, the TIC function latches all of the PRN code phase , carrier phases, and carrier frequencies along with the code epoch counters, and software correlator  () makes these available to application-specific code  (), for example, GPS receiver software. GPS receiver software uses the code phase and epoch counters to compute the pseudo range to each satellite. Software correlator  () keeps track of the code and carrier phase of each signal as determined by the code chipping rate and the carrier Doppler shift inputs. The quantity {circumflex over (f)}, the estimated code chipping rate of software receiver  for satellite j during its kPRN code period, can be determined either by an acquisition search procedure, or if tracking, by a delay-locked loop. Likewise, {circumflex over (\u03c9)}, the associated carrier Doppler shift, can be defined by an acquisition procedure or, if tracking has commenced, by a phase-locked loop or a frequency-locked loop.

In the first test, a first configuration includes a MITEL\u00ae GP2021 hardware correlator, but is in all other ways identical to a second configuration that includes the software correlator  () of the present invention. The two configurations differ in SNR by less that 1 dB and in navigation solutions by no more than 5-10 meters. In the second test, timing studies using the system of the present invention show that processing six channels uses only about 20% of the processor's capacity, while Akos 2001a report a real-time software GPS receiver that would require 100% of the capacity a 1.73 GHz microprocessor to implement a 6-channel GPS receiver when processing data from an RF front-end with a sampling frequency of 5.714 MHz.","Referring now to , among other indicators that could assess the accuracy of the PRN code generated by real-time over-sampled PRN code generator A (), which includes prompt PRN code sign A (), early-minus-late PRN code sign A (), and early-minus-late PRN code zero mask B (), is the low distortion of the generated codes versus the true codes. , generated for prompt code comparisons, shows juxtaposed plots of the autocorrelation function  () of the sampled true code and the cross correlation function  () between the sampled true code and the sampled code as generated from the new xtable.  shows a similar comparison for early-minus-late PRN code  (). In either case, the nominal chipping frequency is f=1\/\u0394t=1.023 Mfz, the sampling frequency is f=1\/\u0394t=12.199 MHz, and the code timing resolution of the table is m=12, i.e., 1\/12of a sample. This resolution translates into approximately 1\/143of a code chip. The actual chipping rate differs from the nominal by (f\u2212f)=1.5 Hz. This Doppler shift of the code chipping rate corresponds to a significant non-zero range rate between the receiver and the transmitter, 438 m\/sec. The correlations are accumulated over 10230 code chips, and the code is a time-multiplexed version of a pair of the new GPS civilian L2 CL and CM codes. The data word indexing calculations for this example use a code chip start time resolution of \u0394t\/10, i.e., m=10.","It is obvious from  that prompt PRN code  () and early-minus-late PRN code  () distortion is very small. The correlations produced using the new tables are virtually identical to those produced from the exact code. The low distortion of the new approach is best characterized by two parameters: the amount by which the correlation peak of the prompt PRN code sign A () droops below one and the offset of the zero-crossing time of the early-minus-late PRN code  (). The former metric characterizes the power loss of the new approach, and the latter metric characterizes the net timing error. The droop of the prompt peak is only 0.3% of the nominal amplitude, which translates into a 0.03 dB loss. The timing distortion of the new code is less than 4\u00d710code chips. This distortion is very small; it translates into about 0.1 m of GPS range measurement error.","It may seem paradoxical that the code timing error is only 4\u00d710code chips when the code timing granularity of the x(i) tables is \u0394t\/(m\u0394t)\u22457\u00d710code chips. The resolution of this paradox lies in the averaging effect of the accumulations. The length of a code chip equals 143.099269 code offset time grid intervals for the example shown in . The non-integer nature of this number causes the code offset errors of the x(i) tables to get dithered as the accumulation works its way through successive data words. This dithering tends to average out the table granularity errors, and this averaging can reduce the net timing error by an order of magnitude or more, as shown in .","Although the invention has been described with respect to various embodiments, it should be realized this invention is also capable of a wide variety of further and other embodiments."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 2D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A and 3B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A and 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIGS. 9A and 9B","FIG. 9A","FIG. 9B"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
