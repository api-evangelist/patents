title: Data object extensibility
abstract: A system for creating a custom field type comprises an input interface, a processor, and an output interface. The input interface is configured to receive an indication to create a custom field type. The processor is configured to validate a parameter of the custom field type. The output interface is configured to provide the custom field type for creating a custom field of a custom object.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["In an object based database system, software objects correspond to real-life entities. For example, a worker object comprises information describing a worker (e.g., worker name, title, salary, etc.,) and relationships to other business objects (e.g., supervisors, subordinates, business locations, etc.). A developer designing the object based database system can preload the system with a set of objects representing common business entities, in order to cover the basic needs of a typical business. However, many businesses have special circumstances, which cannot be addressed using the available objects or configurations of the objects.","The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and\/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and\/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term \u2018processor\u2019 refers to one or more devices, circuits, and\/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.","A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.","A system for creating a custom field type comprises an input interface configured to receive an indication to create a custom field type, a processor configured to validate a parameter of the custom field type, and an output interface configured to provide the custom field type for creating a custom field of a custom object. The system for creating a custom field type additionally comprises a memory coupled to the processor and configured to provide the processor with instructions.","A system for data object extensibility comprises an object based database system comprising a set of data objects. A data object comprises attributes (e.g., data describing the object), relations (e.g., connections to other data objects); and methods (e.g., software for operating on the attributes and relations). A database system manager may decide it is necessary to extend an object\u2014for instance to add new attributes to a worker object, if it is determined necessary to store new data describing the worker. For example, a company that requires its employees to have their fingerprints on file would want to store as part of a worker object information describing when a fingerprint was taken, when it was submitted to a national fingerprint database, what the results were, etc. A company requiring a security clearance would want to store information describing when the clearance was applied for, what the results were, what level of clearance an employee has, etc. The company can add this information by creating a new object that extends the worker object, and has associated with it the data fields desired.","In some embodiments, in order to make data object extensibility as flexible and as powerful as possible, a new object is created using not only the existing data types, but also using custom data types created specifically for the new object. Custom data types can include numeric data types with user-defined range and precision, a text data type with user-defined length, or a list data type with user-defined list elements. A list data type will allow a customer to specify a set of values for the field that can be chosen between. For example, a list type describing an employee security clearance might give a choice of No Clearance, Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. A custom data type creator allows a custom data type to be created, validates the custom data type, and provides the custom data type to the custom object creator.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["102","104","106","100","100","106","106","106","106","106","106"]},"Database system administrator  comprises a database system administrator administrating database system .
