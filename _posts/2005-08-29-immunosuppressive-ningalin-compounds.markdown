Compositions and methods of the invention can be used, for example, to provide immunosuppression during transplantation.","Inflammatory reactions can provide an essential defense to infection and injury. At the same time, many human diseases or treatments are aggravated by excessive inflammatory reactions brought on by immune responses (e.g., immune responses to organ transplantation). Presently, development of specific and efficacious anti-inflammatory treatment modalities is challenging. For example, use of pharmacologic anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and cytokine antagonists) or immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclosporin A, FK 506 and rapamycin) is frequently complicated by adverse events limiting their clinical utility. Therefore, identification of biocompatible agents that reduce immune responses, and preferably inflammation, has important therapeutic implications.","Ningalins comprise a family of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-derived o-catechol metabolites that include the tunichromes (Bruening, R. C.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 5289; Bruening, R. C.; et al. J. Nat. Prod. 1986, 49, 193; Bayer, E; et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1992, 31, 52; Oltz, E. M.; et al. J. Am. Chem.

L. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 54, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Ningalin B is the second member of the ningalin family (Kang, H.; Fenical, W. J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, 3254). Ningalin B and related analogs are described in U.S. Application Publication No. 20030220320 and Boger D. L. et al., J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2479, the contents of each which are incorporated herein by reference. N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, and N6 () were previously described by Boger D. L. et al., J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 2479 as N10, N11, N13, N14, N15 and N30, respectively. Other ningalins are referenced in Soenen D. R. et al, Bioorganic and Med. Chem. Letts. 2003, 13, 1777-1781 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Ningalin analogs of the present invention comprise, for example, analogs having variations in structure, but retaining the essential functional activity of a native ningalin (i.e, the ability to modulate an adverse immune response, such as by decreasing inflammatory cell activation or proliferation). As referred to herein, an analog having \u201cnative ningalin activity\u201d possesses a functional ability decrease activation or proliferation of inflammatory cells which is at least equivalent to that of the compound in its native (e.g., unmodified) form. Analogs of the invention may exceed the physiological activity of the compound in its native form. Methods of analog design are well known in the art, and synthesis can be carried out according to such methods by modifying the chemical structure of a native ningalin such that the resultant analogs exhibit equivalent or enhanced function (U.S. Application Publication No. 20030220320). These chemical modifications include, but are not limited to, substituting alternative R groups and varying the degree of saturation at specific carbon atoms of the native molecule. Analogs of the invention can be relatively resistant to in vivo degradation, resulting in a more prolonged therapeutic effect upon administration. Assays for measuring functional activity include, but are not limited to, those described in the Examples below.","In one embodiment, methods of the present invention comprise identifying compounds or compositions that mimic, exceed or increase native ningalin A or B activity, for example, ningalin analogs. Accordingly, methods of the present invention further relate to screening for compounds that mimic or exceed activity of ningalins presently known in the art.","Design of assays (e.g., cell-based assays) to identify compounds effecting or possessing native ningalin activity, is well within the skill in the art. The end point of the assays will typically measure a physiologic effect. The physiologic effect can comprise modulating inflammatory cellular movement and\/or proliferation in response to interaction with a specific candidate or composition, referred to herein as a test compound. Preferably, inflammatory cell lines are used in cell-based assays.","In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of screening ningalin analogs for immunosuppressive activity comprising the steps of:\n\n","Compositions of the present invention are well suited for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered to any subject that may experience the beneficial effects of the compounds of the invention.","The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered by any means that achieve their intended purpose. For example, administration can be by topical, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, or buccal routes. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment and the nature of the effect desired.","In addition to the pharmacologically active compounds, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically. Preferably, the preparations, particularly those preparations that can be administered orally and that can be used for the preferred type of administration, such as tablets, dragees, and capsules, and also preparations that can be administered rectally, such as suppositories, as well as suitable solutions for administration by injection or orally, contain from about 0.001 to about 99 percent, preferably from about 0.01 to about 95 percent, about 1.0 to about 90 percent, or about 10 to about 50 percent of active compound(s), together with the excipient. Standard texts, such as \u201cRemington's Pharmaceutical Science\u201d, 17th edition, 1985, \u201cHand Book of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 4edition 2003, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. Suitable dosages can also be based upon the text herein and documents cited herein.","The dose ranges for the administration of the compositions of the present invention are those large enough to produce the desired effect (without exceeding the maximal tolerated doses) whereby, for example, the adverse immune response is reduced or eliminated or ameliorated. In specific embodiments, from about 50 to about 500 \/m, from about 500 to about 1000 \/m, from about 1000 to about 2000 \/m, and from about 2000 to about 4000 \/mof one or more ningalins per dose is administered. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, sex, and extent of the disease in the patient. The doses should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as unwanted cross-reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and the like. Counter indications, if any, immune tolerance, and other variables will also affect the proper dosage. The molecules can be administered parenterally by injection or by gradual profusion over time.","The pharmaceutical preparations are manufactured in a manner that is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating, dragee making, dissolving, or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipients, optionally grinding the resulting mixture and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired or necessary, to obtain tablets or dragee cores.","Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as saccharides, for example, lactose or sucrose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and\/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, as well as binders such as starch paste, using, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and\/or polyvinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the above-mentioned starches and also carboxymethyl-starch, cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Auxiliaries are, above all, flow-regulating agents and lubricants, for example, silica, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate, and\/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings that, if desired, are resistant to gastric juices. For this purpose, concentrated saccharide solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and\/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. In order to produce coatings resistant to gastric juices, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropymethyl-cellulose phthalate, are used. Dye stuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example, for identification or in order to characterize combinations of active compound doses.","Other pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include pushfit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active compounds in the form of granules that may be mixed with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and\/or lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds are preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils or liquid paraffin. In addition, stabilizers may be added.","Possible pharmaceutical preparations that can be used rectally include, for example, suppositories, which consist of a combination of one or more of the active compounds with a suppository base. Suitable suppository bases are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, or paraffin hydrocarbons. In addition, it is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules that consist of a combination of the active compounds with a base. Possible base materials include, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, or paraffin hydrocarbons.","Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-soluble salts. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and\/or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers.","Additional pharmaceutical methods can be employed to control the duration of action. Delivery systems can include time-release, delayed release or sustained release delivery systems (collectively referred to herein as controlled release). Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the ningalins, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician. Many types of release delivery systems are available and known to those of ordinary skill in the art. They include polymer base systems such as poly(lactide-glycolide), copolyoxalates, polycaprolactones, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polyhydroxybutyric acid, and polyanhydrides. Microcapsules of the foregoing polymers containing drugs are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,109. Delivery systems also include non-polymer systems that are: lipids including sterols such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids or neutral fats such as mono- di- and tri-glycerides; hydrogel release systems; sylastic systems; peptide based systems; wax coatings; compressed tablets using conventional binders and excipients; partially fused implants; and the like. Specific examples include, but are not limited to: (a) erosional systems in which the anti-inflammatory agent is contained in a form within a matrix such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,775, 4,667,014, 4,748,034 and 5,239,660 and (b) difusional systems in which an active component permeates at a controlled rate from a polymer such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,832,253, and 3,854,480.","A preferred delivery system of the invention is a colloidal dispersion system. Colloidal dispersion systems include lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. A preferred colloidal system of the invention is a liposome. Liposomes are artificial membrane vessels which are useful as a delivery vector in vivo or in vitro. It has been shown that large unilamellar vessels (LUV), which range in size from 0.2-4.0 \u03bcm can encapsulate large macromolecules. Ningalins can be encapsulated within the aqueous interior and be delivered to cells in an active form (Fraley, et al., Trends Biochem. Sci., (1981) 6:77). In order for a liposome to be an efficient transfer vector, one or more of the following characteristics should be present: (1) encapsulation of the ningalin with high efficiency and retention of biological activity; (2) preferential and substantial binding to a target cell in comparison to non-target cells; and (3) delivery of the aqueous contents of the vesicle to the target cell cytoplasm at high efficiency.","Liposomes may be targeted to a particular tissue by coupling the liposome to a specific ligand such as a monoclonal antibody, sugar, glycolipid, or protein. Liposomes are commercially available from Gibco BRL, for example, as LIPOFECTIN\u2122 and LIPOFECTACE\u2122, which are formed of cationic lipids such as N-[1-(2, 3 dioleyloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA) and dimethyl dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB). Methods for making liposomes are well known in the art and have been described in many publications. Liposomes also have been reviewed by Gregoriadis, G. in Trends in Biotechnology, (1985) 3:235-241.","In one important embodiment, a preferred vehicle is a biocompatible microparticle or implant that is suitable for implantation into the mammalian recipient. Exemplary bioerodible implants that are useful in accordance with this method are described in PCT International Publication No. WO 95\/24929, entitled \u201cPolymeric Gene Delivery System\u201d (PCT International application no. PCT\/US95\/03307). WO 95\/24929 describes a biocompatible, preferably biodegradable polymeric matrix for containing an exogenous gene under the control of an appropriate promoter. The polymeric matrix is used to achieve sustained release of the exogenous gene in the patient. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the ningalins described herein are encapsulated or dispersed within the biocompatible, preferably biodegradable, polymeric matrix such as that disclosed in WO 95\/24929.","The polymeric matrix preferably is in the form of a microparticle such as a microsphere (wherein an agent is dispersed throughout a solid polymeric matrix) or a microcapsule (wherein an agent is stored in the core of a polymeric shell). Other forms of the polymeric matrix for containing an agent include films, coatings, gels, implants, and stents. The size and composition of the polymeric matrix device is selected to result in favorable release kinetics in the tissue into which the matrix is introduced. The size of the polymeric matrix further is selected according to the method of delivery which is to be used. Preferably when an aerosol route is used the polymeric matrix and ningalins are encompassed in a surfactant vehicle. The polymeric matrix composition can be selected to have both favorable degradation rates and also to be formed of a material which is bioadhesive, to further increase the effectiveness of transfer. The matrix composition also can be selected not to degrade, but rather, to release by diffusion over an extended period of time.","In another important embodiment the delivery system is a biocompatible microsphere that is suitable for local, site-specific delivery. Such microspheres are disclosed in Chickering et al., Biotech. And Bioeng., (1996) 52:96-101 and Mathiowitz et al., Nature, (1997) 386:410-414.","Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric matrices can be used to deliver the agents of the invention to the subject. Biodegradable matrices are preferred. Such polymers may be natural or synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers are preferred. The polymer is selected based on the period of time over which release is desired, generally in the order of a few hours to a year or longer. Typically, release over a period ranging from between a few hours and three to twelve months is most desirable. The polymer optionally is in the form of a hydrogel that can absorb up to about 90% of its weight in water and further, optionally is cross-linked with multi-valent ions or other polymers.","Ningalins can be delivered using a bioerodible implant by way of diffusion, or more preferably, by degradation of the polymeric matrix. Exemplary synthetic polymers which can be used to form the biodegradable delivery system include: polyamides, polycarbonates, polyalkylenes, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylene oxides, polyalkylene terepthalates, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl ethers, polyvinyl esters, poly-vinyl halides, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyglycolides, polysiloxanes, polyurethanes and co-polymers thereof, alkyl cellulose, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters, nitro celluloses, polymers of acrylic and methacrylic esters, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, carboxylethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, cellulose sulphate sodium salt, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), poly(octadecyl acrylate), polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(vinyl alcohols), polyvinyl acetate, poly vinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid, polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, poly(butic acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-cocaprolactone), and natural polymers such as alginate and other polysaccharides including dextran and cellulose, collagen, chemical derivatives thereof (substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alkyl, alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those skilled in the art), albumin and other hydrophilic proteins, zein and other prolamines and hydrophobic proteins, copolymers and mixtures thereof. In general, these materials degrade either by enzymatic hydrolysis or exposure to water in vivo, by surface or bulk erosion. Examples of non-biodegradable polymers include ethylene vinyl acetate, poly(meth)acrylic acid, polyamides, copolymers and mixtures thereof.","Bioadhesive polymers of particular interest include bioerodible hydrogels described by H. S. Sawhney, C. P. Pathak and J. A. Hubell in Macromolecules, (1993) 26:581-587, the teachings of which are incorporated herein, polyhyaluronic acids, casein, gelatin, glutin, polyanhydrides, polyacrylic acid, alginate, chitosan, poly(methyl methacrylates), poly(ethyl methacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate), poly(phenyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate), poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate).","In addition, important embodiments of the invention include pump-based hardware delivery systems, some of which are adapted for implantation. Such implantable pumps include controlled-release microchips. A preferred controlled-release microchip is described in Santini, J T Jr., et al., Nature, 1999, 397:335-338, the contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.","Use of a long-term sustained release implant may be particularly suitable for treatment of chronic conditions. Long-term release, are used herein, means that the implant is constructed and arranged to delivery therapeutic levels of the active ingredient for at least 30 days, and preferably 60 days. Long-term sustained release implants are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art and include some of the release systems described above. In certain embodiments, the agents of the invention are delivered directly to the site at which there is inflammation, e.g., the joints in the case of a subject with rheumatoid arthritis, the blood vessels of an atherosclerotic organ, etc. For example, this can be accomplished by attaching a ningalin to the surface of a balloon catheter; inserting the catheter into the subject until the balloon portion is located at the site of inflammation, e.g. an atherosclerotic vessel, and inflating the balloon to contact the balloon surface with the vessel wall at the site of the occlusion. In this manner, the compositions can be targeted locally to particular inflammatory sites to modulate immune cell migration to these sites. In another example the local administration involves an implantable pump to the site in need of such treatment. Preferred pumps are as described above. In a further example, when the treatment of an abscess is involved, the ningalins may be delivered topically, e.g., in an ointment\/dermal formulation. Optionally, the agents are delivered in combination with other therapeutic agents (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressant agents, etc.). Quantitative determination of synergism or antagonism is carried out with computerized analysis using the classic isobologram and the combination index of Chou and Taklay, Advances in Enzyme Regulation, 1984, 22, 27.","The preclinical and clinical therapeutic use of the compositions and methods of the present invention to ameliorate acute and chronic inflammatory disorders will be best accomplished by those of skill, employing accepted principles of diagnosis and treatment. Such principles are known in the art, and are set forth, for example, in Petersdorf, R. G. (1983).","Compositions and methods of the present invention are useful for treating a number of disorders associated with adverse immune responses (e.g., from exposure to an allergen or pathogen or transplantation of heterologous blood, organ or tissue).","Immune rejection is a major problem confronting organ transplantation. The principal approach to mitigate rejection is the pharmacological suppression of the immune system of an organ recipient. Methods of the invention further provide a means whereby the rejection of tissue or organs after transplantation can be prevented or controlled, thus prolonging the survival of the tissue or organ. Commonly transplanted organs include, but are not limited to, kidney, pancreas, liver, heart, intestines, lung, and bone marrow, as allograft or autologous compositions. Accordingly, immunosuppressive ningalin compositions of the present invention can be used to prevent or treat hyperacute, acute and chronic rejection of tissue (including blood) or organs.","Inflammation can be caused by an immune response against \u201cnon-self-antigens\u201d (including antigens of necrotic self-material), and the subject in need of treatment according to the invention is a transplant recipient. This is because after tissue (or organ) transplantation, certain antigens from the transplanted material can stimulate the production of immune lymphocytes and\/or autoantibodies, which later participate in inflammation\/rejection causing inflammation and aggravating the condition (Johnson et al., 1989, 19:238; Leinonen et al., 1990, 9:67; Montalban et al., 1991, 22:750).","Accordingly, immunosuppressive ningalins can be used in transplant settings, where cells or tissues to be transplanted can be treated prior to transplant into a subject in order to reduce the likelihood of rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Similarly, ningalins can be used to tolerize the immune system to an antigen that it would otherwise mount an immune response against, by administration prior to, simultaneously with or post transplantation.","Immunosuppressive agents often exert their effect by inhibiting the action of lymphokines; an important example is the capacity of cyclosporine to suppress the synthesis of interleukin-2 by inflammatory cells. In addition to their capacity to suppress the formation of eicosanoids, the glucocorticoids and some other compounds produce their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects by inhibiting the synthesis and action of several cytokines produced by inflammatory cells. Compounds such as histamine, bradykinin, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, prostaglandins and platelet-activating factor are known to be triggers of the inflammation processes. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that ningalins inhibit the activation and\/or proliferation of inflammatory cells in response to these, or other stimuli.","Combinations of drugs and treatment regimens are also contemplated by the invention. The ningalins of the invention can be administered alone or in combination with other therapeutic drugs, including those used in connection with organ rejection therapy and particularly including an immunosupressant. Specifically, ningalins may be administered with one or more drugs including, but not limited to adrenocorticosteroids, cyclosporin, tacrolimus (FK506), sirolimus (rapamycin), sulfasalazine, methoxsalen, methotrexate, mycophenolic acid (mycophenolate mofetil), everolimus, azathiprine, steroids and NOX-100. Administration regimens are described by \u201cImmunosuppressive Agents\u201d in Goodman & Gilman's \u201cThe pharmacological basis of therapeutics\u201d 9th Ed. (Hardman et al. eds) McGraw-Hill pp. 1264-1275 and the Physician's Desk Reference 58Ed., Thompson.","According to another embodiment, the invention provides compositions and methods that suppress inflammation arising from a implantation or transplantation of a material surface. Such methods involve ex vivo coating or loading material surfaces with one or more of the immunosuppressive ningalins provided herein. \u201cMaterial surfaces\u201d as used herein, include, but are not limited to, dental and orthopedic prosthetic implants, artificial valves, stents and organic implantable tissue such as an autologous, heterologous, allogeneic, or xenogenic tissue or organ or graft thereof.","Implantable prosthetic devices have been used in the surgical repair or replacement of internal tissue for many years. Orthopedic implants include a wide variety of devices, each suited to fulfill particular medical needs. Examples of such devices are hip joint replacement devices, knee joint replacement devices, shoulder joint replacement devices, and pins, braces and plates used to set fractured bones. Some contemporary orthopedic and dental implants use high performance metals such as cobalt-chrome and titanium alloy to achieve high strength. These materials are readily fabricated into the complex shapes typical of these devices using mature metal working techniques including casting and machining.","The material surface is coated with an amount of ningalin that can vary depending upon the desired therapeutic effect. In important embodiments, the material surface is part of an implant. In important embodiments, the material surface may also be coated with a cell growth potentiating agent, an anti-infective agent, and\/or an anti-inflammatory agent.","Within the scope of the invention, an adverse immune response can comprise an inflammatory response, but it is not so limited. The inflammatory response can be attributed to various diseases and conditions that affect one or more organs or organ systems including, but not Invited to, the peripheral nervous system, hematological system, bone marrow, the central nervous system, skin, appendix, gastrointestinal tract (including but not limited to esophagus, duodenum, and colon), respiratory\/pulmonary system (including but not limited to lung, nose, pharynx, larynx), eye, genito-reproductive system, gums, liver\/biliary ductal system, renal system (including but not limited to kidneys, urinary tract, bladder), connective tissue (including but not limited to joints, cartilage), cardiovascular system, muscle, heart, spleen, breast, lymphatic system, ear, endocrine\/exocrine system (including but not limited to lacrimal glands, salivary glands, thyroid gland, pancreas), and bone\/skeletal system.","Inflammatory diseases that affect the peripheral nervous system include, but are not limited to, radiculitis.

The generic name for molecules that cause an allergic reaction is allergen. There are numerous species of allergens. The allergic reaction occurs when tissue-sensitizing immunoglobulin of the IgE type reacts with foreign allergen. The IgE antibody is bound to mast cells and\/or basophils, and these specialized cells release chemical mediators (vasoactive amines) of the allergic reaction when stimulated to do so by allergens bridging the ends of the antibody molecule. Histamine, platelet activating factor, arachidonic acid metabolites, and serotonin are among the best known mediators of allergic reactions in man. Histamine and the other vasoactive amines are normally stored in mast cells and basophil leukocytes. The mast cells are dispersed throughout animal tissue and the basophils circulate within the vascular system. These cells manufacture and store histamine within the cell unless the specialized sequence of events involving IgE binding occurs to trigger its release.","The symptoms of the allergic reaction vary, depending on the location within the body where the IgE reacts with the antigen. If the reaction occurs along the respiratory epithelium the symptoms are sneezing, coughing and asthmatic reactions. If the interaction occurs in the digestive tract, as in the case of food allergies, abdominal pain and diarrhea are common. Systematic reactions, for example following a bee sting, can be severe and often life threatening.","Delayed type hypersensitivity, also known as type IV allergy reaction is an allergic reaction characterized by a delay period of at least 12 hours from invasion of the antigen into the allergic subject until appearance of the inflammatory or immune reaction. The T lymphocytes (sensitized T lymphocytes) of individuals in an allergic condition react with the antigen, triggering the T lymphocytes to release lymphokines (macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), macrophage activating factor (MAF), mitogenic factor (MF), skin-reactive factor (SRF), chemotactic factor, neovascularization-accelerating factor, etc.), which function as inflammation mediators, and the biological activity of these lymphokines, together with the direct and indirect effects of locally appearing lymphocytes and other inflammatory immune cells, give rise to the type IV allergy reaction. Delayed allergy reactions include tuberculin type reaction, homograft rejection reaction, cell-dependent type protective reaction, contact dermatitis hypersensitivity reaction, and the like, which are known to be most strongly suppressed by steroidal agents. Consequently, steroidal agents are effective against diseases which are caused by delayed allergy reactions. Long-term use of steroidal agents at concentrations currently being used can, however, lead to the serious side-effect known as steroid dependence. The methods of the invention solve some of these problems, by providing for lower and fewer doses to be administered.","Allergic conditions or diseases in humans include but are not limited to eczema, allergic rhinitis or coryza, hay fever, conjunctivitis, bronchial or allergic asthma, urticaria (hives) and food allergies; atopic dermatitis; anaphylaxis; drug allergy; angioedema; and allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic diseases in dogs include but are not limited to seasonal dermatitis; perennial dermatitis; rhinitis: conjunctivitis; allergic asthma; and drug reactions. Allergic diseases in cats include but are not limited to dermatitis and respiratory disorders; and food allergens. Allergic diseases in horses include but are not limited to respiratory disorders such as \u201cheaves\u201d and dermatitis. Allergic diseases in non-human primates include but are not limited to allergic asthma and allergic dermatitis.","Immediate immune hypersensitivity (or anaphylactic response) is a form of allergic reaction which develops very quickly, i.e. within seconds or minutes of exposure of the patient to the causative allergen, and it is mediated by IgE antibodies made by B lymphocytes. In nonallergic patients, there is no IgE antibody of clinical relevance; but, in a person suffering with allergic diseases, IgE antibody mediates immediate hypersensitivity by sensitizing mast cells which are abundant in the skin, lymphoid organs, in the membranes of the eye, nose and mouth, and in the respiratory tract and intestines.","Mast cells have surface receptors for IgE, and the IgE antibodies in allergy-suffering patients become bound to them. As discussed briefly above, when the bound IgE is subsequently contacted by the appropriate allergen, the mast cell is caused to degranulate and to release various substances called bioactive mediators, such as histamine, into the surrounding tissue. It is the biologic activity of these substances which is responsible for the clinical symptoms typical of immediate hypersensitivity; namely, contraction of smooth muscle in the airways or the intestine, the dilation of small blood vessels and the increase in their permeability to water and plasma proteins, the secretion of thick sticky mucus, and in the skin, redness, swelling and the stimulation of nerve endings that results in itching or pain.","Many allergies are caused by IgE antibody generation against harmless allergens.","The types of antibodies associated with a Th1 response are generally more protective because they have high neutralization and opsonization capabilities. Th2 responses involve predominately antibodies and these have less protective effect against infection and some Th2 isotypes (e.g., IgE) are associated with allergy. Strongly polarized Th1 and Th2 responses not only play different roles in protection, they can promote different immunopathological reactions. Th1-type responses are involved organ specific autoimmunity such as experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (Dubey et al, 1991, Eur Cytokine Network 2: 147-152), experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) (Beraud et al, 1991, Cell Immunol 133: 379-389) and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Hahn et al, 1987, 18: 2037-2042), in contact dermatitis (Kapsenberg et al, Immunol Today 12: 392-395), and in some chronic inflammatory disorders. In contrast Th2-type responses are responsible for triggering allergic atopic disorders (against common environmental allergens) such as allergic asthma (Walker et al, 1992, Am Rev Resp Dis 148: 109-115) and atopic dermatitis (van der Heijden et al, 1991, J Invest Derm 97: 389-394), are thought to exacerbate infection with tissue-dwelling protozoa such as helminths (Finkelman et al, 1991, Immunoparasitol Today 12: A62-66) and (Caceres-Dittmar et al, 1993, Clin Exp Immunol 91: 500-505), are preferentially induced in certain primary immunodeficiencies such as hyper-IgE syndrome (Del Prete et al, 1989, J Clin Invest 84: 1830-1835) and Omenn's syndrome (Schandene et al, 1993, Eur J Immunol 23: 56-60), and are associated with reduced ability to suppress HIV replication (Barker et al, 1995, Proc Soc Nat Acad Sci USA 92: 11135-11139).","Thus, in general, it appears that allergic diseases are mediated by Th2 type immune responses. Th2 cytokines, especially IL-4 and IL-5 are elevated in the airways of asthmatic subjects. These cytokines promote important aspects of the asthmatic inflammatory response, including IgE isotype switching, eosinophil chemotaxis and activation, and mast cell growth. Th1 cytokines, especially IFN-g and IL-12, can suppress the formation of Th2 clones and production of Th2 cytokines.","An \u201callergen\u201d as used herein is a molecule capable of provoking an immune response characterized by production of IgE. Thus, in the context of this invention, the term allergen means a specific type of antigen which can trigger an allergic response which is mediated by IgE antibody. The method and preparations of this invention extend to a broad class of such allergens and fragments of allergens or haptens acting as allergens.

The recipients' native kidneys were removed on the day of transplantation. Animals that died within three days after transplantation were excluded from the analysis (less than 5%).","Kidney Transplantation in Rats","The effect of N5 (administered in DMSO, 20 mg\/kg, i.p.
