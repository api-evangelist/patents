{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This invention relates in general to the automation and distribution of programming information including video, audio, text, and graphics to a large number of program viewers located over a large geographic area. More particularly, it is directed to an integrated, automated production and distribution system for providing customized delivery of digital streaming media to particular geographic areas, markets, groups and\/or individuals via remotely controlled origination nodes.","Prior to the late seventies, television broadcasting was primarily a static industry whose production and distribution techniques remained largely unchanged since the days of Milton Berle and \u201cI Love Lucy.\u201d Even with the advent of color television, the techniques through which ABC, CBS and NBC produced and distributed its network programming remained the same. Using analog and\/or manually operated cameras, video tape recorders, playback machines, switchers, lighting and editing systems, these networks generated national programming combined with national commercial content. Programming was distributed to the networks' owned and operated, as well as affiliated TV stations, via national and regional terrestrial microwave systems operated by companies such as AT&T, WTCI, MRC and Western Union\/CPI.","Sectionalization of the national TV Networks; i.e., delivery of programming and\/or commercial content intended for a specific region and\/or time zone, was accomplished by creating ring networks out of the national microwave distribution system by ordering part time \u201cbridging circuits\u201d and \u201crolling over\u201d numerous tape machines at strategic locations in the national microwave network. For example, programming with the appropriate commercial insertions would be transmitted to the stations between New York City and the Chicago TV affiliate. In Chicago, two manually operated tape machines with commercial content and\/or programming destined for the TV affiliates between Chicago and Washington, D.C., as well as for TV affiliates to the west of Chicago, provided the facilities to create two regional Network feeds. The first manually controlled tape machine would \u201croll over\u201d the New York feed and transmit via a \u201cbridging circuit\u201d connected to microwave facilities on the national network between Chicago and Washington, D.C. In turn, the Washington, D.C. affiliate would have another manually controlled tape machine with commercial and program content destined for the TV affiliates in the Southeast ready to \u201croll over\u201d the Chicago feed. Meanwhile, the second video tape machine at the Chicago TV affiliate would also \u201croll over\u201d the New York feed and replace it with commercial and\/or program content destined for the TV affiliates to the west of Chicago. Likewise, this technique would be used repeatedly in locations such as Birmingham, Wichita, Denver and other such cities across the network until the programming was sectionalized as desired across the network.","In order to perform switches between national and regional programming without noticeable interruption to the home television viewers, a period of available time was allocated for manually controlled local commercial insertion otherwise know as \u201clocal avails.\u201d At each of the networks' local affiliates these \u201clocal avails\u201d were used as a \u201cwindow\u201d in which sectionalization of the network could occur.","In addition, AT&T and the other terrestrial microwave providers supported these scheduled sectionaliztions of the various national TV Networks by manually executing time-based switching of the microwave network during these scheduled \u201clocal avails.\u201d For example, an AT&T network technician would literally run between the racks of communications equipment at certain bridging locations with a patch cord in order to provide the necessary \u201cbridging circuits\u201d during the predetermined \u201clocal avail.\u201d","With the advent and commercialization of satellite technology in the United States in the 1970's, ABC, CBS, NBC and the Public Broadcasting System all converted their terrestrial microwave distribution systems to satellite distribution during the early 1980's. In general, this decision was made due to the superior economics and flexibility of satellite technologies. As a result, new techniques and support systems needed to be developed in order to accomplish sectionalization and\/or customization of the national TV networks.","As a result, the television broadcasting system generally changed from a serial, terrestrial network connecting stations to each other one-by-one via microwave towers, to a point-to-multi-point network where each sectional group was connected directly to the network origination earth station via a satellite link. Accordingly, each sectional group required a separate transponder to receive its designated commercial and programming content. Moreover, just as with a serial network configuration, each of the Network's TV affiliates continued to use its \u201clocal avail\u201d as a \u201cwindow\u201d in which to switch between national, regional and local programming.","In addition, the transition of the U.S. terrestrial TV networks to satellite distribution created the first requirements for computer automation, management, coordination, monitoring, and control systems. The challenge of meeting these requirements resulted in further developments in technology. For example, computerized booking, scheduling and financial management of satellite and telecommunications facilities, origination earth stations, transponders and affiliate receive earth stations, local channels, long distance terrestrial facilities, to name a few, were developed. These systems were typically developed to (1) control and manage the inventory of telecommunications facilities to avoid \u201coverbooking\u201d two users for the same facility, (2) allow allocation of facility charges to be applied to the various network users both internal and external to the respective networks, and to (3) analyze usage to better manage existing facilities, as well as to plan future facilities. The transmission automation systems could also be used to switch facilities and thereby reroute video, audio and data services.","In general, the satellite network control systems installed in the early 1980's and used by the likes of ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS have changed little since their original installation. As the computer technology became more widely available and used computerized network control systems were developed. In the respective broadcast centers of these networks in New York and Washington, D.C., a master computer system capable of transmitting low speed data via either the Vertical Blanking Interval (\u201cVBI\u201d) or a Single Channel Per Carrier (\u201cSCPC\u201d) transport system sends customized data streams to TV affiliate satellite receivers. This transmitted data instructs the various TV affiliate earth stations to perform a number of functions such as: (1) configuring the TV affiliate earth station to receive the appropriate TV programming by instructing it to point at a specific satellite and tune to a particular transponder and\/or center frequency, (2) updating time based schedules and synchronize affiliate clocks, (3) updating network restoral procedures; i.e., instructions as to what to do if the inbound data channel and\/or programming channel is lost due to a catastrophic satellite failure, (4) periodic-reporting instructions back to the master computer system via terrestrial data channels such as X.25 packet nets and later frame relay and\/or ATM, (5) reporting back to the master computer system as to the status of various components of the affiliate earth station and control system.","Another condition created by the transition to a point-to-multi-point, satellite distribution system was that unauthorized access or \u201cpiracy\u201d of programming became an issue. Nearly impossible in a terrestrial, point-to-point microwave system, satellite distribution enabled the \u201cpiracy\u201d of programming out of market from major league sporting events, premium cable as well as pay-per-view (PPV) programming. In response, encryption and conditional access systems have been developed. In early implementations Scientific Atlanta B-Mac and General Instrument VideoCypher \u201cscrambling\u201d products were utilized for these purposes. Today, these systems are still in wide use in analog, satellite distribution systems. In general, it can be said that B-Mac was and is utilized more in Europe while VideoCypher was and is utilized more in the United States.","With the development and installation of digital video compression and transmission systems designed for TV, Cable, PPV and DTH program networks in the 1990's, a new generation of encryption and conditional access products has been developed for them. As with the analog encryption products, Scientific Atlanta and General Instruments own the largest U.S. market share for broadcast quality, video compression products with their PowerVu and DigiCypher product lines both of which come bundled with their own conditional access systems.","Outside of the U.S., DVB standards-based video compression systems are the most common. In addition, numerous DVB compatible conditional access systems have been developed by companies such as Nagra, Iredeto, NDS, Telenor, France Telecom, etc. In general, these systems monitor and control the authorization of full-time, occasional, and\/or PPV programming and group de-authorization of major league sports for \u201cblackouts\u201d in local markets.","Regarding the key based encryption and conditional access techniques used for the distribution of broadcast quality programming, existing networks utilize systems that were developed for use with broadcast networks; i.e., systems that are configured in either a point-to-point or point-to-multi-point fashion. In short, the programming is encrypted at one end of a transmission link and decrypted at the other end. This being the case, current program distribution networks do not pass encrypted programming through one headend and have it decrypted at an appropriate, downstream headend. During the 1980's and 1990's, the increasing availability and affordability of mini and personal computer computing systems allowed the TV and Cable Networks to automate more and more manual broadcast operations. For example, traffic and station management systems were developed to manage commercial sales and programming contracts as well as to create the daily program schedules and \u201cas run\u201d logs. In short, these systems concentrated on the financial and operational aspects of revenue and expenses; i.e., revenue generating commercials and programming. Originally implemented on mainframe computers, systems of this type are now available on mini and high-end personal computing platforms. Videotape library systems were developed to manage the archival, duplication and usage of video taped programs. Manpower & facility scheduling systems were developed to schedule and analyze the usage of technical manpower and facilities such as studios, tape machines, edit rooms, graphics effects, etc. Network playback automation computers scheduled videotape and\/or file server based network playback devices were also developed to reduce the cost and increase the reliability of network playback operations. Studio Automation\/Robotics have been used to automate studio lighting and the remote control of camera operations. Newsroom Automation computers and digital video and audio technologies have also been developed to increase the efficiency of newsroom operations; i.e., the coordination and integration of file server, edit and story creation subsystems for the purpose of minimizing the time and effort required to create TV programming. Still & Animated Graphics enable the creation, manipulation and management of computer generated, digital graphics. Digital video compression & transmission provide a means by which the digital bandwidth required to transport video of a certain quality is reduced. Current techniques utilize Discrete Cosine Transfer (DCT) algorithms and standards based formats such as MPEG, JPEG, etc.","Today, network distribution of broadcast quality television programming via terrestrial TV, cable MSO (Multiple System Operator) or DTH (Direct To Home) systems is still accomplished primarily by analog, satellite distribution. Over the past two decades as these broadcast TV technologies have developed, the number of new broadcast, cable and DTH channels has increased from four national networks to hundreds of free, premium and pay-per-view channels. As a general rule of thumb, the newer networks tend to use more of the digital and automation technologies. For example, practically all new networks utilize digital video transmission while to this day, ABC, CBS and NBC, utilize analog satellite distribution for their main network feeds.","Even with the automation and digitization of the TV production and distribution process that has occurred over the last couple of decades, the means of distributing and sectionalizing TV Networks remains essentially the same. Currently, land mass and\/or international distribution of \u201cbroadcast quality\u201d television is accomplished via satellite. All of these networks are point-to-multi-point networks that employ two alternatives when injecting local and\/or regional programming. Either multiple feeds are provided from the network uplink and switched between local commercials or program content is, injected at a local retransmit site such as a cable headend or terrestrial TV station. In both cases, the national and local content is almost always displayed in a common, \u201cfull screen\u201d format with the primary exception being the Bloomberg Network which injects national commercials in the video \u201cwindow\u201d in their multi-part screen format and local commercials at cable headends in a \u201cfull screen\u201d format.","These existing systems address basic requirements such as the ability to reduce the digital bandwidth necessary to carry a video signal of any given quality, the ability to transport these: digitally compressed video and audio signals via standard digital transmission and modulation systems whether satellite, fiber, wireless and\/or Internet based, and the ability to scramble and control individual authorization of groups and\/or specific satellite receivers over a point-to-point and\/or multi-point system via the use of key based conditional access and encryption technologies. In most cases, the network and\/or regional\/sectional programming is distributed from a network headend facility directly to the appropriate redistribution headend. In other words, TV networks are not designed to forward the appropriate program elements both real-time and stored to an automated, remote origination node for customized production, coordination and distribution of broadcast quality localized programming via terrestrial TV, cable MSO, DTH headend, internet web servers and\/or home based processing unit","With newly launched TV networks, however, the utilization of digital, video compression, conditional access as well as transmission techniques is virtually assured. Previous networks have used one or more combinations of existing analog, satellite distribution, or a hybrid digital, analog approach to transmitting real-time programming and program elements to a headend for retransmission and customized programming for local delivery by inserting full screen graphics and\/or video. Even with the utilization of these new technologies, significantly more in the way of integration of digital technologies and product features that can be developed.","Currently, little has been done to implement a comprehensive integration of the various automated and\/or digitized portions of the network. While traffic, news room, and playback production automation systems have been integrated to a large degree, little beyond this has been accomplished. The automation systems may extend beyond the production and transmission facilities as network integration advances. Further efficiencies may be realized as the production and broadcast distribution of programming is further integrated and automated using today's technology and future evolving technologies. Further efficiencies in integration and automation will allow greater economy in delivering programming as well as providing greater flexibility in the programming that can be provided. Moreover, as the convergence of computer, TV and telecommunications technologies evolves, broader and broader integration of these automated subsystems will be required to deliver the programming of the next generation.","The exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide an integrated streaming media system capable of generating and distributing broadcast quality streaming media content to a large number of remote nodes located over a large geographic area. In the exemplary embodiments, the network automation and integration may extend beyond the production and generation facilities to extend the capability of centrally scheduled network control to remote locations, if necessary, where programming content can be specifically customized for the particular remote location and\/or region. The exemplary embodiments described herein are numerous and have many different aspects and embodiments, any of which may be practiced by alone or in combination with other aspects of the invention.","According to an exemplary embodiment, the streaming media generation and distribution system includes a broadcast or Network Operations Center, a digital distribution system, and Remote Channel Origination Nodes. The Network Operations Center operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and houses the broadcast, production, technical and programming operations of the network. From a wide variety of information sources, the Network Operations Center creates the digital streaming media program content carried by a digital streaming media encapsulated by the IP for distribution to the remote nodes over the satellite network. Preferably, the facility will support the acquisition of programming and information to create the live programming for distribution via encapsulated IP transport techniques.","In the exemplary embodiment, the digital streaming media program content includes weather information data, but in other embodiments may take other forms including news, sports and entertainment programming. The exemplary program production preferably includes acquiring weather information data and graphic feeds from weather information service providers combined with additional data to create the desired programming content. The exemplary system creates a single digital streaming media or digital carrier utilizing encapsulated IP transport techniques to enable the carrying of video, audio, and graphics elements composited to create the delivered multi-window display of the weather information program. The multi-window display screen will preferably be comprised of national, regional and local weather information displayed in different windows of the display screen. The main or primary window of the multi-part screen will switch between different weather forecast segments including national programming segments featuring live on-screen presenters and local segments including graphics and off-camera narration. During the local and regional reports without a live on-camera reporter, an audio narration will be available. The audio will service the particular regional and local segments, with each geographic area receiving an individualized audio narrative explaining and detailing the particular graphics in the primary window.","The network operation center preferably includes a Network Automation and Integration subsystem and Network Monitor Distribution and Control subsystem with specialized computer automated and networked components to digitally assemble the programming components to implement the multi-window program display. The Network Automation and Integration preferably manages the \u201cmulti-channel\u201d origination to the remote nodes and coordinates with automated production systems to create the different segments for the multi-part screen with the individualized audio narratives. The facility preferably includes multiple production areas to enable the concurrent production of regional and local weather segments. The automated production systems preferably mange the incoming information, such as weather data, and digitally distribute it to the different production areas for re-formatting and editing.","According to another aspect of the invention, the digital streaming media and encapsulated IP transport layer carries a plurality of program elements and\/or components necessary to create a multi-window video display composed of a plurality of display windows and elements containing different multimedia programming content such as video, audio, graphics, text, etc. Moreover, the programming content carried by the encapsulated IP transport layer can be supplemented with program elements or components from a variety of different sources, including those external to the network infrastructure. Program elements such as live, taped and\/or stored video, audio and\/or graphics may be introduced into the remote channel origination process by way of physical interfaces to a network RCON in order to provide the final broadcast quality, streaming media product in such a way that the multi-part screen display windows may include different national, local and specialty programming as well as locally inserted content. The programming content is thus preferably tailored to groups, subgroups and individuals receiving the streaming content by way of network RCONs across different geographic areas or markets that forward the finished product to retransmission stations, cable and\/or Direct To Home (\u201cDTH\u201d) headends, web servers and\/or home based processing units for final distribution and\/or viewing as further described herein.","According to an embodiment of the invention, a number of automated subsystems for the purpose of creating, distributing, monitoring and controlling interactive and\/or transactional, streaming media content are integrated to provide customized programming content for individual viewers. In the exemplary embodiment, the Network Automation and Integration function internal to the central Network Operation Center (\u201cNOC\u201d) preferably provide the primary means through which NOC subsystems are able to (1) communicate with each other, (2) transfer program elements among each other, (3) maintain version control of program elements, (4) synchronize subsystems to enable the frame accurate compilation of program elements by network RCONs and (5) ensure efficient, timely, accurate and reliable delivery of program elements to network RCONs.

The interactive\/transactional system allows commercial partners to offer products or services to viewers to purchase or select to obtain more information. According to another aspect of the invention, transactional streaming media may allow viewers to select and then conduct a transaction such as allowing the viewer to request or provide further information or purchase a product or service offered to the viewer. The transactional system allows viewers who wish to purchase the product to conduct an electronic commerce transaction to execute the purchase.","These interactive\/transactional components are carried and distributed by a digital transmission system utilizing encapsulated IP techniques. This method allows the appropriate interactive applications and data elements to be distributed to a specific, predetermined headend via a specific, predetermined remote node. In this way, an effective overlay, virtual private network (\u201cVPN\u201d) is constructed to deliver the appropriate interactive components to the appropriate headend device through a network Remote Channel Origination Node (\u201cRCON\u201d) via vendor specified physical interfaces to digital tier, cable headend equipment.","According to another aspect of the invention, an automated production facility includes automated generation and compilation of pre-recorded audio phrases to create customized audio content. An audio concatenation engine will allow an operator to assemble pre-recorded audio phrases to produce local audio segments with a minimum of personnel and overhead, thus resulting in a cost and time savings to the system operator.","The exemplary network operations center preferably supports and synchronizes local insertion at the remote nodes to offer \u201clocal avail\u201d opportunities. For example, the system will be developed to support the delivery of localized weather information with audio and data, where each of the remote nodes receiving specific weather data and commercials. The network will preferably deploy insertion capabilities at the remote nodes to enable insertion of local weather programming in addition to local advertising. Preferably, the insertion capability is controlled from the network operations center using a Graphical User Interface application software to enable an operator to integrate, create, edit and control the streaming media content. The Graphical User Interface software provides a system operator with a means to remotely control the streaming media as it is generated by the network RCON for final distribution. Preferably, the software enables the network automation and integration subsystem to synchronize the timing and display of various national and local programming information at the various receiving nodes as is described in more detail herein.","The network distribution and management will enable each of the remote nodes to receive program content and generate customized programming. In this embodiment, the remote content origination nodes are capable of creating the local programming from the received program content according to a program schedule that is centrally generated from the channel, traffic & contract management subsystem internal to the network operations center. Local commercial and\/or program insertion is integrated by standard cueing techniques such as use of contact closures and\/or tone based switching as well as central scheduling of local playback or insertion facilities.","According to another aspect of the invention, IP (Internet Protocol) encrypted transmission techniques are utilized for simultaneous distribution of streaming media and store & forward components on serial, point-to-multi-point and\/or hybrid networks. Preferably, the programming stream will be formatted to enable the multiplexing of a plurality of data streams and\/or components for encoding into an IP addressable data stream. IP encryption and conditional access techniques are used to distribute streaming media components. Using the IP technology for delivering the digital program stream provides the network with versatility to deliver highly customized programming for specific geographical areas via a wide variety of network configurations","The disclosed embodiments provide many new features and advantages for generating, integrating and distributing information content and customized programming over a large geographic area. The automated subsystems at the network operations center provides for greater levels of network integration and enables an all-digital production facility allowing greater levels of integration and automation to enable more efficient operation of the system with fewer personnel headcount resulting in substantial savings to the system operator. The digital streaming media and IP techniques allows all information, video, audio, data and control information to be distributed through a common digital format. The remote nodes located at the remote locations throughout the geographic area allows locally customized programming to be assembled from national program components and information components assembled with local data or locally produced programming. Control of the programming at the remote nodes may be controlled from the NOC system using a variety application software programs and hardware including networked client-server workstations, file servers, databases, etc.","A Graphical User Interface (GUI) software application program enables the scheduling, configuration, monitoring and control of programming content from a central location. The GUI provides a convenient mechanism for an operator to control, cue and synchronize the programming displayed at remote node. The control and synchronization information can be transmitted to the remote nodes as a component of the multiplexed digital streaming media. A plurality of Graphical User Interface processes can control the multi-window screen display at the remote locations.","The disclosed embodiments provide a number of advantages in implementing a digital transmission system. The automated subsystems provide integration that enables the system operator to achieve efficiency and operational cost savings in delivering customized broadcast quality digital television programming to individual remote locations and nodes. The automated production of audio narration allows the production of voice segments without requiring live on-air personnel. The GUI allows an operator to control, cue and synchronize the programming displayed at remote locations that can be carried by the encapsulated digital streaming media.","The IP encapsulated digital streaming media is single multiplexed pipe that carries broadcast quality programming content to the remote locations and controls the assembly of the programming with locally provided information to create a multi-window television screen display from the Network Operation Center. The encapsulated digital streaming media may also carry components to implement interactive and transactional programming to enable viewers to dynamically select items to viewer, obtain additional desired information and complete electronic commercial transactions for services or goods. Using the embodiments and teachings disclosed herein, greater flexibility in providing customized programming at a low cost can be achieved.","The foregoing and other features and advantages of an illustrative embodiment of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description, which proceeds with references to the accompanying drawings.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["50","50"]},"The streaming media distribution system  of the present embodiment integrates a variety of live, rendered and stored program elements, real-time data with taped and\/or stored programming, stored and rendered graphics and live & stored local program content and\/or effects to provide customized local programming content, programming elements and system components that can be used to provide broadcast-quality streaming media.

The Severe Weather Window may appear in any of the windows , , , or be shown in its own window, or otherwise appear as a \u201cpop-up\u201d window to highlight severe weather warnings and watches.","In addition to the various display windows described above, a number of information displays may also be provided for viewers as well. For example, at the bottom  of the display screen  is a 2-line graphic displaying current temperatures and weather conditions for cities throughout the country and the world. This Current Information Display window  may feature current weather observations for primary and secondary cities within the region that are also covered in the other windows , . The weather observations may include temperature, humidity, wind speed, barometric pressure, and a preciptation report. The Current Information Display window  may also feature a local conditions continuous display  that continuously updates the observed local weather conditions. During severe weather, this window  can also be used to display National Weather Service issued (\u201cNWS\u201d) advisories, watches and warnings.","It should be understood that, although this embodiment illustrates the multi-window screen display as a two-dimensional display for purposes of clarity, in an interactive television embodiment, the multi-window display, is a three-dimensional display with the ability to view additional programming as selected and driven by the viewer. The viewer may manipulate a screen cursor  though a remote control device to select objects , , ,  in the multi-window display to obtain more information about that object or view any additional programming associated with that object. For example, the WeatherPLUS logo  may be selected by the cursor  whereupon a graphic or video clip may \u201cpop up\u201d (not shown) or appear in a portion of the screen to explain and describe to the viewer more about WeatherPLUS and who or what WeatherPLUS is. The pop up may offer still further choices about accessing more information such as a web page or contacting the company. The DopplerPLUS logo  may be selected and an informational video clip describing what Doppler Radar is and its significance is may be run. In a similar manner a pop up scroll bar may offer numerous different types information ranging from sports scores to traffic travel times, airline flight arrival departure times, gaming and on-line auctions. The selection of items may be provided interactively by viewers such that viewers can dynamically tailor and drive the programming much like a computer user in moving through his desktop or through the Internet. In this case, broadcast quality television rather than computer graphics is utilized.","As shown in , the television weather programming shown in the Active Video & Graphics Window  of  is preferably divided into a sequence of periodically repeating program segments , , , , , and . Each segment shows a different programming segment or \u201cstory board\u201d as illustrated in the timeline representation of . Preferably, the system programming enables a network to run essentially live 365 days per year from a central production factory\/broadcast center with a constantly rotating schedule of national and local weather reports and features for the multi-window display. As can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the multi-window displays significantly complicates the programming by increasing the number of necessary programming schedules. For example, each of the multiple display windows may require a programming schedule such as shown in , resulting in a plurality of overlapping program schedules that must be simultaneously generated and maintained. Discussed below is an exemplary program schedule.","For example, during the first 4 minutes of the displayed program cycle, an hour in this embodiment, a Version A of different zoned weather programs  are shown to viewers in the different geographic areas. For example, in the illustrative embodiment different programming is shown for New York, Boston, Miami, Chicago and Atlanta. It should be understood that the described examples are merely illustrative and not meant to be exclusive or exhaustive and other types of programming to a number of other geographic or non geographic markets may be implemented. In addition to the markets shown, a greater number of local markets such as Philadelphia, Denver, Los Angeles may also be included.","At the 4 minute mark in this embodiment, a national feed  is transmitted to be seen by all viewers. The national feed  typically includes programming features of general interest that is seen by all viewers featuring a live on-camera presenter as seen in the main program window  . At the 10 minute mark, the program content switches to a version B zoned weather  which provides specific programming for different geographic areas as described above.  shows an expanded view  of the specific programming schedule provided to particular geographic areas, in this example a local vignette for the Atlanta, Ga viewing area. In this exemplary embodiment, the local vignette begins with historical weather  information for the Atlanta viewing area followed by current conditions , a regional satellite loop , 3-dimensional fly-through regional satellite\/radar , a commercial , current and forecast map , , and a 5-day local forecast .","It should be understood that the expanded view - of the specific programming for a particular geographic area includes a programming schedules for each desired geographic area, resulting in a plurality of overlapping programming schedules for a given time slot. These program schedules can be implemented by media streams carried in a multiplexed streaming media and by locally sourced program content as described herein. The plurality of various programming schedules and the necessary programming content to be carried by the streaming media to execute the programming schedule can be implemented by the embodiments further described herein.","Shown in  is another depiction of the an exemplary Daily Programming Grid  illustrating the \u201cmacro\u201d scheduling matrix for a \u201ctypical\u201d seven day period during the of network operation. The days of the week  are arrayed along the horizontal access and the hours of the week  vertical axis. To complete programming for an entire year would require a plurality of 52 such program schedules. The programming schedule  is actually designed to be day and weekend sensitive, recognizing that there are likely to be different viewers and different viewer interests at different times of the day and on different days of the week. Furthermore, being a live service with the requirement of serving all four time zones in the United States simultaneously, these fine adjustments to the programming mix need themselves to be moderated for different viewer requirements for different parts of the country at the same time.","Overall, the programming scheduling grid  preferably employs a matrix or \u201chorizontal grid\u201d programming strategy imbuing the schedule with a high degree of regularity and predictability in the programming schedule on a day-to-day, hour-by-hour basis. In this way, viewers will know what programming to expect at any specific time in the day and can tune in appropriately. Moreover, this consistency may be carried over into the way program segments are arrayed within each hour, as will be demonstrated below. Such consistency may be an important aspect of programming in a cable network environment; viewers come to count on seeing what they expect when they tune in at a certain time.","To accommodate programming in multiple time zones from a common national feed, the programming grid  establishes a pattern of programming in three-hour blocks, the formats (but not necessarily the content) of which are then repeated for the benefit of the western time zone. On weekdays until the evening hours, an \u201cA-A, B-B\u201d repeating pattern is set so that the eastern and western time zone viewers get the same type of programming available at the same hour, i.e., the Morning Weather show from 6:00 am to 9:00 am, and the Daily Weather show from 9:00 am to noon. On weekday and Sunday evenings, an \u201cA-B-A\u201d pattern is used so that the same content is available to both coastal time zones between 6:00 p.m. and midnight, albeit in a reverse sequence order. These patterns are fairly subtle, as the great preponderance of weather reporting and forecast material being telecast is live in every instance. However, where there is the ability to reuse segments, such as features, games and shopping shows, these will tend to originate in an \u201cA\u201d block and repeat in the \u201cB,\u201d with some of the more durable elements coursing through the schedule and repeating several hours or several days later. On Saturday and on Sunday until evening, the more relaxed Daily Weather format is used continuously, with many of the less time-sensitive weekday features inserted on tape.","A number of programming considerations and principles can be used in the development of programming criteria scheduling. For example, in the early morning hours, the programming will be tuned to viewers who need current weather information to help them plan their day. Accordingly, there is an emphasis on immediate conditions, present-day and five-day forecasts, practical guidance (commuting conditions, domestic and international business travel updates, what to wear) and expected conditions in popular recreational areas during the upcoming weekend. The local segments are bright and upbeat in the manner of morning drive radio.","During the daytime and on weekends, the programming preferably relaxes and adopts a less intense pace. The typical \u201cbusiness weather\u201d features are preferably augmented with greater coverage of leisure travel destinations and injecting fun elements into the schedule such as a call-in weather game (with prizes) and a shopping segment that may sell everything connected with weather, from gargoyle outdoor thermometers to folding umbrellas and miracle car window defoggers.","During the evening and prime time hours, the schedule gradually shifts back to the morning's pattern and intensity, with an emphasis on \u201ctomorrow's weather\u201d and business travel conditions. In the deep overnight hours, say 3:00 am-6:00 am eastern, the prime time sequence will be rebroadcast from tape, unless there is breaking weather to cover in which case live insertions will be made as appropriate in the national and impacted local segments.","The minute-by-minute rundowns of the four different types of hours shown on the daily grid rundowns show the subtle pacing and content differences between the various formats, while still allowing certain major events to occur at the same place in each hour of each day. For example, in the exemplary embodiment the Local Weather segments always begin on the \u201czeroes,\u201d six times each hour. These segments last for four minutes, including a commercial break that divides the \u201creport\u201d from the \u201cfeature\u201d elements. National Weather Report segments always begin on the \u201cfours,\u201d typically running for two minutes, followed by four minutes of feature material and commercials. Recreational Weather one minute updates are always found at 15 minutes after and 15 minutes before the hour. Severe Weather Reports, beyond what is in the Severe Weather panel of the split screen and what is included in the national reports, is always at 18 and 48 minutes after the hour, if there is anything to report. If there is not, a \u201ccanned\u201d feature may be inserted.","A strategy driving the hourly positioning of segments is providing the viewer with a logical, easy-to-understand and recall, predictable and reliable format so they know when and where to find the information they need and want. A second inherent strategy is to keep the pacing lively and up-tempo, which these short segments do. But underlying this is the essential third key strategy of keeping the viewer \u201chooked\u201d for a minimum of 15 minutes, so that their viewing shows up in Nielsen ratings. To accomplish this, the local and national segments are produced in an \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d sub format, with enough different information in each that it is necessary to watch two consecutive local and two national segments to get the \u201cwhole story.\u201d The presenters will adroitly tease and point from one segment to the next to encourage this essential continuity of viewing (without annoying viewers in the process).","These formats result in the following allocation of the program hour among the various types of segments:\n\n","Shown in Table A below is a walk through of a typical programming hour, by way of a illustration:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0088","num":"0095"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"189pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE A"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Minute","Description"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[":00","At the top of each hour, the first (\u201cA\u201d) of two linked Local"]},{"entry":[{},"Weather segments runs.

Data Analysis and Graphics  receives data  to produce programming content using information from an external or internal source through Data Gathering Analysis and Modeling  such as news, sports, entertainment or other information. Preferably, the Data Gathering Analysis and Modeling  provides the interface to receive information from external sources and information services supplying information and data to prepare programming content. The particular information sources and data will depend on the particular application. Data Gathering Analysis and Modeling  may utilize different interfaces depending on the particular external source and the immediacy of the information. In the exemplary embodiment, for example, a news service, sports information service or a weather information service utilizes a satellite distribution network to transmit updated news sports and weather information. In addition terrestrial landlines may also be used as a backup facility. Hardware and Software Design and Development ,  may be utilized to develop software and hardware applications to process the data and develop information to develop programming content. The outcome of the Hardware and Software Design and Development process ,  is the integration of hardware and software elements into a marketable product as exemplified by the Product Development and Integration process  or other production areas for processing and production as will be further described herein. After the product is developed and integrated,  the actual distribution of the product requires the on site installation of hardware, software and communications systems necessary to receive data, create products and remotely manage monitoring, control and maintenance tasks which is exemplified in this case by  Weather Data, Analysis, Forecasts & Graphics .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0093","num":"0100"},"figref":"FIG. 4B","b":["100","100","110","120","140","110","120"]},"As seen in , data is collected from a plurality of meteorological gathering sites over a number of different geographical areas and transmitted to the system. A weather information service such as DTN\/Kavouras, WSI, Accuweather, etc. may be contracted to provide data gathering  such as weather information. The meteorological data  collected may include radar, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, precipitation measurements made at the different geographic locations which are transmitted and reported back to the data communication hub of the Data Gathering and Analysis System . The Data Gathering and Analysis System  may be implemented using a network client-server architecture with a file server to collect weather information data for analysis and forecasting. The hardware may include personal computers and computer workstations such as Windows NT, Unix, Linux or other comparable systems from Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, or other computer vendors interconnected on a local area network such as an Ethernet network, token ring, ATM or other packet-based computer network.","The Software Application Development System  develops and implements software to produce value-added weather information from the collected weather data. For example, the weather information is collected and formatted in appropriate tables, graphics overlaid on weather maps or combined with appropriate graphics or analyzed to produce weather forecasts. The particular weather information analyses are wide and varied and can be developed by meteorologists and computer programmers skilled in the art of using the Hardware and Software systems  internal to the NOC. Weather service information providers such as DTN\/Kavouras, WSI, NWS Accuweather, as previously mentioned typically provide proprietary software packages to develop weather related information, graphics, radar, etc. The details of the particular functions and implementations are further described herein and still other functions will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The Software Application Development System  may also be implemented using a network client-server architecture with a file server to collect weather information data for analysis and forecasting. The hardware may include personal computers and computer workstations such as Windows NT, Unix, Linux or other comparable systems from Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics, or other computer vendors interconnected on a local area network such as an Ethernet network, token ring, ATM or other packet-based computer network.","The Product Design Integration & Distribution  implements the systems developed by the Hardware and Software development systems ,  to produce the particular information products and program content  as data  is collected. The Product Design Integration & Distribution  system processes incoming data and operates to continually provide updated weather information  to be transmitted to the network operations center  to produce weather information programming. High capacity data storage devices, file servers and databases from a variety of vendors may be utilized to implement this function.","A real-time Product Distribution System  with a satellite distribution system and a backup landline  may be utilized to distribute the information product to the Network Operation Center  for further production. As shown in , a satellite distribution system is utilized to distribute the information and products in a real-time or near real-time manner. The Network Operation Center  includes an earth receive station to receive real-time information products from the Data Analysis and Graphics  operation for processing by the Weather Data Analysis Forecast and Graphics  (\u201cVWDA&G\u201d), a subsystem to the NOC . In addition, a backup terrestrial or landline  may also be utilized as a redundant facility in the case of failure of the primary satellite distribution system. Other operations areas include the exchange and update of product services, maintenance, installation of new services, customer communications between the WDA&G  a subsystem to the NOC  and the information service provider  as needed to operate the system.","Referring now to , shown is a general block diagram of a Commercial Transaction Processing system  including contract information, product information, purchase information, purchase confirmation to manage the various sales and business aspects of the system. In an exemplary embodiment capable of providing interactive and transactional capabilities, the Commercial Transaction Processing  is the process by which an organization or commercial partner  external to the system  is able to display; market, sell and support its products via the interactive\/transactional network infrastructure. Different commercial partners  may market or sell products or services interactively through the streaming media capabilities of the network. After securing a negotiated mutually agreeable contract , the external commercial partner  provides and\/or works in cooperation with the system operator to develop sales and marketing information such as graphics, video, pricing, options, technical specifications and shipping information for the product . The Commercial Transaction Processing  system sends the information to the NOC  to produce the appropriate programming product such as sales and marketing information and graphics according to the agreements with the commercial partners. For example, the NOC  may include Set Top Application Development and Management  as further described in  to produce the appropriate programming for an interactive application. After integrating this information into the appropriate interactive TV platform such as Wink, Open TV, HTML, Java, CGI, etc, the NOC  integrates the interactive and\/or transactional components into the distribution network to send it onto the RCONs  () for implementation via a downstream device such as a headend.","In general, commonly available online transaction processing systems manufactured and distributed by the likes of NCR, Tandem and others for use in banking, ticketing and other product purchase applications can be modified to exchange data with the Interactive Set Top Application Development & Management  and Channel, Traffic & Contract Management  systems both of which are internal to the NOC . The requirements to exchange data with the CT&CM  subsystem is based on the assumption that a processing charge will be assessed by the network on interactive purchases executed via the network infrastructure. Accordingly, the CT&CM  subsystem tracks and manages the financial commitments associated with the exemplary online transaction; i.e., (1) was a transaction for a particular product completed, (2) how much was the transaction, (3) what percentage and\/or transaction fee is due and (4) have normal billing and payments for this transaction been executed? Regarding data I\/O with the Set Top Application Development and Management  (\u201cSAD&M\u201d) subsystem, the Online Commercial Transaction Processor  (\u201cOCTP\u201d) system frames the product data in a structurally compatible fashion for the chosen interactive operating system; e.g., Wink, Open TV, HTML, Java, CGI, etc. The type of data imported by the SAD&M  subsystem from the OCTP  system is generally sales and marketing information such as graphics, video, pricing, options, technical specifications and shipping information.","As the RCONs  utilizes encapsulated IP transport techniques to transmitted the different interactive\/transactional programming elements, transport of these elements is done in a pretty much an overlay, VPN fashion. In other works, the distribution of interactive\/transactional elements from the network SAD&M  subsystem to any particular head-end  is done so that no interim processing is required; i.e., the interactive application and data elements are transmitted from the SAD&M  subsystem to the head-end  without change. As with other elements, IP encryption ensures that the proper program elements are delivered to the appropriate network RCON . The only remaining consideration then is providing the proper physical interface between the network RCON responsible for delivery of the interactive\/transactional elements to the predetermined headend  device.","Consequently, the RCONs  further distributes programming to headend devices  that distribute programming to viewer set top devices. The viewers of interactive programming may select displayed items to view additional information about the product or service and may eventually conduct a transaction to purchase the desired product or service, as further described herein. A return network such as a modem dial up telephone line, wide area network, or Internet connection from the viewer's location to the appropriate transaction can be utilized to allow viewers to return information to request or complete transactions. A number of different return networks may be provided by commercially available interactive television systems.","For example, during a weather program describing wintry weather conditions in the northeast, an airline or travel company may market and sell travel vacations to warm locales such as Florida or the Caribbean. During the wintry weather report, the streaming media carries a graphic advertising the travel vacation that appears in an additional on-screen window such as on of the windows shown in . For example, the window  may show a graphic with instructions for viewers to request more information about the product and then eventually purchase the offered product through an electronic commercial transaction. In a particular embodiment, the product can be purchased interactively on-line if the viewer so desires. The on-line transaction is conducted via standard means enabled by interactive operating systems offered or enabled by the likes of Wink, Open TV, HTML, Java, CGI, etc.","Referring now to , shown is the system Network Operations Center (\u201cNOC\u201d)  that manages, integrates and automates various production, multiplexing and distribution functions of the system. Generally, the NOC  implements and utilizes a distribution network which transmits real-time program and data elements along with store and forward components in a digital streaming media via an IP based Network Distribution, Monitoring and Control System  to the various RCONs  at remote locations throughout the desired viewing areas. RCON  preferably interfaces a plurality of remote nodes including headends , which receive streaming media, information products and program elements addressed for that node by way of encapsulated IP, IP encryption and IP addressing techniques whether in a serial, broadcast and\/or hybrid distribution configuration. Moreover, RCONs  provide the network interface with the downstream headends device  so that the interactive application software and real-time data components of the transactional product can be transported to and from the end user's TV computational device which may reside in a set-top box, computer of even within the TV itself. In a preferred embodiment, RCON  receives national feed video for programming and also has the capability to assemble local programming and perform commercial insertion using a variety of program elements that may be distributed via the encapsulated IP transport or provided locally. In this embodiment, the headend device  is the network facility responsible for final distribution of the streaming media programming to the viewer or end user such as a TV affiliate, a cable system headend, a DTH satellite uplink facility, web server and\/or home based processing unit as further described in . Further details of the distribution network will be provided herein.","It should be understood that any of the functions, processes and methods of the NOC  subsystems shown in  and further described in the  below can be implemented by those skilled in the art with appropriate logic to implement the described methods and functions in application software modules as a set of computer executable software instructions.

The software instructions are executed as data bits by the CPU with a memory system causing a transformation of the electrical signal representation, and the maintenance of data bits at memory locations in the memory system to thereby reconfigure or otherwise alter the unit's operation.","As see in , the NOC includes a Channel, Traffic, Contract and Management  function that receives the input from the Commercial Transaction Processing  to document, implement and track the mutually agreed upon contractual arrangements. As noted before, the requirements to exchange data with the CT&CM  subsystem is based on the assumption that a processing charge will be assessed by the network on interactive purchases executed via the network infrastructure. Accordingly, the CT&CM  subsystem tracks and manages the financial commitments associated with the exemplary online transaction; i.e., (1) was a transaction for a particular product completed, (2) how much was the transaction, (3) what percentage and\/or transaction fee is due and (4) have normal billing and payments for this transaction been executed? Account and enterprise systems from a number of suppliers such as Platinum Technologies, SAP, etc.","Channel, Traffic, Contract and Management  largely determines and controls the desired capabilities of the system according to the negotiated contractual obligations and authorizations of the subscribers. For example, the management system  builds and manages program schedules according to the contractual obligations the system operator has negotiated. The system  generates and manages the appropriate plurality of programming schedules () and the appropriate multi-window screen elements, as well as commercials are inserted to be shown to users at the contracted times. The Management system  preferably also tracks the revenues and costs of the operation and allow financial management of the system. An exemplary embodiment of the Channel, Traffic, Contract and Management  is described in more detail with reference to .","The Management system  communicates to various other subsystems, such as the Production Automation and Network Playback , Network Automation and Integration  and Set Top Application Development and Management  the appropriate information and schedules to enable the production and distribution of the appropriate multi-window program elements to implement the desired distribution of customized program streams. The plurality of program schedules contains the desired programming that is implemented and distributed to viewers by the system  to create the customized multi-window display in different geographic areas of the country.","Weather Data Forecasts and Graphics  receives weather information data from external third party sources as previously described with reference to  and creates programming content products and data such as weather forecasts and information programming content in the form of multimedia content graphics, audio, video, text, etc. Weather Data Forecasts and Graphics  as described in more detail with reference to .","Generally, Production Automation & Network Playback  and Network Automation and Integration  utilize the weather products and data to produce programming content to be carried by encapsulated IP techniques to be distributed to subscribers through RCONs . The Production Automation and Network Playback  provides the facilities including programming studios and technical operations and equipment to produce and programming content for the system.

The system may also utilize IP encryption as the means of scrambling distributed program elements on both serial and point to point and\/or multi-cast networks.","For the purpose of the exemplary weather information distribution network, IP distribution of the \u201cproduct\u201d and programming content is configured in a fashion designed to maximize both operational flexibility and\/or over all economics of implementing and operating the system. Accordingly, the distribution configuration of the respective TV, Cable, DTH and\/or Internet network and\/or service will dictate the means in which the network distributes its content to the downstream RCON  and network provider. In other words, the distribution of the weather products can be accomplished over any type of transmission system whether terrestrial, wireless, simplex and\/or duplex. Moreover, IP transport of the programming products, data, control information, etc. can be accomplished over a variety of standards based telecommunications facilities employing DVB, SONET\/SDH, T3, Frame Relay as well as other transmission protocols.","Regarding the IP encryption of broadcast quality, real-time as well as \u201cstore and forward\u201d elements of the programming network, the methods employed are very much like those used in Internet based TCP\/IP based networks for the routing of requests, files, e-mail, etc. In short, an Internet address in a numeric format such as \u201c205.12.234.231\u201d is used as a unique identifier of the RCON () in question. This address is not a permanent feature of the hardware but is assigned to specific hardware.

Just in the same fashion in which encrypted e-mail sent via the Internet destined for a specific PC is received only by that PC. These IP techniques enables a wide variety of file types and\/or protocols to be \u201cpackaged\u201d and\/or encapsulated by way of the addition of IP header information (see ) for transmission via the chosen network configuration so that upon arrival at the appropriate RCON as specified by its IP addressing and other security matters the original file type and\/or protocols can be unwrapped for distribution to the appropriate downstream processes. This is opposed to current approaches that assign a permanent ID to each integrated receiver decoder (IRD) in a point to multi-point satellite network. The current state of the art in broadcast quality network monitor and control involves the management of digital distribution of compressed video, audio and data via a statistically multiplexed satellite distribution system such as provided by the Divicom Inc. of Milipitas, Calif. as well as other suppliers.","Preferably, the exemplary distribution system transmits programming as digital multimedia streaming media including MPEG-2 digital video, graphics, audio and control data using DVB digital broadcast standards and TCP\/IP protocols. The exemplary system uses layers of transmission protocols implemented according to the OSI communication model to package and deliver the digital multimedia information over the satellite broadcast system.  diagrammatically shows the different transport packet layers.","At the lowest MPEG layer , all video, audio and multimedia data are processed as entirely digital data information that is multiplexed, compressed, and packaged into fixed-length MPEG packets. The multimedia information broadcast from the NOC  to the RCON  receivers are in the form of digital information segregated and assembled into packets. The exemplary system transmits only digital multimedia information. Analog video or audio data such as NTSC or conventional analog video signals and control information are not transmitted from the NOC  and remote locations. MPEG-2 compression allows picture information to be compressed to bandwidth that can be carried by digital signals.","At the DVB layer , processing according to DVB standards including forward-error-correction, scrambling, randomizing, interleaving, and modulation are added to the digital MPEG packets.","At the IP layer , IP transport information is added to the DVB packets, including the appropriate IP address of the RCON  unit that is to receive the packet. The TCP\/IP transmission protocol is a communication protocol commonly used to transport packetized-messages over the Internet. The data packets are also encrypted or scrambled at the IP layer to provide conditional-access to only authorized subscribers.","Scrambling at any protocol layer protects that layer and every layer above it from unauthorized access or otherwise being received. Thus, encryption or scrambling at the IP packet layer protects the information content at the higher layer to allow only selected subscribers to receive the information content. A number of different scrambling techniques can be used. In the planned system, IP packets are encrypted using standard encryption techniques that \u201cmix\u201d the original data with a \u201ckey\u201d known only to the subscribers authorized to receive messages. By knowing the appropriate key and the method used to mixing the original data with the key (\u201cscrambling algorithm\u201d), a subscriber can decrypt the message and recover the original data. The RCON  receivers are provided with the appropriate \u201ckey\u201d to decrypt the IP packets addressed to that unit.","To receive the streaming media, RCON  units are placed at the cable television system headends to receive the satellite broadcasts. Each RCON  unit will be assigned an IP address to uniquely identify each unit. In an IP network, each RCON  unit has its own unique IP address. An IP address is commonly represented as a series of four numbers, each less than , separated by periods as shown below:\n\n","The transmitted digital multimedia data and control information is packaged in TCP\/IP protocol packets or IP datagrams. The satellite transmission system broadcasts streaming media with an encrypted IP address and transport protocol. A diagrammatic example of an IP datagram header is shown in .","In operation, the RCON units receive IP packets addressed to its IP address and passes on IP packets addressed to other IP addresses. To access encrypted IP packets addressed to it, a RCON unit must have both the proper IP address to receive the encrypted packets and the appropriate key to decrypt the packet. First, only the RCON  unit with the appropriate IP address can capture encrypted IP packets addressed to the IP address. The IP address allows the system to broadcast multimedia information to a particular RCON  unit. For example, because RCON  units may be located over a wide geographic area, weather information will necessarily vary for receivers in different geographic areas. The system is capable of directing customized local weather programs to the appropriate RCON  units using the IP addressing scheme.","In addition to the proper IP address, to actually access the information in encrypted IP packets received by a RCON  unit, the RCON must also have a decryption key to decrypt packets as described above. The exemplary system uses Media4's MediaStream product or other similar commercially available products to implement and utilize IP addressing and encryption over a satellite transmission system. Media4's MediaStream product scrambles or encrypts the IP packets to distribute it over a satellite transmission system to the RCON unit with the appropriate address. Thus, the encrypted Transmission Control Protocol\/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP\/IP Encryption\u201d) allows the system to distribute customized local weather information to appropriate subscribers. Using IP addresses and encrypted digital packets, the receiving audience can be selected as desired. Each RCON  unit has its own unique IP address and receives only multimedia weather information addressed to the RCON  with that IP address. Only a receiver with the proper IP address to capture the packets and, the appropriate key to decrypt the IP packet can receive the packet.","This use of IP encryption combined with IP transmission techniques enables the distribution of broadcast quality, real-time as well as \u201cstore and forward\u201d elements of the programming product via serial networks so that only a specific, downstream RCON  receives the desired information.

In this exemplary block diagram, the server is illustrated as the central circle  and the clients are the various workstations networked to the server. The products prepared by the Weather Data and Graphics  are interfaced to Production Automation and Network Playback  and Network Automation and Integration , as shown in , to produce the streaming media programming content for distribution to subscribers.","In the exemplary weather information system, weather data and information to allow the meteorologists within the organization to predict the weather using computer modeling data, graphical weather data as well as tabular data is provided to Weather Data and Graphics  from a system such as Data and Analysis  of . In this embodiment, these weather information components are referred to as DIFAX and alphanumeric data products. DIFAX data is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (\u201cNOAA\u201d) National Weather Service (\u201cNWS\u201d) through the National Center for Environmental Prediction (\u201cNCEP\u201d). These data products consist of current graphical representations of the atmosphere at numerous altitude levels, as well as graphical representations of forecasts as derived from mathematical computer models. Along with short-term man-modified forecasts and longer-term climatological forecasts, the DIFAX data is the backbone of a meteorologist's forecasting arsenal.","Alphanumeric (lit. numbers and letters) products which are issued by the National Weather Service, both at a national and regional level, typically consist of both tabular representations of the same computer models issued in DIFAX form, as well as various weather products issued by the National Weather Service's Offices located in strategic locations nationwide. These products may include local zone forecasts issued by these offices, along with hourly observations of weather conditions across different regions in the United States. These regional offices also issue weather statements, advisories and warnings during times of inclement weather in alphanumeric form as well to further enhance the product list issued by the National Weather Service. These products are transmitted by NOAA along their Family of Services product transmission feed which include the Domestic Data Service, the Public Product Service, as well as the traditional FAA  line. Many of these services are bundled on the National Weather Service's Weather Wire Service.","The Weather Data\/Predictive Model Output Workstation  preferably manages, distributes, catalogues, and outputs these products as required by the meteorologists using the workstation .

By looking for a certain product codes transmitted within each alphanumeric product issued by the NWS, the Watches and Warnings Workstation  is alerted to weather advisories, watches and warnings which can then be passed along into the broadcast product stream either automatically or manually by a Master Control Operator. These particular product codes are well known to those skilled in the art and need not be described here in any detail. The computer workstation  can be programmed to show user-defined regional maps and graphics automatically updated to depict the latest states of noteworthy weather advisories as issued through the NWS through the local Weather Service Offices (WSO) and the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). Taking the text from the weather advisories, lower screen left to right scrolling text information such as shown in the multi-window display of , can also be automatically generated from this workstation for broadcast stream insertion. This scrolling text information, referred to as crawls, or static graphics provide the viewer of the broadcast product with text information issued by the NWS during these times of inclement and noteworthy weather. After being alerted by an audible tone, also generated by the computer workstation , the viewer of the product sees the display of the graphical representation of the weather advisory, as well as the crawl generated textual information generated from the text of the advisory. The Watches and Warnings Workstation  is particularly useful for the operation and production of noteworthy weather events in a weather information of the present embodiment.","Radar Display Workstation  is preferably networked into the data server that distributes into this processor the radar images transmitted by the National Weather Service's NEXRAD Doppler Radar network or a Proprietary Doppler Radar System that may be provided by external vendors  of radar related products and services such as DTN\/Kavouras, Barons, etc. The workstation  then displays the radar data above a customized basemap for data display and animation of this data. With the ability to user define the amount of data cataloguing and animation speed, the meteorologist then is able to track storms and their history using both the computer's archival capabilities along with the NEXRAD's products of storm analysis. The meteorologist then has the choice of which of these numerous products to display into the on-air broadcast product.","One of the most unique capabilities of this workstation  is the ability to display highly localized radar images  using what is referred to as \u201cstreet level\u201d technology. Based on the highly accurate Global Positioning System data, points can be defined to allow the meteorologist to display these radar images, in real-time, on maps showing local streets, neighborhoods, and communities with high levels of specificity and accuracy. By showing this level of local information, both the meteorologist and the viewer of such a product benefit by giving each the most useful information possible. The meteorologist then has the ability to analyze the weather situation with a local specificity never before available to a national weather network audience while the viewer has the luxury of seeing his neighborhood depicted on a local radar display, giving him the ability to determine his personal level of reaction to inclement weather. With this workstation  in place, the most highly localized product possible can be provided.","The National On-Air Graphics Generation Workstation  is preferably responsible for the generation of the graphics, animations, and automatically updated alphanumeric displays over user-defined basemaps. This computer workstation  has the ability to automatically update weather satellite and radar animation files making them available to the on-air product upon request.

This fly-through technology is revolutionizing the display of weather information, and will be used in an environment never before displayed consistently in a national weather network. Then, graphics artists, using this data to formulate their graphics content for specific weather situations, program their sequences to display forecasts and weather information to the national audience, especially highlighting weather occurrences of national interest.","The Local Weather Graphics Production Workstation  is preferably configured to automatically produce regional and local weather information as defined by the Local Coverage Area being serviced (\u201cLCA\u201d). Local Coverage Area is defined by the geographic region that includes subscribers with similar geography, climate, terrestrial expectations, community interests and receives the same local programming. For the purposes of local programming delivery, a market refers to the television market defined by Nielsen called Designated Market Area (\u201cDMA\u201d). A DMA is made up of one or more counties in which stations, local in a central town or city, are most viewed. DMAs usually extend over smaller areas in the East, where cities are closer together than in the West. Each LCA may include subscribers from one or more markets. Displays of composited radar and regional weather satellite can be generated by this workstation  to automatically allow close-in depictions of weather observations, forecasting, and radar. Through the use of the satellite and radar data, along with the automatically updating graphical displays of auto-plotting alphanumeric data, the Local Coverage Area viewer will have displayed to them a local level of specificity again never before available to the viewer from a nationally based weather network. The most advanced technology of three-dimensional displays of weather forecasts will also be produced from this workstation in files of animated weather data dynamically displayed over user-defined basemaps. By changing perspective over a defined surface, local, regional, the workstation  has the ability to display the weather information, whether user-defined animations of current and historic weather information of automatically generated satellite and radar data, from dynamically changing and varying views of perspective giving the viewer the perception of flying through the computer generated scene.

OpenTV is a complete operating system for digital interactive television systems capable of meeting the demands of the digital broadcast consumer electronics market. OpenTV system includes a Software Development Kit (SDK) providing a complete C-language content development environment for developers creating interactive television with graphical content that has the look and feel of television. The OpenTV SDK allows for interactive applications to be developed using OpenTV's application programming interface (API) along with graphical and command-line tools. OpenTV also provides a MPEG encoder that converts a variety of different types of images into television ready pictures. The OpenTV encoder can convert images from a variety of file formats such as TIFF, GIF, JPEG, BMP, PICT and PBM and creates professional quality MPEG still pictures suitable for television broadcasting. OpenTV Web provides digital television operators the ability to repurpose HTML content for television displays. OpenTV Web allows televisions that, unlike conventional personal computer, browsers, do not have significant amounts of processing power or memory to display web content by shifting the HTML processing load to servers in the broadcasting headend. Using this application content can be reused rather than recreated and the content is compressed for quicker download.","The OpenTV system also includes a distribution headend software technology that provides the ability to deliver interactive applications to deliver interactive applications via standard digital television broadcast facilities. The headend software regulates the delivery of file-based OpenTV application simultaneously with audio and video to OpenTV-enabled digital receivers. The OpenTV Flowcaster headend software technology allows operators to transmit data simultaneously with audio and video to OpenTV-enabled digital receivers. Flowcaster supports a wide range of interactive application with both single and multiple stream configurations to provide uninterrupted delivery of these application streams to the digital receiver. The OpenTV system also includes the OpenStreamer application that delivers file-based or stream-based OpenTV applications which can be multiplexed and updated in real-time and can be received and run on any OpenTV-compatible receiver. OpenStreamer delivers interactive application simultaneously with live or pre-recorded video and audio to enabled digital receivers. The OpenStreamer software resides on an NT host computer connected to standard digital broadcast equipment. The OpenStreamer architecture typically consists of an application server and a broadcast server. The application server responds to inputs from external sources, provides for real-time resource generation and controls the broadcast server and triggers stream playout via the common server API or remote management programs. The broadcast server receives content from the PAS, multiplex multiple MPEG-2 Transport Streams and OpenTV applications in real-time and output to the hardware multiplexer according to the request from the application server.

The satellite distribution system  also carries conditional access switching cues, site addressable data via IP encryption, CG, bug and rendering files, commands, remote automation system schedules, software upgrades, etc.","The satellite circuit  carries these program elements for reception in the exemplary weather information programming network by a cable MSO. As is normal for U.S. cable headend distribution, C or Ku band TVRO equipment is used and well known to those skilled in the art and as a result not described in detail herein. A LNB (Low Noise Amplifier Block Down Converter) receives the DVB QPSK modulated satellite signal and via a coax IFL to an integrated receiver-decoder (\u201cIRD\u201d)  that receives the network satellite signal for decryption, decoding and routing for streaming and store and forward program elements to the appropriate devices, such as video file server . Such IRD devices  are available from a wide number of satellite communication manufacturers.","In the exemplary embodiment, the RCON  decrypts and decodes the streaming video and audio; i.e., the National Network feed  and the appropriate regional audio channel. Local sources  for audio and video such as commercial insertion devices, audio voiceover booths, tape machines, file server, and live video feeds are terminated into a remote controllable routing switchers for management prior to screen rendering  and final channel origination. Video, audio, graphic and animated sequence files are stored via a conventional mirrored, hard drive utilizing fiber channel RAID  or similar standards for playback and utilization by the screen rendering process.","The screen rendering process  of the RCON  utilizes the previously mentioned video and audio sources by the way of commonly available computer based processing products that enable the use of digital video effects (DVE), chroma keys and other effects such as those produced by Matrox and Chyron. By routing the appropriate program elements to this screen rendering process the basic multi-part screen is constructed.","Simultaneously, weather data gathered from a local meteorlogical sensor package  along with other data or text streams delivered via the satellite circuit  are routed via the remote system automation processor and framed appropriately for utilization in on screen elements such as titles, bugs, crawls, etc. which are layered over the base multi-part screen.","Prior to termination of the final channel origination of the custom, multi-part screen and appropriate switched audio with the downstream headend equipment, this distribution ready video and audio signal is interfaced to a carrier lost detection switch device  which senses the loss of a proper video or audio signal on one channel and automatically switches to the other. In this case, this will prevent the partial or total lost of the local, customized signal to the specified RCON even in the case of failure of numerous subsystems of the RCON by routing the full screen national network program feed  both audio and video to the downstream headend.","Also notice that besides routing of program and\/or switching elements to the appropriate devices at the appropriate times, the remote system automation processor  is responsible for communications with the NOC  via direct dial, private line or Internet dial up via local ISP in order to; (1) deliver as run logs to CT&CM , (2) alarms and status to NDM&C , (3) transactional responses for SAD&M , (4) SS&PC  for program element delivery status, (5) forwarding of local weather data to the NOC  for use by WDA&G , (6) RCON  to NOC  synchronization and (7) enable full remote control of the specified RCON if necessary.","Those skilled in the art will note that the delivery of set top application elements  by the RCON is done as previously mention in a largely overlay fashion so that implementation by the RCON is primarily a matter of routing of the appropriate elements to a predefined physical interface to the downstream headend device.","In the exemplary embodiment, the RCON  may be implemented using a variety of different products from Chyron, Matrox and others.

An example of a suitable encoder is the MediaView line of encoding products from DiviCom, Inc. of Milipitas, Calif.","The output of the encoders ,  are provided to the multiplexer  to create the multiplexed DVB satellite transport. The exemplary multiplexer  is preferably a statistical multiplexer that multiplexes and grooms signal streams generated by encoders ,  as well as other system components into the desired transport stream for maximum utilization of available satellite bandwidth. Statistical multiplexing enables a plurality of encoders connected to the multiplexer  to share compressed bandwidth for more efficient and higher quality video encoding. For purposes of clarity of explanation, only two lines of encoders and multiplexers are shown to create a multiplexed media stream. However, it should be understood that any number of encoders and multiplexers can be provided to create a plurality of multiplexed channels or streams to be carried by a singular multiplexed transport.

In this case, encapsulated IP offers a standards based method that accommodates (1) the simultaneous delivery of multiple streams of video, audio and data, (2) IP encryption to provide conditional access functionality in a broadcast distribution configuration such as satellite distribution to TV and\/or cable head ends and (3) the flexibility to provide encryption in serial and hybrid configurations.","In a particular embodiment, the network  distributes streaming media and information components via satellite to cable headends using an encapsulated IP via DVB configuration. As shown in  and described above, video and audio from the production automation and network playback systems  as well as data from the network automation and integration system  are multiplexed together for satellite distribution to network RCONs .

In general terms, the status of the network's satellite uplink is determined by the NA&I  by simply reading the status of the earth station monitor and control system. Regarding the determination of what program elements will be transported to what RCON, a more complex set of interactions is required; i.e., (1) the Local Day of Air Scheduling (LDAS) terminal  connected to the CT&CM  generates the RCON schedules, (2) the NDS  ensures that the program element name, version tracking and file location as well as RCON destination information generated by the LDAS  are current, accurate and usable by other NOC  subsystems or network RCONs, (3) the Staging Server & Protocol Converter (SS&PC)  analyzes what program elements need to go to what RCONs and assembles them for delivery, (4) the SS&PC  prepares these elements for injection into the satellite distribution system  for IP encapsulation & encryption by the uplink and conditional access as well as subscriber management systems and (5) the SS&PC  queries and dynamically updates the channel maps resident in network RCONs  as well as the conditional access & subscriber management subsystems to NDM&C  to enable the appropriate delivery of program elements.","It is important to note that monitoring of the regional\/customized channels is accomplished via \u201ccloned\u201d RCONs that provide a probabilistic, virtual monitor of the display of the network RCONs in the field such as monitors , .

For example, NAI  is responsible for the protocol conversion and management of all subsystem databases for the purpose of updating and distributing the most current and accurate information to the various subsystems regarding the production, sharing, integration and distribution of streaming media elements. The NAI  in this embodiment is also responsible for the frame accurate synchronization of all NOC  subsystems and network RCONS  and the analysis and transport of necessary interactive\/transactional, streaming media elements to network RCONs  both internal and external to the NOC.","Regarding, the protocol conversion and management of all subsystem databases, the following is a functional description of the Network Data Synchronizer (\u201cNDS\u201d)  that may perform such functions.

The run logs route are routed as run logs to the Channel Traffic &Contract Management  via private line, dedicated dial up and\/or internet interconnect.","Graphical User Interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) Control Software","Referring now to , shown is a exemplary embodiment of the graphic user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) of a software control interface for creating and editing shows or programs that can be aired or played on a remote display device having a multiple number of display windows such as shown in . The intuitive GUI Control Software provides the user the ability to easily manage and assemble a series of images, animations and transitions as a single weather show to be displayed in a remote display device. Separate sets of still graphics and animation loops can be maintained and edited to be combined and synchronized to create programs or sequences for the various display windows. Using the GUI Control Software makes it relatively easy to change and edit the sequence from a central control device by moving pictures or icons representing the graphics or animation loops in the GUI with a computer mouse device. The GUI  control interface residing at the NOC  allows centrally scheduled control of the network and remote nodes.","In this exemplary embodiment, an image may include a 640\u00d7480 pixel picture. A movie may include a sequence of 640\u00d7480 frames in one file played in rapid succession. Preferably, the GUI Control Software produces 30 frames per second animation of 24-bit color images to present a series of images, animations and transitions as a single show and conforms to compression and format standards to be played. Standard compression and format standards can be used.","As seen in , the GUI control screen  includes several different windows having different control functions. The exemplary embodiment includes library , sorter , transitions , information , control , control panel  and stage  windows. Each of the windows , , , , , ,  performs several different functions as described below. Shows may be built by moving pictures around on the screen with a computer mouse pointing device or a stylus. When an image or animation is imported into the GUI, an icon  representing that element is created and stored in the library . The icon  is preferably a smaller scale picture of the actual image or first frame of an animation sequence. The operator can then simply click on the icon  in the library  with a pointing device such as a computer mouse, and drag it into the sorter window , which displays all the icons , , ,  in the show. The user can then click on the play button  in the control window  and the show displayed in the sorter window  will be played on the remote display screens to which the system transmits the programming. The show may also be played locally on a display monitor connected to the video output port to allow the user to preview what will be going out to the viewers.","The different GUI screen  windows are described below as follows. The library  is where all the external data files are brought into the show. It can be thought of as a graphical list of file pointers. The library  consists of four basic parts: the import button , the icon display , the file list , and the library status field . This window may be moved and resized by the user as is convenient. The library import button  goes to a show importer window to select either movie or image type. Use the browser to select a file, or type one in at the prompt. Click on the import button in this new window to bring the file into the GUI Control Software Interface. As many files as desired can be selected and imported in the system and the done button is clicked. The selected files are then listed in the library icon display list .","The library icon display  is a graphical representation of the files selected with the library import button  where the graphical representations represent the current data in the file. Periodically, such as every five seconds, the library  checks the file for the currently selected icon in the library  and performs an update it if necessary. To add this item to the show, click on this icon  and drag to the sorter  window. The library file list  is a list of all the file names of the files imported into the library . Click on a file name to view the icon in the library icon display. After a file has been selected this way, the icon  may be dragged into the sorter  window to prepare for the presentation. The library status field  is simply a one-word field in the library window  that shows whether the library  is updating or not. The field will usually contain \u201cidle\u201d, but changes to \u201cupdating\u201d when it finds a file that is not current.","Referring now to the sorter window , the sorter window  is basically a list of icons , , ,  that represent presentations. The order of the show proceeds from the order of the icons left to right, top to bottom of the window . The sorter window  consists of any number of pairs of icons and fields, a red highlight box, and a vertical scrollbar. This window  may also be moved and resized by the user. In the exemplary embodiment, the sorter icons , , ,  should initially look like their counterpart in the library window . If the original filename associated with the icon changes, then the library  version will be automatically changed. Preferably in this exemplary embodiment, the image in the sorter window  will change if the \u201cUpdate All Now\u201d button  is clicked in the control window  or if the auto-update  is on for the show in the control window  and the auto-update is turned on for this slide in the information window .","The sorter icons , , ,  can be clicked and dragged within the sorter window  to re-arrange the order of the icons. When a sorter icon is selected, the sorter \u201chighlight\u201d will appear around the icon and the associated image or first frame of movie will show up in the stage . The sorter fields , , ,  consist of zero or more lines describing the various icon above it. The contents of the sorter fields depend on which boxes are checked in the information window. The sorter fields , , ,  will contain any or all of the following items: type, file name, last time modified, number of seconds to pause after playing slide, transition type, transition speed, and whether auto-update is turned on for this slide. If there is not enough room to put the entire line for a particular field, then \u201c . . . \u201d will be placed at the end of what will fit in the field. The border of the sorter widow  turns red when there is at least 1 icon in the sorter window . It represents the highlighted icon, and shows which slide is currently being displayed in the stage widow . The sorter highlight will disappear when there are no images in the sorter window .","The vertical scrollbar (not shown) of the sorter window  will appear when the images in the sorter window  do not all fit in the window as is common done with windows programs. The scrollbar will appear on the far right of the sorter window  with three buttons. There are two triangle shaped buttons; one at the top of the scrollbar and one at the bottom. If you click on these and hold the mouse button down, the sorter window  will slowly scroll up or down, depending on which direction the triangle is pointing. The third button is a rectangle that changes height depending on how many images there are and how much room is needed to display them all. This button can be clicked on, and if the mouse button is held down, it can be dragged up and down to scroll the sorter window . One final way to scroll the sorter window  up and down is to click on the space above or below the third scrollbar button, moving the sorter window  up or down respectively.","Referring now to the transitions window , the transitions window  displays a list of all the possible transitions as well as gives a small preview of how the transition will look. A transition includes the methods of changing from one slide to another. The exemplary Transitions window  includes a list of items  listing the possible transitions, a preview window , a scrollbar to control the speed of the transition , and a field  that displays the speed selected by the scrollbar.","The transitions list  preferably shows the possible transition type that can be used in the show. Click on a line in the list  to select and view the transition in the transitions preview window . Preferably, the selected line will highlight, and the transitions preview will change to a different color using the selected transition type and speed. To change the transition type and speed for an icon , , ,  in the sorter window , click and drag the transitions preview down to the icon in the sorter window  that you wish to change. The highlighted line in the transitions list  is also the transition type that is used when new slides are added to the sorter window .","The transition preview  is the icon-sized graphic in the top left-hand corner of the transitions window  which contains the words of the highlighted line in the transitions list. It is either black text on a yellow background, or white text on a blue background. When the user clicks on a line in the transitions list  or clicks on the transition speed scrollbar, the transition preview  will do the appropriate transition at the current speed. To add this transition and speed to an icon in the sorter window , click on the transition preview and drag it on top of the icon to be changed in the sorter window .","The transition speed scrollbar  is the button just to the right of the transitions preview. To change the speed of the transition, click on the button  and drag it to the left or to the right. The transitions field  will change to reflect the location of the button. The farther to the left the button  is in the scrollbar, the slower the transition speed, and the farther to the right, the faster the transition speed.","The transitions field  represents the speed that the transition type will change. There are four possibilities: \u201cvery slow\u201d, \u201cslow\u201d, \u201cfast\u201d, \u201cvery fast\u201d, depending on the position of the transition speed scrollbar.","Referring now to the stage window , the stage window  is where the show is actually displayed. The image and movie slides , , ,  that were inserted into the sorter window  are displayed with the appropriate transition between each slide. The stage  may be moved, but preferably not resized by the user. The size is 640\u00d7480 pixels, and should remain on the screen. The stage  represents the show that is being transmit to the remote units, so when a show is played, this window  is always brought to the foreground.","Referring now to the information window , information window  contains information about the entire show, as well as about individual slides. It also allows the user to change parameters in the show and slides. The information window  is broken down into five categories as seen in the window: show info, slide info, slide options, movie options, and auto-update. The show info category contains six attributes of the show such as Images, Movies, Slides, Timed Pauses, manual pauses, and show repetitions. The show repetitions are preferably the only parameter in this category that can be modified by the user. The images and movies include the number of images and movies inserted into the sorter window , the slides the number of images plus the number of movies, the timed pauses the total number of seconds in all pauses, the manual pauses the number of pauses set to \u201cmanual\u201d in the show, the show repetitions the number of times to play the entire set of slides.","The slide info category contains three attributes of the highlighted slide in the sorter window and three checkboxes. If the checkbox is on, then this attribute will show up in the sorter field below each sorter icon. The checkbox is either on for all slides, or off for all slides. The three attributes are file type, file name, and last time modified. The type of slide is either \u201cImage\u201d or \u201cMovie,\u201d the filename is the short file name and modified is the last time this image or movie was modified. These attributes are displayed as fields and typically cannot be changed.","The slide options category contains three more attributes of the highlighted slide in the sorter window  and three more checkboxes. If the checkbox is on, then this attribute will show up in the sorter field below each sorter icon. The checkbox is either on for all slides, or off for all slides, like above. The three attributes are the pause time, transition type, and transition speed. Pause is number of seconds to wait before going to the next slide in the show, transition is one of the types in the transitions list, speed is either \u201cvery slow\u201d, \u201cslow\u201d, \u201cfast\u201d, or \u201cvery fast.\u201d These three attributes are displayed as buttons and may be changed by clicking on the button and dragging to the value you wish to select.","The movie options category only appears when a movie slide is highlighted in the sorter window . This category consists of two fields that cannot be modified, one field that can be modified, and one button that can be modified. To modify the parameter for the playback field, move the cursor over the field, delete the current value and retype a new one. Decimal values are allowed. To modify the loop count, click on the button and drag to the desired value.","The auto-update category consists of an on\/off button and a checkbox. If the checkbox is on, then the on\/off status of auto-update is displayed in the sorter fields for each slide. If the on\/off button is on, then auto-update for this slide is turned on. If the auto-update button in the control window is also turned on, then this slide will be updated if the file is ever modified. In this embodiment both the auto-update button for the show and the auto-update button for this slide must be turned on for the slide to update in the sorter and stage. If the show is playing, then the slide will not update until the show has finished playing, because the show auto-update button is automatically turned off during show play.","Referring now to the control window , the control window  contains all the show control buttons needed to play, pause, and cancel the show. It also contains the show auto-update buttons . If a show is running, a status message of how many loops are left will appear below the play buttons.","The \u201cplay from start button\u201d  starts the playing of a show from the first slide in the sorter window  (the icon in the top left most position). When this button is clicked on, it will typically change from the gray color to green and stay green until the show is canceled with the stop button, or the show finishes by playing until all the repetitions are done. The order of a show is typically display slide, pause, do transition to next slide, repeat until done.","The \u201cplay button\u201d  is like the play from start button , except for the starting location. This button  will start the playing of a show from the highlighted slide in the sorter window . If the highlighted slide is a movie, then whether the movie is played depends on whether the first or last frame is in the stage window . If the first frame is showing in the stage , then we haven't played the movie yet, so the movie will play and continue playing the show. If the last frame is showing in the stage , then we have just played the movie, so do the transition to the next slide and continue playing the show.","The \u201cpause button\u201d  suspends playing of the next slide until the pause button is clicked again, or one of the play buttons is clicked. The button will turn red, and turn gray when any show control button is clicked on.","The \u201cstop button\u201d  will cancel the playing of the show and turn the show control buttons gray.","The \u201cauto-update for the show button\u201d  turns on or off the auto-update ability for the slides in the sorter  and stage  windows. Whether the slides actually update or not also depends upon whether or not auto-update is on for the individual slide.","The \u201cupdate all now button\u201d  forces auto-update to happen immediately for all slides, regardless of whether auto-update is turned on for each slide or the show.","Referring now to the control panel window , the control panel window  is the first window that appears when show has been started. To begin working within control panel window  the user must first select new, or open from the file menu. This window  contains three pull-down menus , ,  that allow the user to load\/save shows in the file menu , customize the layout in the preferences menu , and get help on any topic within show under the help menu .","The file menu  options include:\n\n","The preferences menu  options include:\n\n","The help menu  options includes\n\n","At the remote node or headend display devices, RCON  receives the control signals in the streaming media to synchronize the programming content to create the desired programming in each of the multiple windows. The particular schedules and control signals are addressed to the RCON according the encrypted IP addressing and conditional access techniques that can be provided by vendors such as Media4. The RCON  may be implemented with the Duet Platform from Chyron and developed using Lyric and CAL as previously described.","As shown in , a plurality of GUIs  at the Network Operations Center  can control the different multi-window screens in the display . In this example, each of the GUIs  control the display of a corresponding window , , ,  in the multi-screen display  as depicted in . It should be understood of course that the dashed arrows merely illustrate an exemplary correspondence between the multiple GUI processes and the particular multi-window screen display , , ,  that is controlled by the GUI interface. The GUIs are shown as separate processes, however, they can be maintained on a single computer workstation as different windows on the desktop as is typically performed with other multi-tasking windows programs. Each of the replicated GUI  processes can then be individually accessed and manipulated to control a particular window , , ,  of the multi-window screen display  as described above with respect to the GUI interface . The control of the multi-window display by the GUI will be carried through the digital streaming media from the NOC  to the remote location. For example, the GUI will send through the digital streaming media the appropriate control and synchronization signals to change or switchover programming in different windows, cut to commercials, etc. In other embodiments, the GUI may include a remote process  that is located at the remote location to receive the commands from the GUI and implement the programming indicated by the commands.","The present embodiment preferably includes logic to implement the described methods and functions in software modules as a set of computer executable software instructions. The workstation running the application software includes a Computer Processing Unit (\u201cCPU\u201d) or microprocessor to implement the logic that controls the operation. The microprocessor executes software that can be programmed by those of skill in the art to provide the described functionality. The software can be represent as a sequence of binary bits maintained on a computer readable medium including magnetic disks, optical disks, organic disks, and any other volatile or (e.g., Random Access memory (\u201cRAM\u201d)) non-volatile firmware (e.g., Read Only Memory (\u201cROM\u201d)) storage system readable by the CPU. The memory locations where data bits are maintained also include physical locations that have particular electrical, magnetic, optical, or organic properties corresponding to the stored data bits. The software instructions are executed as data bits by the CPU with a memory system causing a transformation of the electrical signal representation, and the maintenance of data bits at memory locations in the memory system to thereby reconfigure or otherwise alter the unit's operation.","Audio Concatenation Engine","In addition to producing live and prerecorded audio weather reports, the preferred embodiment of the system will produce audio reports with the assistance of a computer application software that reassembles prerecorded audio elements, which include words, phrases; number and pauses, into coherent narration\u2014Audio Concatenation. The Audio Concatenation Engine (\u201cACE\u201d) software performs the primary task of building user selected audio elements, which include words, phrases, number and pauses, into audio reports that can be used to complement graphics, pictures and imagery generated or used by NHT. The ACE software uses pre-produced audio elements and a dynamic graphics user interface (\u201cGUI\u201d) in order to build audio reports (\u201cprocessing\u201d) through a process of script editing and audio assembly from a library of pre-recorded audio elements. Using the ACE software allows a variety of audio programs to be created with in a minimum time and with a minimum of human intervention resulting in considerable savings in overhead and personnel, resulting in considerable cost savings to the system operator.","Pre-Production of Audio Elements","In the exemplary embodiment, the process of building a library of audio elements that can be accessed by the ACE software preferably includes a multi-step process such as the exemplary process shown in .","At step , the desired audio elements are first identified according to the entire the possible vocabulary necessary to compose the desired audio narration. The audio element identification process includes the selection and codification of desired words, phrases, number and pauses for use in audio reports generated by the ACE. For example, in a weather information audio narration certain words or a vocabulary are necessary for speaking out all the possible variations of the weather report. The library of audio elements can be updated at any time, but the ACE does not create words, phrases or numbers that are not in the library. As can be understood, the particular words will vary and can be chosen creatively by the system operator.","At step , after the vocabulary of possible words has been identified, the audio elements with the selected words recorded by a human speaker. A live speaker can pre-record all the necessary audio elements to complete the library with the vocabulary of desired words, although in other embodiments synthesized speech such as provided by systems such as Lucent Technologies may be utilized. A consistent recording environment is required to generate a library of audio elements that can be stacked together and create plausible speech (i.e., sound real) without unnatural fluctuations in speech pitch or vocal inflections inconsistent with natural speech.","The process of normalizing audio elements to create audio elements that can be concatenated together to create natural sounding continuous speech thus begins during the audio record phase and can be modified further during the edit phase at step , the final phase before the ACE can access and concatenate the audio elements. During the edit phase , the audio elements are cut with predefined front and back-end padding at step  such that the audio elements are uniformly padded. At step , the audio elements are normalized to ensure that signal levels are consistent for each narrator's speech at step , and edited to include fades in and out to and from 0 dbz at step  to insure consistent signal levels between audio elements throughout the library. This last task at step  can increase the quality of the assembled audio report when different audio elements are concatenated together to create natural sounding speech with out undue fluctuations, delays or pauses in the assembled audio narration.","At step , the audio elements are coded and saved on a randomly accessible storage medium such as random access memory, hard disc drive, file or video server as \u201c.wav\u201d files with in one or several of the following formats including PCM, 44,100 Hz, 16 Bit, Mono. Of course other audio storage formats may be used as well. Preferably, the library is indexed, hashed or databased such that each of the audio elements can be quickly accessed.","Referring now to , the Audio Concatenation Engine has two user interfaces, the Main Menu  and Script Edit Window . The primary ACE user interface is the Main Menu  of . The Main Menu  is the initial screen displayed to use when using the ACE software application to produce audio reports. The functions that can be performed from this screen  include the selection of weather report templates  (\u201cscripts\u201d) to edit and audio playback. The edit function enables access to all predefined scripts which can then be viewed in the Script Edit Window . The playback function plays processed reports and is not used to play to-air but rather as a means to test audio reports for quality, accuracy, and length.","In order to access the secondary user interface, the Script Edit Window  of , the user selects a script from the drop down menu  below the bold Edit title on the Main Menu  and clicks the Edit button . Scripts correspond to and are played in conjunction with graphics and are updated on the same frequency for consistency and accuracy. The selection of Edit  opens the Script Edit Window  of .","Referring now to , from the Script Edit Window , the user selects individual audio elements that comprise audio weather reports. In addition, the user can configure recording parameters including language, spacing, narrator (e.g., male and female options), intonation, inflection, and tone. The user selects audio elements describing weather conditions or news information from drop down menus within the script. All audio elements reside in a library and are linked from elements in each drop down menu to the actual audio file for retrieval during the audio assembly process as is described in the audio report processing.","The primary functions performed on the Script Edit Window  include the following items: Cancel , Reset Trims , Process , Listen  and Save . The \u201cCancel\u201d function key  cancels the current operation and returns the user to the Script Edit Window  where the script may be reedited. The \u201cReset Trims\u201d function key  restores default record settings. The \u201cProcess\u201d function key  executes the assembly of the selected (i.e., visible) audio elements and builds an audio file, the audio weather report. The \u201cListen\u201d function key  provides a preview of the most recent version of the audio file for the selected script. The \u201cSave\u201d function key  exits the Script Edit Window  and returns the user to the Main Menu . The \u201cInsert\u201d function is performed within the drop-down menu and enables the user to modify existing scripts to include new audio element options. The \u201cInsert\u201d function requires pre-production and editing of the desired audio element (e.g., include \u201ctornado\u201d as an audio element option within a script during the spring).","Audio Report Processing","After the desired script is assembled, the processing of individual audio elements into an audio report includes three primary steps: 1) blank .wav file acquisition, 2) audio element insertion and 3) save. Upon the selection of the \u201cProcess\u201d button, the ACE builds a .wav file from a blank template and inserts the selected (i.e., visible) audio elements in order as defined in the open Script Edit Window . Once the final audio element is inserted into the blank .wav file, the file is saved without the remainder of the blank .wav file at the end and the run time is computed. The process of assembling audio elements into a report can be automated to run at specific times or upon the receipt of new information driving the contents of the drop-down menus in the Script Edit Window .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0249","num":"0298"},"figref":["FIG. 22","FIG. 20","FIG. 20"],"b":["1068","1012","1024"]},"At step , the blank .wav file is generated from a stored .wav template, and at step , the desired audio elements are inserted into the .wav file as ordered by the selection of the operator in the Script Edit Window . The specified audio elements are selected from the audio library generated as described in  and the process continued until all the specified audio elements are selected to form the desired audio narration. At step , the audio narration inserted into the .wav file is saved for later playback at step . The generated .wav files can be saved in a fashion similar to the audio element library, although the generated .wav files are typically temporary and thus kept in a less permanent fashion. At step , the generated audio narration stored in the .wav file is played back at an appropriate rate to generate realistic sounding speech. The playback may be real time as the .wav file is generated or playback may be set to occur upon a particular cue or at a particular time.","The ACE can be implemented as application software executing logical instructions running on a typical personal computer or workstation; similar to those described herein, to perform the methods and functions described above. The logic can be implemented in a variety of different ways as described with respect the GUI interface .","The many disclosed embodiments herein allow the creation of a broadcast network system for displaying a multi-window screen programming customized for different remote locations by enabling the generation, distribution, assembly and synchronization of digital streaming media from a network operation center.
