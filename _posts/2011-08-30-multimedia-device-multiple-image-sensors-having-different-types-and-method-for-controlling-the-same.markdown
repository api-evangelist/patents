The HNED  corresponds to, for example, a client  which is a multimedia device according to the embodiment of the present invention.","The content provider  manufactures various contents and provides them. Examples of the content provider  include a terrestrial broadcaster, a cable system operator (SO), a multiple system operator (MSO), a satellite broadcaster, and an Internet broadcaster, as illustrated in . Also, the content provider  may provide various applications in addition to broadcast contents.","The service provider  can provide contents provided by the content provider  by service-packaging them.

The client  may construct a home network end user (HNED) to receive a service.","In the mean time, the client  may provide contents through the network. In this case, the client  may be a content provider contrary to the above. The content provider  may receive contents from the client . In this case, it is advantageous in that bidirectional content service or data service is available.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0066","num":"0065"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},"The multimedia device according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a network interface , a TCP\/IP manager , a service delivery manager , a demultiplexer (Demux) , a PSI& (PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , an audio decoder , a video decoder , a display A\/V and OSD module , a service control manager , a service discovery manager , a metadata manager , an SI&Metadata DB , a UI manager , and a service manager . Moreover, a plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are connected with the multimedia device , by a connection mode of a USB mode, for example. Also, although the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are designed as separate modules in , the plurality of heterogeneous images sensors  may be designed in such a manner that they are housed in the multimedia device .","The network interface  receives packets from a network, and transmits the packets to the network. In other words, the network interface  receives services, contents, etc. from the service provider through the network.","The TCP\/IP manager  is involved in packets received in the multimedia device  and packets transmitted from the multimedia device , i.e., packet transfer from the source to the destination. The service delivery manager  takes the role of control of received service data. For example, if the service delivery manager  controls real-time streaming data, it can use RTP\/RTCP. If the service delivery manager  transmits the real-time streaming data by using RTP, it parses the received packets in accordance with RTP and transmits the parsed packets to the demultiplexer  or stores the parsed packets in the SI&Metadata DB  under the control of the service manager . The service delivery manager  feeds the received information back to a server, which provides a service, by using RTCP.","The demultiplexer  demultiplexes the received packets to audio, video and PSI (Program Specific Information) data and then transmits the demultiplexed data to the audio decoder , the video decoder , and the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , respectively.","The PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  receives and decodes PSI section, PSIP (Program and Service Information Protocol) section or SI (Service Information) section, which is demultiplexed by the demultiplexer .","Also, the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder  decodes the received sections to make a database for service information, and stores the database for service information in the SI&Metadata DB .","The audio\/video decoders \/ decode the video data and the audio data, which are received from the demultiplexer .","The UI manager  provides a graphic user interface (GUI) for the user by using an on screen display (OSD), etc. and performs a receiving operation based on a key input from the user. For example, if a key input signal for channel selection is input from the user, the UI manager  transmits the key input signal to the service manager .","The service manager  controls managers related to the service, such as the service delivery manager , the service discovery manager , the service control manager , and the metadata manager .","Also, the service manager  makes a channel map and selects a channel by using the channel map in accordance with the key input signal received from the UI manager . The service discovery manager  provides information required to select the service provider that provides services. If a signal related to channel selection is received from the service manager , the service discovery manager  discovers a corresponding service by using the received information.","The service control manager  takes the role of selection and control of the service. For example, if the user selects a live broadcasting service like the existing broadcasting mode, the service control manager  uses IGMP or RTSP. If the user selects a video on demand (VOD) service, the service control manager  selects and controls the service by using RTSP. The metadata manager  manages metadata related to the service and stores the metadata in the SI&Metadata DB .","The SI&Metadata DB  stores the service information decoded by the PSI&(PSIP and\/or SI) decoder , the metadata managed by the metadata manager , and the information required to select the service provider provided by the service discovery manager . Also, the SI&Metadata DB  may store setup data for the system.","In the mean time, the IG  is a gateway where functions required to access IMS based IPTV services are collected.","The plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  illustrated in  are designed to take a single image or a plurality of images of a person or object located in the periphery of the multimedia device . In more detail, the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  are designed to operate the single image or the plurality of images continuously, periodically, at a selected time, or at a specific condition only, as described later in more detail.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},"Generally, the first image sensors related to depth data processing include a field not suitable for long-distance face recognition due to limited resolution (for example, maximum VGA level) and a recognition distance (for example, 3.5 m). Also, the second image sensors related to color data processing have drawbacks in that they have a slow recognition speed and are not robust to light condition. Accordingly, in order to solve the drawbacks of the image sensors, the multimedia device according to one embodiment of the present invention is designed to interact with a hybrid type image sensor module that is a hybrid type of the first image sensor and the second image sensor.","An IR camera or depth camera is used as the first image sensor. In more detail, a time of flight (TOF) type IR camera or depth camera and a structured light type IR camera or depth camera have been discussed. The TOF type IR camera or depth camera calculates distance information by using the time difference resulting from emission of infrared rays. The structured light type IR camera or depth camera calculates distance information by emitting infrared rays to a specific pattern and analyzing a modified pattern. The first image sensor is advantageous in view of depth data recognition and processing speed, and easily senses object, person, etc. even at a dark place. However, the first image sensor has a drawback in that it has low resolution at a long distance.","Moreover, a color camera or RGB camera is used as the second image sensor. In more detail, a stereo camera type color camera or RGB camera and a mono camera type color camera or RGB camera have been discussed. The stereo camera type color camera or RGB camera detects and traces the hand or face based on image time comparison information taken through two cameras. The mono camera type color camera or RGB camera detects and traces the hand or face based on shape and color information taken through one camera. The second image sensor is advantageous in that it has more improved resolution than that of the first image sensor, whereas the second image sensor has drawbacks in that it is vulnerable to peripheral lighting and it is difficult to recognize the corresponding object at a dark place. In particular, the second image sensor has a drawback in that it is difficult to recognize exact depth.","In order to solve the aforementioned problems, as illustrated in , the multimedia device according to one embodiment of the present invention is designed to have both the first image sensor and the second image sensor. The image sensors may be designed in such a manner that they are embedded in the multimedia device, or may be designed as separate hardware modules. First of all, as illustrated in (b) of , the first image sensor takes images that include users located in the periphery of the multimedia device. Detailed taking-images are illustrated in (), (), () and () of  in due order.","In the mean time, if image-taking and data analysis of the first image sensor are completed, as illustrated in (a) of , the second image sensor takes images of a face of a specific user. Detailed taking-images are illustrated in (), (), and () of  in due order.","The first image sensor of the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors according to one embodiment of the present invention takes first images located in the periphery of the multimedia device and extracts depth data from the taken first images. As illustrated in () of , the first image sensor can be designed in such a manner that a field of each object is displayed at different contrast ratios depending on the distance.","Moreover, the first image sensor can recognize a face of at least one user by using the extracted depth data. In other words, the first image sensor extracts body information (for example, face, hand, foot, joint, etc.) of the user by using the database, etc., as illustrated in () of , and acquires location coordinates and distance information of a face of a specific user as illustrated in () of . In more detail, the first image sensor is designed to calculate values x, y, and z which are location information on the face of the user, wherein the x means the location on a horizontal axis of the face in the taken first image, the y means the location on a vertical axis of the face in the taken first image, and the z means the distance between the face of the user and the first image sensor.","Also, among the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors according to one embodiment of the present invention, the second image sensor for extracting color images takes second images of the recognized face of the user, and is illustrated in () of .","In the mean time, if the first image sensor and the second image sensor illustrated in  are designed to adjoin each other, an error due to the difference in physical location may be disregarded. However, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the second image sensor is designed to compensate for the coordinate information or distance information acquired by the first image sensor by using the information on the difference in physical location and to take the user by using the compensated coordinate information or distance information. Also, if the first image sensor and the second image sensor are designed to be arranged horizontally from the ground, the information on the difference in physical location can be set based on a horizontal frame. The second image sensor, as illustrated in () of , extracts feature information from the taken second image. The feature information is data corresponding to a specific part (for example, mouse, nose, eye, etc.) for identifying a plurality of users who use the multimedia device. Moreover, the second image sensor may zoom in a zone corresponding to the face of the user based on the coordinate values (the values x, y, and z) obtained through image-taking of the first image sensor. This means a procedure of switching from () of  to () of .","If image-taking and analysis of the first image sensor and the second image sensor are completely performed, the multimedia device according to one embodiment of the present invention accesses a memory that stores data corresponding to the extracted feature information, and extracts information for identifying a specific user stored in the memory.","If the information for identifying a specific user exists in the memory, the multimedia device provides a service previously set for the specific user.","On the other hand, if the information for identifying a specific user does not exist in the memory, the multimedia device is designed to display a guide message for storing the recognized user information in the memory.","As described above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the first image sensor is designed to detect user location information or coordinate information on the face of the user while the second image sensor is designed to recognize the face by using the data acquired by the first image sensor.","Moreover, according to another embodiment of the present invention, the second image sensor is designed in such a manner that it is operated only in case of a specific condition. For example, if the distance information acquired by the operation of the first image sensor between the user and the first image sensor is less than a first reference value, or if a recognition rate on the face of the user, which is acquired by the operation of the first image sensor, is more than a second reference value, the face of the user located in the periphery of the multimedia device is detected and recognized by the first image sensor only. On the other hand, if the distance information acquired by the operation of the first image sensor exceeds the first reference value, or if the recognition rate on the face of the user, which is acquired by the operation of the first image sensor, is less than the second reference value, the second image sensor is additionally used to recognize the face of the user.","According to still another embodiment of the present invention, the second image sensor is designed to perform zoom-in by using the distance information acquired by the first image sensor in the procedure of recognizing the face of the user and to take the face only by using face coordinate information acquired by the first image sensor.","Accordingly, the different types of heterogeneous image sensors are used as above, it is advantageous in that it enables long-distance face recognition and data processing speed is more improved than that of the related art.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0098","num":"0097"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},"Face detection is performed by a process different from that of face recognition. The face detection includes a process of detecting a face zone within one image, whereas the face recognition is a process of recognizing whether the detected face corresponds to which specific user.

If the user desires to register a random channel as the preference channel while viewing the random channel, he\/she makes a V shape using two fingers, unfolds five fingers, or clasps hands as illustrated in  to . If the plurality of users view the broadcast receiver, hand action of each user is recognized, whereby a preference channel per user may be registered.","Data indicating that each hand shape or hand gesture corresponds to a command signal indicating that a current broadcast channel should be registered as a preference channel is previously stored in the databases of the multimedia devices ,  and .","Although  to  illustrates specific hand shapes only, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the examples of  to , and the preference channel may be registered by using other body parts.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0252","num":"0251"},"figref":["FIG. 46","FIG. 48"]},"Although small gestures of the user are required in  to , the embodiments of  to  are advantageous in that no gesture of the user for registration of the preference channel is required.","As illustrated in , a plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  according to another embodiment of the present invention take a user located in the periphery of a multimedia device . In particular, the plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  can monitor a joint motion  of the user by using a depth camera. If there is little change in motion for a certain time like the motion  illustrated in , it may be assumed that the user concentrates in the corresponding channel. Accordingly, the multimedia device  is designed to automatically register the current broadcast channel as the preference channel if there is relatively little change in motion of the taken user.","Moreover, as illustrated in , a plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  according to one embodiment of the present invention take a user located in the periphery of a multimedia device . Unlike , joint motion  of the user frequently occurs in . In this case, it may be assumed that the user does not concentrate in the broadcast program output from the current channel. Accordingly, the multimedia device  is designed not to register the current broadcast channel as the preference channel if there is relatively change in motion of the taken user.","In the mean time, as illustrated in , as a result of taking users located in the periphery of a multimedia device  through a plurality of heterogeneous image sensors  according to one embodiment of the present invention, if () detachment, () return, () detachment, and () return are repeated several times, it is not required to register the current broadcast channel as the preference channel. However, if detachment\/return of the users located before the broadcast receiver is not performed several times, the multimedia device is designed to automatically register the current broadcast channel as the preference channel. Moreover, the embodiment designed in  may be implemented in combination with the embodiments of  and , or may be implemented as a separate embodiment.","In other words, preference channel registration according to the embodiment of the present invention may be performed automatically by the multimedia device based on action pattern and change in face expression of the user in the middle of viewing a broadcast program. In more detail, the multimedia device analyzes the action pattern and change in face expression of the user who is viewing the broadcast program, by using heterogeneous image sensing modules, and automatically registers the current broadcast program as the preference channel if the analyzed result corresponds to the previously set action pattern or face expression. In other words, if the user rarely leaves the multimedia device in the middle of viewing the broadcast program, if change in face expression of the user seriously or frequently occurs, or if the user shows a viewing pattern such as clasping hands, crying, smiling, and doze, the multimedia device registers the current broadcast channel as the preference channel. Preferably, the multimedia device performs preference channel registration based on the action pattern and change in face expression of the user by determining whether the action pattern or the change in face expression departs from the previously set reference range. Also, preference channel registration based on the action pattern and change in face expression of the user may have lower reliability than that the preference channel is directly registered by the user. In this case, the multimedia device may register the current broadcast channel as a preliminary preference channel without immediate registration as the preference channel. Accordingly, the multimedia device provides a preliminary preference channel list to the user, and is operated to register channels only selected by the user as the preference channels.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0258","num":"0257"},"figref":["FIG. 49","FIG. 49","FIG. 53"]},"The multimedia device outputs a broadcast program received through the device broadcast network (S).
