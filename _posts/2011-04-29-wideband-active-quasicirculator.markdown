{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The subject disclosure relates to circulators and, more particularly, to a wideband active quasi-circulator for use in radio frequency applications.","Wireless communications have become prevalent in society. With such widespread use, it is desirable to design communication devices that are lightweight, have a small footprint with a minimum amount of internal components, and that are cost effective to produce, resulting in devices that are inexpensive and easy for the consumer to carry.","To reduce the size of such communication devices, it is desirable to maintain continuous (or almost continuous) bi-directional data transfer between two (or more) devices that are in communication with each other (e.g., full duplex operation). For full duplex operation, a device might utilize frequency diversity where the device transmits on a first frequency range (or band) and receives on a second frequency range (or band). The frequencies used can be separated by an adequate guard-band so that frequency-selective filters can be used to isolate the receiver from the transmitter while, at the same time, coupling both the receiver and the transmitter to a common antenna (also referred to as frequency diplexing). Other techniques utilized to separate the transmit signals from the receive signals for full duplex operation, over a single antenna, include time diversity techniques, spread spectrum codes, polarization selectivity, and circulators.","An issue associated with wireless communications relates to co-site interference wherein communications from devices within a geographic region interfere with other devices in the same geographic region. A solution for co-site interference issues is the quasi-circulator. However, a problem with conventional circulators and quasi-circulators is that such devices can be bulky and can have a narrow frequency range and thus, are not practical in use. Even if the circulator has a small size and a wideband frequency range, a problem that arises is that there might not be enough isolation between ports of the circulator. Another problem can be a circulator that has a narrow tuning range and thus, has a limited tuning bandwidth.","Additionally, conventional communication devices utilize a multitude of internal components. For example, radio frequency (RF) devices utilize power amplifiers, low noise amplifiers, switchplexer, and discrete components. These internal components increase the cost for RF-front end and can also increase the size (and weight) of communications devices.","The above-described deficiencies of today's radio frequency device architectures are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems, and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non-limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.","A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary, non-limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended, however, as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non-limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.","In accordance with one or more aspects and corresponding disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with an active quasi-circulator that has a small size, is lightweight, and can be compatible with monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology and, therefore, can replace a bulky ferrite circulator. Such replacement can be transparent to the changing standards including the Radio Frequency (RF) architecture referred to as software defined radio.","In an aspect, the active-circulator comprises both a power amplifier and a low noise amplifier, which are constructed by distributed amplifiers. A fundamental block of the active-circulator is distributed amplifiers, therefore, different topologies to improve the performance of distributed amplifiers can be implemented in the quasi-circulator, which can provide good power handling and noise figure performance.","The quasi-circulator, as disclosed herein, can operate over a wide frequency range with isolation (or substantial isolation) between the power amplifier and the low noise amplifier that is tunable (or reconfigurable) with high isolation at any frequency within the wide frequency range. Further, the disclosed quasi-circulator is suitable for use in mobile units in multi-band radio frequency communication systems. In addition, the disclosed quasi-circulator can replace a conventional passive switchplexer, which can further reduce the size of the circuit.","These and other embodiments are described in more detail below.","Wireless communications standards utilize several frequency bands that can be spread over a large range (e.g., Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), WiFi, Global Positioning System (GPS), Bluetooth, and so forth). Due to global roaming, it has become necessary to utilize wideband Radio Frequency (RF) front-end circuits to support different global standards (and associated frequency bands).","A circulator is a device comprising ports arranged such that energy entering one port is coupled to an adjacent port, but is not coupled to other ports. An example of a conventional circulator  comprising three-ports is illustrated in . The ports, labeled as Port 1, Port 2, and Port 3 (S=0) are arranged such that energy entering Port 1 is coupled to Port 2 (an adjacent port), but is not coupled to Port 3. Thus, signals are input to Port 1 and passed to the next port (e.g. Port 2) in a certain rotation (e.g., clockwise direction) without allowing the signals to pass in the opposite rotation (e.g., counter-clockwise direction). Further, the signals are not transferred to Port 3 because Port 3 is isolated from Port 2. The properties of the conventional circulator can be seen in the S-parameter matrix below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"msub":{"mi":["S","conventional"]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":["S","parameter","matrix"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mn":"1"}}]}}}}},"It is noted that although the circulator illustrated in  is a three-port device with a clockwise rotation, the disclosed aspects can be utilized with circulators having a different number of ports and\/or a different rotation (e.g., counter-clockwise).","A function of a circulator is to provide non-reciprocal characteristics (e.g., provides one direction transmission) to enable isolation (or substantial isolation) between ports of the circulator. When used as an isolator, the circulator has one port terminated in a matched load. A two-port isolator is non-reciprocal and provides isolation for the reverse direction only.","Conventional circulators of various types have known problems. For example, ferrites are a traditional material used for conventional passive circulators. The use of such circulators is based on Faraday rotation, which occurs when microwaves of a specific polarization are incident upon a ferrite material that is subjected to a magnetic field parallel to the direction of propagation of the microwaves. Circulators composites of ferrites are bulky, weighty, and have a narrow frequency range. Therefore, such circulators are generally impractical.","A tunable (or reconfigurable) active circulator is an active\/passive device that has a narrow tuning range. An advantage of a tunable active circulator is small size as compared with conventional circulators. However, a problem associated with the tunable active circulator is a limited tuning bandwidth. A chart  of a limited tuning range of a conventional wideband and tunable active circulator is shown in  where frequency  is represented along the horizontal axis and isolation  is represented along the vertical axis. An acceptable level of isolation is illustrated by the dashed line . As shown by the arrow , there is a limited tuning range available with a tunable active circulator. Also shown is a conventional wideband active quasi-circulator frequency response .","In RF\/microwave systems, non-reciprocal components, such as isolators and circulators, provide isolation between ports in both time and frequency. A conventional ferrite circulator can be replaced by an active circulator or a quasi-circulator. An active quasi-circulator is not a complete active circulator, but is similar to the conventional circulator except there is no signal flow from Port 3 to Port 1. The properties of a quasi-circulator are provided in the S-parameter matrix below:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["[","]"],"msub":{"mi":["S","quasi"]}},{"mo":["[","]"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"0"}]},{"mtd":[{"mn":"0"},{"mn":"1"},{"mn":"0"}]}]}}],"mo":"="}},{"mrow":{"mi":["S","parameter","matrix"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mtext":"-"},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}],"mn":"2"}}]}}}}},"An active quasi-circulator has some advantages as compared to conventional ferrite circulators. These advantages include small size, lightweight, and compatibility with monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology. Another advantage is that the active quasi-circulator can cover a wideband frequency range. Further, a signal transfer from Port 1 to Port 2 can be achieved with low insertion loss.","Circulators have various applications, including duplexing, multiplexing, and phase shifting. A duplexer is a device that switches an antenna to either a transmitter or a receiver. Thus, a single antenna can be utilized for both transmission and reception. When a circulator is used for duplexing, the circulator can allow for simultaneous (or almost simultaneous) signal transmission and reception at different frequencies. Thus, there is the need for good port isolation. If the circulator has a wideband frequency operation, the circulator can support multi-band standards at substantially the same time while utilizing a single antenna and a transmit\/receive circuit. An application for such circulators is software defined radios which utilize wideband non-reciprocal components, which can allow for the transmission of both Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) without the need for diplexing filters and\/or duplexing switches, thus mitigating the complexity of the circuit.","For multiplexing, a de-multiplexer device is utilized. The de-multiplexer comprises interconnected filters that can split a single channel carrying many frequencies into two or more channels that carry narrower bands of frequencies. A multiplexer can carry out an inverse process. For example, a multiplexer can combine into a single broadband channel two or more channels carrying different bands of frequencies. A two-channel multiplexer, referred to as a diplexer, typically comprises a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter. On the other hand, a multiplexer, comprising three or more channels, typically comprises band-pass filters.","Phase shifting can be accomplished with narrow-band phase shifters that can comprise microwave circulators. Such phase shifters offer simplicity, since only a reflective shifter is needed.","For wireless communications, RF\/microwave circuits can support multi-band standards, such as GSM, 3G, 4G, GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others. With the growth of mobile communications and a variety of different standards, the use of wideband active quasi-circulators can provide advantages over known techniques, such as circulators that use ferrite. The disclosed wideband active quasi-circulators have the advantages of small size, light weight, and compatibility with monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technology as well as the ability to transmit and receive at substantially the same time and at different frequencies.","The software defined radio utilizes multimode operation and the disclosed aspects can be utilized with the software defined radio. Further, existing mobile units in a multi-band radio frequency communication system can utilize the disclosed aspects to replace a conventional passive switchplexer to further reduce the size of the mobile unit.","An aspect relates to a wideband active quasi-circulator comprising a first port, a second port, and a third port. The wideband active quasi-circulator also comprises a first distributed amplifier connected to the first port, the first distributed amplifier configured for wideband signal cancellation. Also included is a second distributed amplifier that can be configured as a wideband power amplifier. The second distributed amplifier is operatively connected to the first distributed amplifier. Further, the wideband active quasi-circulator comprises a third distributed amplifier configured as a wideband low noise amplifier. The third distributed amplifier is operatively connected to the first distributed amplifier, the second distributed amplifier, the second port, and the third port.","In an implementation, the wideband active quasi-circulator also comprises an antenna configured for simultaneous (or almost simultaneous) transmission and reception of a signal when the three distributed amplifiers are biased.","In another implementation, the second distributed amplifier and the third distributed amplifier are configured to provide wideband frequency operation.","In a further implementation, at a first frequency, the wideband power amplifier is isolated or substantially isolated from the wideband low noise amplifier.","In some implementations, the first port is a single antenna port.
