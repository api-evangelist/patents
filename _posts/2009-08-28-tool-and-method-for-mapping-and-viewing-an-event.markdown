{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This Application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/145,392 which was filed on Jan. 16, 2009 and is presently and is incorporated by reference herein.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to a tool and method for mapping an event and more particularly, a tool and method for mapping an event which includes generating a zoomable and pannable view of an event map, and annotating an event map which may include annotating an event map based on a user input either individually or collaboratively and searching the annotated event map.","2. Description of the Related Art","When attending large multi-track events, such as conferences, trade shows or even large sporting events, attendees may be overwhelmed by the many choices available. They may find it hard to navigate the event in a way that best fits their personal interests and goals.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","100","105","110","115","100"]},"However, such a related art method is inflexible. There is no customization of views, there is no mechanism for preconference planning, and the schedule is disconnected from any social network. In short, the conference schedule provides poor visualization and personalization for the user.","There are several types of calendaring systems currently available. For example, Lotus\u00ae Notes, Lotus\u00ae Domino and Lotus\u00ae Quickr by IBM\u00ae provide email, shared calendars, and shared document storage and management, and also provide the ability to integrate word processing applications. There are also known in the related art several Web-based mashup creators (e.g., Web Summary, Marmite, and d.mix) which may allow a user to browse annotated web sites and perform a parametric copy of elements of interest.","There are also known in the related art, smart scheduling systems (e.g., GroupTime and RhaiCAL) and zoomable calendar interfaces (e.g., DateLens and Spiral Calendar) and zoomable interfaces (e.g., Planviewer) for visualizing hierarchical temporal data such as Microsoft\u00ae Project plans.","Timeline is another application that allows for visualizing time-based events. Timeline is a DHTML-based AJAX mashup\/widget which supports horizontal panning and allows a user to overlay annotations on top of a timeline. There are also other applications which may allow a user to visualize time-oriented data and hierarchical data (e.g., DOI Tree AVI and Polyarchies). There have also been some standards which have been published related to personal information exchange (e.g., vCard) and calendaring and scheduling (e.g., VCalendar and RDF Calendar).","There are also other related art systems and methods which relate to personal information exchange, calendaring and scheduling (e.g., Google Calendar, Trumba\u00ae Connect, Achieve Planner, Zimbra\u2122 Calendar, The Calendar Planner, 30Boxes, Calendarhub, diigo, AirSet, Spongecell, HipCal, nTreePoint Events, Cozicentral, iCalShare and Calgoo).","However, none of these related art systems and methods provides a user with a zoomable and pannable view of a customized event map.","In addition, when attending large multi-track events, such as conferences, trade shows or even large sporting events, attendees may be overwhelmed by the many choices available. They may find it hard to navigate the event in a way that best fits their personal interests and goals. However, none of these related art systems and methods may include annotating an event map based on a user input either individually or collaboratively and searching the annotated event map.","In view of the foregoing and other problems, disadvantages, and drawbacks of the aforementioned conventional systems and methods, an exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool and method of mapping an event, and a tool and method for annotating an event map which may include annotating an event map based on a user input either individually or collaboratively and searching the annotated event map.","An exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool for mapping an event includes a map generator for generating an event map, a view generator for generating a zoomable and pannable view (e.g., a customized view) of the event map, and a display device for displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the event map.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of mapping an event. The method includes generating an event map, generating a zoomable and pannable view of the event map, and displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the event map.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool for mapping an event, including a map generator for generating an event map, a customizing unit for customizing a view of the event map in a context comprising one of time, location, user and activity, based on user data, a view generator for generating the customized view of the event map, the customized view comprising a zoomable, pannable and mashable view of the event map, and including one of a timeline view, a branch view and a planogram view, and a display device for displaying the zoomable, pannable and mashable view of the customized event map,","The view may include a link related to a feature in the customized event map, and the view generator generates a view (e.g., a view of a pdf file, photo, video, etc.) in response to a user selection of the link, the feature including one of an event location, an event rating, an event time, an event session, and media (e.g., a paper) or other presentation, information or media associated with an event session. Further, customizing the view of the event map may include one of: customizing the view of the event map before the event, such that the customized view of the event map includes an identifier for identifying at least one of a session that has been marked as being of interest, a conflict among plural sessions that have been marked as being of interest, a location in a planogram of a session that has been marked as being of interest, and a location in a planogram of a structure housing an attendee of the event, and customizing the view of the event map during the event, such that the customized view of the event map includes an up-to-date view of the event map. The up-to-date view may, for example, highlight at least one of a session being attended by a user, and a session being attended by a person other than the user.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a system for mapping an event. The system includes an event server for storing event data, a processing device for inputting user data, the processing device being connected to the event server via a network, a tool for mapping an event, the tool being connected to the event server and the processing device via the network. The tool includes a map generator for generating an event map based on the event data, a view generator for generating a zoomable and pannable view of the event map, and a display device for displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the event map.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool for annotating an event map. The tool includes a map generator for generating an event map, an annotating unit for annotating the event map based on a user input, a view generator for generating a zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map, and a display device for displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of annotating an event map. The method includes generating an event map, annotating the event map based on a user input, generating a zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map, and displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a tool for annotating an event map. The tool includes a map generator for generating an event map, and an annotating unit for annotating the event map based on a user input, the annotating including tagging information (e.g., a comment) onto a feature of the customized hierarchical event map, the feature including one of a session of an event, a paper to be presented at the event, media elements related to the event, a speaker at a session of the event, and a location related to the event. The tool also includes a view generator for generating a zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map, a customizing tool for customizing a view of the annotated event map based on customizing data, a display device for displaying the zoomable view of the annotated customized hierarchical event map, a graphical user interface (GUI) which is displayed by the display device, and includes a viewing panel for displaying the zoomable view of the annotated hierarchical event map, a storage device for storing the annotated hierarchical event map, a search unit for performing a search of the hierarchical event map based on search criteria input to the search unit by a user; and a sharing unit for setting a policy for sharing the annotated hierarchical event map.","The sharing unit may be used, for example, to designate an annotation in the annotated event map one of public, private and shared with a group (e.g., one or more persons or entities) that is definable or configurable by the user. For example, the user may use the sharing unit to configure the group to include the employees of a particular company, members of a particular organization, people meeting particular criteria, etc.","The \u201csearch criteria\u201d may include keywords, topics, authors, organizers, locations, annotations, etc. A user may input such search criteria to search for event maps that have been annotated in a particular manner. For example, the search criteria may also be input to search for an event map that has been annotated by a specific user, by one among a group of users, by a person of certain amount of repute, by a certain number of users, during a specific time interval, with particular terms, with specific hyperlinks, and with a range of ratings.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a system for collaboration among event attendees. This could come in the form of being able to interact with people who are attending the same session or with people attending different sessions in the event. A user may attend the event in person or by other means such as internet enabled meetings, video conferences and so on. A user may access these capabilities (e.g., the event, meetings, or conferences) on a variety of devices such as laptop computers, netbooks, cell phones, ebooks, desktop computers, etc.","Another exemplary aspect of the present invention is directed to a system for annotating an event map. The system includes an event server for storing event data, a processing device for inputting user data, the processing device being connected to the event server via a network, a tool for annotating an event map, the tool being connected to the event server and the processing device via the network, and including a map generator for generating an event map, an annotating unit for annotating the event map based on a user input, a view generator for generating a zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map, and a display device for displaying the zoomable and pannable view of the annotated event map.","The present invention also includes a programmable storage medium tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform the inventive method.","The invention may also include a computing infrastructure in which computer-readable code is integrated into a computing system, such that the code and the computing system combine to perform the method of mapping an event or the method of annotating an event map according to the present invention.","With its unique and novel features, the present invention provides a tool and method for mapping an event which is more efficient and convenient than conventional systems and methods, and an efficient and convenient tool and method of annotating an event map which may include annotating an event map based on a user input either individually or collaboratively and searching the annotated event map.","Referring now to the drawings,  illustrate the exemplary aspects of the present invention.","It should be noted that the term \u201cmashup\u201d may be construed to mean an application (e.g., Web application) that combines data from more than one source (e.g., from plural content providers) into a single integrated tool (e.g., tool ). For example, a mashup may receive different forms of media from plural sources and combine the different forms of media into a single graphical interface (e.g., an event map). The term \u201cmashable\u201d may be used to describe an application that is capable of combining data from more than one source into a single integrated tool.","The present invention may include a Web-based collaborative calendar that provides a mashup substrate that can host both text and media (e.g., still image and moving image, audio) data. The invention may also provide a zoomable and pannable (e.g., and mashable) interface, and generate a hierarchical event composition.","A zoomable interface allows a user to view the contents at different levels of detail or resolution. A zoom can be literal or in image space where the contents are magnified and shown with a higher drawing resolution as would be done with a magnifying lens or, semantic or in model space, where a different level of information is shown when the user zooms in. An example of literal zooming occurs when a user zooms in on a photo from a digital camera. An example of semantic zoom occurs when additional information is rendered such as including an abstract of a talk when the user zooms in instead of just the title for the talk.","A pannable interface allows a user to examine parts of the data that are not presently viewable in the viewing region or window by bringing such portions of data into the viewing region or window. Panning can include horizontal panning, vertical panning or panning in other directions such as a northwesterly direction or a southwesterly direction, etc. In particular, the invention may provide a customizable view based on time, content and\/or keywords. The invention may also allow a user to collaborate with co-workers and colleagues, and may associate an event with location and planogram data in order to improve the visualization for the user.","The invention may provide an application programming interface (API) which allows overlays, manipulation, data composition, and personalization on a substrate of an event map (e.g., event schedule, event calendar, etc.). The invention may also allow a user to correlate data across events, across features within sub-events, etc.","The event map may include, for example, an interactive representation of an event. The whole event may be represented in a standard format, such as extensible markup language (XML), which may allow rendering of the event in a substrate that can be zoomed and panned. A slot in the event may include people such as speakers, organizers, and attendees (which may be represented in a vCard-like format), a subject (papers, presentations, etc) and\/or other information (e.g., sessions and session hierarchies) which may be represented in a vCalendar-like format. The invention may also generate a planogram view of the event location.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["200","200","205","215","217","205"]},"The tool  may also include a customizing unit  for customizing a view of the event map. For example, customizing data (e.g., user data pertaining to a user, attendance data pertaining to an attendee of the event, data pertaining to the event, and\/or data pertaining to a portion of the event) may be input to the customizing unit  (e.g., using an input device such as a keyboard) and the view of the event map may be customized based on this customizing data, so that the view generator outputs a \u201ccustomized view\u201d for display on the display device.","The attendance data may include, for example, attendance data for the user and\/or attendance data a person other than the user. For example, the attendance data may include data indicating that the user is attending Track  of the morning session and Track  of the afternoon session of a conference. Thus, for example, the event map may include an event map that has been customized to reflect the sessions which the user and\/or a person other than the user is attending, plans to attend or has attended.","Further, the user may mark the sessions that he plans to attend and provide this data to the event map for further utilization. For example, the event map can use the data input by the user to determine (e.g., and display) the number of people who are planning to attend a session, how full a session is compared to the physical or virtual capacity allocated to that session, etc.","It should be noted that although  shows the customizing data as being input to the customizing unit , the customizing data might also be input to the event map view generator .","More specifically, the tool  may represent an event as a data object that may be stored in a file. The data object may also be stored in a database with well-defined schemas and tables. The view generator  may interpret the data object and create a rendering (e.g., a customized view of the event map). The view may include one or more links which may point to a file (e.g., a pdf file, photo (e.g., JPEG file), video (e.g., MPEG file) etc.), or may point to a feature other than a file (e.g., selecting the link may open a popup window, launch an overlay, cause auxiliary information to be displayed, etc.).","The customizing unit  may include a zooming unit  for causing the view generator  to generate a zoomed view of a feature of an event map, a panning unit  for causing the view generator  to generate a panned view of an event map, and a mashup unit  which may generate a mashup substrate that may access data (e.g., third party data) using an application programming interface (API), and cause the view generator  to generate a view of an event map which represents the mashup. The zooming, panning and mashup units , ,  of the customizing unit  may be controlled, for example, by a user input.","A \u201cfeature\u201d of the event map may include information such as charts, presentations, media (e.g., papers such as Word files, Excel files, pdf files, etc.), flash files, 3D animation, audio podcasts (e.g., MP3 files), still image files (e.g., JPEG files) and video images (e.g., MPEG files)) and user-definable information. For example, if the event map is for a sporting event, a feature of the event map may include player statistics, video highlights of games and players, audio snippets of games or interviews of players and coaches, and so on.","The tool  may be implemented partially or completely in either hardware or software or a combination of both. For example, the tool  may include an event mapping software program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital processing apparatus to perform a method of mapping an event.  illustrates a system  for mapping an event according to an exemplary aspect of the present invention. As illustrated in , the system  may include a server  which may include a memory device (e.g., hard drive, RAM, CD-ROM, etc.) which may store the tool . The system  may also include plural processing devices  (e.g., an electronic device such as a camera, mobile phone, desktop computer, tablet computer, laptop computer, handheld device, personal digital assistant (PDA), Blackberry device, etc.) which may include a memory device (e.g., hard drive, RAM, CD-ROM, etc.) for storing the tool .","The processing device  may be connected (e.g., via wired or wireless communication link) to the server  via a network  (e.g., the Internet). A user may use an input device  (e.g., keyboard, mouse, touch panel, joystick, microphone, flexible deformable panels, camera coupled with computer vision algorithms, etc.) which is connected to the processing device  in order to input customizing data to customize a view of an event map, and to view or manipulate data displayed in the customized event map on the display device .","The system  may also include one or more event servers  which may store event data relating to an event such as a conference, convention, tradeshow or sporting event. For example, such event data may include the topics for discussion by day, time, session (e.g., morning, afternoon and evening session), details for individual event items such as titles, presenters, their affiliations, and presentation media such as charts, live or recorded videos, and live or recorded podcasts, the location of sessions, and planogram data that may additionally include pictures, seating arrangements, and details about the location such as acoustic properties, the type of audiovisual equipment in the room.","It should be clear that additional information related to the event could vary depending on the type of the event, a sporting event would have different data compared to an academic conference. For example, the server  may store the event data in the form of a list or a table, and the tool  (e.g., stored on either the server  or a user's processing device ) can access that event data and use the accessed event data to generate an event map (e.g., in the event map generator ) a view of which may be customized by the user using the processing device .","The customized view of the event map may be displayed in a display screen of the display device  in response to a user input. In particular, the memory device of the processing device  may store a browser (e.g., a Web browser such as Internet Explorer) for viewing the customized view of the event map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0062"},"figref":"FIG. 3A","b":["300","200","267","300","305","310","300","305","310","300"]},"The GUI  may also include a Zoom Settings button , Pan Settings button , and mashup Settings button  which may be selected by the user in order to set the zoom, pan and mashup features of the tool , respectively. The zoom and pan functions may be performed directly with input devices . Touch screen actions such as swipes, pinches, etc., can be used. A stylus may also be used for control. The amount of flexion on a flexible display can also be used as an input mechanism to control the zoom and pan functions. The GUI  also includes a viewing panel  for viewing the event map, and a list view button , branch view button , timeline view button  and a planogram view button  which may be selected by the user in order to display either a list, branch, timeline or planogram view of the event map in the viewing panel .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3B"],"b":["300","325","325"]},"The tool  may address common issues that arise while attending an event such as a large multi-track event. The tool  may help the user to keep track of what segments (e.g., sessions, tracks, etc.) of the event to attend, and to plan out a personalized schedule. The tool  may represent the conference calendar in a pannable, zoomable and mashable substrate, in a manner which includes a variety of visualization and collaboration elements on the event substrate.","The tool  may represent events with vCal\/XML structures and may represent people with vCard\/XML structures, so that customization, searching and\/or filtering with the tool  is all in scope.","Further, a sub-event of the event (e.g., Papers Session of Track  on Monday morning) can have a name-space and a repository containing files (e.g., a PDF file, MS Word file, Excel file, JPEG file, Flash file, video file, 3D animation file, etc.) and other features relating to the sub-event. For example, if a user clicks on the paper session  in , the tool  may access PDF files of all of the papers to presented in a session on Monday morning at the conference, and cause a PDF viewer application (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) to be opened up and display the PDF files from the Monday morning session on the display device .","The tool  may provide a more dynamic viewing of complex events with steady and pleasing zooming and panning for multi-track events. Also, sub-events may be structured as smaller \u201cEventMaplets\u201d which may subsequently be shared between users.","Further, instead of splitting the large amount of information into \u201ca deck of cards\u201d to fit into a user's browser screen, the tool may leverage spatial cues to visualize events (e.g., temporally related events). The tool  may also provide a customizable hierarchical layout of events via multiple constraints defined by contexts such as time, location, user and activity.","In addition, the user may use the tool  to customize a view of the event map before, during and\/or after the event. For example, the tool  may provide a \u201cMyConference\u201d page, which may have features that are similar to other pages such as MyYahoo or iGoogle pages.","For example, the MyConference page may show only sessions that the user has selected for inclusion in his personal conference schedule. The user can use several means to make such a selection including, for example, restricting the times to only certain hours in the day, restricting the subject matter to only certain topics, restricting the presentations to certain presenters or affiliations of presenters, etc.","First, before the event actually begins, the tool  may display (e.g., in the GUI ) for the user the sessions that he has marked as being of interest. For example, in , the sessions which the user plans to attend may be indicated by an indicator (e.g., highlighted, color coded or design coded) for distinguishing these sessions from other sessions which the user does not plan to attend. This may allow the user to visualize a conflict among those items of interests, such as when two events occur in different places at the same time.","The tool  may also indicate sessions that a person other than the user (e.g., the user's friends, co-workers, etc.) will attend. For example, in , the sessions which the user plans to attend may be colored red, and the sessions which his friend, Pete, plans to attend may be colored blue. The tool  may also show room location on the conference site planogram, pictures of the room, seating arrangements, details about the audiovisual and other equipment in the room, the location of the sessions which the user and his friends plan to attend, the location of the hotel where the user or the user's friends are staying, etc. Users may also be able to reserve their seats for a session by connecting to a self contained or external reservation system. Such details can be revealed in an auxiliary window or as overlay.","Second, the tool  may continuously or periodically update the event map before and\/or during the event. In particular, during the event, the tool  may keep the event map up-to-date in order to show the session which the user is currently attending, the session which the user's friends are currently attending, indicate any cancellations or changes in sessions, such as a change in location or a change in lecturer, indicate any changes to the sessions which the user or the user's friends plan to attend, etc. For example, during the event, the user may access the tool  using his laptop computer or his PDA (e.g., Blackberry) using the WiFi access of the location (e.g., hotel, convention center) or other forms of wireless connectivity such as 3G or 4G cellular. Thus, by viewing the updated event map, a group of co-workers may ensure that they are attending different sessions of the event in order to ensure that the group is optimizing the information that they are acquiring from the event.","The event map may also provide the user (e.g., the members of the group) with the sense that he is attending several sessions (e.g., all of the sessions) simultaneously. For example, viewing the event map in , the user may realize that his friend Pete is in a session in which Professor X is lecturing. If the user has a question for Prof. X, the user can simply open an instant messaging dialogue box on his browser and send an instant message to Pete and ask Pete to ask the question of Professor X.","Moreover, the user could click on a link for another track which he is not attending in order to receive live audio feed of the other track which may be output from the user's processing device (e.g., laptop, PDA, etc.), or video feed of the other track which may be displayed in the viewing panel  of the GUI  on his display device . Alternatively, the discussion at each of the sessions may be transcribed (e.g., transcribed in real time) so that a user could be attending Track  session on Monday Morning, while viewing (e.g., in the viewing panel  of the GUI ) the transcribed discussion of the Track  session, and so forth.","The tool  may also include in the GUI  a mechanism for allowing the user to direct a question to the lecturer of a session which is different from the one that the user is attending. For example, while a user is attending Track  session on Monday Morning, he could direct a question (e.g., via instant messaging, etc.) to the lecturer of the Track  session, and so forth.","Further, if a conference session is being videotaped, the conference organizer may make the video of the session available to the conference attendees in real time via a wired or wireless communication link, and store past sessions (e.g., on the event server ). In this case, the GUI  may include a list of all of the sessions so that the user could select a session from the list in order to view the video (e.g., streaming video from the conference website) which may be displayed in the viewing panel  of the GUI .","Referring again to the drawings,  illustrate exemplary views - which may be generated by the view generator  of the present invention.","For example,  illustrates a day view  which highlights a day (e.g., Monday) of the event. The day view  for Monday may be generated by the tool  and displayed in the viewing panel  by zooming into (e.g., clicking on) the Monday button on the overview event map in . The day view  may provide a more detailed view of Monday's sessions by breaking Monday down into first subcolumns for Morning, Afternoon, Evening and Late Evening, second subcolumns for papers, courses and tutorials, and third subcolumns for the individual papers, courses and tutorials. The day view  may also include icons and images  to improve the labeling and visualization for the user.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0082","num":"0081"},"figref":["FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["420","200","325","412","410","420","420","420","200"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0083","num":"0082"},"figref":["FIG. 4C","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4A"],"b":["430","200","325","422","420","422","410","410","430","410","430"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 4D","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4A"],"b":["440","200","325","412","430","412","410","440","440","1","2","3"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":["FIG. 4E","FIG. 4C","FIG. 4D"],"b":["1","450","200","325","412","430","1","443","440","1","450","1","1","1","2","1","3","1","4","1"]},"Further, if the user selects (e.g., clicks on) one of the papers in the Monday Morning papers view  or the Monday morning papers session P view , the tool  may display the selected paper in the GUI . For example, if a user selects paper P_  in either view  or view , the tool  may access a file (e.g., PDF file, Excel file, MS Word file, etc.) for paper P_  and cause a PDF viewer application (e.g., Adobe Acrobat) to be opened up and display the paper P_  in the viewer panel  of the GUI .

The user input may include, for example, information entered by a user such as ratings, tags, the likelihood that the user will attend a particular session, comments, time, location, translations, interpretations, the presence or absence of a particular person or group of persons, the number of people present (e.g., at an event session), or information (e.g., image files, text files, messages, etc.) obtained from a database or network (e.g., the Internet) which is input to the annotating unit  at the direction of the user. Other system-generated information that may be added to the annotation may include, for example, the location of the user, the location of the event, the time at which the annotation was created. The tool  may also include an authenticating unit which may require a user to be authenticated in order to annotation an event map. In other cases (e.g., cases which do not require authentication), an annotation may be made by a user anonymously.","The annotations on the event map may be played back in a time-sequenced manner so that a user can determine how the annotations came about in time and, in essence, replay the annotations as they annotations occurred. The annotations made by the annotating unit  may also be displayed (e.g., visualized) graphically using techniques (e.g., well-known techniques) such as histograms, color saturation, pie-charts, etc.","The tool  may also include a search unit  for performing a keyword or a more advanced search of the event map based on search criteria that may be input (e.g., to the search unit ) by the user.

For example, the rating indicator could be the user's personal rating or could be a average rating of all of the attendees of the event who have input their personal rating.","The view  also includes a discussion widget which the user may select in order to initiate and\/or participate in a discussion of a feature (e.g., a paper discussion in a session) with other attendees, or the author or presenter at the event. That is, a user may access a discussion of a presentation, paper etc. of the event through a link, pop-up, etc. which is displayed on the event map (e.g., on the presentation or paper displayed in the view of the event map). The discussion outlined above can happen before the event occurs, while the event is in progress or after the completion of the event.","The user may also access details of a presentation, paper etc. at the event (e.g., an abstract of a paper) through a pop-up dialog box (e.g., the stopping point for in-substrate navigation).","An annotation (e.g., a tag such as a comment which is tagged to the event map) may be but is not necessarily related to a session which the user plans to attend or is currently attending (e.g., \u201cThis presenter is a real dud\u201d), or to a paper to be presented in a session (e.g., \u201cThe data supporting this guy's conclusions is weak\u201d), or to a location of a session (e.g., \u201cThis room is too small for this session\u201d), and so on.","Further, a view of the event map to which the user may attach a tag (e.g., a comment) with the annotating tool may be customized or not customized. That is, it is possible for the user to use the annotating tool  to attach a tag (e.g., comment) onto a view of event map that has been customized, for example, to include the user's attendance data (e.g., highlighting sessions which the user is attending, highlighting locations of the sessions which the user is attending on a planogram view, etc.), but it is not necessary that a view of the event map be so customized.","The annotating tool  may allow a user to add notes, comments, questions, messages, ratings, etc., to an event map (e.g., an event map that has been generated by map generator ) and\/or to search the event map (e.g., performing a keyword or advanced search of the event map including the comments tagged to the event map). The annotating tool  may also allow a user to conveniently collaborate with friends, colleagues, co-workers, etc. regarding features of the event map. For example, the annotating tool  may allow a user to conveniently send an instant message or text message to a co-worker to request information about a presentation, paper, lunch location, speaker, etc.","The annotating tool  may also allow a user to conveniently store an annotated event map (e.g., store the annotated event map in a memory device of the processing device  or the event server , or the network server of the user's employer). For example, after an event, a user may keep the annotated event map for his records or for his employer's records. The user may also refine his comments that he initially annotated to the event map. For example, years after a conference is conducted, the user may further annotate his event map for the conference with additional comments, or the user may edit his initial annotation to include additional comments regarding a speaker, a paper, a location pertaining to the event, etc. The user may keep the annotated event map personal and to himself and not share the annotated event map with any other entity, or the user could click on the Share event map button  in order to share the annotated event map with one or more individuals.","The user may also return to the event map years later to search for a speaker at the conference, or search for a paper which was presented at the conference, or to help him recall the hotel where he stayed in the past. The user could also link an annotated event map to another event map which the user attended years ago. The user could also link a portion (e.g., a paper session, tutorial, etc.) of an annotated event map to a portion (e.g., a paper session, tutorial, etc.) of another event map which the user attended years ago.","The annotating tool  also may provide a mechanism for the user to collect and organize the comments that he annotated to an event map or over plural event maps. For example, as illustrated in , the GUI  may include a Collect comments (e.g., annotations) button  which may cause an MS Excel file to be generated and displayed in the viewing panel . The file may include, for example, columns which list the tags (e.g., comments) which were tagged to an event or to plural events, the session (e.g., paper, presentation) to which the tag was tagged, and the time the tag was tagged to the event map.","The GUI  may also include a Report generator button  which the user may select (e.g., \u201cclick on\u201d) in order to generate a report (e.g., an Expense Report, trip Report, etc). For example, if the user selects the Report generator button , a fillable form (e.g., a PDF file, Excel File, etc.) may be generated and appear in the viewing panel  of the GUI . The user could fill out the form in the viewing panel  and then select the Send email button  in order to send the completed form to his supervisor, his company's human resources department, his bar association, etc. This may make it more convenient for an employee to report his attendance at a conference, and for an employer or organization (e.g., a bar association) to confirm the user's attendance at a conference.","The annotating tool  may allow the user to conveniently collaborate with co-workers, colleagues, etc. The annotating tool  may also include a discussion board type feature which allows the user to correspond with other attendees. For example, the event server  may host a discussion board which the user can access by clicking on icon in , or by using the annotating tool  to log onto his account for the event. Once the user has logged on, the user can zoom in on a session and join a discussion (e.g., a discussion about the speaker, the paper being discussed, etc.) with other attendees of the session.","The above capabilities of the tool  may allow the user to network and share ideas with other attendees of a session even if the user is not physically present in the session. For example, the user could stay in his hotel room and \u201cremotely attend\u201d one or more of the sessions and even collaborate with his co-workers who are physically present at the session, or participate in the discussion in those sessions via the annotating tool . In particular, the annotating tool  may allow a user to perform collaborative attending, tagging, and\/or mining with structure instead of straight-line tagging.","In short, the annotating tool  may make annotations on the canvas (e.g., substrate) of the event map. These annotations (e.g., tags) can be related to the content of a session (e.g., paper quality, relevance to the user's employer, etc.), recommendations (e.g., identify co-workers who might be interested in a paper presented at the event, co-workers who should read the paper, etc.), people (e.g., identify students presenting at an event that the user's company must hire, identify a rising star student, or connect the student to a company's Campus Relationship Manager, etc., or identify faculty who should be nominated for the company's Faculty Award), research projects (e.g., mark related projects on a research project wiki), universities (e.g., note that a university of a faculty member author is doing a lot of work in remote health monitoring), and so on.","The annotating tool  may also allow a user to aggregate and correlate the business intelligence layers across plural events and across plural users. For example, thousands of annotated event maps of several hundred of the company's employees could be stored over several years, and the company's Campus Relationship Manager could search the annotated event maps to acquire a name of a candidate for employment to pursue for the company. This could be based, for example, on the number of tags returned by the search for a student, the quality of the tags for the student, and so forth.","Further, the annotations (e.g., tags) which the user may tag to the event map be private or may have some access control scoping. This feature may include a business intelligence layer added over a publicly available information canvas. For example, the employees of a company could tag privately for the company's benefit, whereas general users may just tag for social benefit.","A \u201cremote attendee\u201d user could use the annotating tool  to interact with an event site (e.g., a session at the event) during the conference. The user could post a technical request using the tool , or post a non-technical request (e.g., \u201cCould you please find out if student Y is really good or riding on Z's coat-tails . . . \u201d). This may allow the user to participate with people who are physically at the event.","The annotation tool  may also include a reader (e.g., a really simple syndication (RSS) reader) which would allow the user to view (e.g., in the viewing panel ) frequently updated works (e.g., such as blog entries, news forums, wikis, annotations, news headlines, audio, and video). The reader may check the user's subscribed feeds regularly for new work, download any updates that it finds, and generate a view of the updated work in the viewing panel .","For example, a user could subscribe to an RSS feed from an event, and request a list of papers or presentations tagged \u201crelated to Bluebird\u201d by employees of a particular company in conferences in 2008.","Further, the annotating tool  may allow a user to aggregate items of interest across plural events. For example, if the event is an annual event, the user may aggregate items of interest for the events that he attended over plural years. This would allow a user to determine, for example, how a university's participation in a particular conference has changed over the years, or to see the development of a competitor's research, and so on.","Further, digital libraries of organizations such as the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) or the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) could make available their annotations (e.g., tags) on event maps so that others can benefit from previous readers. Users may download the content and consume the material electronically on their personal devices such as PCs, electronic readers such as Amazon Kindle, etc., and contribute back annotations to the event maps hosting site.","The annotating tool  may also allow a user to annotate the event map (e.g., tag the event map) with code (e.g., a portable chunk of code such as a widget, gadget, badge, module, webkit, capsule, snippet, mini or flake) that can be installed and executed within a separate HTML-based web page without requiring additional compilation. The code may use, for example, DHTML, JavaScript, or Adobe Flash, and may add some content to the event map that is not static. That is, the annotating tool  may be used by the user to embed application elements into an event map (e.g., an extension of widget technology).","In particular, the code may relate to a feature of the event map and be displayed as being attached to (e.g., pinned to) the feature of the event map. That is, the event map substrate may include \u201cmini-applications\u201d which are attached to (e.g., pinned to) features (e.g., sessions, tracks, locations, etc.) of the event map.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0148","num":"0147"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["900","900","910","920","930","940"]},"Referring now to , system  illustrates a typical hardware configuration which may be used for implementing the method  of generating an event map and method  of annotating an event map.
