title: Extensible infrastructure for representing networks including virtual machines
abstract: Embodiments provide a virtual machine infrastructure including an application model and a user interface for displaying data associated with a plurality of nodes. The user interface is arranged in a hierarchy of views. An application is added to the infrastructure by adding an edge category and a view extension to the infrastructure. The user interface simultaneously displays the added view extension together with a view extension provided by another application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["Software applications, such as virtual machines (VMs), may be executed by a group, or \u201ccluster,\u201d of host computing devices. Each VM creates an abstraction of physical computing resources, such as a processor and memory, of the host executing the VM and executes a \u201cguest\u201d operating system, which, in turn, executes one or more software applications. The abstracted resources may be functionally indistinguishable from the underlying physical resources to the guest operating system and software applications.","At least some host computing devices are connected together to form one or more networks. In addition, at least some known cloud computing and\/or datacenter environments include large numbers of host computing devices, and each computing device may include a plurality of VMs. Cloud computing and\/or datacenter environments also include a plurality of network switches, datastores, and other devices or systems that support the host computing devices and VMs.","To ensure that the computing devices and\/or other devices within a cloud computing environment and\/or a datacenter operate efficiently and\/or are configured properly, software management tools are often used. Such software management tools often display the computing devices and\/or other devices in a tree or graphical view for monitoring. However, with large numbers of computing devices present in a cloud computing and\/or datacenter environment, a tree view may become inconvenient, requiring a user to horizontally and\/or vertically scroll through large sections of the tree within a relatively small application window. In addition, large numbers of computing devices and\/or other devices may cause a graphical view to be visually convoluted and\/or may require excessive computing resources to display the devices.","In addition, at least some known software management tools display data associated with computing devices in a segregated manner. In other words, the data is displayed only from the context of the application currently being accessed by the user. If the user wants to access other data available for a computing device that is supplied by another application, the user must exit the first application and access the second application, or must otherwise manually switch between applications. Accordingly, users may experience difficulty in identifying and\/or diagnosing issues associated with computing devices.","One or more embodiments described herein provide an extensible infrastructure for representing a network system including an application model and a user interface for displaying data associated with a plurality of nodes. The user interface is arranged in a hierarchy of views. An application is added to the infrastructure by adding an edge category and a view extension to the infrastructure. The user interface simultaneously displays the added view extension together with a view extension provided by another application.","This summary introduces a selection of concepts that are described in more detail below. This summary is not intended to identify essential features, nor to limit in any way the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Embodiments described herein provide an extensible infrastructure for representing a network system including a plurality of system objects such as computing devices and\/or virtual machines (VMs). The infrastructure includes, in some embodiments, an application model, an object model, a resource model, and a user interface. In other embodiments, the infrastructure may include additional or fewer elements. The application model defines a hierarchical set of views to enable an application to navigate from an application entry point to a node representing a system object. The data model provides a set of views for representing data associated with nodes. In addition, the data model enables data associated with a node to be received from a first application being accessed, and receive data associated with the node from a second application without switching a focus from the first application or the node.","Accordingly, when an application views or displays data associated with a node, the application does not need to duplicate data from other applications for the node. Instead, the infrastructure enables a user to access the singular version of the node as it is shared between applications. In addition, administrators or users may access all data gathered for a node from a plurality of applications without having to switch between applications. The infrastructure and user interface are extensible, allowing an administrator or developer to add further extensions and interfaces to extend the functionality of the infrastructure and user interface in a customized manner.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","104","104"]},"Computing device  also includes at least one presentation device  for presenting information to a user . Presentation device  is any component capable of conveying information to user . Presentation device  may include, without limitation, a display device (e.g., a liquid crystal display (LCD), organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, or \u201celectronic ink\u201d display) and\/or an audio output device (e.g., a speaker or headphones). In some embodiments, presentation device  includes an output adapter, such as a video adapter and\/or an audio adapter. An output adapter is operatively coupled to processor  and configured to be operatively coupled to an output device, such as a display device or an audio output device.","The computing device  may include a user input device  for receiving input from user . User input device  may include, for example, a keyboard, a pointing device, a mouse, a stylus, a touch sensitive panel (e.g., a touch pad or a touch screen), a gyroscope, an accelerometer, a position detector, and\/or an audio input device. A single component, such as a touch screen, may function as both an output device of presentation device  and user input device .","Computing device  also includes a network communication interface , which enables computing device  to communicate with a remote device (e.g., another computing device ) via a communication medium, such as a wired or wireless packet network. For example, computing device  may transmit and\/or receive data via network communication interface . User input device  and\/or network communication interface  may be referred to as an input interface  and may be configured to receive information, such as configuration options (e.g., threshold values), from a user.","Computing device  further includes a storage interface  that enables computing device  to communicate with one or more datastores. In exemplary embodiments, storage interface  couples computing device  to a storage area network (SAN) (e.g., a Fibre Channel network) and\/or to a network-attached storage (NAS) system (e.g., via a packet network). The storage interface  may be integrated with network communication interface .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["235","235","235","100","100","205","205","102","104","112","110","106","210","205"],"sub":["1","2 ","N "]},"The virtualization software layer supports a virtual machine execution space  within which multiple virtual machines (VMs -) may be concurrently instantiated and executed. Hypervisor  includes a device driver layer , and maps physical resources of hardware platform  (e.g., processor , memory , network communication interface , and\/or user input device ) to \u201cvirtual\u201d resources of each of VMs -such that each of VMs -has its own virtual hardware platform (e.g., a corresponding one of virtual hardware platforms -). Each virtual hardware platform includes its own emulated hardware (such as a processor , a memory , a network communication interface , a user input device  and other emulated I\/O devices in VM .","In some embodiments, memory  in first virtual hardware platform includes a virtual disk that is associated with or \u201cmapped to\u201d one or more virtual disk images stored in memory  (e.g., a hard disk or solid state disk) of computing device . The virtual disk image represents a file system (e.g., a hierarchy of directories and files) used by first virtual machine in a single file or in a plurality of files, each of which includes a portion of the file system. In addition, or alternatively, virtual disk images may be stored in memory  of one or more remote computing devices , such as in a storage area network (SAN) configuration. In such embodiments, any quantity of virtual disk images may be stored by the remote computing devices .","Device driver layer  includes, for example, a communication interface driver  that interacts with network communication interface  to receive and transmit data from, for example, a local area network (LAN) connected to computing device . Communication interface driver  also includes a virtual bridge  that simulates the broadcasting of data packets in a physical network received from one communication interface (e.g., network communication interface ) to other communication interfaces (e.g., the virtual communication interfaces of VMs -). Each virtual communication interface may be assigned a unique virtual Media Access Control (MAC) address that enables virtual bridge  to simulate the forwarding of incoming data packets from network communication interface . In an embodiment, network communication interface  is an Ethernet adapter that is configured in \u201cpromiscuous mode\u201d such that all Ethernet packets that it receives (rather than just Ethernet packets addressed to its own physical MAC address) are passed to virtual bridge , which, in turn, is able to further forward the Ethernet packets to VMs -. This configuration enables an Ethernet packet that has a virtual MAC address as its destination address to properly reach the VM in computing device  with a virtual communication interface that corresponds to such virtual MAC address.","Virtual hardware platform may function as an equivalent of a standard x86 hardware architecture such that any x86-compatible desktop operating system (e.g., Microsoft WINDOWS brand operating system, LINUX brand operating system, SOLARIS brand operating system, NETWARE, or FREEBSD) may be installed as guest operating system (OS)  in order to execute applications  for an instantiated VM, such as first VM . Virtual hardware platforms -may be considered to be part of virtual machine monitors (VMM) -which implement virtual system support to coordinate operations between hypervisor  and corresponding VMs -. Those with ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various terms, layers, and categorizations used to describe the virtualization components in  may be referred to differently without departing from their functionality or the spirit or scope of the disclosure. For example, virtual hardware platforms -may also be considered to be separate from VMMs -, and VMMs -may be considered to be separate from hypervisor . One example of hypervisor  that may be used in an embodiment of the disclosure is included as a component in VMware's ESX brand software, which is commercially available from VMware, Inc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIG. 2"],"b":["300","100","235","235","300","100","235","235"],"sub":["1","N ","1","N"]},"In an embodiment, system  includes a plurality of nodes  that are each representative of at least one system object. The system objects may include one or more computing devices , VMs -, network switches (not shown), datastores (not shown), and\/or any other resource or device. Nodes  may be grouped by, or included within, one or more node types (not shown) and are related to each other by one or more edges . In addition, as described more fully herein, nodes  and node types are extensible such that an application may add new nodes  and\/or node types to system  and\/or nodes .","Each edge  represents a relationship or common characteristic of a pair of nodes . Edges  may include, without limitation, a parent-child relationship, a physical relationship (e.g., two VMs -may be instantiated within the same host computing device  and\/or two computing devices  may be physically connected together), a common problem or error that each node  is experiencing, a common node type shared between nodes , and\/or any other relationship that enables system  to function as described herein. In an embodiment, edges  may be grouped or defined by one or more edge categories (not shown in ). In addition, as described more fully herein, edges  and edge categories are extensible such that an application may add new edges  and\/or edge categories to system  and\/or nodes .","In an embodiment, a plurality of applications -monitors and\/or manages nodes  within system . Each application -monitors and\/or manages at least a subset  of nodes  within system  such that each application -has or defines a view and\/or a perspective for each node  within subset . Accordingly, an application boundary or scope  is defined by, or includes, subset  of nodes  within boundary . More specifically, each application -may identify or define one or more edge categories and\/or node types that application -will manage and\/or monitor, and subset  includes each node  that satisfies the edge categories and\/or node types. The perspective includes the data, actions, and\/or configuration settings for a node . In addition, application boundary  of one application may overlap an application boundary  of another application or applications -such that subsets  of applications -may overlap, or share common nodes . Accordingly, each application -may have a different perspective of a node  common to other applications -such that each application -may include a different amount and\/or type of data, actions, and\/or configuration settings for node .","In an embodiment, applications -may include, without limitation, vSphere, vCloud, View, Virtual Infrastructure (VI), VMware Update Manager (VUM) and\/or Site Recovery Manager (SRM) brand software, which are available from VMware, Inc. Alternatively or additionally, applications -may include one or more third party and\/or user-defined applications.","In some embodiments, a node  that currently is the focus (or is in context) of the application -being accessed is an anchor node . Nodes  that share one or more edges  with (i.e., are related to) anchor node  are related nodes .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIGS. 6-11","FIG. 3"],"b":["401","300","306","306","401","302","300","500","401","402","306","306","401"],"sub":["1","N ","1","N "]},"In an embodiment, application infrastructure  and user interface  (and associated node information and views) are implemented and\/or executed by one or more computing devices . For example, infrastructure  and user interface  are implemented by a plurality of computer-executable instructions and\/or components stored within a memory, such as memory  or memory , and the instructions are executed by a processor, such as processor  or processor  (all shown in ) to perform the functions described herein. In addition, user interface  is displayed to a user by presentation device  and input from a user is received by user input device  (both shown in ).","Referring again to , in an embodiment, infrastructure  includes an application model , an object model , a resource model , and user interface . Each model , , and  and\/or user interface  includes and\/or defines templates, application programming interfaces (APIs), programming objects and components, user interfaces, and\/or any other data and\/or instructions that enables infrastructure  to function as described herein.","As described more fully herein, user interface  includes a plurality of views (not shown in ) for managing and monitoring nodes . The views may be defined by, and\/or provided by, application model , object model , and\/or applications -.","Resource model  defines a plurality of resource node types, such as physical resource nodes (also known as \u201cbacking nodes or objects\u201d), virtual resource nodes, virtual consumer nodes, and container nodes. A physical resource node provides a resource. For example, a disk or storage area network (SAN) provides storage resources. A virtual resource node provides a layer of abstraction on top of the physical resource. For example, resource pools abstract central processing units (CPUs) and memory, datastores abstract storage disks, and a VMware Distributed Switch (vDS) brand software abstracts physical network interface cards (NICs). The resource abstraction may provide capabilities that cannot be assigned to the physical resource directly, like load balancing across multiple physical resources. A virtual consumer node, such as a VM -, consumes a virtual resource, and container nodes organize or categorize other nodes.","Application model  defines an extensible hierarchy of views (shown in ) that are exposed to applications -for applications -to access through one or more application extensions or plugins (also referred to as \u201cview extensions\u201d or \u201cuser interface extensions\u201d). User interface  includes data from the objects and\/or extensions of the hierarchy and presents the data, extensions, and\/or views to a user. In addition, the views are extensible such that applications -may incorporate additional data and\/or actions into views. Application model  enables one or more applications -to add data associated with applications -to existing task and feature areas of application model views, instead of building out separate sub-applications within applications -. For example, if an application shows data about a node , that application may add the data to the existing view for that node . If an application must expose configuration settings for services provided by application , such as electronic mail (email) or session management, that application may add controls to a general administration or settings portion of the view. If an application provides new nodes , data, use cases, and actions instead of augmenting an existing node , application is also enabled to provide one or more filters, views, and\/or inventories that represent the perspective of application with respect to the subset  of nodes  (also known as an \u201cinventory\u201d) within application boundary .","In an embodiment, application model  enables user interface  to centralize data, settings, and actions (hereinafter referred to as \u201cnode information\u201d) associated with nodes  such that users (through applications -) are able to configure settings for all applications -in one place, view all issues on a managed node  from one view, and the like. In addition, application model  reduces duplication between different applications -. Instead of implementing multiple management, monitoring, or administration user interfaces or views, applications -can add data to the existing user interface  (e.g., to one or more views) defined by application model .","Referring to , user interface  is arranged or implemented in one or more hierarchies  of views. In an embodiment, hierarchy  includes a plurality of levels , such as an entry point , an inventory level , a node level , a category extension level , and\/or an application-specific extension level . Each level  of hierarchy  includes its own views of nodes , edge categories, and\/or system . In addition, applications -interface with, or extend, hierarchy  by inserting or installing an application extension (not shown) at one or more levels of hierarchy . Each application -may include a separate hierarchy , and\/or may be at least partially integrated with a hierarchy  of another application -.","In some embodiments, the term \u201cextend\u201d refers to augmenting or increasing a functionality of a component, device, or system. In addition, in some embodiments, the term \u201cview\u201d refers to a display, such as a window, tab, portlet, and\/or any other display that enables an application -or another program or component to present graphical data and\/or text to a user. In an embodiment, views defined by application model  and\/or object model  are displayed in a portion of user interface .","Each application -may extend infrastructure  and\/or user interface  to define an individual entry point  for accessing system  and\/or initiating a workflow. Alternatively, an application may not include an entry point . For example, an application may only be configured to perform actions on nodes , and may not include views associated with nodes , or the application may only provide additional data within preexisting views provided by other applications -.","In an embodiment, inventory level  includes one or more inventories  that each identifies a plurality of nodes  related to an anchor node  by one or more edges . In addition, nodes  are grouped together by edge categories. Applications -may extend inventory level  by defining one or more application-specific inventories  and\/or defining one or more application-specific edges  and\/or node types. Selecting one or more nodes  or edge categories causes user interface  to display a view associated with the node  or edge category.","Node level  includes a selected or focused node  (also known as an anchor node). When a node  is selected from inventory level  (or from another level ), data and\/or one or more views associated with node  are displayed by user interface .","Category extension level  includes one or more category views  defined by object model , such as a summary view , a monitor view , a manage view , a related items view , and\/or any other view. In an embodiment, category views  are associated with, and display data associated with, a node  selected at node level . An application may extend category extension level  by inserting or installing an extension that adds data, configuration settings, and\/or actions specific to application into one or more category views  of category extension level .","Application-specific extension level  includes one or more application-specific views  defined by object model  and\/or applications -. More specifically, each application-specific view  of application-specific extension level  is associated with, and\/or included within, a category view  of category extension level . An application may extend application-specific extension level  by inserting or installing an extension that adds data, configuration settings, and\/or actions specific to application into one or more application-specific views  of application-specific extension level .","During operation, a user navigates through hierarchy  of views using a navigation panel (not shown in ) of user interface . As the user navigates to category extension level  and\/or application-specific extension level  of hierarchy , one or more associated category views  and\/or application-specific views  are displayed to the user. In some embodiments, during navigation, data and views from multiple applications -are displayed simultaneously in a data panel (shown in ).","Referring to , application model  provides a manage and monitor interface  in which applications -may plug into to add one or more application-specific views (not shown) for the management and\/or monitoring of nodes  or application configuration settings. Manage and monitor interface  is positioned in a first, or navigation, panel  of user interface .","In an embodiment, application model  enables applications -to define entry points  into system . Manage and monitor interface  includes one or more links to entry points  in navigation panel . Manage and monitor interface  enables applications -to access and\/or expose data, configuration settings, and\/or actions (i.e., node information) for nodes , and enables such node information to be received from other applications -while in the context of a currently-focused application . The node information is displayed in a second, or data, panel  of user interface .","Referring to , a user may navigate hierarchy  of views for nodes  using navigation panel . More specifically, the user may select an entry point  to list or display one or more inventories  for the application selected by entry point . For example, as illustrated in , the user may select Virtual Infrastructure (VI) entry point  to focus on the VI application and to display inventories  associated with VI application . Inventories  may include one or more groups of overviews or dashboards , node inventories , third-party application extensions , and\/or custom views or queries . Node inventories  display inventories of nodes  listed by edge categories . More specifically, edge categories  are listed based on, and determined by, the node type. In addition, edge categories  of node inventory  may be selected to move to a lower level of hierarchy within navigation panel  to display and focus on a node  within node inventory .","Application model  may also define an administration or services view (not shown) that enables applications -to plug into to offer configurations for services specific to applications -, such as database connections, polling rates, and the like. Additionally, application model  may define an application-specific view (not shown) that enables applications -to add one or more views to offer application-specific user preferences and\/or any other view that enables application model  to function as described herein.","Object model  defines a template for nodes  that are representative of system objects. More specifically, object model  categorizes node information such that each application -may provide different aspects or perspectives of node information, and may provide new node types and\/or edge categories , while maintaining a substantially uniform interface and display for the node information.","Referring to , a plurality of object model views  is defined by object model  for nodes , and are positioned and displayed by user interface  within data panel  at a category extension level . In an embodiment, object model views  include, or are displayed within, a plurality of windows, menus, or tabs, such as a getting started tab (not shown), a summary tab , a monitor tab , a manage tab , a related items tab , a legacy tab (not shown), and an action menu (not shown in ) of user interface . In addition, applications -may provide one or more application-specific views , such as tabs, menus, or portlets, as plugins or extensions to object model  at an application-specific extension level . In an embodiment, object model views  are positioned within data panel . In the embodiments shown in , the getting started tab and the legacy tab are not displayed by user interface . Application-specific views  are also positioned within data panel  and below object model views .","The getting started tab provides an introduction to a selected node  (i.e., a node  selected within navigation panel ), such as how node  fits into application and how node  is used. The tab also provides links to common tasks or actions associated with node .","Summary tab  includes summary view  and provides identification information for a selected node  and identifies any issues or events requiring attention. In an embodiment, the identification information includes high level data that enables a user to uniquely identify node . The high level data includes properties such as the name of node , user-readable globally unique identifier (GUID) such as a hostname or internet protocol (IP) address, and life-cycle properties of node , such as a creation date of node . Summary tab  also includes status information for the selected node , such as visual representations of resource utilization data for node .","In an embodiment, the issues identified by summary tab  include high priority identified misconfigurations of node  and\/or notifications that require immediate attention of a user. In addition, other suitable data may be shown on summary tab , and may be disabled or removed by the user if the data is not desired.","Referring to , monitor tab  includes monitor view  and displays node information for a selected or anchor node . In an embodiment, the node information includes runtime data describing a current operation of node , and\/or historical data (not shown) for operation of node  in the past. For example, the runtime data may include a power state of a VM -, a distributed resource scheduler (DRS) recommendation for a cluster (not shown), a connection state of a host computing device , and\/or performance and alarm data for node . The historical data may include one or more logs, tasks, and\/or events.","In an embodiment, monitor tab  includes a plurality of application-specific views  defined by object model  and\/or by one or more applications -, such as the focused application . Monitor tab  may include application-specific views  that are displayed in, for example, an issues tab  for displaying issues affecting or associated with node . Monitor tab  may also include a performance tab  for displaying performance data related to a past activity of node , resource consumption data (i.e., how node  is using the resources allocated to node , if applicable), and\/or profile performance data (e.g., how node  is performing relative to the profiles and health status set for node ). In addition, monitor tab  may include a task tab  for displaying a long term record of tasks for node , and an event tab  for displaying a long term record of events on node  and\/or one or more logs for node . An application, such as focused application , may add or insert one or more application-specific tabs  to display application-specific data, configuration settings, and\/or actions for node . If any data for monitor tab  is not relevant for a selected node , it may be removed or hidden.","It should be recognized that node information displayed within monitor tab  (e.g., displayed within application-specific views  and\/or displayed within other views  defined by object model ) may be within the context of one or more other applications -in addition to, or instead of, the focused application -. More specifically, the node information displayed may be a part of the perspective of one or more other applications -in addition to, or instead of the perspective of the focused application . Accordingly, monitor tab  and\/or other views  defined by object model  enables the focused application to receive and display node information for the selected node  from other applications -without changing or leaving the focus of the currently focused application .","Referring to , manage tab  includes management properties of node  that affect how node  operates in system . The management properties are static properties that do not change unless the user or a policy changes them. In an embodiment, the management properties include resource allocation properties, node settings, profile definitions, alarm definitions, physical resource node properties (also known as \u201cbacking object properties\u201d), tags, permission settings, and\/or any other property or setting that enables manage tab  to function as described herein.","Resource allocation properties are configurable settings related to the resource types (if applicable) that node  exposes to related consumer nodes . Node settings include direct mutable properties of node , such as virtual hardware platform -(shown in ) of a VM -, and\/or DRS settings of a cluster (not shown). Profile definitions identify any profile assigned to node  and, in some embodiment, enables the user to override the profile settings for node .","In addition, alarm definitions enable a user to define alarms for the selected node . Resource provision node properties display data for related nodes  that provide resources to the selected node . In an embodiment, tags include metadata that the user selects to identify or annotate the selected node , such as custom attributes and notes (e.g., descriptions of node ). Permission settings identify which users and\/or devices have authority to view or change the settings and\/or properties of node . If one or more of the above properties or settings is not relevant to a given node type, it may be removed or hidden.","Referring to , related items tab  displays all or a portion of nodes  that related to the selected node  (i.e., all or a portion of nodes  sharing at least one edge  with selected node ). More specifically, related items tab  identifies one or more edge categories , and displays all nodes  that share an edge  in edge categories  with the selected node . In addition, for each related node displayed in related items tab , one or more columns  of node information is displayed. In some embodiments, columns  of node information are selected based on the node type of the selected node  and\/or the node type of the related nodes .","Columns  may also be extended by application such that related items tab  includes one or more application-specific columns  of node information. Such columns  represent one or more edge categories  of selected node . For example, if the Hosts tab  is selected as illustrated in , all nodes  related to selected node  by edge category  (e.g., all nodes  that have a node type set to host computing device ) are displayed.","It should be recognized that related nodes  displayed within related items tab  may be within an application boundary  of one or more other applications -in addition to, or instead of, the focused application . Accordingly, related items tab  enables the focused application to receive and display node information for the selected node  from other applications -(i.e., from the perspective of other applications -) without switching or changing the focus away from the currently focused application .","In each view  defined by object model  and displayed by user interface , one or more actions to be performed on the selected node  may be displayed in an action menu  or tab. When a node  is displayed in a view , the full set of actions available to be performed on the selected node  is available to the user in action menu . More specifically, actions from each application -perspective are available to the user for the selected node  within the context of the focused application . However, the context of the focused application may define which actions are displayed to the user for selection.","As described herein with reference to , each application -is represented by one or more high-level inventories  in navigation panel . Inventories  are \u201cjumping off points\u201d or secondary entry points for workflows and views that display and manipulate nodes  of system  that applications -share between each other.","A user or an administrator begins a workflow at an entry point  and\/or inventory  for a selected (i.e., focused) application . The user or administrator progresses through the workflow by navigating through hierarchy  to specific views  and nodes . The views  of a selected node  show the perspective of application for node  (e.g., node information), as well as the perspectives of all other applications -that encompass node  within application boundaries . Because the node information for all applications -is displayed and\/or available in the details of node  within the views , the focused application is saved from duplicating common data of node  that is provided by other applications -.","After arriving at a particular view  or node , the administrator can conclude the workflow by manipulating node  (e.g., actions associated with node ) for the originating application , or for another application -as needed. In one embodiment, node  is manipulated by changing data, at least one configuration setting, and\/or at least one action for node , for example, that is displayed in data panel .
