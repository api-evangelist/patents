title: Method for cooling a motor in a blower assembly for a furnance
abstract: A method of cooling the bearings of a motor in a motor housing for a furnace assembly is disclosed comprising an aperture in the motor housing whereby air is brought into the motor housing and drawn around the motor via an impeller into the impeller housing thereby eliminating the need of a separately attached fan to cool the motor or motor bearings. The impeller pulls the air from the motor housing into the impeller housing or blower via an inlet port in the impeller housing and apertures in the back plate of the impeller and out an exhaust port situated in the impeller housing.

No. 60\/140,144 filed Jun. 21, 1999, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. This application is a continuation of the provisional application Ser. No. 60\/140,144 entitled, \u201c80+ Blower and Furnace Venting Method\u201d and filed Jun. 21, 1999, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Not Applicable.","(1) Field of the Invention","This invention relates generally to a method for cooling a motor in a blower assembly for a furnace. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of cooling an electric motor without an auxiliary fan in a blower assembly.","(2) Description of Related Art","Typically, many gas-furnaces use induced draft blower assemblies to control flue gas by removing the burnt by-products. These blowers are designed to produce a certain amount of airflow. The motor's shaft extends radially into the blower's housing where an impeller is attached to the motor shaft. The blower housing typically has one inlet and one outlet. Combustion gases are drawn into the housing by the rotating impeller that expels the gases through the outlet into a flue or similar avenue of exit.","With respect to motor cooling, the gases that are forcibly moved through the housing by the impeller do not come into contact with the motor. Thus, blower activity does not in any way contribute to the cooling of the motor.","As is known in the state of the art for conventional motor and furnace assemblies, auxiliary fans are provided on the rotating shaft of a blower motor to draw air into the motor housing to cool the motor. The furnace electronics are located in the vestibule area of the motor casing where the air temperature can often reach 150\u00b0. The inevitable exposure of the electronics to the vestibule heat shortens the working life of the electronics. Typically vents are provided in the motor housing to allow for the entry and exit of cooling air.","There are three notable drawbacks associated with the presence and operation of fans in a blower motor assembly. First, the fan inevitably creates drag on the operating motor and reduces motor efficiency with respect to the task of drawing in and expelling exhaust gases from an operating furnace. Second, the fan inevitably generates unwanted noise. Third, the presence of one or more fans increases the overall length of the blower motor assembly. In an effort to solve these numerous related problems, a method for venting the air in a furnace or blower housing assembly has now been achieved that optimizes the intake of combustion air and the expulsion of exhaust gases while providing a \u201ccool-to-the-touch\u201d blower housing.","It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for cooling the motor that eliminates the need for an auxiliary fan. Another object of the invention is to reduce noise levels produced by a blower by eliminating the auxiliary fan. A further object of the invention is to reduce overall blower motor height to allow for more streamlined furnaces. A yet further object of the invention is to provide a means of eliminating heat sources near the electronics in the vestibule portion of a furnace to which the blower is attached. These and other objects are accomplished from the following described blower.","This invention relates to a method of cooling a motor in a blower assembly that thereby eliminates the need to have an auxiliary fan to cool the motor.","According to the invention the assembly blower or motor casing has at least one hole or aperture located anywhere on the motor case to allow for the flow of air into the motor case. The combination of the aperture on the motor case and impeller back plate aperture allows for external air to be drawn into the blower over the motor and into the impeller portion of the blower housing and out an exhaust port situated in the blower housing.","The new method eliminates the need for an auxiliary fan to cool the motor, thereby, reducing the overall length of the assembly. This method not only provides a motor case that is self cooling but also provides the additional benefit of being cool to the touch. Finally, this method provides for the reduction of noise by the elimination of the fan.","These and other objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from a review of the drawings and a reading of the following detailed description of the invention.","Referring to , a method for cooling a motor in a blower housing assembly for furnaces according to one embodiment of the invention is shown. A motor cover or housing  is configured to encompass a motor  which comprises a shaft , rotor  and stator . Motor cover  has portions that define a shaft bushing  and mechanical fastener bores  for securing motor  to motor cover . Motor cover  has flanges  each of which has portions defining a fastener bore  for securing motor cover  to an impeller housing  which is configured to encompass an impeller  which is attached to shaft . Impeller  is situated in impeller housing  such that impeller  can freely rotate within said impeller housing .","Motor cover  has at least one hole or aperture  located anywhere on motor cover  for drawing in air to cool the bearings (not shown) of the motor  in the motor cover . In an alternate embodiment, vent aperture  can be formed as a plurality of vent slots in other shapes (not shown) or as a combination of apertures.","Impeller  has a plurality of fins  which provide surfaces for directing incoming air from motor chamber  or exhaust gases from an attached furnace. The incoming air from the motor  flows through an inlet port  between the motor housing  and the impeller housing . The air then flows through at least one any size hole or aperture  located on the back plate  of the impeller  from the motor case  by rotation of the impeller .","The method of venting the air in furnaces according to the foregoing description results in a blower design that eliminates the need for an auxiliary fan (not shown) attached to shaft . In this method there is at least one hole or aperture  situated anywhere in a motor case or housing  that allows for air to enter the housing  to cool the bearings (not shown) of the motor  and the motor  itself in the motor case . The warm air flows across and around the motor  in the direction of the impeller housing  and through an inlet port  in the impeller housing . The air then flows through at least one any size hole or aperture  located on the back plate  of the impeller  from the motor case  by rotation of the impeller . The exhaust air from the furnace is drawn in through an exhaust gas inlet  by the impeller  and is directed out of the outlet pipe  connected to the impeller housing .","Elimination of an auxiliary fan allows for the reduction in the overall height for the blower housing. This, in turn, allows for a similar reduction in height of a furnace. Coupled with this beneficial effect is the elimination of some of the noise that is inevitably produced by the blower via fan operation. Also maximized is the elimination of the heat source near the furnace electronics that are at least partially contained in the furnace vestibule.","It is further possible to eliminate much of the heat that is generated in the vestibule of a furnace. Temperatures which typically reach 150\u00b0 F. an be reduced to 90\u00b0 F. by using the novel venting method. The blower can be sealed off to the furnace for fresh air intake. Optionally, the blower can be sealed off to the furnace door to allow for the total sealing of the inducer compartment to maximize blower efficiency. Such a configuration maximizes the drawing of motor heat into the impeller chamber and out the outlet pipe  which is in fluid communication with the impeller housing . Also maximized is the elimination of the heat source near the furnace electronics which are at least partially contained in the vestibule.","Numerous alternatives and embodiments exist for the invention such as modifications of the motor housing geometric configuration, integral versus modular motor cover and impeller housing, single large vent aperture versus a plurality of vent slots in the motor cover.","It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular constructions herein disclosed and\/or shown in the drawings, but also comprises any modifications or equivalents within the scope of the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":"10"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
