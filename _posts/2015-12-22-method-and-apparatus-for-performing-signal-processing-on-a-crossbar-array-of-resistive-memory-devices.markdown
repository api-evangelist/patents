In recent years, neuromorphic hardware systems have gained great attentions. Such systems can potentially provide the capabilities of biological perception and information processing within a compact and energy-efficient platform. Systems such as these can be used in different computing platforms for high performance computing under size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints. Potential Air Force applications, for example, include autonomy and autonomous systems, communication and networking, intelligence data analytics and cyber situational awareness.","To this end, a resistive crossbar array based computing system has the potential to enable high-efficient, large-scale signal processing. Such systems, for example, can dramatically improve the capabilities in pattern recognition used in modern artificial intelligence systems. In such systems, a crossbar array of resistive memory devices is used to carry out signal processing computations.","The present invention relates generally to methods and apparatuses for sensing the current that represents the computation results from a resistive memory device (i.e., \u201cmemristor\u201d) crossbar array and converting it to a digital word using low-power circuit with small form factor.","It is an object of the present invention to design an apparatus and method that transforms an input digital word into a distinct output digital word as a function of the current and voltage the input digital word generates across an array of resistive memory devices.","In an embodiment of the present invention, an apparatus for a resistive memory array signal processor, comprises a first converter for converting a real number vector input into a temporal sequence of voltage waveform outputs; at least one resistive memory array, having the sequence of voltage waveforms as inputs, for converting the sequence of voltage waveforms into current waveform outputs; an integrator for accumulating the current waveform outputs; a second converter, having the accumulated current waveforms as inputs, for converting the accumulated current waveforms into voltage waveform outputs; and a third converter, having the voltage waveforms as inputs, for converting the voltage waveforms into a real number output.","In another embodiment of the present invention, a method for performing signal processing using a crossbar array of resistive memory devices, comprises the steps of a first mapping of a real number input to a voltage waveform; applying the voltage waveform to a plurality of wordline inputs of the crossbar array of resistive memory devices; accumulating current waveforms through each of a plurality of bitline outputs of the crossbar array of resistive memory devices; integrating the accumulated current waveforms: converting the integrated current waveforms to voltage waveforms; and a second mapping of the voltage waveforms to a real number output.","Briefly stated, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for performing signal processing on a crossbar array of resistive memory devices. The invention is implemented using one or multiple crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices in conjunction with devices for converting input real number representations to voltage waveforms, devices for converting current waveforms into voltage waveforms, and devices for converting voltage waveforms to real numbers outputs.","The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate the same elements.","The present invention provides an apparatus and method for performing signal processing on a crossbar array of resistive memory devices, using pulse-based representations of input and output values. The invention is implemented using one or multiple crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices in conjunction with devices for converting real number representations to voltage waveforms, devices for converting current waveforms into voltage waveforms, and devices for converting voltage waveforms to real numbers, all of which may be implemented in electronic hardware or electronic hardware augmented by firmware or computer software.","Relying on a one-to-one mapping between a mathematical value and a pulse-based voltage waveform, each individual input value can be represented by a temporal sequence of voltage pulses applied to a wordline (row) of the crossbar array. The resistive crossbar design converts the input voltage pulse waveforms into output current waveforms at the bitlines (column) of the crossbar array. An integrator block is used to convert the output current waveform to a total accumulated current value. The accumulated current of each output of the crossbar is then converted back into pulse-based voltage waveform, using the reverse of the same (with a different scale factor) one-to-one mapping function for the input conversion.","This describes the apparatus and method for performing signal processing using pulse-based representations of the inputs and outputs, through a crossbar array of resistive memory devices.","The basic circuit of the invention's crossbar array with N rows and M columns of resistive memory devices  is shown in the . For each pair of wordline (WL)  and bitline (BL) , there is one resistive memory device  (memristor) connecting them. This embodiment of the present invention assumes that the conductance of the resistive memory device connecting WLand BLis set at g.","When voltage waveforms vi(t) (j=1, 2, . . . , N) are applied to the wordlines  (inputs), also assuming that the bitlines  are all held at 0 Volt, the current waveforms io(t) at the end (bottom) of each of the bitlines  can be calculated by:\n\n()=\u03a3(()\u00b7), 1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nThe integration of the current waveforms and the output current waveforms over a period of time T, resulting from all the bitlines, is represented by:\n\n\u222b()(\u00b7\u222b()), 1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(2)\n","Referring to  depicts alternative implementations of the crossbar array shown in . Within the scope of the present invention, the resistive memory device  \u201c1R\u201d structure (shown in ) can be replaced with either the \u201c1S1R\u201d structure of serially connected one resistive memory \u201c1R\u201d device  and one \u201c1S\u201d device (shown in ), or the \u201c1T1R\u201d structure connected one resistive memory \u201c1R\u201d device  and one transistor \u201c1T\u201d device  (shown in ).","Referring to , the present invention based on the design of the crossbar array of resistive memory devices is now functionally depicted. The input to the system is a vector [a, a, a] where a(j=1, 2, . . . , N) is a real number. A one-to-one conversion (mapping) function  converts the input real numbers into pulse-base voltage waveforms in the time period of [0, T]. The conversion (mapping) process can be written as:\n\n()(),0,1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(3)\n","Where vi(t) is a pulse-based voltage waveform, which means that vi(t) can only be one of the two predefined voltage levels: Vand V. An example of the pulse-based voltage waveform in time period [0, T] is shown in . When these voltage waveforms are applied  to the wordlines  of the crossbar array (see ), current waveforms are generated at the end of the bitlines  (see ), according to Equation (1). A conversion module\/function (CF) is then used to convert  each current waveform into pulse-based voltage waveform:\n\n()=CF(()), 0,1,2, . . . , \u2003\u2003(4)\n\nNote that with more than one input voltage waveforms applied, the output current may not follow a pulse-based waveform. Finally the invention applies another one-to-one conversion (mapping) function that converts  output pulse-base voltage waveforms (in the time period of [0, T]) into real numbers. The conversion (mapping) process  can be written as:\n\n(()), 0,1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(5)\n","Please also note that the first and last conversion\/mapping steps can be omitted if the system is already using pulse-based representations.","For the embodiment of the present invention described in the previous section, there can be many choices of the conversion\/mapping functions M, Mand CF. Specific implementations of the conversion\/mapping functions are possible.","If the input voltage waveforms of (t) are restricted to periodical pulse functions with fixed pulse width of T, function Mcan be implemented by mapping the real number ato a unique frequency value of the pulse waveform such that:\n\n=\u03b1\u222b()1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(6)\n","where \u03b1 is a positive constant scalar number.","For converting function CF from io(t) to vo(t), the accumulated total current by integrating io(t) over time period [0, T] can be first calculated according to:\n\n=\u222b()1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(7)\n","Again, restricting the waveforms of (t) to periodical pulse functions with fixed pulse width of T, the invention maps the accumulated total current to a unique frequency value of the vo(t) pulse waveform such that:\n\n\u03b2\u00b7\u222b()1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(8)\n","where \u03b2 is a positive constant scalar number.","After obtaining the vo(t) waveforms, the mapping function Mis implemented by mapping the frequency value of vo(t) to the real number bi such that:\n\n=\u03b3\u00b7\u222b()1,2, . . . ,\u2003\u2003(9)\n","where \u03b3 is a constant scalar number.","If Equations 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are combined, the complete process performed by the present invention from inputs a(1=1, 2, . . . , N) to outputs b(i=1, 2, . . . , M) can be captured as:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["b","i"]},"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mi":"\u03b3","mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","mi":"T"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["o","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u03b2"]},"mo":"\u00b7","msubsup":{"mi":["I","i","total"]}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u03b2"]},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","mi":"T"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"i","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["o","i"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":["\u03b3","\u03b2"]},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mn":"0","mi":"T"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"v","mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":["i","j"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"t"}]}}}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mi":"\u03b3","mrow":{"mi":["\u03b1","\u03b2"],"mo":"\u00b7"}},"mo":"\u00b7","mrow":{"munderover":{"mo":"\u2211","mrow":{"mi":"j","mo":"=","mn":"1"},"mi":"N"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"g","mrow":{"mi":["i","j"],"mo":","}},{"mi":["a","j"]}],"mo":"\u00b7"}}}}},{"mi":"i","mo":"=","mn":"1"}],"mo":[",",",",",","\u2062",","],"mn":"2","mi":["\u2026","M"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"10"}}]}}}}}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
