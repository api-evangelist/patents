Quantitative data about the analytes is often obtained by detecting changes in the fluorescence emission of select probe molecules that bind them, which can result from photoinduced electron transfer (PET) or intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The fluorophores that are often used for these analyses are BODIPY, coumarin, naphthalimide, and fluorescein. Although these fluorophores theoretically can be modified to display either a ratiometric dual-emission response through ICT, or a change in fluorescence intensity through PET, modifying the structure of these compounds to selectively control the excited-state photophyscial properties of these compounds typically requires multi-step synthetic operations that result in low yields.","For fluorescent probes to operate successfully and universally in a biological system, the probe must exhibit water solubility, insensitivity to local polarity, and minimal interference from background emission. These requirements are difficult to achieve.","In one aspect, the invention features a fluorophore that includes a compound that includes an imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium ion core and having the formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0006"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"22.52mm","wi":"56.39mm","file":"US09371448-20160621-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}}},"wherein Ris alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, glycoalkyl, haloalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, or cycloalkyl, and when Ris aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, or cycloalkyl, Roptionally is substituted with at least one R,","Ris H, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, carbonyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, ether, thioether, halogen, haloalkyl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl, and when Ris aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl or cycloalkyl, Roptionally is substituted with at least one R,","Ris",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0010"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00003","num":"00003"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00003","he":"25.99mm","wi":"15.07mm","file":"US09371448-20160621-C00003.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["3 ","3 ","4"]},"each Ris independently H, alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkenoxy, alkynyl, alkynoxy, amide, amidino, amino, aryl, arylalkyl, azido, azo, carbamate, carbamide, carbonyl, carboxamido, carboxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkoxy, cyano, ether, thioether, halogen, haloalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, hydrazine, imino, nitro, phosphate, sulfate, sulfonamide, sulfonyl, sulfide, or thiocarbonyl,","each Ris independently H, aryl, heteroaryl, ether, thioether, alkyl, alkenyl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, haloalkyl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl, and when Ris alkenyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl or cycloalkyl, Roptionally is substituted with at least one R,","X is a counter ion, and n is an integer from 1 to 4, the compound including at least one substituent that includes a heteroatom that includes at least one pair of electrons conjugated to the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium ion core, an aryl that includes a substituent that includes at least one pair of electrons conjugated to the aryl,",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0014"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00004","num":"00004"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00004","he":"25.99mm","wi":"15.07mm","file":"US09371448-20160621-C00004.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","2 ","3 "]},"In one embodiment, Ris Calkyl, phenylCalkyl, phenylCalkoxy, or phenylCdialkylamine, Ris H, Calkyl, phenylCalkyl, phenylCalkoxy, or phenylCdialkylamine, and Ris H, Calkyl, phenylCalkyl, phenylCalkoxy, or phenylCdialkylamine.

The compounds include an imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium ion core and at least one substituent attached to the core. The compounds can exhibit a change in their fluorescence emission properties due to a change in the deexcitation pathway (i.e., the mechanism by which the fluorescence emission is modulated). The change in the deexcitation pathway of the compounds can be modulated by photoinduced electron transfer (PET) or intramolecular charge transfer (ICT).

This effect can be reversed upon alteration of the environment to one that mimics its initial state.","The presence and mechanism of fluorescence emission can depend upon the substituents on the compound, the nature of a binding event with an analyte, the environment in which the compound is located, and combinations thereof.

A change in a fluorescence property exhibited by a compound can manifest itself as a change in emission intensity, a change in the emission wavelength, and combinations thereof.","The substituents also can be selected to achieve compounds that function in a variety of modes including, e.g., in a \u201cturn-on\u201d mode in which detectable fluorescence emission occurs as the environment changes or a binding event occurs, in a \u201cturn-off\u201d mode in which a detectable fluorescence emission ceases to occur as the environment changes or a binding event occurs, in a ratiometric response mode in which there are detectable changes in the relative intensity of fluorescence emissions at at least two different wavelengths, and combinations thereof.

The hydrophobicity sensor can additionally exhibit the cation sensor fluorescence responses set forth above with respect to cation sensors.","The mode in which the sensor functions depends upon the substituents on the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium ion core, the environment in which the sensor is located, the cations present in the environment, and combinations thereof. The substituents on the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium ion core can be selected to achieve a hydrophobicity sensor that functions as a turn-on hydrophobicity sensor, a ratiometric response cation sensor, and combinations thereof. The hydrophobicity sensor can function as a turn-on sensor, for example, in aqueous environments (e.g., water and water-based solvents), as a ratiometric response sensor in a nonpolar environment (e.g., an organic solvent), and combinations thereof. Alternatively, the hydrophobicity sensor can function as both a turn-on sensor and a ratiometric sensor in nonpolar environments. For some hydrophobicity sensors, the turn-on fluorescence emission is modulated by PET or ICT and the ratiometric response is modulated by a combination of ICT and PET.","One useful class of hydrophobicity sensors has a chemical structure according to the following formula",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0155","num":"0153"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00018","num":"00018"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00018","he":"39.54mm","wi":"53.34mm","file":"US09371448-20160621-C00018.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"sub":["1 ","1-4 ","1-4 ","1-4 ","1-4","2 ","5 ","1-4 ","1-4 ","1-4 ","1-4","1 ","1-4 ","2 ","5 ","1-4 ","1-4 "]},"One example of a useful hydrophobicity sensor that exhibits turn-on hydrophobicity sensing and ratiometric cation sensing includes compounds of formula (III) in which Ris phenyldialkylamine (e.g., phenyldimethylamine and phenyldiethylamine), Ris H, and Ris phenylalkyl.","One example of a useful method of using the hydrophobicity sensor includes contacting a system with the hydrophobicity sensor and detecting a change in the fluorescence emission of the system.
