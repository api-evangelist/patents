{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE","SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE","Notation and Nomenclature","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers in information handling systems. More particularly, the present disclosure describes an apparatus, system, and method useful for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers implemented in a core power domain.","The power supply to a core power domain is switched off to reduce power leakage in standby mode. However, switching off the power supply to the core power domain causes loss of information from the pad configuration registers that are implemented in the core power domain. The pad configuration registers may need to be restored when the power supply to the core power domain is switched back on. No external memory is accessible until the pad configuration registers are restored, for example. Furthermore, only a limited number of inputs and\/or outputs are allowed at the boundary between the core power domain and an always-on power domain to avoid routing congestion.","Conventional D flip-flop implementations can have power leakage from the chip as high as 5.6 \u03bcW. Moreover, conventional D flip-flop implementations can occupy a chip area as large as 0.05 mm. Conventional placement of the pad configuration registers in the always-on power domain leads to undesirable place and route congestion. Conventionally, software interactions are needed to restore the pad configuration registers.","According to various illustrative embodiments, an apparatus, system, and method for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers implemented in a core power domain are described. In one aspect, the apparatus comprises a hardware save and restore logic component implemented in the core power domain and coupled to the pad configuration registers. The apparatus also comprises a memory instantiated in an always-on power domain and coupled to the hardware save and restore logic component, the hardware save and restore logic component implemented in the core power domain to automatically save the pad configuration registers in the memory in a pad configuration save process before a power supply to the core power domain is switched off and to automatically restore the pad configuration registers from the memory in a pad configuration restore process after the power supply to the core power domain is switched on.","In another aspect, a method for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers implemented in a core power domain comprises automatically saving the pad configuration registers in a memory instantiated in an always-on power domain and coupled to a hardware save and restore logic component implemented in the core power domain and coupled to the pad configuration registers, automatically saving the pad configuration registers before a power supply to the core power domain is switched off. The method also comprises automatically restoring the pad configuration registers from the memory after the power supply to the core power domain is switched on.","In yet another aspect, a system for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers implemented in a control module in a core power domain is provided, the system comprising a hardware save and restore logic component implemented in the control module in the core power domain and coupled to the pad configuration registers. The system also comprises a power manager instantiated in an always-on power domain and coupled to the hardware save and restore logic component. The system also comprises a memory instantiated in a wakeup control module in the always-on power domain and coupled to the hardware save and restore logic component, the hardware save and restore logic component implemented in the control module in the core power domain to automatically save the pad configuration registers in the memory in a pad configuration save process before a power supply to the core power domain is switched off and to automatically restore the pad configuration registers from the memory in a pad configuration restore process after the power supply to the core power domain is switched on, wherein the pad configuration restore process is started by the power manager after the power supply to the core power domain is switched on.","It is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of the present claimed subject matter and are, therefore, not to be considered limiting of the scope of the present claimed subject matter, as the present claimed subject matter may admit to other equally effective embodiments.","Certain terms are used throughout the following description and claims to refer to particular system components and configurations. As one skilled in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate, companies may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function. In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201ccomprising\u201d are used in an open-ended fashion, and, thus, should be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding, but not limited to . . . ,\u201d and so forth. Also, the term \u201ccouple\u201d or \u201ccouples\u201d is intended to mean either an indirect or direct electrical connection. Thus, if a first device couples to a second device, that connection may be through a direct electrical connection or though an indirect electrical connection via other devices and\/or connections. Furthermore, the term \u201cinformation\u201d is intended to refer to any data, instructions, or control sequences that may be communicated between components of a device. For example, if information is sent between two components, data, instructions, control sequences, or any combination thereof may be sent between the two components.","Illustrative embodiments of the present claimed subject matter are described in detail below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the present disclosure.","In various illustrative embodiments, as shown in , for example, an apparatus  for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers  implemented in a core power domain  may comprise a hardware save and restore logic component  implemented in the core power domain  and coupled  to the pad configuration registers . The apparatus  may also comprise a memory  instantiated in an always-on power domain  and coupled  to the hardware save and restore logic component . In various illustrative embodiments, the memory  may be a static random access memory (SRAM) implemented in the always-on power domain . The hardware save and restore logic component  may be implemented in the core power domain  to automatically save the pad configuration registers  in the memory  in a pad configuration save process before a power supply to the core power domain  is switched off. The hardware save and restore logic component  may also be implemented in the core power domain  to automatically restore the pad configuration registers  from the memory  in a pad configuration restore process after the power supply to the core power domain  is switched on.","In various illustrative embodiments, the pad configuration save process is started before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off. In various illustrative embodiments, the pad configuration save process is started by software and\/or firmware and\/or an ASIC before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off. In various illustrative embodiments, once the save process is started, switching the core power domain  off may be gated until the save process is complete. As shown in , for example, the pad configuration save process may be started by having a start save signal sent from the pad configuration registers  to the hardware save and restore logic component  before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off. Similarly, as also shown in , for example, the pad configuration save process may be completed by having a save done signal sent from the hardware save and restore logic component  to the pad configuration registers  before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off.","In various illustrative embodiments, as shown in , for example, the apparatus  for automatically saving and restoring pad configuration registers  implemented in a core power domain  may further comprise a power manager  instantiated in the always-on power domain  and coupled  to the hardware save and restore logic component . The pad configuration restore process is started by the power manager  after the power supply to the core power domain  is switched on. As shown in , for example, the pad configuration restore process may be started by the power manger  by having a start restore signal sent from the power manger  to the hardware save and restore logic component  after the power supply to the core power domain  is switched on. Similarly, as also shown in , for example, the pad configuration restore process may be completed by having a restore done signal sent from the hardware save and restore logic component  to the power manger  after the power supply to the core power domain  is switched on.","In various illustrative embodiments, as shown in , for example, the pad configuration registers  are automatically saved in a portion  of the memory  to which one or more other write commands are disabled. For example, once the pad configuration registers  have been automatically saved in the portion  of the memory , any subsequent write commands directed to the portion  of the memory  are not enabled, keeping the pad configuration registers  that have been automatically saved in the portion  of the memory  from being overwritten.","As shown in , the hardware save and restore logic component  and\/or the pad configuration registers  may be coupled , through a bus, for example, to other components of an information handling system (not shown). Similarly, the pad configuration registers  may be coupled  to respective pads (not shown).","In various illustrative embodiments, the apparatus  reduces power leakage from a chip relative to a flip-flop implementation and reduces an area of the chip occupied relative to the flip-flop implementation. For example, as described above, conventional D flip-flop implementations can have power leakage from the chip as high as 5.6 \u03bcW. Moreover, conventional D flip-flop implementations can occupy a chip area as large as 0.05 mm. By way of contrast, in various illustrative embodiments, the power leakage from a chip may be reduced to about 3 \u03bcW and may occupy a chip area of only about 0.03 mm.","As also described above, conventional placement of pad configuration registers in an always-on power domain leads to undesirable place and route congestion. By way of contrast, in various illustrative embodiments, the apparatus  reduces place and route congestion relative to an implementation having the pad configuration registers  instantiated in the always-on power domain .","Moreover, as also described above, conventionally, software interactions are needed to restore the pad configuration registers. By way of contrast, in various illustrative embodiments, the hardware save and restore logic component  permits much higher performance by not requiring any software interaction to automatically restore the pad configuration registers . The hardware save and restore logic component  may be implemented in the core power domain  to automatically save the pad configuration registers  in the memory  in the pad configuration save process before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off. The hardware save and restore logic component  may also be implemented in the core power domain  to automatically restore the pad configuration registers  from the memory  in the pad configuration restore process after the power supply to the core power domain  is switched on.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","110","220","120","200","130","220","120","235","235","110","200","160","150","265","265","130","200","140","240","150","245","130","130","220","120","110","140","120","130","220","120","110","140","120","160","120","110","250","140"],"i":["a","b ","a","b "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","130","100","200","130","310","110","140","150","120","130","310","120"]},"Upon receiving a start save signal from the pad configuration registers , the hardware save and restore logic component  may transition to a state  of saving the pad configuration registers  in the memory  before the power supply to the core power domain  is switched off.
