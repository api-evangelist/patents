title: Modular towable platform
abstract: A towable buoyant platform of modular floating segments is provided to serve as a floating target. The platform connects at least one pontoon thereto. The pontoon includes a keel that connects to the hull and a plurality of buoyant modules. The keel extends longitudinally along the platform. Each module has an interface that connects to the keel. Each module also includes first and second longitudinal ends. The first and second ends have a tongue and a groove, respectively. The tongue and groove are slideably connectable to each other, such that fore and aft modules of the plurality attach together.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy, and thus, the invention herein may be manufactured, used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","The invention relates generally to a modular towable platform. In particular, the invention relates to pontoon components for assembling the towable platform.","Naval target testing and practice involves disposing a floating object that serves as a target within a navigatable body of water that serves as a firing range. The target can become the recipient of incoming projectiles in order to evaluate targeting equipment and\/or augment marksmanship skills. One typical target configuration includes a pontoon boat hull composed of aluminum.","Conventional towable platforms yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular, conventional platforms lack convenient ability to repair and\/or sectional replacement of buoyant components that experience damage from kinetic or explosive strikes as a target.","Various exemplary embodiments a modular buoyant platform to serve as a floating target. The platform connects at least one pontoon thereto. The pontoon includes a keel that connects to the hull and a plurality of buoyant modules. The keel extends longitudinally along the platform. Each module has an interface that connects to the keel.","In various exemplary embodiments, each module also includes first and second longitudinal ends. The first end has a tongue, and the second end has a groove. The tongue and groove are slideably connectable to each other, such that fore and aft modules of the plurality attach together.","In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized, and logical, mechanical, and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.","Conventional aluminum pontoon floatation hulls have been use as targets at Potomac River Test Range for approximately six-to-eight years. During tests in which projectiles strike the hull, portions thereof can be damaged. Such damage can be difficult and expensive to repair. An alternative design (plywood on styrofoam blocks) was considered as a less costly (and disposable substitute) but has been determined to exhibit undesirable characteristics, such as releasing large numbers of small fragments into the local region when struck by a projectile, and thus are not used.","An alternative product from Wilson Distribution of Kenton, Ohio described in U.S. Design Pat. No. D520,935 enables multiple sections to be joined by hinging but does not permit individual replacement when a section is damaged without dismantling the structure from one end.","By contrast, various exemplary embodiments provide a modular towable platform that can serve as a floating target. This platform comprises a frame strut keel on which attach floatable sections that can be removed and retrofitted as necessary.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A through 1E","b":"100"},"In , the assembly includes an upper spar or keel  that extends longitudinally along the hull length of the floating platform. A plurality (in this example, five) of interchangeable floatation sections or modules  are suspended from the keel  to provide buoyancy along the length of the platform. A bow (and\/or alternatively stern) module  may optionally be included to reduce drag. These interchangeable modules  concatenate to each other by connection interfaces, as well as each module  and  to the keel . The attachment mechanisms for the modules  to the keel  and to each other can be by bolts or other releasable fastening devices, as will be understood by artisans of ordinary skill.","After exposure to attack as a target, at least one exemplary module may become damaged so as to require replacement. In , the third of five modules  indicates physical damage. In , that damaged module  is removed from the keel , leaving a gap  in the platform.","Each module  can be designed to maintain buoyancy despite damage, but may require intermittence replacement due to structural demands on the platform. In , a replacement module  inserts into the gap . In , the replacement module  has been connected to the keel  and the adjacent modules , producing a complete and restored platform. Thus,  illustrate how a damaged module  can be replaced by a replacement module  as desired while enabling undamaged sections of interchangeable modules  to remain in place.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":["FIGS. 2A","FIG. 2A","FIGS. 2B and 2C"],"b":["2","2","200","120","210","110","210","120","220","200","120","210","220"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B","b":["220","220"]},"At the aft end, the female receptacle or groove  includes radially expanding edges  (to inhibit longitudinal separation) and a facing surface . At the fore end, the male receptacle or tongue  includes radially expanding surface  and a facing surface . A through-cavity  penetrates both groove  and tongue  across the entire lateral length of the module  to enable insertion of a lock rod that binds one module  to another module  such as to avoid rotation or slippage.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2C","b":["220","250","290"]},"Connection between tandem modules can be accomplished via the recepticles. For example, front and rear modules  can be connected together by sliding the tongue  of the rear module into the groove  of the front module such that the respective outward edges  and  are proximate (in near contact) until the respective surfaces  and  face each other. A similar arrangement of intersliding faces can also be used with an end module  and a bow (or stern) module .","While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein, many modifications, substitutions, changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art.
