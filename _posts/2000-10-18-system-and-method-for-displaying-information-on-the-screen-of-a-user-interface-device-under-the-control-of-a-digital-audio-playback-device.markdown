{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60\/176,563 entitled \u201cA Method for Display and use of Manufacturer-Specific Information on user Interface Screen connected to a Digital Playback Device\u201d filed Jan. 18, 2000.","The present invention is directed, in general, to digital audio playback devices and, more specifically, to a digital audio playback device (DAPD) that is capable of displaying on the screen of a user interface device connected to the digital audio playback device.","Digital audio playback devices (DAPD) are among the most popular consumer products created by the digital revolution. The term digital audio playback devices generally is applied to any device that stores and plays back audio files in a purely electronic format. The purely electronic format eliminates the need for mechanical parts that are comparatively expensive and easy to break. Typically, a digital audio playback device contains a large non-volatile memory, such as a flash random access memory (RAM), that stores, for example, 64 megabytes (MB) of audio files. One of the most popular types of digital audio playback devices on the market is the MP3 player. A user can download about an hour of MP3 music files to an MP3 player from another device, such as a personal computer (PC).","Users of digital audio playback devices interact and control the digital audio playback device with the help of a user interface (UI). The user interface of a digital audio playback device may be provided directly on the digital audio playback device (for example, a conventional CD player with buttons and an LCD display on the front panel of the player) or on another device, such as a PC, directly connected to the digital audio playback device. Frequently, a digital audio playback device may have a built-in UI and also may use a UI on an attached device (like a PC) for added convenience and features. For example, the RUSH\u2122 MP3 player from Philips Electronics includes an LCD-based UI on the device and also operates via a UI software application on a connected personal computer. As digital audio playback devices become smaller and smaller, there is less room for control buttons and video displays on the exterior of the digital audio playback device. A pocket-sized digital audio playback device may have only three or four control buttons and a tiny LCD for displaying alphanumeric data. Hence, digital audio playback devices controlled by a user interface on a connected device are becoming increasingly common. It is common to refer to a UI built directly on the portable audio device as an \u201con-board UI.\u201d It also is common to refer to a UI on a connected device as a \u201cconnected UI.\u201d","An exemplary connected user interface (UI) on a connected PC may comprise a display that has the appearance of some type of conventional music playing device, such as a CD player. For example, the user interface may contain a Skip Forward button, a Skip Back button, a Pause button, a Stop button, and the like. The user presses these buttons using the mouse attached to the connected PC. The user interacts with the digital audio playback device while the digital audio playback device is connected to the PC, usually through some type of cradle device. While connected, the user can erase audio files currently in the digital audio playback device and can download new audio files to the digital audio playback device. When the user is finished configuring audio files on the digital audio playback device, the user can remove the digital audio playback device from its cradle and carry it around with him.","Digital audio playback devices and connected user interfaces for those devices are often developed and distributed by different parties. Typically, the connected user interface executed by the PC may control a digital audio playback device via some software libraries made available by the manufacturer of the digital audio playback device and resident on the connected device. In many cases, a digital audio playback device user can download the user interface software libraries from the Internet. These libraries typically consist of the device drivers needed to communicate with and control the digital audio playback device over the PC connection.","These libraries also contain implementations of application programming interfaces (APIs) that are supported by the digital audio playback device. An API is the interface through which a software program accesses lower level software functions, such as an operating system. The application programming interfaces for digital audio playback devices are often agreed to by several manufacturers of digital audio playback devices. As a result, a consumer may select one of several available user interface applications to operate the consumer's digital audio playback device.","A typical user interface application typically operates any of several digital audio playback devices in the market. Using application programming interfaces, developers and sellers of connected user interface application software can establish a relationship with consumers via the \u201clook and feel\u201d and the ease of use of their proprietary user interfaces. Further, connected user interface makers are also able to uniquely brand their user interface software and provide remote access capability for the consumer to visit the user interface maker's web site(s) of choice.","However, independent developers and sellers of connected user interface software are often reluctant to develop a customized user interface for each manufacturer of digital audio playback devices. This reluctance is partly due to the high development cost to customize user interface software for each manufacturer. The reluctance also is due to a strategy of connected user interface developers and sellers to attract consumers to a web site of the user interface maker's choice.","As noted above, user interface makers can use application programming interfaces to have their user interface software connect to and control any of several digital audio playback devices. Digital audio playback device makers would also like to have the ability to control the user interface software from their digital audio playback device (or associated drivers) and have a manufacturer-specific logo displayed on the user interface or allow the user to connect to a web site selected by the manufacturer of the digital audio playback device.","Therefore, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that provide an interface that digital audio playback device manufacturers may use to control the user interface software operating on a connected processing system, such as a personal computer. In particular, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that provide an interface that may be used by the digital audio playback device manufacturer to direct the consumer to a web site recommended by or operated by the digital audio playback device manufacturer.","To address the above-discussed deficiencies of the prior art, it is a primary object of an advantageous embodiment of the present invention to provide a digital audio playback device (DAPD) comprising: 1) an external interface capable of being coupled to a connected processing system, the connected processing system capable of executing a user interface application program that accesses and controls the digital audio playback device via the external interface; 2) a memory coupled to the external interface capable of storing a reverse DAPD application programming interface (API); and 3) a processor coupled to the memory and the external interface and capable of executing the reverse DAPD API, the reverse DAPD API capable of causing the processor to access and control a user interface associated with the user interface application program and displayed on a monitor screen associated with the connected processing system.","According to one embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API comprises executable instructions capable of communicating with and controlling an operation of the user interface application program.","According to another embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API comprises first data associated with a manufacturer of the digital audio playback device.","According to still another embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API is capable of causing the processor to access and control at least a portion of the user interface to display the first data in the at least a portion of the user interface displayed on the monitor screen.","According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the first data comprises a graphics file comprising a logo image associated with the manufacturer.","According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the first data comprises a Universal Resource Locator (URL) associated with an Internet web site associated with the manufacturer.","A reverse DAPD application programming interface according to the principles of the present invention may also be implemented in a processing system, such as a personal computer, connected to the digital audio playback device (DAPD), rather than in the DAPD itself. Accordingly, it is a primary object of an advantageous embodiment of the present invention to provide a processing system comprising: 1) an external interface capable of being coupled to a connected digital audio playback device, the connected digital audio playback device capable of playing audio files stored in the digital audio playback device; 2) a memory coupled to the external interface capable of storing a user interface application program that accesses and controls the digital audio playback device via the external interface and capable of storing a reverse DAPD application programming interface (API); and 3) a processor coupled to the memory and the external interface and capable of executing the user interface application program and the reverse DAPD API, the reverse DAPD API capable of communicating with the digital audio playback device and enabling the digital audio playback device to access and control a user interface associated with the user interface application program and displayed on a monitor screen associated with the processing system.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API in the processing system comprises executable instructions capable of communicating with and controlling an operation of the user interface application program.","In another embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API in the processing system comprises first data associated with a manufacturer of the digital audio playback device.","In still another embodiment of the present invention, the reverse DAPD API in the processing system is capable of enabling the digital audio playback device to access and control at least a portion of the user interface to display the first data in the at least a portion of the user interface displayed on the monitor screen.","In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the first data in the processing system comprises a graphics file comprising a logo image associated with the manufacturer.","In a further embodiment of the present invention, the first data in the processing system comprises a Universal Resource Locator (URL) associated with an Internet web site associated with the manufacturer.","The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention so that those skilled in the art may better understand the detailed description of the invention that follows. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter that form the subject of the claims of the invention. Those skilled in the art should appreciate that they may readily use the conception and the specific embodiment disclosed as a basis for modifying or designing other structures for carrying out the same purposes of the present invention.

Display  is a small device, such as an LED or LCD, capable of displaying a relatively small number of alphanumeric characters and icons. Control buttons  perform operations typical of conventional audio devices, such as CD players. These operations include Skip Forward, Skip Back, Pause, Stop, Play, and the like. Control buttons  also allow a user to scroll through selectable audio files (such as MP3 files) stored in DAPD . The titles of the audio files may appear in display .","In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a user may interact with DAPD  through a user interface application program executed by PC . The user interface is displayed on screen  of monitor . The user enters commands on the keyboard and\/or mouse associated with PC  to perform various tasks, including for example, browsing and downloading MP3 files on the Internet, viewing a directory of MP3 files stored in DAPD , viewing a directory of MP3 files stored in PC , deleting selected MP3 files from DAPD , transferring MP3 files from PC  to DAPD , and the like. In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the user interface application program uses a plurality of conventional application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with digital audio playback devices made by different manufacturers. Additionally, each of the different digital audio playback devices may use one or more of a plurality of reverse DAPD application programming interfaces (APIs) according to the principles of the present invention to interact with the user interface.","In one embodiment of the present invention, the user interface application executed by PC  and an implementation of the reverse DAPD application programming interfaces may be stored on the hard disk drive of PC . Furthermore, a user interface application and reverse DAPD application programming interfaces according to the principles of the present invention may be stored as computer-readable data files and computer-executable instruction codes on removable storage medium , which may be, for example, a 3.5 inch floppy diskette, a CD ROM, a DVD, or a similar storage medium. Additionally, in an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a user interface application and reverse DAPD application programming interfaces according to the principles of the present invention may be downloaded from removable storage medium  to DAPD  via PC .","Digital audio playback devices are available in the market with software libraries that contain hardware drivers, implementations of APIs that may be used to control the digital audio playback device, encryption and decryption software and keys, and other such software or data. These libraries are installed on PC  where the user interface application program executes, either by the maker of PC  or by the user. The installed libraries allow the user interface application program to interact with, pass data to, and generally control the digital audio playback device using an implementation of an API supported by the digital audio playback device and implemented in the library on PC .","Similarly, a reverse DAPD API is used by a digital audio playback device to request that the user interface application program display some information on screen , such as the logo of the DAPD manufacturer, or allow the user to access a DAPD-specific web site, or the like. As shown in  below, reverse DAPD APIs according to the principles of the present invention may be implemented in the libraries installed on PC  or in the libraries in DAPD , or a combination of both.","In one embodiment, the reverse DAPD API is implemented in the libraries installed on PC . In such an embodiment, the reverse DAPD API may be in the form of DAPD-specific data (e.g., URLs of web sites recommended by the digital audio playback device manufacturer, bitmaps or graphics for the logo of the DAPD manufacturer, and the like) and some executable code that provides the DAPD-specific information to the user interface application program in a manner useful for display. Upon startup, the user interface application program uses the reverse DAPD APIs in the installed libraries to obtain the DAPD-specific data and uses the accompanying executable code to display DAPD-specific information in an agreed-upon portion of the user interface screen. If the user interacts with the DAPD-specific graphic or information on the screen, the user interface application program uses the executable code in the libraries to allow the user to visit a DAPD-specific web site or performs other tasks as defined by the reverse DAPD API specification.","An alternative method to achieve the same results is to provide the DAPD-specific data and executable code in DAPD  and to use the reverse DAPD API to allow the digital audio playback device to request from the user interface application program certain tasks as defined in the reverse DAPD API. In this method, the drivers installed on PC  implement a communication protocol to allow DAPD  to communicate with the user interface application program, to make requests for display of graphics, and to fulfill the user interface application program requests for URL information and the like.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["260","105","105","205","210","215","220","225","230","205","210","215","220","225","230","235","230","240","250","260","266","260","262","264"]},"During normal operation of PC , data processor  executes O\/S program  and, optionally, one or more applications selected by the user. If the user decides to download audio files, such as MP3 files, to DAPD  or to edit audio files already on DAPD , the user launches user interface (UI) application program . In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, UI application program  provides the user with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that may resemble a conventional audio playing device. For example, the user interface associated with UI application program  may resemble a CD player that has a Skip Forward button, a Skip Back button, a Pause button, a Stop button, and the like.","The user may access and control DAPD  through user I\/O IF  by entering commands and data with the keyboard or mouse of PC . UI application program  in turn accesses and controls DAPD  through I\/O IF . In order to control a DAPD from any manufacturer, UI application program  may select one or more DAPD application programming interfaces (APIs) from DAPD API library . Each DAPD API in DAPD API library  is an interface through which a higher level software program, such as UI application program , accesses lower level software functions, such as the drivers in DAPD .","However, according to the principles of the present invention, DAPD  may access and control the user interface provided by UI application program . To accomplish this, data processor  also executes reverse DAPD API  in RAM . DAPD specific data  may comprise, for example, a URL of the web site operated by the manufacturer of DAPD  and a graphics file for the logo of the manufacturer of DAPD . Reverse DAPD API program  comprises, for example, executable code that formats the DAPD-specific information so that it may be displayed by UI application program . A portion of the user interface is reserved for displaying the logo and the web site of the manufacturer.","Alternatively, the reverse DAPD API may be installed in DAPD .  illustrates exemplary reverse digital audio playback device application programming interface  implemented in exemplary DAPD  according to one embodiment of the present invention. DAPD  comprises digital signal processor (DSP) , audio interface (IF) , input\/output (I\/O) interface (IF) , user interface (IF) , and random access memory (RAM) . DSP , audio IF , I\/O IF , user IF , and RAM  are coupled together by, and communicate through, communications bus . RAM  stores audio program , audio (e.g., MP3) files , and reverse digital audio playback device (DAPD) application programming interface (API) . Reverse DAPD API  further comprises reverse DAPD API program  and DAPD specific data .","During normal operation of DAPD , DSP  executes audio program  in order to play one or more of audio files  selected by the user. User commands entered on control buttons  are received from user IF . As noted above, if the user decides to download audio files, such as MP3 files, to DAPD  or to edit audio files already on DAPD , the user launches UI application program  on PC . In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the launching of UI application program  causes DSP  to automatically launch reverse DAPD API . DAPD  uses reverse DAPD API  to access UI application program  in order to control at least a portion of the user interface associated with UI application program .","DAPD specific data  may comprise, for example, a web site URL and a graphics file logo for the manufacturer of DAPD . Reverse DAPD API program  comprises, for example, executable code that formats the DAPD-specific information so that it may be transmitted to UI application program  for subsequent display in the user interface.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","150","250","105","150","405","250","260","150","260","105","150","410","150","250","150","415","150","250","150"]},"Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art should understand that they can make various changes, substitutions and alterations herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["For a more complete understanding of the present invention, and the advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following descriptions taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like numbers designate like objects, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
