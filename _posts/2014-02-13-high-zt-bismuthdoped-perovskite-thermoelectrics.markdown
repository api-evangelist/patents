DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to thermoelectrics and, in particular, to high ZT bismuth-doped perovskite thermoelectrics.","The thermoelectric effect refers to phenomena by which either a temperature difference creates an electric potential or an electric potential creates a temperature difference. Thermoelectric materials show the thermoelectric effect in a strong or convenient form. Thermoelectric performance is defined by a dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT=(\u03c3ST\/\u03ba), where \u03c3 is electrical conductivity (S m), S is the Seebeck coefficient (V K), and \u03ba is thermal conductivity (W mK). Therefore, by going to much higher temperatures, ZT can be substantially increased. The power factor, PF=\u03c3S, can be optimized by modifying the composition and crystallinity of the material. In particular, without a high degree of crystallization, ZT for thermoelectric materials tends to be unacceptably low due to deleterious effects to the power factor. Low-cost materials that have a sufficiently strong thermoelectric effect can be used in many applications, including power generation and refrigeration.","Metal oxide ceramics have recently garnered increased interest as thermoelectric materials for high-temperature energy harvesting applications. In particular, perovskites, including CaTiO, SrTiO, and BaTiOare interesting candidates for thermoelectrics because their electrical and thermal behavior can be tailored with A-site and B-site dopants. Further, the perovskites can accommodate multiple dopant atoms that can be used to reduce phonon heat transport while simultaneously creating defect states below conduction band.","However, a need remains to identify methodologies for reducing thermal conductivity without sacrificing thermopower and electrical conductivity of bulk oxides.","The present invention is directed to a bismuth-doped perovskite thermoelectric, comprising (Bi, La)SrTiO, wherein x is between 0.01 and 0.1, that can have a high thermoelectric figure-of-merit.","A perovskite structure is any material with the same type of crystal structure as calcium titanium oxide (CaTiO). The perovskite structure is adopted by many oxides that have the formula ABO, where \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are two cations of very different sizes, and the oxygen anion bonds to both. The ideal cubic-symmetry structure has the B-site cation in 6-fold coordination, surrounded by an octahedron of oxygen anions, and the A-site cation in 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination. The relative ion size requirements for stability of the cubic structure are quite stringent, so slight buckling and distortion, for example via doping, can produce several lower-symmetry distorted versions, in which the coordination numbers of the A cations, B cations, or both are reduced.","Strontium titanate (SrTiO; STO) is a large band-gap perovskite oxide that can be easily doped at the A and B cationic sites.  shows the cubic perovskite structure for doped SrTiO, with Ti occupying the B-site, Sr occupying the A-site, and divalent dopants (Ca, Ba) and aliovalent dopants (La, Bi) substituted at the A-sites. The large orbital degeneracy of titanium d-band carriers results in large power factors. See Ravichandran et al., 82, 165126 (2010).","This invention is directed to the thermoelectric performance of bismuth-doped perovskites and, more particularly, to (Bi, La)-doped SrTiOwherein the lanthanum dopant is partially substituted with bismuth. La-doped SrTiO(La-STO) is a promising n-type thermoelectric material due to its combination of high thermopower (S\u02dc90 \u03bcV\/K) and electrical conductivity (\u03c3\u02dc1200 S\/cm). Typically, the thermal conductivity of La-STO is \u02dc5-5.5 W\/m-K at room temperature which limits its applicability as a high ZT thermoelectric. According to the present invention, the replacement of small amounts of La with Bi increases the Seebeck coefficient and decreases the thermal conductivity of reduced La-STO. As described below, laboratory scale specimens with nominal compositions of (Bi, La, Sr) TiOand (Bi, La, Sr)TiOwere evaluated for thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. Additional compositions that utilize B-site dopants (Mn, Nb, Ta, W, V, Cr, etc.) for titanium can also be used.","These compositions can be manufactured by many methods including solid state, liquid state, and gaseous phase synthesis. These materials can be made into single crystals, thin films, bulk ceramics, or nano-structures by methods including but not limited to sintering, melt fusion, chemical solution deposition (CSD), reactive sputtering, physical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and pulsed laser deposition. In particular, CSD is a technique that can produce large quantities of nanograined material quickly and inexpensively. See Brennecka et al., 93, 3935 (2010), which is incorporated herein by reference. However, achieving fully dense crystalline films with CSD can be challenging due to remnant organic material inhibiting complete crystallization. See Aygun et al., 109, 034108 (2011). As examples of the invention, bulk ceramics and CSD thin films are described below","Polycrystalline nano-SrTiOthin films were prepared by CSD using 0.15M chelate chemistry with methanol solvent. The films were spin cast and every layer was crystallized at 700\u00b0 C. on 0001-oriented sapphire substrates. The cast films were additionally heat treated for one-half hour in air at high temperature to coarsen the microstructure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 2","sub":"3 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 3","sub":"3 "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","sub":["3 ","3 ","3 ","3"]},"Bulk (Bi, La)-STO thermoelectrics were produced by reacting a homogenous mixture of SrCO, LaO, BiO, and TiOat an elevated temperature (1200\u00b0 C.) under an oxidizing atmosphere. (Bi, La)-doped SrTiOsamples were prepared by milling the metal oxides and carbonates in ethanol and calcining under flowing Oor Ar\/3% H. The calcined powders were then ground and pelletized. The ceramics were sintered and post heat treated under flowing Ar\/3% Hto generate conductive n-type SrTiOceramics.","The calcination atmosphere influenced the sintered microstructure. ) is an SEM of the microstructure of bulk (La, Sr) TiOcalcined in O. ) is an SEM of the microstructure of bulk (La, Sr) TiOcalcined in H. ) is an SEM of the fracture surface. Powders calcined in flowing Oreached higher densities that those calcined in Ar\/3% H.","After calcination, the powders were ground and compacted with or without an organic binder to form uniform ceramic green bodies. These green bodies were then heated to a sintering temperature required to facilitate densification in flowing O. Typically, the sintering temperature required to densify the powder generated by calcination exceeded 1400\u00b0 C. A number of sintering conditions can be used to control microstructure, and thus, thermoelectric performance of the final component. After sintering, the dense ceramic was sectioned into the desired geometries required for testing by diamond machining and heat treated in Ar\/3% Hto facilitate reduction. This reduction step is preferred to achieve the desired thermoelectric performance and can be accomplished using reducing gas mixtures of CO\/CO, Ar\/H, N\/H, and the like. The duration and temperature of the reduction step is an important variable that impacts the thermoelectric performance of the material. Heat treatment of (Bi, La)-doped SrTiOin reducing atmospheres produced Bi-rich and Ti-rich precipitates. Precipitation of Bi and TiOcauses a decrease in carrier concentration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIGS. 6(","i":["a","b"],"b":"6"},"Time domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) was used to characterize thermal conductivities of films and bulk ceramics.

The temperature dependent power factor can be calculated from Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity.  shows the change in power factor as a function temperature and composition.  shows the thermal conductivity of Bi-doped La-STO at elevated temperature as a function of bismuth doping. Bismuth effectively reduced thermal conductivity when it replaced lanthanum. Small changes in bismuth content (as low as 1%) reduce the thermal conductivity of the La-STO from 5-5.5 W\/m-K to \u02dc3.5-4 W\/m-K at 300K. The dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT=(\u03c3ST\/\u03ba) can be calculated from the power factor and thermal conductivity at a given temperature.  shows ZT as a function of temperature temperatures from 300 to 550K for (Bi, La)-STO samples containing 10 mol. % total dopant. Favorable power factor and figure-of-merit values were obtained for (Bi, La)\u2014SrTiOdespite a drop in \u03c3with respect to La\u2014SrTiO. As a result of the higher thermopower (S) and lower thermal conductivity (k), the composition (Bi, La, Sr) TiOhas a ZT=0.10 compared to ZT=0.15 for La-STO. Lower thermal conductivity will be important to realize compact modules (high power density) with very high \u0394T values. High achievable \u0394T will provide higher power modules in a smaller volume which makes control of thermal conductivity necessary.","A Jonker analysis enables the determination of electrical properties from which the maximum achievable PF can be predicted. ) shows a Jonker plot of S vs. log \u03c3.
