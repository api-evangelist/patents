{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61\/664,025, filed Jun. 25, 2012, 61\/664,037, filed Jun. 25, 2012, 61\/673,113, filed Jul. 18, 2012, 61\/673,187, filed Jul. 18, 2012, and 61\/673,195, filed Jul. 18, 2012, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.","Lupus is a group of conditions with similar underlying mechanisms involving autoimmunity. In these conditions antibodies created by the body to attack antigens (e.g., viruses, bacteria) became unable to differentiate between antigens and healthy tissue. Thus, the antibodies that should protect the body begin to attack the body's own healthy tissues. Triggers for lupus include viruses, bacteria, allergens (both IgE and hypersensitivity), hormones (e.g., estrogens), environmental stimulants (e.g., ultraviolet light, sunlight, stress, smoking, trauma, scratching, burn, coldness), and certain medications.","Lupus is generally a chronic disease in which the signs and symptoms tend to come and go. Common signs or symptoms of lupus include, for example, joint pain and stiffness; muscle aches, pains, or weakness, fever with no known cause; feeling very tired; butterfly-shaped rash across the nose and cheeks; other skin rashes; unusual weight loss or weight gain; anemia; trouble thinking, memory problems, and confusion; kidney problems with no known cause; chest pain when taking a deep breath; sun or light sensitivity; hair loss; and purple or pale fingers or toes from cold or stress. Less common symptoms include blood clots, seizures, strokes, sores in the mouth or nose, severe headache, dizzy spells, \u201cseeing things\u201d or not being able to judge reality, feeling sad, and dry or irritated eyes. Lupus also increases the risk of developing various other diseases and\/or causes other diseases to occur earlier in life. Such diseases include heart disease, osteoporosis, and kidney disease. See, e.g., Lupus Fact Sheet by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women's Health (womenshealth.gov\/publications\/our-publications\/fact-sheet\/lupus.cfm; accessed Jun. 18, 2012).","Types of lupus include, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) (CLE includes, e.g., acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (ACLE), subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), intermittent cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and chronic cutaneous lupus), drug-induced lupus, and neonatal lupus. About 70% of all cases of lupus are SLE. CLE can have symptoms that are limited to the skin or can be seen in those with SLE.","Lupus affects predominately young women. More than 90% of people with lupus are women between the ages of 15 and 45. African-American, Latina, Asian, and Native American women are at greater risk of developing lupus than are white women. Men are at higher risk for developing lupus before puberty and after age 50. For African-American women between the ages of 15 and 64, the prevalence is one per 245 women. This prevalence rate for African-American women makes lupus one of the most common chronic diseases of this population. See, e.g., lupus.org\/webmodules\/webarticlesnet\/templates\/new_empty.aspx?articleid=413&zoneid=99, accessed Jun. 18, 2012.","Fibrotic conditions include diseases that involve the formation and\/or deposition of fibrous tissue that builds up and\/or spreads over or replaces normal organ tissue. Fibrotic conditions occur when processes that normally contribute to wound healing go awry, resulting in extra scar tissue that can be harmful. Fibrotic conditions can affect single organs or tissues, or they can be systemic and affect multiple organs or tissues of the body. Examples of systemic fibrotic diseases include atherosclerosis, scleroderma, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, and chronic graft vs. host disease. Fibrotic conditions can affect almost any part of the body. For example, fibrotic conditions can affect the lungs, heart, skin, kidneys, bone marrow, liver, and eyes.","Fibrotic conditions affect a large portion of the population; atherosclerosis alone will affect about 25% of Americans in their lifetime. Fibrotic conditions have serious consequences for quality of life. Examples of serious consequences of fibrotic conditions include difficulty breathing, kidney failure, and blindness. Furthermore, fibrotic conditions are often fatal. Indeed, tissue fibrosis contributes to 45 percent of all deaths in developed countries.","Inflammatory myopathies are diseases that typically involve inflammation of the muscles and associated symptoms, such as muscle weakness. The muscle weakness can be progressive and can lead to difficulty moving, including difficulty walking, breathing, swallowing, and talking. Inflammatory myopathies can be caused by allergic reactions, other diseases, exposure to a drug or toxin, or exposure to an infectious agent, or they can be idiopathic (no known cause). Inflammatory myopathies include dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies. In some cases, dermatomyositis involves predominantly skin symtoms, without muscle symptoms, or without noticeable muscle symptoms. Inflammatory myopathies can affect both adults and children (e.g., juvenile dermatomyositis). Inflammatory myopathies can include symptoms that affect other organs or systems of the body, such as the skin, lungs, heart, eyes, and gastrointestinal system. Although inflammatory myopathies are relatively rare, their prevalence has likely been underestimated (see, e.g., Smoyer Tomic, K. C. (2012) 13:103) and they can cause serious and even fatal symptoms or complications.","Inflammatory skin conditions, such as skin rashes, including rashes caused by allergens or other diseases, are commonplace. Skin rashes are frequently painful and\/or itchy (pruritic) and can be debilitating. Associated symptoms such as hay fever are likewise uncomfortable and can be debilitating. Allergic reactions can also have serious consequences, such as anaphalaxis.","Accordingly, there is a need for effective treatments for lupus, fibrotic conditions, inflammatory myopathies, skin conditions, and associated symptoms.","Methods, compositions, and kits for treating or preventing lupus, a fibrotic condition (e.g., fibrosis), inflammatory myopathies (e.g., myositis, e.g., dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis) and other disorders (e.g., skin conditions, e.g., skin rashes) are provided herein.

In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention.","The terms \u201cantagonist\u201d and \u201cinhibitor\u201d are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein (e.g., a PI3K, e.g., PI3K-\u03b4), whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms \u201cantagonist\u201d and \u201cinhibitors\u201d are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While antagonists can specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition.","As used herein, a \u201cphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor\u201d or \u201cPI3K inhibitor\u201d refers to an inhibitor of any PI3K. PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3\u2032-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family includes kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (see, e.g., Katso et al., 200117, 615-675; Foster, F. M. et al., 2003116, 3037-3040). The class I PI3Ks (e.g., p110\u03b1, p110\u03b2, p110\u03b3, and p110\u03b4) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream mediators such as those in the Akt\/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II PI3Ks (e.g., PI3K-C2\u03b1, PI3K-C2\u03b2, PI3K-C2\u03b3) and III PI3Ks (e.g., Vps34) play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. Specific exemplary PI3K inhibitors are disclosed herein.","The class I PI3Ks comprise a p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory adapter subunit. See, e.g., Cantrell, D. A. (2001) 114: 1439-1445. Four isoforms of the p110 subunit (including PI3K-\u03b1 (alpha), PI3K-\u03b2 (beta), PI3K-\u03b3 (gamma), and PI3K-\u03b4 (delta) isoforms) have been implicated in various biological functions. Class I PI3K\u03b1 is involved, for example, in insulin signaling, and has been found to be mutated in solid tumors. Class I PI3K-\u03b2 is involved, for example, in platelet activation and insulin signaling. Class I PI3K-\u03b3 plays a role in mast cell activation, innate immune function, and immune cell trafficking (chemokines). Class I PI3K-\u03b4 is involved, for example, in B-cell and T-cell activation and function and in Fc receptor signaling in mast cells. In some embodiments provided herein, the PI3K inhibitor is a class I PI3K inhibitor. In some such embodiments, the PI3K inhibitor inhibits a PI3K-\u03b1 (alpha), PI3K-\u03b2 (beta), PI3K-\u03b3 (gamma), or PI3K-\u03b4 (delta) isoform, or a combination thereof.","Downstream mediators of PI3K signal transduction include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a plckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family.","The term \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable salt\u201d refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.

In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts.","\u201cPharmaceutically acceptable carrier\u201d or \u201cpharmaceutically acceptable excipient\u201d includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.","The term \u201cselective inhibition\u201d or \u201cselectively inhibit\u201d as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target.","\u201cRadiation therapy\u201d means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionucleotides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e. beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g. strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.","\u201cProdrug\u201d is meant to indicate a compound that can be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term \u201cprodrug\u201d refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., \u201cPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\u201d A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in , ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term \u201cprodrug\u201d is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.","The term \u201cin vivo\u201d refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body.","The term \u201cin vitro\u201d refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed.","Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures wherein hydrogen is replaced by deuterium or tritium, or wherein carbon atom is replaced by C- or C-enriched carbon, are within the scope of this invention.","The compounds described herein can also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds can be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (H), iodine-125 (I) or carbon-14 (C). All isotopic variations of the compounds described herein, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term \u201cabout\u201d when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range can vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range.

A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a \u201cracemic\u201d mixture. The term \u201c(.\u00b1.)\u201d is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. \u201cDiastereoisomers\u201d are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (\u2212) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.","\u201cEnantiomeric purity\u201d as used herein refers to the relative amounts, expressed as a percentage, of the presence of a specific enantiomer relative to the other enantiomer. For example, if a compound, which can potentially have an (R)- or an (S)-isomeric configuration, is present as a racemic mixture, the enantiomeric purity is about 50% with respect to either the (R)- or (S)-isomer. If that compound has one isomeric form predominant over the other, for example, 80% (S)- and 20% (R)-, the enantiomeric purity of the compound with respect to the (S)-isomeric form is 80%. The enantiomeric purity of a compound can be determined in a number of ways known in the art, including but not limited to chromatography using a chiral support, polarimetric measurement of the rotation of polarized light, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using chiral shift reagents which include but are not limited to lanthanide containing chiral complexes or the Pirkle alcohol, or derivatization of a compounds using a chiral compound such as Mosher's acid followed by chromatography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.","\u201cMoiety\u201d refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.","\u201cNitro\u201d refers to the \u2014NOradical.","\u201cOxa\u201d refers to the \u2014O\u2014 radical.","\u201cOxo\u201d refers to the \u2550O radical.","\u201cTautomers\u201d are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. \u201cTautomerization\u201d is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. \u201cPrototropic tautomerization\u201d or \u201cproton-shift tautomerization\u201d involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order, often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g. in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto-enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers.","The compounds of the present invention can also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds can be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (H), iodine-125 (I) or carbon-14 (C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.","A \u201cleaving group or atom\u201d is any group or atom that will, under the reaction conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site. Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups.","\u201cProtecting group\u201d has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). For example, a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise, amines and other reactive groups can similarly be protected.","\u201cSolvate\u201d refers to a compound (e.g., a compound selected from Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in physical association with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. It will be understood that \u201ca compound of Formula I\u201d encompass the compound of Formula I and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof.","\u201cSubstituted\u201d means that the referenced group can be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently selected from acyl, alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, carbohydrate, carbonate, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halo, carbonyl, ester, thiocarbonyl, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, oxo, perhaloalkyl, perfluoroalkyl, phosphate, silyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, sulfonamidyl, sulfoxyl, sulfonate, urea, and amino, including mono- and di-substituted amino groups, and the protected derivatives thereof. Di-substituted amino groups encompass those which form a ring together with the nitrogen of the amino group, such as for instance, morpholino. The substituents themselves can be substituted, for example, a cycloakyl substituent can have a halide substituted at one or more ring carbons, and the like. The protecting groups that can form the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and can be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above.","\u201cSulfanyl\u201d refers to the groups: \u2014S-(optionally substituted alkyl), \u2014S-(optionally substituted aryl), \u2014S-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and \u2014S-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).","\u201cSulfinyl\u201d refers to the groups: \u2014S(O)\u2014H, \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted alkyl), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted amino), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted aryl), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).","\u201cSulfonyl\u201d refers to the groups: \u2014S(O)\u2014H, \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted alkyl), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted amino), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted aryl), \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and \u2014S(O)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl).","\u201cSulfonamidyl\u201d or \u201csulfonamido\u201d refers to a \u2014S(\u2550O)\u2014NRR radical, where each R is selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). The R groups in \u2014NRR of the \u2014S(\u2550O)\u2014NRR radical can be taken together with the nitrogen to which it is attached to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring.

In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and\/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.","The pharmaceutical compositions can be anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water can be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and\/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and\/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.","An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.","Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof.","Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof.","Disintegrants can be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.","Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.","When aqueous suspensions and\/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and\/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof.","The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.","Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.","A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (\u201cHLB\u201d value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.","Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.","Within the aforementioned group, ionic surfactants include, by way of example: lecithins, lysolecithin, phospholipids, lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.","Ionic surfactants can be the ionized forms of lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylserine, PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine, PVP-phosphatidylethanolamine, lactylic esters of fatty acids, stearoyl-2-lactylate, stearoyl lactylate, succinylated monoglycerides, mono\/diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono\/diglycerides, citric acid esters of mono\/diglycerides, cholylsarcosine, caproate, caprylate, caprate, laurate, myristate, palmitate, oleate, ricinoleate, linoleate, linolenate, stearate, lauryl sulfate, teracecyl sulfate, docusate, lauroyl carnitines, palmitoyl carnitines, myristoyl carnitines, and salts and mixtures thereof.","Hydrophilic non-ionic surfactants can include, but not limited to, alkylglucosides; alkylmaltosides; alkylthioglucosides; lauryl macrogolglycerides; polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers such as polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers; polyoxyalkylene alkylphenols such as polyethylene glycol alkyl phenols; polyoxyalkylene alkyl phenol fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol fatty acids monoesters and polyethylene glycol fatty acids diesters; polyethylene glycol glycerol fatty acid esters; polyglycerol fatty acid esters; polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters; hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids, and sterols; polyoxyethylene sterols, derivatives, and analogues thereof; polyoxyethylated vitamins and derivatives thereof; polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers; and mixtures thereof; polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters and hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of triglycerides, vegetable oils, and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The polyol can be glycerol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, propylene glycol, pentaerythritol, or a saccharide.","Other hydrophilic-non-ionic surfactants include, without limitation, PEG-10 laurate, PEG-12 laurate, PEG-20 laurate, PEG-32 laurate, PEG-32 dilaurate, PEG-12 oleate, PEG-15 oleate, PEG-20 oleate, PEG-20 dioleate, PEG-32 oleate, PEG-200 oleate, PEG-400 oleate, PEG-15 stearate, PEG-32 distearate, PEG-40 stearate, PEG-100 stearate, PEG-20 dilaurate, PEG-25 glyceryl trioleate, PEG-32 dioleate, PEG-20 glyceryl laurate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-20 glyceryl stearate, PEG-20 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl oleate, PEG-30 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 glyceryl laurate, PEG-40 palm kernel oil, PEG-50 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-40 castor oil, PEG-35 castor oil, PEG-60 castor oil, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, PEG-60 corn oil, PEG-6 caprate\/caprylate glycerides, PEG-8 caprate\/caprylate glycerides, polyglyceryl-10 laurate, PEG-30 cholesterol, PEG-25 phyto sterol, PEG-30 soya sterol, PEG-20 trioleate, PEG-40 sorbitan oleate, PEG-80 sorbitan laurate, polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, POE-9 lauryl ether, POE-23 lauryl ether, POE-10 oleyl ether, POE-20 oleyl ether, POE-20 stearyl ether, tocopheryl PEG-100 succinate, PEG-24 cholesterol, polyglyceryl-10oleate, Tween 40, Tween 60, sucrose monostearate, sucrose monolaurate, sucrose monopalmitate, PEG 10-100 nonyl phenol series, PEG 15-100 octyl phenol series, and poloxamers.","Suitable lipophilic surfactants include, by way of example only: fatty alcohols; glycerol fatty acid esters; acetylated glycerol fatty acid esters; lower alcohol fatty acids esters; propylene glycol fatty acid esters; sorbitan fatty acid esters; polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters; sterols and sterol derivatives; polyoxyethylated sterols and sterol derivatives; polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers; sugar esters; sugar ethers; lactic acid derivatives of mono- and di-glycerides; hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, fatty acids and sterols; oil-soluble vitamins\/vitamin derivatives; and mixtures thereof.

Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol, glycerol, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, PEG-400, glycofurol and propylene glycol.","The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer can be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it can be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer can also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer can be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight.","The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof.","In addition, an acid or a base can be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils can also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.","Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.","Pharmaceutical Compositions for Topical (e.g., Transdermal) Delivery.","In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is a composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.","Compositions can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation can provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.","The pharmaceutical compositions also can comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.","Another exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (\u201cpatches\u201d).

The liquid or solid compositions can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions can be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner","Other Pharmaceutical Compositions.","Pharmaceutical compositions can also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., , Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., , Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., , Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 200120th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000; Martindale, , Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally.","The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg\/kg\/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g\/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g\/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.","In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes can be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention can also be used for treatment of an acute condition.","In some embodiments, a compound is administered in multiple doses. Dosing can be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing can be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.","Administration of the compound can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, the compound is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, the compound is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, the compound is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects.","An effective amount of a compound can be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant.","The compositions can also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration can, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention can slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound can be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix can be a polymeric matrix, and can serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for example, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly(ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices can be nondegrading or can degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. A compound can be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip\/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and\/or brush-coating. A compound can be applied in a solvent and the solvent can be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, a compound can be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents can be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent can be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, a compound can be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker can be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound. Any bio-labile linkage can be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. A Compound can additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of a compounds via the pericard or via advential application of a formulation described herein can also be performed.","A variety of stent devices which can be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat.

It is known in the art that due to intersubject variability in compound pharmacokinetics, individualization of dosing regimen is necessary for optimal therapy. Dosing for a compound of the invention can be found by routine experimentation in light of the instant disclosure.","When a compound of the invention, is administered in a composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound of the invention unit dose forms of the agent and the compound of the invention can be adjusted accordingly.","The subject pharmaceutical composition can, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition can be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages.

Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.","The activity of the compounds of the present invention may be determined using any method known in the art, or any method described herein. For example, the activity of the kinase may be assessed, e.g., by measuring the incorporation of \u03b3-P-phosphate from \u03b3-P-ATP onto N-terminal His tagged substrate, which is expressed in and is purified by conventional methods, in the presence of the kinase. The assay may be carried out in 96-well polypropylene plate. The incubation mixture (100, \u03bcL) may comprise 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl, 5 mM \u03b2-glycerolphosphate, 100 \u03bcM Na-orthovanadate, 5 mM DTT, 5 nM kinase, and 1 \u03bcM substrate. Inhibitors may be suspended in DMSO, and all reactions, including controls may be performed at a final concentration of 1% DMSO. Reactions may be initiated by the addition of 10 \u03bcM ATP (with 0.5 \u03bcCi \u03b3-P-ATP\/well) and incubated at ambient temperature for a suitable time, e.g., for 45 minutes. Equal volume of 25% TCA may be added to stop the reaction and precipitate the proteins. Precipitated proteins may be trapped onto glass fiber B filterplates, and excess labeled ATP washed off using a Tomtec MACH III harvestor. Plates may be allowed to air-dry prior to adding 30 \u03bcL\/well of Packard Microscint 20, and plates may be counted using a Packard TopCount\u00ae.","Treatments for Lupus","In one aspect, a method of reducing a lupus associated symptom in a biological sample is disclosed. The method includes contacting the biological sample with a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., as a single agent or in combination with another agent or therapeutic modality), in an amount sufficient to decrease or inhibit lupus (e.g., to decrease lupus associated symptoms). In one embodiment, the method is carried out in vivo, for example, in a mammalian subject, e.g., an animal model or as part of therapeutic protocol.","As used herein, \u201ccontacting\u201d can be direct (e.g., by direct application of the PI3K inhibitor to a biological sample, e.g., in vitro) or indirect (e.g., by administering the PI3K inhibitor to a subject (e.g., by any known administration route, e.g., orally), such that the PI3K inhibitor reaches an affected biological sample within the body.","As used herein, a \u201cbiological sample\u201d includes, for example, a cell or group of cells (e.g., PBMCs, or plasmacytoid dendritic cell(s)), a tissue, or a fluid (e.g., whole blood or serum) that comes into contact with the PI3K inhibitor, thereby resulting in a decrease or inhibition of lupus or lupus associated symptoms. In some embodiments, the biological sample is present within or derived from a subject who has lupus, or from a subject at risk for developing lupus. In some embodiments, the biological sample can be contacted with the PI3K inhibitor outside the body and then introduced into the body of a subject (e.g., into the body of the subject from whom the biological sample was derived or into the body of a different subject). In some embodiments, the biological sample includes cells that express Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and\/or Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).","In some embodiments, the cell is a plasmacytoid dendritic cell. In some embodiments, contacting the plasmacytoid dendritic cell with a PI3K inhibitor ameliorates or prevents development of a CLE skin lesion.","Also disclosed herein are methods of treating or preventing lupus in a subject. The methods include administering a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., as a single agent or in combination with another agent or therapeutic modality), to a subject in need thereof, in an amount sufficient to decrease lupus or a lupus associated symptom in the subject.","Type I interferons (IFNs), especially IFN-\u03b1, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. See, e.g., Ohl, K. and Tenbrock, K. (2011) , Article ID 432595 (14 pages). In particular, SLE patients frequently show enhanced levels of serum IFN-\u03b1 and the IFN levels have been found to correlate with anti-dsDNA production and disease activity. IFN-\u03b1 therapy can lead to autoantibody production and an SLE-like syndrome. Furthermore, many of the symptoms of SLE resemble symptoms of patients with influenza or side effects of IFN-\u03b1 therapy, for example, fever, fatigue, and leucopenia. Genetic association studies have most frequently identified genes that are components of the upstream or downstream pathways of type I interferon, e.g., STAT4 and IRF5, as being associated with SLE. Additionally, both adult and pediatric SLE PBMCs show significant upregulation of IFN-regulated gene transcripts (the \u201cinterferon signature\u201d), which is considered a biomarker for disease activity. See, e.g., Id.","Although leucocytes produce IFN, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs or pDCs) are the main producers; they produce 100-200 times more IFN than any other cell type. It is thought that PDCs can produce such high amounts of IFN because they constitutively express Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9).","The formation of immune complexes is a hallmark of SLE. Causes of immune complex formation include increased apoptosis and defective clearance of apoptotic material, as well as high occurrence of autoantibodies. Id. Immune complexes induce IFN-\u03b1 production by pDCs Immune complexes are internalized after binding Fc gamma RIIa on the surface of pDCs and activate TLR9 and TLR7 in the endosomal compartment, which induces IFN-\u03b1 secretion. Id. Overproduction of IFNs in lupus creates a vicious cycle, exerting wide effects that result in further enhanced synthesis of IFN. These effects are summarized in Ohl, K. and Tenbrock, K. (2011) Article ID 432595 (14 pages).","In human lupus (e.g., SLE and CLE), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) actively produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to endogenous TLR ligands derived from chronic inflammation. This results in a type 1 IFN gene signature. Type 1 IFNs (e.g., IFN-\u03b1) modulate autoimmunity by promoting CD maturation, T-cell survival, B-cell differentiation, immunoblogulin class switching and antibody production. See, e.g., Ghoreishi, M. and Dutz, J. P. (2009) 19: 1029-1035.","In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal.

In some embodiments, the subject is at risk for developing lupus (e.g., the subject carries a gene that, individually, or in combination with other genes or environmental factors, is associated with development of lupus).","In some embodiments, the subject exhibits elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies (e.g., anti-Smith antibodies, anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies, anti-U1 RNP, SS-a (or anti-Ro), SS-b (or anti-La)), antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-ss DNA antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, or anticardiolipin antibodies. In some embodiments, the subject exhibits elevated levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. In some embodiments, the subject exhibits elevated levels of anti-Sm antibodies.","In some embodiments, the subject exhibits autoantibodies against one or more antigens that are known to be associated with lupus or with lupus subtypes.

In some embodiments, serum cam also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. In some some embodiments, glomerulonephritis can be assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E at the end of the study, or survival can also be an endpoint. For example, proteozome inhibitor Bortezimib is effective at blocking disease in the NZB\/W model in both the prophylactic and therapeutic model with reductions in anto-antibody production, kidney damage, and improvements in survival (14: 748-755 (2008)). This established art model can be employed to demonstrate that the kinase inhibitors provided herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.","Other animal models include, e.g., the MRL\/1pr, NZB\/W, and BSXB mouse strain, as well as transgenic forms of these.

Systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis is a prototypic antibody-mediated autoimmune disease where hyperactive helper T-cells drive polyclonal B-cell activation and secretion of pathogenic autoantibodies. The autoantibodies form immune complexes with their respective auto-antigens, depositing in sites such as the kidney initiating a destructive inflammatory process. This can result in lupus nephritis, in which circulating immune complexes deposit in the glomerular subendothelial space and in the mesangium, leading to deterioration of the glomerulus and eventual end-stage renal disease. The development of glomerular lesions involves multiple adhesion molecules cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, lipid mediators and Fc receptors. In some embodiments, the methods disclosed herein reduce nephritis (e.g., glomerulonephritis).","In some embodiments, the subject exhibits excessive PI3K activity or abnormal activity (e.g., excessive or reduced activity) of one or more components of the PI3K signaling pathway (e.g., Akt (PKB), mTOR, a Tec kinase (e.g., Btk, Itk, Tec), phospholipase C, PDK1, PKCs, NF\u03baB, Rac GEF (e.g., Vav-1), or Rac).","Treatments for Fibrotic Conditions","The present invention provides methods of treating a fibrotic condition (e.g., a fibrosis) comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a PI3 kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with one or more additional therapies (e.g., one or more additional therapeutic agents), to a subject in need thereof. In one embodiment, the PI3 kinase inhibitor is Compound 292. The invention also encompasses a composition for use, and use of, a PI3K inhibitor, alone or in combination with another agent, for preparation of one or more medicaments for use in treating a fibrotic condition.","The present invention also provides methods of reducing fibrosis in a cell or tissue. These methods include contacting a fibrotic cell or tissue with a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., as a single agent or in combination with another agent or therapeutic modality), in an amount sufficient to decrease or inhibit the fibrosis. These methods may be carried out in vitro or in vivo, for example, in a mammalian subject, e.g., an animal model or human. In one embodiment, the fibrosis is present in subject with a fibrotic condition.","As used herein, \u201cfibrotic condition\u201d refers to a disease or condition involving the formation and\/or deposition of fibrous tissue, e.g., excessive connective tissue builds up in a tissue and\/or spreads over or replaces normal organ tissue (reviewed in, e.g., Wynn, 4:583-594 (2004) and Abdel-Wahab, O. et al. (2009) 60:233-45, incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition involves excessive collagen production and deposition. In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is caused, at least in part, by injury, e.g., chronic injury (e.g., an insult, a wound, a toxin, a disease). In further embodiments, the fibrotic condition is surgical-induced, burn-induced, or radiation-induced.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is associated with excessive PI3K activity or abnormal activity (e.g., excessive or reduced activity) of one or more components of the PI3K signaling pathway (e.g., Akt (PKB), mTOR, a Tec kinase (e.g., Btk, Itk, Tec), phospholipase C, PDK1, PKCs, NF\u03baB, Rac GEF (e.g., Vav-1), or Rac). In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is associated with an inflammatory, an autoimmune or a connective tissue disorder. For example, chronic inflammation in a tissue can lead to fibrosis in that tissue. Exemplary tissues in which fibrosis can develop include, but are not limited to, biliary tissue, liver tissue, lung tissue, heart tissue, vascular tissue, kidney tissue, skin tissue, gut tissue, peritoneal tissue, bone marrow, eye tissue, and the like. In certain embodiments, the tissue is epithelial tissue. In some embodiments, the fibrosis is systemic. In some embodiments, the fibrosis is associated with scleroderma.","Inhibition of a PI3K is useful for ameliorating fibrotic conditions and disorders, including reducing fibrosis, and\/or having a protective effect by decreasing signs or symptoms of fibrosis. Such signs or symptoms may include decreased development of fibrotic lesions, a decrease in weight loss or other clinical symptoms, or altered expression of biological molecules (e.g., mRNA or protein expression) associated with development of a fibrotic condition.","Biological molecules associated with development of a fibrotic condition (e.g., systemic sclerosis) include, e.g., interferon-responsive genes (e.g., type I IFNs, e.g., IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2), toll-like receptors (TLRs) and TLR ligands (e.g., autoantibodies (e.g., systemic sclerosis-associated autoantibodies) and TLR ligands generated from matrix molecules during tissue injury). See, e.g., Lafyatis, R. & York, M. (2009) 21:617-622. Other examples of biological molecules associated with development of a fibrotic condition include, e.g., PI3K, Akt, endothelin-1(ET-1), \u03b1-SMA, ezrin, paxillin, and moesin. See, e.g., Shi-Wen, X. et al. (2004) 15: 2707-2719. Further examples of biological molecules associated with development of a fibrotic condition include, e.g., Akt, collagen, connective tissue growth factor (CCGF\/CCN2), and protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). See, e.g., Parapurman, S. K. et al. (1996) 131: 1996-2003. Yet other examples of biological molecules associated with development of a fibrotic condition include TGF\u03b2, FAK, MEKK1, JNK, and \u03b1-SMA. See, e.g., Liu, S. et al. (2007) 18: 2169-2178.","In some embodiments, biological molecules associated with development of a fibrotic condition are expressed and\/or assessed in a fibroblast (e.g., a human lung fibroblast, e.g., an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis fibroblast).","In some embodiments, a cell or tissue affected by the fibrotic condition (e.g., a fibroblast) expresses increased levels of a PI3 kinase (e.g., PI3K-\u03b2).","Exemplary fibrotic conditions that can be treated or prevented using the methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, a systemic fibrotic condition or a fibrotic condition of the lung, liver, heart, vasculature, kidney, skin, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, or a combination thereof. Each of these conditions is described in more detail herein.","Exemplary fibrotic conditions and disorders that can be treated with PI3K inhibitors include, but are not limited to, liver fibrosis, such as liver fibrosis associated with liver injury (e.g., liver injury caused by alcohol, viral infection (e.g., Hepatitis B and C infection); pulmonary fibrosis (e.g., lung fibrosis caused by smoking, drugs such as bleomycin); cardiac fibrosis; bone marrow fibrosis, kidney fibrosis, and ophthalmic fibrosis (e.g., glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, diagetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, dry eye disease).","Opthalmic fibrosis or fibrosis of the eye can occur in response to injury, such as mechanical wound or various metabolic malfunctions (including, e.g., responses to inflammation, ischemia, and degenerative disease). Fibrotic conditions that affect the eye include anterior segment fibrotic diseases and posterior segment fibrotic diseases. See e.g., Friedlander, M. (2007) 117(3): 576-586. Anterior segment fibrotic diseases include, e.g., corneal opacification and glaucoma. Fibrosis in the context of posterior segment fibrotic disease may also be referred to as gliosis. Id. Examples of posterior segment fibrotic diseases include, e.g., retinopathies (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity), macular degeneration (e.g., age-related macular degeneration), and neovascular glaucoma.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is an ophthalmic fibrotic disease or a fibrotic condition that affects the eye. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is an anterior segment fibrotic disease. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is selected from corneal opacification and glaucoma. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a posterior segment fibrotic disease. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a retinopathy. In some embodiments, the retinopathy is diabetic retinopathy. In some embodiments the fibrotic condition is macular degeneration. In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is age-related macular degeneration.","Fibrosis of the lung (also referred to herein as \u201cpulmonary fibrosis\u201d) is characterized by the formation of scar tissue within the lungs, which results in a decreased function. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with shortness of breath, which progresses to discomfort in the chest weakness and fatigue, and ultimately to loss of appetite and rapid weight-loss. Approximately 500,000 people in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide suffer from pulmonary fibrosis, and 40,000 people in the U.S. die annually from the disease. Pulmonary fibrosis has a number of causes, including radiation therapy, but can also be due to smoking or hereditary factors (Meltzer, E B et al. (2008) 3:8).","Pulmonary fibrosis can occur as a secondary effect in disease processes such as asbestosis and silicosis, and is known to be more prevalent in certain occupations such as coal miner, ship workers and sand blasters where exposure to environmental pollutants is an occupational hazard (Green, F H et al. (2007) 35:136-47). Other factors that contribute to pulmonary fibrosis include cigarette smoking, and autoimmune connective tissue disorders, like rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Leslie, K O et al. (2007) 28:369-78; Swigris, J J et al. (2008) 133:271-80; and Antoniou, K M et al. (2008) 20:686-91). Other connective tissue disorders such as sarcoidosis can include pulmonary fibrosis as part of the disease (Paramothayan, S et al. (2008) 102:1-9), and infectious diseases of the lung can cause fibrosis as a long term consequence of infection, particularly chronic infections. Pulmonary fibrosis can also be a side effect of certain medical treatments, particularly radiation therapy to the chest and certain medicines like bleomycin, methotrexate, amiodarone, busulfan, and nitrofurantoin (Catane, R et al. (1979) 5:1513-8; Zisman, D A et al. (2001) 18:243-52; Rakita, L et al. (1983) Am Heart J. 106:906-16; Twohig, K J et al. (1990) 11:31-54; and Witten C M. (1989) 70:55-7). In other embodiments, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can occur where no clear causal agent or disease can be identified. Genetic factors can play a significant role in these cases of pulmonary fibrosis (Steele, M P et al. (2007) 74:601-8; Brass, D M et al. (2007) 4:92-100 and du Bois R M. (2006) 27:581-8).","In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the lung chosen from one or more of: pulmonary fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), usual interstitial pneumonitis (UIP), interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), or bronchiectasis.","In other embodiments, pulmonary fibrosis includes, but is not limited to, pulmonary fibrosis associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome, scleroderma, pleural fibrosis, chronic asthma, acute lung syndrome, amyloidosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, Caplan's disease, Dressler's syndrome, histiocytosis X, idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis, lymphangiomyomatosis, mitral valve stenosis, polymyositis, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary hypertension (IPH)), pneumoconiosis, radiotherapy (e.g., radiation induced fibrosis), rheumatoid disease, Shaver's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, tuberous sclerosis, Weber-Christian disease, Wegener's granulomatosis, Whipple's disease, or exposure to toxins or irritants (e.g., pharmaceutical drugs such as amiodarone, bleomycin, busulphan, carmustine, chloramphenicol, hexamethonium, methotrexate, methysergide, mitomycin C, nitrofurantoin, penicillamine, peplomycin, and practolol; inhalation of talc or dust, e.g., coal dust, silica). In certain embodiments, the pulmonary fibrosis is associated with an inflammatory disorder of the lung, e.g., asthma, and\/or COPD.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the liver or hepatic fibrosis, e.g., fatty liver disease, steatosis (e.g., nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cholestatic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), biliary fibrosis, cirrhosis, alcohol induced liver fibrosis, biliary duct injury, infection or viral induced liver fibrosis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, autoimmune hepatitis, or cholangiopathies (e.g., chronic cholangiopathies). Hepatic or liver fibrosis includes, e.g., hepatic fibrosis associated with alcoholism, viral infection, e.g., hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis C, B or D), autoimmune hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), progressive massive fibrosis, exposure to toxins or irritants (e.g., alcohol, pharmaceutical drugs and environmental toxins such as arsenic), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, galactosemia, or glycogen storage disease. In certain embodiments, the hepatic fibrosis is associated with an inflammatory disorder of the liver.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the heart or vasculature. A fibrotic condition of the heart or vasculature includes, but is not limited to, myocardial fibrosis (e.g., myocardial fibrosis associated with radiation myocarditis, a surgical procedure complication (e.g., myocardial post-operative fibrosis), vascular restenosis, atherosclerosis, cerebral disease, peripheral vascular disease, infectious diseases (e.g., Chagas disease, bacterial, trichinosis or fungal myocarditis)); granulomatous, metabolic storage disorders (e.g., cardiomyopathy, hemochromatosis); developmental disorders (e.g, endocardial fibroelastosis); arteriosclerotic, or exposure to toxins or irritants (e.g., drug induced cardiomyopathy, drug induced cardiotoxicity, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, cobalt poisoning or exposure). In certain embodiments, the myocardial fibrosis is associated with an inflammatory disorder of cardiac tissue (e.g., myocardial sarcoidosis).","In one embodiment, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the kidney or renal fibrosis (e.g., chronic kidney fibrosis). Renal fibrosis includes, e.g., nephropathies associated with injury\/fibrosis (e.g., chronic nephropathies associated with diabetes (e.g., diabetic nephropathy)), lupus, scleroderma of the kidney, glomerular nephritis, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, IgA nephropathyrenal fibrosis associated with human chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic kidney fibrosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, chronic progressive nephropathy (CPN), tubulointerstitial fibrosis, ureteral obstruction (e.g., fetal partial urethral obstruction), chronic uremia, chronic interstitial nephritis, radiation nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis (e.g., focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)), progressive glomerulonephrosis (PGN), endothelial\/thrombotic microangiopathy injury, scleroderma of the kidney, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVVAN), or exposure to toxins, irritants, chemotherapeutic agents. In one embodiment, the kidney fibrosis is mediated by a bone morphogeneic protein (BMP). In certain embodiments, the renal fibrosis is a result of an inflammatory disorder of the kidney.","In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the bone marrow. In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition of the bone marrow is myelofibrosis (e.g., primary myelofibrosis (PMF)), myeloid metaplasia, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, or primary myelofibrosis. In other embodiments, bone marrow fibrosis is associated with a hematologic disorder chosen from one or more of hairy cell leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.","In other embodiments, the bone marrow fibrosis is associated with one or more myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) chosen from: essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, or other MPN.","In one embodiment, the fibrotic condition is primary myelofibrosis. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (also referred to in the literature as idiopathic myeloid metaplasia, and Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia) is a clonal disorder of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (reviewed in Abdel-Wahab, O. et al. (2009) 60:233-45; Varicchio, L. et al. (2009) 2(3):315-334; Agrawal, M. et al. (2010) 1-15). The disease is characterized by anemia, splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis, and is marked by progressive marrow fibrosis and atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia. CD34+ stem\/progenitor cells abnormally traffic in the peripheral blood and multi organ extramedullary erythropoiesis is a hallmark of the disease, especially in the spleen and liver. The bone marrow structure is altered due to progressive fibrosis, neoangiogenesis, and increased bone deposits. A significant percentage of patients with PMF have gain-of-function mutations in genes that regulate hematopoiesis, including Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) (\u02dc50%) (e.g., JAK2 V617F) or the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) (5-10%), resulting in abnormal megakaryocyte growth and differentiation. Studies have suggested that the clonal hematopoietic disorder leads to secondary proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive collagen deposition. Decreased bone marrow fibrosis can improve clinical signs and symptoms, including anemia, abnormal leukocyte counts, and splenomegaly.","Bone marrow fibrosis can be observed in several other hematologic disorders including, but not limited to hairy cell leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. However, each of these conditions is characterized by a constellation of clinical, pathologic, and molecular findings not characteristic of PMF (see Abdel-Wahab, O. et al. (2009) supra at page 235).","In other embodiments, the bone marrow fibrosis can be secondary to non-hematologic disorders, including but not limited to, solid tumor metastases to bone marrow, autoimmune disorders (systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, mixed connective tissue disorder, polymyositis), and secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with vitamin D deficiency (see Abdel-Wahab, O. et al. (2009) supra at page 235). In most cases, it is possible to distinguish between these disorders and PMF, although in rare cases the presence of the JAK2V617F or MPLW515L\/K mutation can be used to demonstrate the presence of a clonal MPN and to exclude the possibility of reactive fibrosis.","The effect of PI3K inhibitors in myelofibrosis can be characterized in mouse models available in the art, e.g., as described in Varicchio, L. (2009) supra.","Monitoring a clinical improvement in a subject with bone marrow fibrosis can be evaluated by one or more of: monitoring peripheral blood counts (e.g., red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets), wherein an increase in peripheral blood counts is indicative of an improved outcome. In some embodiments, clinical improvement in a subject with bone marrow fibrosis can be evaluated by monitoring one or more of: spleen size, liver size, and size of extramedullary hematopoiesis, wherein a decrease in one or more of these parameters is indicative of an improved outcome.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the skin. In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is chosen from one or more of: skin fibrosis and\/or scarring, scleroderma (e.g., systemic scleroderma), or keloid.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is scleroderma. Scleroderma is a group of diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin and\/or other connective tissues. Scleroderma is more common in women than in men and most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years. Scleroderma may be localized (e.g., affecting only the skin) or systemic (e.g., affecting other systems such as, e.g., blood vessels and\/or internal organs). Common symptoms of scleroderma include Raynaud's phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and skin changes (e.g., swollen fingers and hands, or thickened patches of skin).","Localized scleroderma (localized cutaneous fibrosis) includes morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea is typically characterized by oval-shaped thickened patches of skin that are white in the middle, with a purple border. Linear scleroderma is more common in children. Symptoms of linear scleroderma may appear mostly on one side of the body. In linear scleroderma, bands or streaks of hardened skin may develop on one or both arms or legs or on the forehead. En coup de sabre (frontal linear scleroderma or morphea en coup de sabre) is a type of localized scleroderma typically characterized by linear lesions of the scalp or face.","Systemic scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) includes, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis (also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis, or CREST syndrome), diffuse systemic sclerosis (also known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis), and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma. CREST stands for the following complications that may accompany limited scleroderma: calcinosis (e.g., of the digits), Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysfunction, sclerodactyl), and telangiectasias. Typically, limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands, arms, and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement, with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See, e.g., Denton, C. P. et al. (2006), 2(3):134-143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud's phenomenon, whereas in the diffuse subtype, onset of Raynaud's phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension, severe bowel involvement, and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis, lung fibrosis, and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs (e.g., kidneys, esophagus, heart, or lungs). Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.","In some embodiments, the fibrotic condition is scleroderma. In some embodiments, the scleroderma is localized, e.g., morphea or linear scleroderma. In some embodiments, the condition is a systemic sclerosis, e.g., limited systemic sclerosis, diffuse systemic sclerosis, or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.","In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the gastrointestinal tract. A fibrotic condition of the gastrointestinal tract may be associated with an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, e.g., fibrosis associated with scleroderma; radiation induced gut fibrosis; fibrosis associated with a foregut inflammatory disorder such as Barrett's esophagus and chronic gastritis, and\/or fibrosis associated with a hindgut inflammatory disorder, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is diffuse scleroderma.","In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is selected from pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease; fatty liver disease; cholestatic liver disease, biliary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis; myocardial fibrosis; and renal fibrosis.","In certain embodiments, the fibrotic condition is selected from biliary fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis and renal fibrosis","Other fibrotic conditions that can be treated with the methods and compositions of the invention include cystic fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, mediastinal fibrosis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, spinal cord injury\/fibrosis.","Evaluating the effect of PI3K inhibitors, such as Compound 292, in several fibrotic conditions in vivo can be performed, for example, using animal models. A number of models in which fibrosis is induced are available in the art. Administration of PI3K inhibitors, such as Compound 292, can be readily used to evaluate whether fibrosis is ameliorated in such models. Examples of such models, include but are not limited to, the unilateral ureteral obstruction model of renal fibrosis (see Chevalier et al., \u201cUreteral Obstruction as a Model of Renal Interstitial Fibrosis and Obstructive Nephropathy\u201d (2009) 75:1145-1152), the bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis (see Moore and Hogaboam \u201cMurine Models of Pulmonary Fibrosis\u201d . (2008) 294:L152-L160), a variety of liver\/biliary fibrosis models (see Chuang et al., \u201cAnimal Models of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis\u201d (2008) 12:333-347; Omenetti, A. et al. (2007) 87:499-514 (biliary duct-ligated model); a number of myelofibrosis mouse models as described in Varicchio, L. (2009) supra.; and the locally-injected bleomycin induced model of scleroderma (see, e.g., Yamamoto et al., \u201cAnimal Model of Sclerotic skin I: Local Injection of Bleomycin Induce Sclerotic Skin Mimicking Scleroderma, 112: 456-462 (1999). Regardless of the model, a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., Compound 292) can be evaluated using at least three general types of paradigms: 1) test whether the inhibitor can inhibit the fibrotic state; 2) test whether the inhibitor can stop fibrotic progression once initiated; and\/or 3) test whether the inhibitor can reverse the fibrotic state once initiated.","Treatments for Inflammatory Myopathy","Disclosed herein are methods of treating inflammatory myopathies and skin conditions. The methods include administering a PI3K inhibitor (e.g., as a single agent or in combination with one or more additional agents or therapeutic modalities), to a subject in need thereof, thereby treating the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition (e.g., by ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition). The PI3K inhibitor is administered in an amount sufficient to treat the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition in the subject. An \u201camount sufficient,\u201d as used herein, includes a therapeutically effective amount and\/or a prophylactically effective amount.","Interferons (IFNs) (e.g., Type I interferons, e.g., IFN-\u03b1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy (e.g., dermatomyositis) as well as other autoimmune diseases. See, e.g., Wong, D. et al. (2012) PLoS ONE, 7(1):e29161 doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0029161; Higgs, B. W. et al. (2012) 15:25-35. Furthermore, various cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, IL-10, TGF\u03b2, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-15) play a role in pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy (e.g., dermatomyositis). See, e.g., Kao et al. (2011) 13:225-232. For example, the bood, muscle, and skin of patients with dermatomyositis is characterized by the presence of an \u201cIFN signature\u201d involving upregulation of IFN-inducible genes. See, e.g., Wong, D. et al. (2012) 7(1):e29161; Higgs, B. W. et al. (2012) 15:25-35. Type I IFN is the major contributor to the overexpression of IFN inducible genes in peripheral blood. Higgs, B. W. et al. Although leucocytes produce IFN, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs or pDCs) are the main producers; they produce 100-200 times more IFN than any other cell type. It is thought that PDCs can produce such high amounts of IFN because they constitutively express Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) actively produce IFN-\u03b1 in response to endogenous TLR ligands derived from chronic inflammation, which can result in a type 1 IFN gene signature.","Experiments disclosed herein reveal, in part, that PI3 kinase inhibitors (e.g., Compound 292) can effectively modulate (e.g., inhibit or enhance) production of cytokines\/chemokines (e.g., IFN-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and\/or TNF-\u03b1) that are induced by various TLR ligands and are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies (e.g., dermatomyositis). At least in part for this reason, it is expected that PI3 kinase inhibitors (e.g., PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors) are effective in the treatment of inflammatory myopathies.","As used herein, the term \u201cinflammatory myopathy\u201d (or \u201cinflammatory myopathies\u201d) encompasses acute and chronic inflammatory muscle diseases and includes idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (e.g., polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis, giant cell myositis, eosinophilic myositis, focal\/localized myositis, granulomatous myositis, macrophagic myofasciitis, pipestem capillary disease) as well as inflammatory myopathies caused by or associated with allergic reactions, other diseases (e.g., cancer, connective tissue disease), exposure to a drug or toxin (e.g., cocaine, heroin, cimetidine, penicillamine, adulterated rapeseed oil, amiodarone, L-tryptophan, colchicines, statins, quinidine, or phenylbutazone), or exposure to an infectious agent (e.g., a virus, bacterium, fungus, protozoan, cestode, or nematode). There is evidence that some inflammatory myopathies are autoimmune myopathies (e.g., dermatomyositis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathies). As used herein, \u201cdermatomyositis\u201d includes all forms of dermatomyositis, including amyopathic dermatomyositis (dermatomyositis without muscle symptoms or without overt muscle symptoms).","In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.","The inflammatory myopathy can be an acute inflammatory myopathy or a chronic inflammatory myopathy.","In some embodiments, the inflammatory myopathy is a chronic inflammatory myopathy (e.g., a myositis, e.g., dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or inclusion body myositis).","In some embodiments, the inflammatory myopathy is caused by an allergic reaction, another disease (e.g., cancer or a connective tissue disease), exposure to a toxic substance, a medicine, or an infectious agent (e.g., a virus).

The \u201cshawl sign\u201d is a splotchy rash, which may develop over the neck and upper chest and back in the pattern of a shawl. The rash in DM can be accompanied by calcium deposits that occur as hard lumps beneath the skin known as Gottron papules, which are frequently found on bony prominenences (e.g., those on the knuckles, elbow, knees, toes, and feet). The rash in DM can be itchy (e.g., a pruritic rash, e.g., utricaria). The rash may appear scaly, appear as white plaques on the insides of the cheeks, and\/or as thickening on the palms of the hands (mechanic's hands). Initially, symptoms of DM may be limited to cutaneous manifestations. Muscle weakness typically begins in the proximal muscles (those closest to the trunk of the body) and may progress to distal muscles as the disease progresses.","Biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies (e.g., dermatomyositis) include, e.g., altered (e.g., increased) levels of cytokines (e.g., Type I interferons (e.g., IFN-\u03b1 and\/or IFN-\u03b2), interleukins (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, IL-15, IL-17 and IL-18), and TNF-\u03b1), TGF-\u03b2, B-cell activating factor (BAFF), and overexpression of IFN inducible genes (e.g., Type I IFN inducible genes).","In certain embodiments, the symptom associated with inflammatory myopathy is an elevated level or increased biological activity of one or more of the following: IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, IL-10, TGF\u03b2, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-15.","In some embodiments, decreasing or inhibiting the inflammatory myopathy comprises inhibiting (e.g., decreasing a level of, or decreasing a biological activity of) one or more of IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, IL-10, TGF\u03b2, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-15 in the subject or in a sample derived from the subject.","Other biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies can include, e.g., an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), an elevated level of muscle enzymes (e.g., creatine kinase, aldolase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), electromyographic abnormalities, elevated rheumatoid factor, and\/or presence of autoantibodies, e.g., anti-synthetase autoantibodies (e.g., anti-Job, anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12, anti-EJ, anti-OJ, anti-JS, anti-KS, anti-ZO, anti-YRS), anti-signal recognition particle antibodies (anti-SRP), anti-RNP antibodies, anti-nuclear autoantigen antibodies (e.g., Mi-2 antibodies), anti-p155 antibodies, anti-PM\/Sci antibodies, anti-CADM-140, anti-SAE (small ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme), anti-p155\/140 and anti-p140.

As shown in , PI3K inhibition by Compound 292 inhibits induction of IFN-\u03b1 via TLR9. TLR9 is a nucleotide-sensing TLR; and functions as a receptor for viral and bacterial nucleic acids, as well as cellular danger or stress signals, e.g., acute phase reactants. In addition to the recognition of foreign nucleic acids, TLR9 has been shown to recognize self nucleic acid complexes in inflammatory myopathies, such as lupus. As stated above, biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies (e.g., lupus) can include increased levels of TLR 9 signaling induced cytokines such as IFN-\u03b1. The potent inhibition of the TLR9-induced IFN-\u03b1 signaling pathway by Compound 292 indicates Compound 292 can be used to prevent or treat disorders where the IFN-\u03b1 or a TLR (e.g., TLR9) signaling pathway is altered, (e.g., increased). Examples of such disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory myopathies, lupus, cutaneous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis.","In other embodiments, an altered level (e.g., increased) of TLR 9-induced cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1, can be used as a biomarker to select patients for treatment with Compound 292. For example, a subject, e.g., a patient suffering from an inflammatory myopathy, e.g., lupus, cutaneous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic scleroderma, or dermatomyositis, can be screened for expression of TLR 9 induced cytokine expression, and\/or IFN-\u03b1; based on the cytokine expression profile, the subject selected or not selected for treatment with Compound 292. Other embodiments include, screening a subject, e.g., a patient diagnosed with lupus, for expression of IFN-\u03b1, if the subject expresses an increased level of IFN-\u03b1 as compared to a reference value (e.g., a reference standard), the subject is then selected for treatment with Compound 292.","A gene signature characteristic of a type I interferon response commonly activated in rheumatic diseases can also be evaluated. Rheumatic diseases that can be evaluated can include, but are not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic scleroderma (e.g., as described in Higgs et al. Ann Rheum Dis (2011) 70: 2029-2036). The gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more genes involved in a type I interferon induced response, e.g., IF16, RSAD2, STAT2, IFI44, LIPA, IFI44L and IFI27 (e.g., as described in Higgs et al 2011, supra).","In an embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: type I IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, or GM-CSF (e.g., as described in Higgs et al. (2012) 15: 25-35). In one embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of the following: IFN-\u03b1 serum levels of high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), C3a, or dsDNA (e.g., as described in Ruan et al. (2010) 185: 4213-4222). In an embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: inflammatory cytokines, e.g., type I IFNs, type II IFNs, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1; immunomodulatory cytokines, e.g., IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2; IL-21, IL-17, or IL-2 (e.g., as described in Ohl et al. (2011) Article ID: 432595).","Any combination of the aforementioned genes can be used to evaluate a subject. In one embodiment, the levels, e.g., expression, of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or more than fifteen of: IFN-\u03b1, type I IFNs, type II IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21, GM-CSF, TGF-\u03b2, IF16, RSAD2, STAT2, IFI44, LIPA, IFI44L or IFI27 can be evaluated. In another embodiment, the levels, e.g., expression, of one or more of: IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-8. In one embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of level (e.g., expression) of IL-17; for example, one or more of: IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, or IL-17 can be evaluated.","The ICvalues for selected compounds were determined and are provided in Table 3.

(p110\u03b1\/p85\u03b1, p110\u03b2\/p85\u03b1, p110\u03b4\/p85\u03b1 from Upstate, and p110\u03b3 from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgC12), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 \u03bcg\/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 \u03bcCi of \u03b3-32P-ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 \u03bcM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 \u03bcl 1N HCl followed by 160 \u03bcl CHCl:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl3. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 \u03bcM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.","Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and\/or agonists of PI3-Ks including but not limited to PI 3-Kinase \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b4, and \u03b3. An exemplary system is PI 3-Kinase (human) HTRF\u2122 Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtitre plate (e.g., a 384 well microtitre plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20 ul per well. In the first step, each well receives 2 ul of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5 ul of a kinase\/PIP2 mixture (diluted in 1\u00d7 reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3 ug\/ml kinase and 10 uM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5 ul of ATP (diluted in 1\u00d7 reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5 ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism\u00ae 5.","The PI3K inhibitory activity of Compound 292 was tested in several assays described herein. Overall, Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b4 activity at lower doses compared to other PI3Ks (e.g., at least 10-fold lower dose compared to PI3K-\u03b3, PI3K-\u03b2 or PI3K-\u03b1).","In one exemplary assay tested, Compound 292 inhibited PI3K-\u03b4 activity at lower doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 0.5 nM to 10 nM, typically about 1 nM to 5 nM. For example, Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b3activity at higher doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 20 nM to 40 nM. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b2 activity at higher doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 70 nM to 90 nM. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b2 activity at higher doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 1500 nM to 2 \u03bcM.","In another exemplary assay tested, Compound 292 inhibited PI3K-\u03b4 activity at lower doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 50 nM to 100 nM. For example, Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b3activity at higher doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 1 \u03bcM to 5 \u03bcM. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K-\u03b2 activity at higher doses, e.g., an ICin the range of about 2 \u03bcM to 10 \u03bcM.

As shown in Example 6, PI3K inhibition by Compound 292 inhibits induction of IFN-\u03b1 via TLR9. TLR9 is a nucleotide-sensing TLR; and functions as a receptor for viral and bacterial nucleic acids, as well as cellular danger or stress signals, e.g., acute phase reactants. In addition to the recognition of foreign nucleic acids, TLR9 has been shown to recognize self nucleic acid complexes in inflammatory myopathies, such as lupus. As stated above, biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies (e.g., lupus) can include increased levels of TLR 9 signaling-induced cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1. The potent inhibition of the TLR9-induced IFN-\u03b1 signaling pathway by Compound 292 indicates that Compound 292 can be used to prevent or treat disorders where the IFN-\u03b1 or a TLR (e.g., TLR9) signaling pathway is altered (e.g., increased). Examples of such disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory myopathies, lupus, cutaneous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis.","In other embodiments, an altered level (e.g., increased) of TLR 9-induced cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b1, can be used as a biomarker to select a patient for treatment with Compound 292. For example, a subject, e.g., a patient suffering from an inflammatory myopathy (e.g., lupus, cutaneous lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic scleroderma, or dermatomyositis), can be screened for the level (e.g., expression) of TLR 9-induced cytokine expression and\/or IFN-\u03b1. Based on the cytokine expression profile, the subject can be selected or not selected for treatment with Compound 292. Other embodiments include, screening a subject, e.g., a patient diagnosed with lupus, for the level (e.g., expression) of IFN-\u03b1, if the subject expresses an increased level of IFN-\u03b1 as compared to a reference value (e.g., a reference standard), the subject is then selected for treatment with Compound 292.","A gene signature characteristic of a type I interferon response commonly activated in rheumatic diseases can also be evaluated. Rheumatic diseases evaluated can include, but are not limited to, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic scleroderma (e.g., as described in Higgs et al. (2011) 70: 2029-2036). The gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more genes involved in a type I interferon induced response, e.g., one or more of IFI6, RSAD2, STAT2, IFI44, LIPA, IFI44L or IFI27 (e.g., as described in Higgs et al 2011, supra).","In one embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: type I IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, or GM-CSF (e.g., as described in Higgs et al. (2012) 15: 25-35). In an embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: IFN-\u03b1 serum levels of high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), C3a, or dsDNA (e.g., as described in Ruan et al.

In an embodiment, the gene signature can include analysis of the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: inflammatory cytokines, e.g., type I IFNs, type II IFNs, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1; immunomodulatory cytokines, e.g., IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2; IL-21, IL-17, or IL-2 (e.g., as described in Ohl et al.

In one exemplary embodiment, the level (e.g., expression) of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen or more than fifteen of the following genes: IFN-\u03b1, type I IFNs, type II IFNs, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-21, GM-CSF, TGF-\u03b2, IF16, RSAD2, STAT2, IFI44, LIPA, IFI44L or IFI27 can be evaluated. In another embodiment, the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of the following IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or IL-8 can be evaluated. In yet another embodiment, the gene signature can further include analysis of IL-17; for example, the level (e.g., expression) of one or more of: IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, or IL-17 can be evaluated.","The murine NZB\/W F1 lupus model was used to investigate the efficacy of Compound 292 administered orally (PO) in the treatment of lupus. The murine NZB\/W F1 lupus model has many features of human lupus, and is characterized by elevated levels of anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA autoantibodies; a critical role for plasmacytoid dendritic cells and IFN-\u03b1; T-cell, B-cell, macrophage involvement; pheymolytic anemia; progressive immune complex glomerulonephritis; proteinurea; severity and incidence more pronounced in females; and decreased survival.

Compound 292 is therefore expected to be efficiacious in treating human lupus, including, e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus and mitigating associated signs and symptoms of lupus, e.g., glomerulonephritis, proteinuria, anti-dsDNA autoantibodies, and spleen inflammation.","A compound's efficacy in treating scleroderma can be tested using animal models. An exemplary animal model is a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin (\u201cBLM\u201d) described, for example, in Yamamoto et al., \u201cAnimal Model of Sclerotic skin I: Local Injection of Bleomycin Induce Sclerotic Skin Mimicking Scleroderma, 112: 456-462 (1999), the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. This mouse model provides dermal sclerosis that closely resembles systemic sclerosis both histologically and biochemically. The sclerotic changes observed in the model include, but are not limited to: thickened and homogenous collagen bundles and cellular filtrates; gradual increase in number of mast cells; degranulation of mast cells; elevated histamine release; increase in hydroxyproline in skin; presence of anti-nuclear antibody in serum; and strong expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2-2 mRNA. Therefore, efficacy of a compound in treating scleroderma can be assessed by monitoring the lessening of one or more of these changes.","Briefly, the following exemplary procedures can be used to generate the mouse model for scleroderma: Specific pathogen-free, female BALB\/C mice and C3H mice of 6 weeks old, weighing about 20 g, are purchased and maintained with food and water ad libitum. BLM is dissolved in PBS at differing concentrations and sterilized with filtration. Aliquots of each concentration of BLM or PBS are injected subcutaneously into the shaved back of the mice daily for 1-4 weeks with a needle. Alternatively, mice are injected every other day.","Histolopathological and biochemical changes induced can be assessed using any methods commonly practiced in the field. For example, histopathological changes can be assessed using a standard avidine-biotin peroxidase technique with anti-L3T4 monoclonal antibody, anti-Lyt2 monoclonal antibody, anti-mouse pan-tissue-fixed macrophage antibody, anti-stem cell factor monoclonal antibody, anti-transforming growth factor-\u03b2polyclonal antibody, and anti-decorin antibody. Cytokine expression of cellular infiltrates can be assessed by using several anti-cytokine antibodies. Hydroxyproline level can be assessed by hydrolyzing skin pieces with hydrochloric acid, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and colorimetrically assessing the hydrolates at 560 nm with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Pepsin-resistant collagen can be assessed by treating collagen sample extracted from biopsied tissues and analyzing by polyacrylamide stacking gel electrophoresis. Mast cells can be identified by toluidine blue, and cells containing matachromatic granules can be counted under high magnification of a light microscope. Serum levels of various cytokines can be assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels of the cytokines can be assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autoantibodies in serum can be detected using 3T3 fibroblasts as the substrate for the screening.","Effects of Compound 292 on treating inflammation was investigated in a 28 day semi-therapeutic mouse EAE model.","EAE Induction","EAE was induced in 60 mice using Hooke Kit\u2122 MOG\/CFA Emulsion PTX (Hooke Laboratories, Lawrence Mass.), catalog number EK-0110, lot number 0104, per manufacturer's recommended protocol, except that pertussis toxin was diluted with phosphate buffered saline to achieve 1.4\u00d7 and 1.3\u00d7 solution (starting from the 1.5\u00d7 solution in the kit). This was done to optimize disease severity for this particular study.","Mice were injected subcutaneously, at two sites in the back, with the emulsion component of the kit (containing MOG). One site of injection was in the area of the upper back, approximately 1 cm caudal of the neck line. The second site was in the area of the lower back, approximately 2 cm cranial of the base of the tail. Injection volume was 0.1 mL at each site. Within 2 hours of the injection of emulsion, and then again 24 hours after the injection of emulsion, the pertussis toxin component of the kit was administered intraperitoneally. Volume of each injection was 0.1 mL.","Groups and Treatment","EAE was induced in 60 mices, which were divided into six groups with 10 mice in each group: Group 1\u2014Vehicle, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg (negative control); Group 2\u2014FTY720, 3 mg\/kg, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg (positive control); Group 3\u2014Compound 292, 0.3 mg\/kg, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg; Group 4\u2014Compound 292, 1 mg\/kg, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg; Group 5\u2014Compound 292, 3 mg\/kg, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg; and Group 6\u2014Compound 292, 10 mg\/kg, p.o., QD, 5 mL\/kg. Vehicle for Group 2 (FTY720) was water and 2% ethanol. Vehicle for all other groups was water, 0.5% CMC (low viscosity), and 0.05% Tween80. Mice were dosed at the same time every day, +\/\u22121 hour. The last day of dosing was Day 27 after immunization.","Scoring and Readout","Readouts were EAE scores and changes in body weight. Mice were scored daily from Day 7 to Day 28, and body weights were measured three times\/week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday), starting on Day-1.","EAE was scored on scale 0 to 5:\n\n","In-between scores were assigned when the clinical signs fell between two above defined scores.","Tissue Collection","At the end of the study, the following tissues were collected:","Collection of Plasma for PK:","On Day 27, plasma was isolated from mice in Groups 3 through 6. Three mice from each group were bled at 30 minutes and 1 hour after the last dose of Compound 292. Plasma was isolated from another 3 in these groups at 4 hours, and from another 3 mice in these groups at 6 hours after the last dose of Compound 292. On Day 28, plasma was isolated from three mice in each of Groups 3 through 6 at trough. Blood was collected into EDTA tubes. The blood was placed at 4\u00b0 C. after collection and then centrifuged within 20 minutes of collection to separate plasma. Approximately 100 \u03bcL of plasma was collected from each sample and stored at \u221280 C immediately after collection.","Collection of Serum:","On Day 28, serum was isolated from all the mice in the study and from the na\u00efve mice. Blood was collected into Gel Clot Activator tubes, left at room temperature for 15-30 minutes, and then centrifuged for 5 minutes to separate serum. At least 100 \u03bcL of serum was collected from each sample and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C. immediately after collection.","Collection of Spines for Histological Analysis:","After the last collection of blood on Day 28, mice in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 6 and the 3 na\u00efve mice were sacrificed and immediately perfused with PBS. Spines were collected in buffered formalin for histological analysis.","Histological Analysis of Spines:","At the end of the study 3 luxol fast blue (LFB) stained sections and 3 H&E sections, from lumbar, thoracic, and cervical spinal cord of all mice in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 6 and the 3 na\u00efve mice were prepared and analyzed.","Count of Inflammatory Foci:","Inflammatory foci were counted in each H&E stained section. Each group of approximately 20 cells was counted as one focus. Foci larger than 20 cells were counted based on an estimate of how many foci of 20 cells were present.","Estimation of demyelination area: The demyelination score represents an estimate of demyelinated area for each section as follows. For LFB stained slides, the demyelinated area was estimated based on intensity of blue staining of myelin. For H&E stained sections, demyelinated area was estimated by looking for interruption of normal structure\u2014pallor and vacuolation consistent with edema and demyelination, and dilated axons.\n\n","Count of Apoptotic Cells:","The number of apoptotic cells in each of the three H&E sections was determined.","Results","EAE development was evaluated by comparing incidence, time to EAE onset, MMS, and EAE scores at the end of the study between the compound-treated groups and the vehicle-treated group (negative control) (Table 8, ).

Mice treated with CsA had significantly reduced colon edema (78%), inflammation (49%), gland loss (64%), erosion (100%), hyperplasia (76%), summed histopathology score (62%), PMN percent (70%), neutrophil score (81%), and mucosal thickness (74%). When compared to vehicle controls using a Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric), mice treated with 10 mg\/kg Compound 292 also had significantly reduced colon inflammation (17% reduction, p=0.005), gland loss (26%, p=0.004), erosion (94%, p=0.045), hyperplasia (45%, p=0.006), summed histopathology score (31%, p=0.001), and neutrophil score (45%, p=0.005); and mice treated with 3 mg\/kg Compound 292 had significantly reduced colon inflammation (19%, p=0.007), gland loss (24%, p=0.019), hyperplasia (37%, p=0.036), summed histopathology score (28%, p=0.013), neutrophils score (43%, p=0.013), and mucosal thickness (36%, p=0.051) (, , and ).","When considering only distal colon sections, mice treated with 10 mg\/kg Compound 292 had significantly (by ANOVA) reduced colon mucosal thickness (46%) as compared to vehicle controls. Mice treated with 3 mg\/kg Compound 292 had significantly reduced hyperplasia (61%), summed histopathology score (52%), PMN percent (56%), neutrophil score (66%), and mucosal thickness (64%). Mice treated with CsA had significantly reduced colon inflammation (38%), gland loss (56%), hyperplasia (62%), summed histopathology score (52%), PMN percent (65%), neutrophil score (77%), and mucosal thickness (69%). When compared to vehicle controls using a Mann-Whitney U test, mice treated with 10 mg\/kg Compound 292 also had significantly reduced colon inflammation (28% reduction, p=0.032), gland loss (39%, p=0.025), hyperplasia (46%, p=0.044), and summed histopathology score (38%, p=0.031); and mice treated with 3 mg\/kg Compound 292 had significantly reduced colon inflammation (42%, p=0.004) and gland loss (52%, p=0.010) (, , and ).","Results of this study indicate that daily, oral dosing of mice with Compound 292 (3 or 10 mg\/kg) had significant beneficial effect on the clinical and histopathology parameters associated with CD4 inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment with 1 mg\/kg Compound 292 significantly reduced colon weight.","While exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only.
