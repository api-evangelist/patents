No. 12\/352,827 entitled, Analytic Measurement of Online Social Media Content, and U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/353,096 entitled, Displaying Analytic Measurement of Online Social Media Content in a Graphical User Interface, concurrently filed on Jan. 13, 2008 and assigned to the corporate assignee of the present invention.","At least certain embodiments of the invention relate generally to information management, and more particularly to modeling networks in online social media.","Traditional methods of collecting, managing and providing real-time or near real-time relevant information have been enhanced through the use of the Internet and online research and information collection tools. One such set of tools is known as web analytics. Web analytics focus on a company's own website for collection of online information, particularly traffic data. Web analytics are limited because they only consider a subset of the relevant online universe, specifically the behavior of users of a given website. They do not discover other information about the users such as interests and opinions expressed in interactive systems. Behavioral analytics are another set of information collection and management tools that attempts to analyze the \u201cclick stream\u201d of users and show advertisements based on this information. However, this method has many technical limitations since it tends to provide only a very limited picture of a user's overall interests. Also there is a lack of consolidation between a user's work and home PCs.","Online social media is a new source of valuable information on the Internet that may be harvested to generate information and other data about products or services, branding, competition, and industries. Online social media encompasses online media such as blogs and sub-blogs, online discussion forums, social networks, wiki sites such as Wikipedia, online reviews on e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com\u00ae, video sites such as YouTube\u00ae, micro-blogging services such as Twitter\u00ae, and so on. There are currently over 106 million blogs growing at a rate of 11% per year. There are several million forums with active contributions by more than 33% of Internet users. There are 483 million users of social networks worldwide growing at a rate of 47% annually. As a result, social media is becoming a crucial and rapidly growing source of consumer opinion. This information may allow users to quantify opinion on social media sites to gain useful insights into current consumer sentiment and trends relating to their products or services, brands, and\/or technologies, and those of their competitors. Collecting and presenting this information can help users in a variety of ways such as, for example, target advertising revenues and expenditures, marketing, sales, customer service, brand management, product development, investor relations, and so on. Social networking sites are currently trying to leverage their own user profiles to target advertising based on their users' behavior and declared interests. However, most users today participate in several different online social media sites. Online content analytics are another set of information collection tools that attempts to analyze content in social media sites such as online forums, blogs, and so on. However, these techniques require a high degree of manual human intervention by analysts. Additionally, the reports generated by these analysts can be very expensive and can't be updated very frequently due to the necessity of human intervention in the data gathering and analysis process.","At least certain embodiments disclose methods, apparatuses, and computer-readable media for generating a social network graph to model one or more social networks of related authors of online social media and their corresponding posts of online social media conversations relevant to subject matter of interest in a category. Embodiments are configured for harvesting and aggregating posts of online social media conversations from one or more online social media sources; performing content scraping on the posts of online social media conversations to obtain raw data including user-profile information of a social media author corresponding to each individual post of online social media conversations; and performing social network analysis processing on the raw data to obtain the social network graph.","Throughout the description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to avoid obscuring the underlying principles of embodiments of the invention.","At least certain embodiments disclose methods, apparatuses, and computer-readable media for generating a social network graph to model one or more social networks of related authors of online social media and their corresponding posts of online social media conversations relevant to subject matter of interest in a category. Embodiments are configured for harvesting and aggregating posts of online social media conversations from one or more online social media sources; performing content scraping on the posts of online social media conversations to obtain raw data including user-profile information of a social media author corresponding to each individual post of online social media conversations; and performing social network analysis processing on the raw data to obtain the social network graph.","Embodiments provide analytic measurement of online social media content for users such as global enterprises, advertising agencies, sales and marketing departments, media companies, government agencies, and virtually any entity requiring real-time or near real-time access to such information. This online social media content is quantified and provided in a relevant and user-friendly manner to these entities using an interface such as a graphical user interface (GUI). These embodiments provide both historical and current measurements to enable analysis of past and present information. Online social media content is harvested, sorted, and provided to relevant groups or entities. Certain embodiments describe a social media analytics platform for collecting and converting raw online social media conversations into actionable information that can be used to increase the top-line growth and margins of its recipients. Additionally, this aggregation of social media information can be analyzed to determine trends in each of the above discussed categories.","Monitoring and aggregating this new information source may be used on its own or in conjunction with traditional research and measurements such as, for example, quantitative and qualitative market research, paid media tracking, and traditional web site analytics. This process is automated so that qualitative measurements can be aggregated, quantified, and presented with minimal human intervention. At least certain embodiments contemplate a harvesting process referred to herein as \u201cscraping\u201d where social media sources are discovered or located and exploited for relevant information. The content is then aggregated and quantified in a manner relevant to the industry or other category. The aggregated and quantified online social media content is then provided to the user of the social media analytics (SMA) platform in an efficient, timely and user-friendly manner using the interface. In one embodiment, the interface is user-specific.","Examples of the quantitative online social media content data that can be provided by embodiments include: brand and product\/service sentiment for users and their competition; the share of voice of the brand (e.g., volume of discussion about the brand, product or service) over the social media versus the competition; topics and keywords used by online discussion participants for the brand and the competition; information on the opinion leaders for the category (e.g., online social content authors with the most influential voices); top websites resulting from the brand search; automated alerts for changes in sentiment; keywords, terms or phrases in posts to the online social media websites; and much more. This information is aggregated, quantified, and provided to users in real-time or near-real-time for the purpose of, for example, marketing, public relations, advertising, sales, customer service, brand management, product development, investor relations, and so on. The result of this process is to provide highly relevant and timely actionable information to users of the SMA platform.","This information may be advantageous for several reasons including brand and product\/service perception or sentiment analysis, trend recognition and opportunity identification, early warnings about customer service or quality issues, opinion leader identification and engagement, competitor monitoring, and optimized online advertising to name a few. This information allows users to quantify opinion on social media sites to gain insights into current consumer sentiment about the users' products or services, brands, and technologies and those of their competitors. This information also enables users of the SMA platform to recognize trends in consumer buzz about new technologies, product or service types, and attributes. In addition, users may receive early-warning signs to identify dissatisfied customers. Users also may identify and target opinion leaders for a given product\/service or category using this information. Embodiments of the SMA platform can also supplies users with a list of highly relevant websites where high-affinity users are exchanging opinions and making purchasing decisions. This information can also be made widely available inside users' organizations using an interface to push analytics to potentially everyone inside the organization instead of just the top-level marketing staff enabling entire organizations to establish an overall better sense of the voice of their customers and to make informed decisions at the customer level because embodiments focus on the social behavior of potential customers using online social media sources and provide far better insight into commercially relevant interests.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0056","num":"0055"},"figref":"FIG. 1A","b":["199","100","300","700","100","199"]},"The harvesting layer  of  includes online social media sources discovered or located on the Internet  including social media source _, social media source _, social media source _, and so on through social media source N_. Vertical layer  of SMA platform  is where the online social media content relevant to each industry is aggregated, quantified, and stored in a database. In the illustrated embodiment, Industry1-specific data aggregation and quantification  receives content from social media source _ and social media source _ of harvesting layer , industry2-specific data aggregation and quantification  receives content from social media source _ , social media source _ , and social media source N_, and industryN-specific data aggregation and quantification  receives content from social media source N_. For every identified source, relevant social media content is retrieved and processed.","The vertical layer  stores the aggregated and quantified online social media content in a database and supplies the content to the presentation layer  for display. Presentation layer  of  includes user-specific web user interface  for display of the aggregated and quantified online social media content received from vertical layer . Presentation layer  also includes a web service application programming interface (API) to provide fully automated data integration into third-party analytics or data presentation systems, and a user-specific alerter  to provide alerts relating to changes in online social media sentiment. The user-specific alerter  may be tailored for each user of the SMA platform .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 1B","FIG. 2"],"b":["100","100","200","200","127","201","127","101","127","131","129","131","203"]},"At operation  the scraping process is performed including scouring the identified online social media sources for conversations relevant to a particular sector or other category and breaking down the content into pieces to be stored for later processing. The scraping process starts at an overview page typically provided by each social media source and identifies hyperlinks to potentially relevant subpages and content pages based on the structural properties of these hyperlinks. The process then iteratively drills down multiple levels of subpages in the same manner until a specific relevant discussion thread is found. Each discussion thread is then analyzed in order to isolate its atomic content components for further processing. For example, a particular relevant social media source (e.g., website) may have a web page with a thread containing 20 different posts relating to the Audi A6 automobile. In such a case, the web page would be retrieved and broken apart into 20 pieces, with each piece stored individually along with the user-profile information of the authors who posted the content.","The results of the scraping process include: the raw conversations of each social media post referred to as the raw post content data; the metadata of the raw post content; and information relating to the author of each post, as well as relationships between authors, referred to as the raw social graph data. The raw post content retrieved from the online social media sources is stored in raw content storage  (operation ). This includes the actual text of the relevant social media post. The raw content metadata is also stored in raw content metadata storage  (operation ). The raw content metadata includes information such as the URL of the social media website, and the length, context, and time of the post. Additionally, the raw social graph data is stored in raw social graph data storage  (operation ). This data may include the social media post's author profile data such as the author's username, demographic information, number of posts to the social media website, those responding to the author's posts, and the author's contacts.","In the illustrated embodiment, the social network analysis (SNA) processing is then performed on the raw social graph data stored in raw social graph data storage  (operation ). Here, information on each author of a social media post and on those responding to the author's post is retrieved from the raw social graph storage  and used to generate a social graph which includes an aggregation of social network information that can be useful in several contexts. For example, the social graph data may be analyzed to determine information about the author's social network including which authors are communicating about what topics, who is responding to which posts, what the related content is, and so on. The SNA processing is used to develop this information on networks of related authors and posts and to determine which authors are the most influential within these networks based on the social graph. The SNA processing first calculates a so-called centrality value for each author that expresses the author's degree of influence in a given social network. Authors that are connected to a large number of other authors and also connected to distinct sub-groups of authors are assumed to have higher influence than less well-connected authors. In order to calculate the centrality value, a version of Brandes' Betweenness Centrality algorithm is applied to the raw social graph for each website. The resulting raw centrality value is then modified with the activity level of the author, i.e. the number of posts written by this person, and an importance score for the website where that author is active. Within graph theory and network analysis, there are various measures of the centrality of a vertex within a graph that determine the relative importance of a vertex within the graph. Betweenness is a centrality measure of a vertex within a graph. Vertices that occur on many shortest paths between other vertices have higher betweenness than those that do not. For instance, an influential author on a large website such as MySpace\u00ae will receive a higher influence score than the author of a little known blog. In at least one embodiment, the influence score for each author is calculated by the following formula:\n\nInfluence score=*()*(), where\n\n","The SNA processing also provides information including: the websites on which each of the social media authors have contributed; registrations in social networks; the status of influence of the authors; the author's sentiment towards a given brand, product or service; known demographic and geographic information about the authors; and trends in all of the above.","The social graph is then stored in social graph storage  (operation ). An additional input into the social graph storage  is from user-profile scraping data accumulated from the Internet  using user-profile scraping module . At operation , the user profile scraping module  scours the Internet  to find any other information about the authors of the online social media conversations. Whatever information associated with the author that can be harvested from the Internet  is collected and stored along with the social graph in social graph storage  (operation ). This completes the harvesting layer process  according to an exemplary embodiment.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0068"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"],"b":["100","300","300","300","400","400"]},"Process A begins with receiving data  at processing module  from storage (operation ). The data  received from storage is the output data  from  including the raw content data from raw content data storage , the raw content metadata from raw content metadata storage , and the social graph data from social graph storage . Process A continues with performing text edge processing on the raw content data from raw content data storage  and the raw content metadata from raw content metadata storage  (operation ). Text edge processing is performed using text edge processing module  of processing module . Text edge processing, in one embodiment, utilizes graph theory to analyze the terms and concepts contained within the online social media conversations to determine the frequency of occurrence of these terms and concepts in conjunction with the relevant brand, product or service and the relatedness of the concepts and\/or terms in the post to that brand, product or service. Relationships between these terms are analyzed to determine graph edges which indicate the strength of these relationships. In a first step, a relevant sentence is parsed and split up into individual words and tuples of adjacent words. Stop words with little informational value such as \u201cof,\u201d \u201cit,\u201d \u201cis\u201d and so on are excluded in this step. Next, the relationship between the main term of interest (e.g. a brand, service or product name) and each found word or tuple is stored.  illustrates text edge parsing for an individual sentence according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the sentence, \u201c[t]he Audi A6 is a very fast car with a great engine,\u201d is parsed to determine relationships between the main terms of interest (Audi  and Audi A6 ) and each found word or tuple in the sentence (A6 , fast , car , fast car , great , engine , and great engine ). In , the lines between the main terms of interest and each found word or tuple indicate that such a relationship exists. Each relationship is then counted as one instance of an \u201cedge\u201d between these connected objects. In the following aggregation step, the number of edges between objects is added up. The resulting frequency of edge occurrences is an indication of how closely two terms are connected. For instance, if the tuple \u201cfast car\u201d is used significantly more frequently in connection with car brand A than with car brand B (corrected by the total number of posts about each brand), we can assume that social media users perceive car brand A as a stronger producer of fast cars.  illustrates an excerpt from an aggregated term graph according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The number of edges between brands (brand A , brand B , and brand C ) and each found word or tuple (fast , car , fast car , great , engine , and great engine ) are added up to determine the frequency of edge occurrences. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, brand A  has a total of n=3,983 edge occurrences with respect to the tuple \u201cfast car .\u201d In contrast, brand B  only has n=2664 edge occurrences with respect to the tuple \u201cfast car .\u201d Thus, from the fact that the tuple fast car  is used significantly more frequently in connection with brand A  than with brand B  (corrected by the total number of posts for each brand), we can assume that social media users perceive brand A  as a stronger producer of fast cars than brand B . The data resulting from text edge processing module  of processing module  is then stored in text edge storage  (operation ).","Sentiment rating processing is then performed using sentiment rating processing module  on the raw content data stored in raw content data storage , the raw content metadata stored in raw content metadata storage , and the social graph information stored in social graph storage  (operation ). Sentiment rating processing includes analyzing the actual text of online social media conversations to find keywords, terms or phrases to determine if a particular post refers to the particular brand, product or service of interest. This helps to determine the sentiment about the brand, product or service. The input to sentiment rating processing module  includes the actual text of the social media post, lists of keywords, and so on. Industry-specific keywords are identified and a value or sentiment rating is assigned to each of these keywords. In at least certain embodiments, this processing includes natural language and sentence structure analysis to determine which parts of the text of a social media post apply to the particular brand, product or service. Once the keywords are identified, they are processed using a number of factors including how many times the keyword appears in the social media post, the closeness and linguistic context of the keyword in relation to the brand, product or service, and whether the keyword reflects a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about the brand, product or service. This processing may also require balancing opposing keywords (e.g., both positive and negative keywords in the same post) to determine an overall sentiment rating of how positive, negative, or neutral the social media post is in relation to a brand, product or service.","Keywords are assigned with a positive and negative probability value each that express the probability that the keyword means something positive or negative in the context of the specific vertical. Since the same word can have different meanings per industry or topic, these probabilities can be specifically set per vertical. Also, some embodiments include a training or feedback loop where keywords may be re-rated over time based on experience. During the processing, terms of interest (brands, products, service names) and their synonyms are identified in the text of the social media post. In a next step, the environment (the closest n words) of this occurrence is searched for relevant sentiment keywords that might refer to the term of interest. Linguistic elements such as negations, comparatives, or enumerations are taken into account when determining the relevance of a sentiment keyword for the term of interest. Each occurrence of the term of interest is assigned with a sentiment score depending on the keywords in the environment, the linguistic modifiers present, the proximity of the keyword to the term of interest, and potentially reduced confidence due to ambiguities. Finally these atomic scores are added up for the whole post and corrected by the relevance of the post for the term of interest, i.e. the percentage of the post that actually refers to the term of interest.","This information is then combined with the social graph data from social graph storage  to determine a weighting factor of the social media post. That is, the sentiment rating processing of operation  takes into consideration the level of influence the author of the social media post has in determining the sentiment rating. A weighting factor is determined based on the influence of the author of the social media post. The resulting data from sentiment rating processing module  is then stored in the sentiment rating storage  (operation ). Additionally, the sentiment rating data stored in sentiment rating storage  is aggregated over time in the sentiment aggregation queue  for sentiment trend processing to be discussed infra. This completes process A according to an exemplary embodiment and control flows to process B of . In short, the sentiment rating is generated using a combination of natural language processing, statistical processing, positive\/negative keyword modifiers and author and site influence.","Process B begins at operation  where data from storage is received at processing module  from storage. The data received from storage includes the social graph data  output from social graph storage  of , the data from text edge storage , the data from sentiment rating storage , and the data from sentiment aggregation queue . At operation , volume trend processing is performed on the data from storage using volume trend processing module  of . The overall volume of opinions about users' brands, products or services is calculated and trends over time can be determined based on volume trend processing. Additionally, volume trends about competing brands and products or services can be provided in this operation. Basic volume is calculated using the number of occurrences of a brand, product or service name and its synonyms per unit of time (e.g., day, month, or year). The content authored in each unit of time is searched for the terms of interest, and the number of occurrences is added up per unit of time and per term. When plotted in a time series, these volume data points describe the volume trend for the brand, product or service. At operation , text trend processing is performed on the data. The text trend processing analyzes the text edge information stored in text edge storage  in conjunction with time information to determine text trends over time. This processing is used to determine how sentiment changes over time. At operation , sentiment aggregation processing is performed on the sentiment rating and aggregation data from storage using sentiment aggregation processing module  of . The sentiment aggregation processing module  determines the aggregation of sentiment over time for various sources (or groups of sources) such as relevant websites, blogs, My Space\u00ae pages, and et cetera. This information may then be used to compare online social media sources to determine which sources are more favorable for advertising a user's brands, products, or services. For example, this processing may determine a particular user's products or services are better advertised on My Space\u00ae instead of topic-specific blogs. Additionally, information can be gathered regarding which websites are initially more relevant for product releases, for example, and which websites are more relevant over time. This allows users of the SMA platform to follow these trends and to roll-out or switch advertising campaigns based on this information. Process B continues with opinion leader aggregation processing using opinion leader aggregation processing module  of  on the data from storage (operation ). The opinion leader aggregation processing module  determines the aggregation of opinion leader data over time to determine trends in opinion leader data. This information may be valuable to users by enabling them to identify and target social media authors with the most influence to enter into conversations with these lead authors and influence their opinion to influence the opinions of many others.","At least certain embodiments include additional external data processing (operation ). For example, sales data may be included in the trend processing using sales data processing module , traffic data may be included in the trend processing using traffic data processing module , and demographics data may be included in the trend processing using demographics processing . Sales data processing module  allows users to correlate the sales data with sentiment data over time. This can lead to predictions in sales volume data and pricing. Traffic data processing module  allows users to correlate the traffic data with sentiment data over time. Likewise, demographics processing  allows users to correlate demographics data with sentiment data over time. Other external data from users' database sources may also be included in the processing and correlated with sentiment data over time.","Process B continues with storing the results of the above processing in a database referred to herein as the vertical database (operation ), and sending this data as output data to the user interface  of the presentation layer  for display (operation ). Additionally, the results of the above processing are also output to the alert queue  for user alerts when sentiment trends change above or below a certain threshold, for example (operation ). This allows for constant, real-time monitoring of emerging trends and consumer sentiment. This completes the vertical layer processing according to an exemplary embodiment. Control flows to  where the output of the vertical layer  processing is fed into the presentation layer  for display to users of the SMA platform.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0073","num":"0076"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 6A"],"b":["500","300","500","705","700","500","600"]},"Process  begins with staging one or more search run definitions  for processing in search queue  (operation ). Search run definitions contain one or more brand or product names in combination with any number of other relevant keywords that a consumer might be searching for. One or more searches of the Internet  corresponding to the one or more search run definitions  staged in search queue  are then performed using one or more search engine APIs  (operation ). The results of these searches are fed into website and link scraping module . Website and link scraping is then performed (operation ) using the website and link scraping module . During this operation, the top websites filtering subsystem  actually goes into the websites found in the one or more searches and follows the website links within each of these websites. The websites found in the searches and the links within these websites is assembled for the purpose of attempting to model search engine users' behavior by determining which websites search engine users will likely visit when they run each of the one or more searches. In at least one embodiment, this information can provide users of the SMA platform with a list of websites with a high affinity for the users' industry or products\/services. This information may be useful in a variety of circumstances including allowing users to launch targeted advertising campaigns. For example, the top websites filtering subsystem  may run a search in Google for digital cameras and determine that a typical search engine user will only look at the first 3 web pages listed in the search results. The top websites filtering subsystem  will then follow the links in these 3 web pages to find more web pages and then follow the links in those web pages, and so on. The top websites filtering subsystem  will assemble this information and use it to build up a website and link network graph discussed below. The raw search result data resulting from website and link scraping module  is then stored in search result raw data storage  and the metadata is stored in search result raw metadata storage  (operation ) to be provided to processing module .","Process  continues with performing website graph processing (operation ). In at least one embodiment, the website graph processing includes using graph theory to analyze the website network to determine the frequency of occurrence of each website in the website network in connection with the relevant brand, product or service and to determine the relatedness of each website in the website network to that brand, product or service. Relationships between these websites and the relevant brand, product or service are analyzed to determine graph edges which indicate the strength of these relationships. First, links between websites that contain content relevant to the brand, product or service are counted. The number of links between two websites provides an indication of how strongly the two websites are interconnected.  illustrates an exemplary website link network according to one embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, website link network  includes three websites with links connecting to one another. In the example, there are two (2) connections between the websites Yahoo.com  and Edmunds.com  including a link from subpage 1 of Yahoo.com  to subpage 1 of Edmunds.com  and a link from subpage 3 of Yahoo.com  to subpage 3 of Edmunds.com . Likewise, there are four (4) connections between the websites Edmunds.com  and Autoblog.com  and two (2) connections between the websites Autoblog.com  and Yahoo.com  in the exemplary website link network . Once the number of links between each pair of websites is counted, a version of Brandes' Betweenness Centrality algorithm is applied to the resulting graph. This algorithm calculates centrality values that indicate how strongly connected a given website is to other relevant websites, either directly or indirectly. This is depicted in  which illustrates an excerpt from a website graph according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, website graph excerpt  includes lines representing \u201cedges\u201d where each \u201cedge\u201d is a connection between each pair of websites in the graph. Website A  is connected to website B , website D , website F , website G  and website I  within one (1) edge. Website A  is further connected to website C , website E  and website H  within two (2) edges. Therefore, website A  is connected to each other website within one or two edges, so it will receive a high centrality value in comparison to the other websites. Internet users that find any of the other websites in the graph when looking for information are very likely to end up on website A ; therefore, it is assumed that website A  is highly relevant to this graph. In this manner websites that are the most relevant to a particular user of the SMA platform are located.","The resulting website network graph generated by the website graph processing module  is then stored in website graph storage  (operation ) and the data  from the website graph storage  is output to the user interface  of the presentation layer  of  (operation ). Process  continues at operation  where website advertisement network processing is performed using website ad network processing module . The website advertisement network processing, in at least certain embodiments, uses typical link patterns to identify advertisement networks that put advertisements on the analyzed websites. Since each advertisement network uses a particular type of software to provide advertisement banners, sponsored text links or other forms of online advertising, the resulting link patterns identify each advertisement network. Each website might carry advertisements from one or multiple networks, or no advertising at all. The website advertisement network processing is performed to provide users of the SMA platform with information as to which advertisement networks are the most relevant for advertising their brands, products, or services. The resulting website advertisement network information generated by the website ad network processing module  is also stored in website graph storage  (operation ) and output to the user interface  of the presentation layer  in  (operation ). This completes the top websites filtering process  according to an exemplary embodiment. In short, the top websites filtering subsystem  is used to locate websites users of the SMA platform are most likely to reach when searching online for information about a particular brand, product or service.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0077","num":"0080"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 1B","FIG. 3","FIG. 5","FIG. 3","FIG. 8"],"b":["300","500","700","147","329","519","705","133","141","327","517","705","331","302","703","705","700","800"]},"Process  begins by receiving the data stored in the vertical database  of the vertical layer  in , receiving the data stored in the social graph storage , and receiving the data stored in the raw content data storage  of the harvesting layer  in  (operation ).

Process  also includes receiving data directly from the results of the processing performed in processing module  of  (operation ). This data is received and staged in the alert queue  (operation ) to be output to the alerter  and the user interface . Among other things, the alerter  is used for alerting users of the SMA platform of real-time or near real-time changes in user sentiment regarding their brands, products, or services. This completes process  according to an exemplary embodiment.","Some of the advantages of the social media analytics platform are that embodiments provide: brand\/product\/service-level analytics including websites frequently talking about the relevant brand, product or service; social media authors frequently talking about the brand\/product\/service; overall volume of opinions about the brand, product or service; overall sentiment towards the brand, product or service; volume and sentiment of opinions about competing brands, products or services; competing brands, products or services most frequently mentioned in connection with the users' own brand, product or service; terms used most frequently in connection with a brand, product or service; and trends and early-warning alerts for all of the above. Embodiments also provide site-level analytics including site traffic (unique visitors and pages viewed), topic distribution of site, overall sentiment towards a given brand, product, service or technology, number of active or contributing users, relevance of the active users, relationships to other relevant sites, and trends in all of the above. Finally, embodiments provide user-level analytics (users referred to here are participants in social media sites) including: sites on which users contributed content; known identities of users, users' registrations in social networks; influence of users; users' known ownership and\/or use of a given product, service or technology; users' sentiment toward a given brand, product, service or technology; users' known demographic and geographical attributes; and trends in all of the above.","In at least certain embodiments, a GUI is utilized to present the quantified and analyzed online social media content in a manner relevant to the user. The GUI may be fully customizable giving users the ability to select which charts and graphs should appear on the login page of the interface. The GUI provides an intuitive display to visualize brand, product or service sentiment over time. This display is a quantitative measure of opinion or sentiment for a brand, product, services, or its competitors and is derived from an automated aggregation of sentiment ratings on each individual post to online social media about a brand, product, services and\/or those of their competitors. The GUI includes various knobs or switches to manipulate the above information in a variety of ways. Among many other things, inside the GUI users can filter information by product\/service or competitor, groups of websites, data ranges, or drill down to the lowest level of granularity of the information to see the actual text of online social media posts as it appears on the originating source website. The GUI provides a visualization that allows users to give context to each social media post and gain familiarity with the posting website. The GUI is designed to be used by non-expert users without help from consultants. The GUI not only provides standard spreadsheet-style visualization such as bar and pie charts, but also highly innovative approaches including: radar screen; heatmaps; geographical visualization; 3D clustering, tag clouds, and timelines. Content may be harvested from as far back as sources make available. For example, discussion boards can have posts from many years ago. The start date on the GUI is configurable and is designed for ease-of-use allowing for a visualization of the underlying data calculations and aggregations instead of simply raw data.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 9","b":["903","901"]},"The dashboard may be customized according to the users' needs. The dashboard display in  includes: a brand sentiment index gauge  in the upper left corner; a brand trend line graph  in the upper right corner; a share of voice chart  in the lower left corner; and a brand sentiment chart  in the lower right corner. The brand sentiment index gauge  tells how positively or negatively social media participants are talking about users' brands, products, or services. The brand sentiment index gauge  reflects this online activity for the current month. They value of zero (0) means neutral sentiment. Positive values of 20 or above are typically very good. The brand trend line graph  shows how social media participant attitudes and opinions for a user's brand, product or service have changed over time. This enables users to see how sentiment has responded to various events such as advertising campaigns, programs and product launches. The share of voice chart  indicates the percentage of social media posts referring to the users' brands in comparison with their competitors. This allows users to gain important insight into the relative activity the users' brands are generating in online social media. The brand sentiment chart  displays users' annualized sentiment index in comparison with the indices of users' competitors for the current year.
