{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61\/139,793 filed Dec. 22, 2008, the entirety of which application is expressly incorporated by reference herein.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N0017-07-C-4013 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.","Superheterodyne and direct conversion receivers and waveform generators (also known as exciters) are employed in a wide range of applications. These include (but are not limited to) radar and communications transceivers. These receivers provide the ability to select a narrower RF band within a wider operational band for signal reception and transmission using detection and modulation circuits implemented at narrower intermediate frequencies bands, which are typically lower than the transmit band frequencies, and include baseband. The narrower or lower center frequency intermediate frequency bands are better suited to detection and modulation where analog to digital converter, digital to analog converter performance is improved and more commonly available. The frequency conversion is accomplished through at least one or more stage of mixing for up-conversion and\/or down-conversion. An ability for these receivers is the need for frequency selectivity and\/or hopping to provide frequency agility of the receivers and exciters within the operational band. Agility relates to the number of frequencies, the operational band covered within a band, and may also relate to the speed of tuning. The local oscillator synthesizers employed produce the reference signals at an offset from the radio frequency of interest, where the offsets are related to the intermediate frequencies. The synthesizer typically adjusts its frequency to address the agility of the receiver, but also provide low phase noise and spurious signals which degrade the performance of the receiver.","To address suppression of clutter in radar, and generally the suppression of interference and jamming the receiver dynamic range and\/or the waveform generator's spectral purity have certain requirements. With advancing threats and denser RF environments, the ability of prior art frequency agile synthesizers are limited by phase noise and spurious produced and are also more complex than desired. In particular higher performance agile LO synthesis results in significant increase in size weight and power required and limits dynamic range.","The phase noise and spectral purity of LO synthesizers are based low phase noise fixed frequency oscillators for which all synthesized frequencies are synchronized to in order to meet particular frequency accuracy, drift and phase coherence requirements. Agile high performance synthesizer typically degrade phase noise by 20 dB to 40 dB over the best available oscillators.","The traditional phase noise performance LO synthesis employs direct RF synthesis techniques includes low phase noise frequency division, mixing, and switched filtering to develop an ultra low noise frequency agile LO. This approach, however, has phase noise limitations due to the addition of multiple residual component phase noise sources. Additionally multiple bandpass filters are utilized to reject spurious, where settling time in switching filters, and related complexity of filters, switches and loss recovery amplifiers increases size, weight and power consumptions while further limiting phase noise.","Frequency synthesis techniques, such as those that use phase locked loop (PLL) employ frequency fractional division devices within the PLL feedback loop for frequency agile synthesis are subject to both settling time limitations, and spurious and noise generated in the fractional dividers, which are subsequently amplified at the output.","Direct digital synthesis (DDS) employing digital-to-analog (DAC) devices, have undesirable lower than desired performances related to generation of spurious due to amplitude and time skew distortion and due to phase quantization resulting in a large number of spurious signals.","Recently, there has been focus brought to architectures and technologies that combine a plurality of LO synthesizer units to yield an improvement of phase noise relative to a single unit. While this approach can reduce uncorrelated noise terms it does not address harmonic or other correlated terms. A simplistic approach results in cost, size and weight of a plurality of traditional high performance LO synthesizers can be prohibitive. Other approaches employing tunable oscillators arrays on integrated circuits with frequency injection locking address the size weight and power and complexity of parallel architectures, but performance of the individual synthesizers are limited in phase noise and agility.","Accordingly, an improved frequency LO synthesizer is desirable in the art that provides improved spectral purity, improved frequency agility, and size weight and power advantages.","A representative integrated circuit comprises a clock signal generator that generates a clock signal, a code pattern generator that generates digital pattern data based on the clock signal, and multiple traversal local oscillator synthesizers that are coupled in a cascaded configuration. Each traversal local oscillator synthesizer includes a transversal digital-to-analog conversion (T-DAC) unit that includes a plurality of registers and a unary modulator (Umod) array. The T-DAC provides frequency selection ranges covering wide operational bands based on the digital pattern data and the clock signal.","Other systems, devices, methods, features of the disclosure will be or will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such systems, devices, methods, features be included within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.","Exemplary synthesizers are discussed with reference to the figures. Although these systems are described in detail, they are provided for purposes of illustration only and various modifications are feasible. In general, the exemplary synthesizers address the field of local oscillator synthesis in which improvements to phase noise, and spectral purity are desired, while also providing the frequency selection ranges covering wide operational bands.","In general, the disclosed integrated circuit and method for operation generates a frequency selectable local oscillator reference signal using a digital to analog converting comb filter. The comb filter comprises a transversal digital-to-analog converter (TDAC) unit which is comprised of a plurality of amplitude and sign adjustable low resolution digital to analog and clock modulating converters which receive digital signals from a plurality of taps from a digital shift register. The plurality of digital to analog and clock modulating converter outputs are combined on a traveling wave transmission line for generating the output local oscillator signal. Additionally the method of the disclosure combines this with a circular pattern generator and method of programming to implement a discrete form of the SINC filter where the main lobe corresponds to the desired frequency and the zeros correspond to the spurious frequencies.","Clock signal generators that amplify or convert an external sampling clock signal into a common digital shift register clock signal with clock frequency fs, and a common unary modulation clock signal, which is selected as a multiple of fs\/2, a circular code pattern generator that generates digital patterns that repeat within an adjustable number of cycles Ncycle, where the maximum cycle length corresponds to the number of available shift register taps, and said circular pattern is derived from a quantized sine wave. Such a pattern produces a dominant desired term and Ncycle-1 undesired secondary spurious terms. The apparatus is programmed with amplitude and sign weights to produce the effect of a comb filter centered to pass the desired term and null each of the spurious terms. This produces the desired sine wave local oscillator reference signal, ideally without spurious terms since all spurious terms reside at filter comb filter nulls. The absence of spurious at frequencies other than the comb filter nulls results in improved digital to analog conversion direct synthesis of local oscillator signals. Also, plurality of digital to analog converters lead to reduction of uncorrelated residual phase noise produced in each, thereby providing improved phase noise.","Integrated circuit implementation can further include all the pattern and weight coefficients stored on chip within memory to form a complete synthesizer requiring only the external clock, a frequency control word. Each frequency word will look-up a unique digital pattern and comb filter. It may also select multiplication of the unary clock for translating the comb filter by multiples of one half the clock frequency. This represents a substantial reduction over prior art in complexity for agile LO synthesis. Implementation of the integrated circuit using high speed transistor technologies, such as SiGe\/CMOS (Silicon Germanium\/Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) can result in a self contained multioctave local oscillator generator integrated circuit over DC to 20 GHz range replacing prior art which is conventionally the size of an rack mounted assembly","Referring to  is a block diagram that illustrates a 3 stage superheterodyne multiple stage transceiver system , including a transmitter and a receiver having an agile local oscillator system  in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. The three stage superheterodyne transceiver system  includes a transmitter  and a receiver . The exemplary system includes both transmitter and receiver, but each can be employed separately as well.","A transmitter waveform generator employs direct digital synthesizer (DDS)  for generating a low intermediate frequency modulated signal that is coupled to an up-converter composed of three radio frequency (RF) sections that include mixers , ,  filters that are employed to select desired mixer terms, and amplifiers that amplify the selected terms to overcome losses from the mixing operation. The output of the chain produces a higher frequency low power signal that is amplified by a power amplifier  which receives signals from the waveform generator and produces amplified signals. The amplified signals are received by an antenna circulator  which sends the amplified signals to an antenna  for transmission.","Also within the transceiver system  can also includes a receiver  for amplifying and converting receive RF signals via an antenna . The received RF signals are passed through the antenna circulator  to a low noise amplifier , which amplifies the received signals. The amplified received signals are passed through down-converter composed of another three RF sections having mixers , , . Similar to the transmitter , filters and amplifiers in the receiver  are employed to select mixer terms and to overcome losses. At the output of the chain, a lower intermediate frequency replica of the radio frequency signals is produced for conversion by IF to digital I\/Q baseband conversion unit  composed of an analog-to-digital converter for converting analog signals to digitized samples, and a baseband converter for producing digitized Inphase and Quadrature (I and Q) components of the digitized bandpass signal.","The three stage superheterodyne receiver system  further includes a first local oscillator , a second local oscillator  and third local oscillator , all of which can include a transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer. The oscillators , ,  are coupled to power dividers , , , respectively. The power dividers , ,  are coupled to mixers , , , , ,, respectively.

Common step size of interest range from 10 MHz to 100 MHz and commonly several hundred frequencies can be generated by a single transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer .

Therefore, with appropriate design, transceiver  of  can exhibit wider bandwidths and employs fewer components within its local oscillator synthesizer, which can reside within an integrated circuit. Given that spurious signals are limited to a comb of possible frequencies, the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  is also amenable to high dynamic range receivers and waveform generator frequency plan where residual spurious terms given nonideal suppression within the invention can be avoided, or out of the pass band.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","305","160","305","250","245","320","240","160","160","160","330","160"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0055","num":"0054"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"119pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Clock frequency (fs = fd)","\u2003\u2002\u20094 GHz","\u20032.7 GHz"]},{"entry":["Number of umod (Numod, M)","\u20032","\u20033"]},{"entry":["frequency of umod (fumod = Mfs)","\u2003\u2002\u20094 GHz","\u20024.05 GHz"]},{"entry":["Number of pattern (Npat)","400","270"]},{"entry":["Number of total frequency (Nfreq_tot)","201","136"]},{"entry":["Number of frequency (Nfreq)","200","135"]},{"entry":["fstep\/fs","\u2003\u200910 MHz","\u2003\u200910 MHz"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = 0)\/fs","4.000 GHz","2.700 GHz"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = 1)\/fs","3.990 GHz","2.710 GHz"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = Nfreq)","2.000 GHz","4.050 GHz"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":"160"},"Table 2 is shown below providing exemplary data where the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  is provided with multiple sets of input clocks and more specifically where a common data clock fs of 1.4 GHz is used in conjunction with 5 umod frequencies derived by frequency multiplication of the 1.4 GHz clocks signal.

transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  improves phase noise performance over conventional synthesizers due to the method employing a common low noise source for the data clock fs and U-mod clock fumod through amplification, splitting and frequency multiplication, and short chain elements. The common low noise source includes a common dual clock source and driver  that outputs clock signals to the array of digital-to-analog converter (DAC) cells on lines  and  and the short chain elements include a DAC cell array. A shift register is employed to produce an array of delayed replica signals which are weighted by the DAC cells taps to implement a finite impulse response transverse comb filter for selecting the desired frequency. The combining of DAC signals results in coherent addition of the desired signals terms out of each DAC, and also noncoherent addition of the uncorrelated residual phase noise terms produced within each DAC cell This renders the noise of the array of DAC cells much smaller than the dual clock source . A reduction of 10 log 10(Ntap) in a single sideband phase noise of each cell (in units of dBc\/Hz) is thus realized, where the number of taps or DAC cells is Ntap. For a 200 tap array a 23 dB reduction in phase noise can be realized.","The primary limiting source within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  is potentially the distribution buffer drivers for the data clock and umod clock. An integrated circuit implementation employing SiGe Heterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) transistors is capable of provide low residual phase noise inherent to the known characteristics of this technology.","Thus ,  can be combined with the distributed transversal architecture to enable extremely low expected phase noise from the design because the HBT transistor. A design for a 25 ohm output impedance for ,  results in a low residual phase noise with high slew rates. A simulation of outstanding SiGe clock buffer phase noise has shown a single sideband phase noise floor better than \u2212170 dBc\/Hz being reached within 10 KHz of the carrier.","Frequency multiplication and\/or frequency division functions can be implemented in the HBT process to ease system implementation. An example of this amenable to integrated circuit techniques is to employ high speed HBT differential flip flops, designed to operate at clock rates as high as 40 GHz within this technology as the building blocks of a counter digital frequency divider, configured for division factors typically on the order of 1 through 8 within . These can be the same flip flops employed in forming the high speed circular shift register. Additionally phased lock loops using a wideband voltage controlled oscillator, feedback path with frequency divider and phase detector can provide frequency multiplication. These functions within  enable a useful range of choices for producing the data clock signal and umod clock signals with frequencies supporting multiple combinations, or modes of synthesis which increase the number of frequencies produced.","For example, a 10.24 GHz input could be frequency divided to provide a 5.12 GHz Umod clock and then further divided to provide a 1.28 GHz clock for the ternary data patterns. Conversely, if the system phase noise floor was less of a concern, a lower frequency input reference could be frequency multiplied within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  to provide the Umod and ternary clock functions.","The transversal agile local oscillator concept, which employs a synchronized digital shift register pattern generator, also incorporates a synchronization function that enables the synthesizer  to control the timing and initial phase state of the local oscillator signal. The local oscillator signal can include a sinusoide with a phase ramp, representing the initial phase as an intercept at the initial time step, or first sample, and a phase increment at each successive sample representing the ramp, which may include a saw tooth phase function modulus +\/\u2212180 deg. This phase ramp is implicit to the signal and is not directly generated, as is done in conventional direct digital synthesis, but rather through means of control of the pattern, pattern initialization, and TDAC weights. The initial phase can be reset to any of the possible initial phases by means of selecting a delay shift in the circular digital pattern, or by modifying the TDAC weights. In a manner similar to direct digital synthesizers, the pattern can be initialized with a synchronization\/reset pulse. This can be added as a feature to the design, such as frequency hopping applications.","Conversely, a preferred embodiment for this sends a synchronization pulse that resets a counter within the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer . This counter can be used to gate a waveform start trigger sent on lower frequency timing boundaries corresponding to the synchronization pulse. It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that this type of function can be implemented using the standard design libraries.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIGS. 8A-B"],"b":["160","160","410","440","435","415","240","160","9"]},"The clock signal generator  receives and generates clock signals based on the reference clock  and Umod data  from the signal generator unit  ().

cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  can be constructed from low resolution high speed quantized shift registers and modulating and weighted Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) elements where the quantization is 3 levels or greater. Each DAC is capable of controlling an amplitude and sign unique to each tap, representing a coefficient of a filter. Each DAC can also modulate the shift register signal with some multiple of \u00bd the shift register clock rate to emphasize a particular Nyquist band. The low resolution quantized shift registers, being driven by the a synthesized data clock signal, allows the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  to increase the resolution in frequency adjustment. It can also fit within a small area such as on an integrated circuit with a number of taps, e.g., 32 taps to form clock dependent delay lines.","The spurious produced are determined primarily by the quantization of the high speed shift register pattern and not by DAC amplitude control linearity out of each tap of the comb filter of the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizers , . By the combined effect of the comb filter, the quantization spurious is suppressed at the filter nulls, while the desired frequency is passed. The pattern circularity, or repetition rate, defines possible frequencies where both signal and spurious reside. The possible spurious frequencies correspond to the zeros of the comb filters. Since the frequency location is determined by both the circular patterns, comb filters, and frequency multiplication employed in response to a common reference signal, the frequencies of the signals and comb filters zeros are determined by their respective clocks. Hence the comb filter zeros track the spurious frequencies as a function of the instantaneous signal where the clock cycle period may change as a function of time.","Higher order Nyquist bands (each with 32 maximum possible frequencies) can be selected by selecting a umod clock at the Umod multiplier  and employing external Nyquist band-pass filters . The output frequency is the combination of fs, fumod, the pattern, comb filter and Nyquist band filter selected. The Umod multiplier  is further described in connection with . This has the function of provide Umod clock signals from multiples of \u00bd the input, including 0. The zero state produces a differential signal with a fixed high voltage and low voltage difference that leaves the Umod circuits in a fixed buffering mode, passing the signals without modulation.","The cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  can produce a large number of frequencies and with less taps than the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  of . For example, the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  can have 400 taps for a 5 MHz steps over a 2 GHz operational bandwidth (or 2000 MHz with 1 MHz steps), in support of a, for example, superheterodyne receiver (or exciter); whereas, the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  can have 32 taps. The cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  can have an order of 32 taps (N=32) with possibly  frequencies or any number less than 32 over a Nyquist band.","A substantial reduction from 400 taps to 32 taps can be realized with the addition of two 8 tap clock and umod cores. The result device produces low density spurious that are suppressed by comb filter nulls. This is in comparison to the high density spurious that can result from fractional N divider synthesis. Also, the phase noise of the TALOS improves by 10 log N where the divider is a cascade which degrades with order N. Hence the TALOS provides much higher performance in a miniaturized synthesizer than current art can achieve.","To increase resolution of the frequency steps from 10 MHz to 5 MHz, the generation mode state word source  can be programmed to produce shorter length patterns that are used by the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  to facilitate producing 400 frequencies within the 32 taps for the exemplary two (2) stage cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer , but may include any order lower than 32. In correspondence with these sets of patterns and the comb filter selections by the Umod multiplier , the clock rate of the shift register at the second transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  is also adjusted by a clock synthesizer from the transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer .","Patterns and comb filters can be programmed in the cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  to enable selection of any of the possible frequencies from a set of clock rates, umod frequencies and patterns which are stored in memory. The resulting concept supports generation of the fine step size Local Oscillator frequencies of interest.","Table 4 is shown below providing exemplary data of a first stage of a cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer as in  where the column DCLK Gen refers to  and UCLK Gen refers to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0108","num":"0112"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"91pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"84pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 4"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"DCLK Gen","UCLK Gen"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"70pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"84pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"fref","5.6","5.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Numod","0","2"]},{"entry":[{},"fumod","0","5.6"]},{"entry":[{},"Npat","8","8"]},{"entry":[{},"Nfreq_tot","5","5"]},{"entry":[{},"Nfreq","4","4"]},{"entry":[{},"fstep\/fs","0.7","0.7"]},{"entry":[{},"f(nfreq = 0)\/fs","0.000","5.600"]},{"entry":[{},"f(nfreq = 1)\/fs","0.700","4.900"]},{"entry":[{},"f(nfreq = Nfreq)","2.800","2.800"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{},"b":["160","1804","1810"]},"Table 5 is shown below providing exemplary data of a second stage of a cascaded transversal agile local oscillator synthesizer  based on receiving data which is a subset of the possibilities shown in Table 4.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0110","num":"0114"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00005","num":"00005"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"9"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"9","colwidth":"28pt","align":"char"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 5"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["fdclk2","0.7","0.7","0.7","0.7","0.7","0.7","0.7","0.7"]},{"entry":["Numod","0","2","3","4","5","6","7","16"]},{"entry":["fumod2","0","0.7","1.05","1.4","1.75","2.1","2.45","5.6"]},{"entry":["Npat","70","70","70","70","70","70","70","70"]},{"entry":["Nfreq_tot","36","36","36","36","36","36","36","36"]},{"entry":["Nfreq","35","35","35","35","35","35","35","35"]},{"entry":["fstep\/fs","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01","0.01"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = 0)\/fs","0.000","0.700","0.700","1.400","1.400","2.100","2.100","5.600"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = 1)\/fs","0.010","0.690","0.710","1.390","1.410","2.090","2.110","5.590"]},{"entry":["f(nfreq = Nfreq)","0.350","0.350","1.050","1.050","1.750","1.750","2.450","5.250"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"9","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":"1410"},"Thus, the number of local oscillator frequencies produced are then greatly increased as the product of the number of clock frequencies and possible set of single stage and single building block frequencies.
