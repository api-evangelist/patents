{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.","Technical Field of the Invention","This invention relates to the field of military aircraft munitions loading, specifically to the provision of a series of mechanical and electronic components collected and assembled to provide the means for loading munitions onto aircraft while in flight.","Shrinking defense budgets, combined with the increasing needs of the United States to project its military power often on short notice throughout the world, requires the armed forces to do more with less equipment and fewer personnel. Recently, as can be seen in the case of the war against Iraq, there has been a lack of consensus among allies forcing the United States to \u201cgo it alone\u201d when prosecuting the war against terrorism. The nations of Europe, for example, lying closer as they do to areas of turmoil such as the Middle East, are often reluctant to take hard stances against terrorists who lie within an automobile ride from their borders. As can be seen most recently with Turkey during operation \u201cIraqi Freedom\u201d, nations are often reluctant to promptly provide forward operating locations or to grant flyover rights for United States military aircraft lest these nations seem to be associated too closely with United States military initiatives. The delays caused by these diplomatic barriers can seriously impact United States' combat operational planning.","What is needed therefore is a means to not only refuel U.S. military aircraft while in flight, so as to extend mission operational effectiveness, but also a means to continually reload the munitions which have been expended during combat operations without having to return to either a distant friendly nation's ground bases, or in the case of naval airpower, to a distant aircraft carrier, to obtain more munitions.","Military combat aircraft require both fuel and munitions to complete their assigned missions. While the re-fueling of combat aircraft can be accomplished either while on the ground or in the air, the loading of munitions has thus far been limited to the ground. Because of this, the weapons mounts currently found on the pylons of military combat aircraft are designed specifically to be \u2018single-shot\u2019 in function and they are re-serviced each time the aircraft lands and takes off. Additionally, aerial rearmament would benefit the extension of airframe serviceable life of combat aircraft which is otherwise degraded each time a combat aircraft's heavy wing loads are stressed during take off. With an aerial re-armament system, combat aircraft would no longer need to take off with any munition as they can all be loaded on the aircraft while in flight. Re-arming the aircraft while in flight would also offer added advantages in terms of military intelligence in that observers (spies) on the ground would not know where a combat aircraft's targets lie in terms of proximity to the ground base, nor what munitions would be employed against a target list. With aerial re-armament, surprise would be achieved and maintained throughout aerial combat operations.","What is needed therefore is a system for aerial re-armament of combat aircraft so as to enhance the response time, combat effectiveness, deployment options and reach of United States' combat air forces.","It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for aerial rearmament of combat aircraft.","One object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus which transfers munitions from a rearming aircraft to the weapons pylons of a combat aircraft while both aircraft are in flight.","Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method to automate the process of guiding the transfer of munitions from a rearming aircraft to the weapons pylons of a combat aircraft.","Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus to facilitate the adaptation of any combat aircraft's weapons pylons to munitions transferred from a rearming aircraft in flight.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for storing in a database all combinations of munitions, rearmament aircraft and combat aircraft types and to configure such combinations in response to an Air Tasking Order (ATO).","Still yet another object of the present invention is to an apparatus by which the rearming aircraft can alternatively directly release munitions near a target wherein a combat aircraft would provide the guidance for the munition to the target.","The invention described herein provides an apparatus and method for rearming combat aircraft in-flight. Said invention comprises an apparatus for the aerial transfer munitions from a rearming aircraft to the weapons pylon of the recipient combat aircraft. Invention further comprises a method for the selection of munitions from a database of munitions and aircraft types in response to an Air Tasking Order. Invention further comprises an apparatus to adapt a variety of combat aircraft to aerial rearmament.","According to an embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises a boom, where the boom is attachable to and extendible from a rearming aircraft; a weapons mount that is attachable to the aircraft which is to be rearmed and where the weapons mount is also capable of accepting a munition; and a weapons platform attached to the boom which is capable of positioning and orienting the munition for transfer from the boom to the weapons mount.","According to a feature of this embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises means for providing aerodynamic lift to said boom.","According to another feature of this embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises a first sensor mounted on the weapons platform and a second sensor mounted on the weapons mount, where the first sensor cooperates with the second sensor to assist in guiding the weapons platform to the weapons mount.","According to yet another feature of this embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises an interactive computer program which comprises a means for selecting combinations of rearming aircraft, aircraft to be rearmed, and munitions; a means for storing and accessing these selected combinations in a database; a means for determining the quantity, availability, and compatibility of the rearming aircraft, the aircraft to be rearmed and the munitions; and a means for displaying the means for selecting, the means for storing and accessing, and the means for determining.","According to still another feature of this embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises an interactive computer program which cooperates with a centralized database, where that centralized database may be either Air Tasking Order (ATO) or a Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS). Additionally, the interactive computer program may cooperate with the centralized database in real-time or non-real-time.","According to still yet another feature of this embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for aerial rearmament of aircraft comprises another interactive computer program which comprises a means for guiding the transfer of the munition from the rearming aircraft to the aircraft to be rearmed; a means for determining and indicating the spatial orientation of the munition during the transfer; and means for determining and indicating the status of the transferred munition. The means for guiding the transfer of the munition further comprises a means for displaying the relative orientation of the first sensor to said second sensor; and a means for the operator to correctly position the boom based on the displayed relative orientation. The means for determining and indicating the spatial orientation of the munition further comprises a means for determining and indicating the azimuth angle, elevation angle and yaw angle of the weapons platform and a means for determining and indicating the distance between the weapons platform to the weapons mount. The means for determining and indicating the status of the transferred munition further comprises a means for determining and indicating whether or not the munition is \u201cdocked;\u201d a means for determining and indicating the whether or not the munition is \u201chooked;\u201d and a means for determining and indicating the whether or not the munition is \u201carmed.\u201d","Advantages and New Features","There are several advantages and new features of the present invention relative to the prior art. Important advantages include providing a method for striking strategic targets without regard to forward operating locations or airspace agreements; extending indefinitely the Close Air Support mission in support of forces on the ground; providing a fleet of \u201cvirtual\u201d bombers without the cost or time involved in developing more aircraft that are specifically bombers in mission orientation. The invention thus fills the traditional void in airpower theory, that airpower cannot be effective in fighting the unconventional war against insurgents; using the present invention and an aerial task force, as soon as targets \u2018pop up\u2019 they can be hit immediately.","A related advantage stems from the fact that once the present invention has been deployed, the effective airframe life of combat fighter aircraft will be extended because they will not have to takeoff or land with heavy munitions loads on their wings. A new weapons mount designed for multiple loads, or multiple \u2018shots\u2019 facilitates such advantage and is part of the present invention.","Referring to , apparatus for aerial rearmament comprises a boom , a first sensor , a Plexiglas faring  covering sensor , a weapons platform , a weapons mount  and a second sensor  located on weapons mount . A rearming aircraft , and a combat aircraft being rearmed  are likewise depicted. In this figure, boom  is depicted in its extended position. First sensor  is located on weapons platform  and protected from the slipstream by a transparent Plexiglas fairing . First sensor  is guided to second sensor , located on the leading edge of the weapons mount , located on the starboard wing pylon of the combat aircraft . By way of an example munition  a General Purpose Mark  bomb is shown already loaded onto the port wing of combat aircraft  while another is shown in position on weapons mount  for placement on the starboard wing.","Referring to  depicting the perspective from a combat aircraft being rearmed  viewing toward rearming aircraft  with the boom  extended. Control surfaces, or \u2018elevons\u2019  located on boom  provide both lift and guidance for boom . The weapons platform , and an example munition  in this example a General Purpose Mark  bomb resting on the weapons platform  is being delivered to the combat aircraft's  (see ) weapons mount  (see ).","Referring to , an electrical power source  from the rearming aircraft  provides power for the hydraulic pump , the guidance unit , the computer and monitor , a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera , and sensors  located on the weapons platform  at the end of the boom .","Hydraulic power is provided through hydraulic control valves  to the boom , and through the boom  to the elevons  which act as control surfaces to provide lift and maneuverability to the boom  when extended into the slipstream behind the rearming aircraft .","Data in the form of guidance instructions are provided by the computer , to and from the guidance unit , the hydraulic control valves , the elevons , and the weapons platform .","Data from sensors  located on the weapons platform  at the end of the boom  is transmitted to the computer  where it is monitored by the computer guidance software and the human operator. This sensor data is then interpolated into guidance instructions and sent to the guidance unit , continually refreshing the position of the boom  and weapons platform  in relation to the position of both the combat aircraft  and the rearming aircraft . Data on the precise location of the boom  and the munition  located on the weapons platform  is provided by additional sensors  located on the weapons mount  of the combat aircraft .","A closed circuit television (CCTV) camera  located on the weapons platform  at the end of the boom  allows the human operator to adjust the camera  if necessary to visually monitor the process. Night operations lights , also located on the weapons platform , illuminate the area of activity and allow the human operator to similarly monitor the process visually during darkness.","Referring to , boom  (see ) is telescopically extended outward from the rear of the rearming aircraft  (see ). Boom  is guided by sensors  (see ) and the computer  (see ) on the rearming aircraft  toward the weapons mount  located on the pylon of the combat aircraft . Weapons mount  is fixed to the pylon by ground crew while the combat aircraft  is on the ground through the use of a first pair of standard mounting loops . Once the weapons mount  is fixed on the combat aircraft  pylon, all other munitions  loading can be accomplished while the combat aircraft  is airborne.","A second pair of standard loops  are located in tandem on the top surface of the weapon  and are forced upward with the motion of the boom  until the loops  engage the hooks  on the weapons mount . Any slight variations in movement necessary to perform this part of the process are facilitated by the articulating pivoting cradle  located on the weapons platform . Until the second pair of standard loops  on the munition  are fully engaged to the hooks  on the weapon mount  of the combat aircraft , the weapon  is held to the weapons platform  and the boom  through clamping action provided by a set of calipers  which open by computer control once electronic and visual verification of attachment is achieved by the human operator.","During attack runs on the target, the combat aircraft pilot releases the munition  in the normal way; when he does this, the repeating gas canister gun  fires its round (similar to an eight-gauge shotgun shell) which forces the hooks  open and simultaneously forces an assisting plunger  downward, pushing the munition  away from the weapons mount  and towards its target on the ground.","Referring to , a computer screenshot is shown which depicts some of the facets of the present invention aerial rearmament system as it might be implemented within a typical Unix-based Command and Control system such as the Theater Battle Management Core System (TBMCS). In this screenshot, all items along the top Tool Bar  have their drop down menus visible. In actual operation, each of these drop down menus is collapsed until desired by clicking on it with a mouse or other pointing device. In preparation for the aerial rearmament mission, the human operator selects one item from each of the drop down menus, filling out the online form which then constitutes a database. Each item selected is then inserted into the database file , which is saved with a unique name. This information then becomes part of the Air Tasking Order (ATO) within the TBMCS. When the operator reopens this database file , all the information needed to complete the aerial rearmament mission is available at a glance to the human operator. This database file  can either be filled out on the ground before the mission(s), and then either transmitted up to the rearmament aircraft electronically, or loaded into the rearmament aircraft's computer on a floppy disk or other mechanical means, or filled out by the human operator on the rearmament aircraft while in flight and transmitted to the command and control facility located on the ground. Each time a rearmament mission is completed, the remaining available inventory of munitions stores located on the rearmament aircraft is updated in the database and reported to Command and Control personnel on the ground.","Referring to , a computer screen shot  depicts the computer software indicating guidance progress of the boom  (see ) and the munition  (see ,  and ) to be loaded onto the combat aircraft. The physical location of the first sensor  located on the end of the telescoping boom  is depicted in relation to its position with respect to the second sensor  (see ) located on the front of the weapons mount  (see ) which is attached to the appropriate pylon  of the combat aircraft  (see ).","The distance indication  (in meters) of the first sensor  (i.e., located on the end of the boom ) is calculated by the guidance software. In a like manner, the azimuth  (in degrees) of the weapons platform , elevation angle  (in degrees), and yaw angle  (in degrees) are updated and shown in their respective boxes. When the weapons platform  reaches its correct position under the weapons mount  it is said to be \u2018docked,\u2019 and this condition is then depicted on the display as a green light  in the \u201cDocked Yes\/No\u201d. Until the docked condition is achieved, a red indicator light  remains illuminated.","The munition  only remains in the docked position momentarily, then it is raised slightly to engage its standard loops  (see ) into the two \u2018L\u2019 shaped hooks  (see ) located in tandem in the weapons mount. These loops are in standard locations on every munition regardless of type. When the \u201chooked condition\u201d exists, a green light  is illuminated. Prior to this condition a red light  is lit.","The last procedure is the arming state of the munition. An \u201carmed state\u201d is indicated by a green light , which remains illuminated with a red light  until armed.","Referring to , the present invention is depicted in an additional role directly dropping munitions  (such as the Guided Bomb Units (GBUs) shown) from the boom  while extended through the rear of a rearming aircraft  (see ) such as a C-141, C-130, or C-17 etc. The extended boom , together with elevons , weapons platform , and protective fairing  are shown. An endless conveying system  is attached underneath the boom , which allows munitions  to be conveyed rearward and then released. Once released, the calipers  and sway braces  which hold the munition  to the endless conveying system  temporarily until release continue their progress on the conveyor returning to their starting position inside the rearming aircraft  in the munitions build area, where another munition  can be built and conveyed.","While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been particularly described in the specification and illustrated in the drawing, it should be understood that the invention is not so limited. Many modifications, equivalents, and adaptations of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 7"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
