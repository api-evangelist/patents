title: Brokering for application hosting computing resources of multiple vendor-specific provisioned computing environments
abstract: In certain embodiments, a computer-implemented method includes accessing, using one or more processing units, application parameters associated with an application. The application parameters define constraints for hosting the application using one or more of a plurality of provisioned computing environments available over a computer network from multiple computing resources vendors. Each vendor is associated with a corresponding vendor-specific provisioned computing environment that includes computing resources available to be provisioned for use by a multiple entities distinct from the vendors. The method includes accessing, using the one or more processing units, vendor-specific data for the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments. The method includes determining, using the one or more processing units, from among the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments and based on the application parameters and the vendor-specific data for the provisioned computing environments, a first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment for hosting the application.

No. 61\/421,487, filed Dec. 9, 2010, entitled \u201cBrokering for Application Hosting Computing Resources of Multiple Vendor-Specific Provisioned Computing Environments.\u201d","Owners of computer applications, including for example application developers, businesses or any other entities owning or otherwise providing an application, often desire that functionality provided by their application be made available over a computer network. In some cases, application owners may wish to provide their applications to users by using computing resources offered by a provisioned computing resources vendor associated with a provisioned computing environment. The computing resources vendor may provision computing resources of the vendor's associated provisioned computing environment for use, such as for application hosting, over a computer network.","As described above, application owners or other suitable entities may desire hosting of their applications using computing resources offered by one or more computing resources vendors. The computing resources vendors may make computing resources, such as any suitable combination of hardware, firmware, and software resources, available over a computer network for a fee for use by entities external to the vendor. Each vendor may operate a provisioned computing environment that is unique in one or more respects relative to the provisioned computing environments of other vendors. For example, each vendor's provisioned computing environment may have associated pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other associated characteristics, any or all of which may be unique to that provisioned computing environment and may change over time. Additionally, even with a single computing resources vendor, different service levels and capabilities may be available for different fees.","It may be quite burdensome for application owners to review the pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other associated characteristics of the various vendors to determine the vendor-specific computing resources environment that best meets the application owner's needs at a particular time. It may be even more onerous for application owners to monitor changes in the pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other associated characteristics of the various vendors to determine whether the vendor-specific computing resources environment that best meets the application owner's needs has changed over time. Furthermore, changes in the application owner's objectives may also dictate that a reevaluation of the appropriate vendor-specific provisioned computing environment for hosting the owner's application should be performed. Thus, it would be burdensome for an application owner to frequently review their objectives and the characteristics of the various vendor-specific computing environments. However, failing to do so may cost the application owner both financially and with undesirable application performance.","Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a broker that is operable to determine from among a number of provisioned computing environments, two or more of which are associated with different vendors, one or more provisioned computing environments that are best suited for hosting an application according to various constraints specified by the application owner and information about the various provisioned computing environments. In other words, from the available provisioned computing environment from a variety of vendors, the broker may determine the one or more most appropriate provisioned computing environment to host the application owner's application according to various constraints identified by the application owner and information about the provisioned computing environments.","The broker may be able to make this determination dynamically, such that as the constraints identified by the application owner change and\/or certain variables associated with the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments change, the running application (e.g., in one of the plurality of provisioned computing environments) may be dynamically moved to a more appropriate one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments according to this changed information. In making this determination, the broker may consider various data about the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments. The data may include performance data, cost data, and any other suitable data about the vendor-specific computing environments. The broker may initiate hosting using the determined one or more provisioned computing environments of the application. In certain embodiments, the operation of the broker and the associated moves of hosting of the application may be substantially transparent to uses of the application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","102","104","106","100","100"]},"In general, broker module  is operable to broker for hosting of an application associated with client system  computing resources of the plurality of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . For example, broker module  accesses application parameters provided by an application owner (e.g., via client system ) and vendor-specific data received regarding vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  (e.g., via vendor-specific provisioned computing environments ) and considers that accessed information and data in determining which one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  should host the application. Broker module  may substantially continuously or at any other suitable regular or irregular interval re-determine the appropriate vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  that should host the application.","Client system  may be implemented using any suitable type of processing system and may include any suitable combination of hardware, firmware, and software. Client system  may include one or more computer systems at one or more locations. Each computer system may include any appropriate input devices, output devices, mass storage media, processors, memory, or other suitable components for receiving, processing, storing, and communicating data. For example, each computer system may include a personal computer, workstation, network computer, kiosk, wireless data port, personal data assistant (PDA), one or more Internet Protocol (IP) telephones, smart phones, table computers, one or more servers, a server pool, one or more processors within these or other devices, or any other suitable processing device. Client system  may be a stand-alone computer or may be a part of a larger network of computers associated with an entity.","Client system  may be operated by or otherwise used by an owner of an application . An application owner may be an entity such as an individual or business (or any other suitable group of individuals) that owns the rights to use an application. However, it should be understood that reference to application owner may include any other suitable entity seeking to have an application hosted using computing resources of provisioned computing environments provided by vendors. The application owner may use client system  to submit applications  to be hosted, application parameters  associated with those applications , and other suitable input to broker module .","Application  may include any suitable combination of software, firmware, and hardware that is operable to provide functionality to users of application . As just one example, application  may include a web site and\/or web service to be hosted using computing resources of one or more provisioned computing environments . Application parameters  may define constraints for hosting application  using one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . An application owner may use client system  to submit application  and associated application parameters  to broker module  for broker module  to determine which vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  will host application  at any given time in a manner that best meets constraints (e.g., application parameters) identified by the application owner and is most cost effective (assuming the constraints include such a request).","Broker module  may include any suitable type of processing system and may be implemented using any suitable combination of hardware, firmware, and software. Additional details regarding example techniques for implementing broker module  are described below with reference to the example system  of  and the example broker module  of .","Broker module  is generally operated by an entity that is distinct from at least one or more of the vendors providing provisioned computing environments . However, it should be understood that the entity operating broker module  also may be a vendor that provides one or more of provisioned computing environments . Additionally, the entity operating broker module  may or may not be distinct from the application owner.","In general, broker module  is operable to broker for application hosting computing resources of multiple vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Broker  may make its brokering determinations based on application parameters  (described in greater detail below), vendor-specific data  (described in greater detail below), and any other suitable information. As will be described in greater detail below with reference to , broker module  may provide a portal and\/or application programming interface (API) to client system  through which the application owner may submit applications  and associated application parameters .","Turning to vendor-specific provisioned computing environments , system  includes a number of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Each provisioned computing environment  may including various computing resources and may provide an environment in which one or more of the computing resources are made available over a communication network to one or more remote computer systems (e.g., client system  or other systems). In certain embodiments, a portion or all of the components of each provisioned computing environment  form a computing infrastructure which may be communicatively coupled together over a high speed communication network. Each vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  may provide a collection of remote computing services offered over a network. Those computing services may include, for example, storage, processors, applications, or any other suitable computing resources that may be made available over a communication network. In certain embodiments, entities accessing those computing services may gain access to a suite of elastic information technology (IT) infrastructure services (e.g., computing resources) as the entity requests those services. Provisioned computing environments  may provide a scalable, reliable, and secure distributed computing infrastructure.","At least certain of the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  are provided by distinct vendors. In the illustrated example, provisioned computing environment is provided by vendor A, provisioned computing environment is provided by vendor B, and so on. A vendor may include any suitable entity that operates or otherwise manages one or more provisioned computing environments  for provisioning of computing resources to one or more other entities over a computer network. Each vendor typically provides a framework for operating or otherwise managing its associated one or more provisioned computing environments  that may be different in one or more respects from the framework used by other vendors associated with other provisioned computing environments . Additionally, each vendor may have its own capabilities. Moreover, each vendor typically has its own cost structure for pricing the provision of its associated computing resources to other entities. Additionally, at any given time, each vendor's associated provisioned computing environments  may experience different operating conditions, which may affect performance of the provisioned computing environments . Thus, each vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  may have associated pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other associated characteristics, any or all of which may be unique to that computing environment and may change over time.","Although each vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  is illustrated and primarily described as being associated with a different vendor, the present disclosure contemplates a single vendor offering multiple provisioned computing environments  having any suitable combination of different pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other associated characteristics. Thus, broker module  may be used to broker a single vendor's multiple provisioned computing environments , either alone or in combination with other vendors' provisioned computing environments . In certain embodiments, the entity providing broker module  may also be a vendor of one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments .","As described briefly above, in brokering vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  for hosting of application , broker module  may at one or more times gather and consider vendor-specific data . Vendor-specific data  may include any suitable information relating to one or more characteristics of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Broker module  may gather vendor-specific data  for each of the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . For example, vendor-specific data  may include values for one or more of the following characteristics of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments : pricing; capabilities; framework structure; performance; and other characteristics of the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments .","As more particular examples, vendor-specific data  may include values for one or more of the following characteristics of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments : central processing units (e.g., clock speed and number of cores); volatile memory (e.g., size); non-volatile memory (e.g., size); physical location of computing resources (e.g., geographic location, such as city, state, country); availability (e.g., availability to host an application and to what extent); security (e.g., types of security formats, processes, and systems used by environment ); hosting costs (e.g., the current pricing information to the application for using environment  for hosting application ); vendor identity (e.g., the name of the vendor); and any other suitable characteristics. In certain embodiments, vendor-specific data  may be gathered generally for both available (but currently unused for purposes of hosting application ) provisioned computing environments  and those one or more provisioned computing environments  that currently host application  (if any).","Vendor-specific data  may be gathered by broker module  in any suitable manner. For example, broker module may poll at any suitable regular or irregular interval computing environments  for appropriate vendor-specific data . As another example, provisioned computing environments  may be configured to communicate vendor-specific data  to broker module  at one or more regular or irregular intervals. As yet another example, an authorized user may manually input vendor-specific data into broker module .","Different application owners may have different objectives for hosting of applications. For example, an application owner may expect its application  to be hosted in a manner that achieves the greatest available performance regardless of cost. This may be the case for an application  that is critical for the business of the application owner. However, even under such constraints, broker module  may be able to determine the lowest cost vendor that still provides the best performance (e.g., should two or more vendors be able to provide the \u201cbest\u201d performance but at different prices). As another example, an application owner may expect certain performance and availability minimums, but may also request balancing of those constraints against certain cost constraints. One particular example scenario that may be requested by an application owner may be referred to as the \u201cchase-the-sun\u201d approach, which may take advantage of instances when computing resources are cheaper at night (when demand is typically lower) than during the day. In this scenario the application owner may be tolerant of some network latency for application  since the application  may be hosted in a geographically remote provisioned computing environment  (i.e., one where it is currently night). Instead of running application  in a provisioned computing environment  in the current daytime geographic region, broker  may dynamically move hosting of application  behind the \u201csun\u201d (i.e., daytime hours) to run where compute resources are not in high demand and are therefore generally cheaper. This may allow the application owner to realize a cost reduction in hosting of application .","As described above, when requesting that application  be hosted using one or more of provisioned computing environments , the application owner may submit one or more application parameters , which may define one or more constraints on the hosting of application . In other words, these application parameters  may provide the mechanism by which application owners inform broker module  of their objectives for hosting an application . These application parameters  may place constraints on the characteristics (e.g., pricing, capabilities, framework structure, performance, and other characteristics) of the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  that may host application  at any given time, and may be used by broker module  in determining the appropriate provisioned computing environment  to host application  at a given time. Particular example application parameters  may include values for one or more of the following characteristics (each of which are substantially similar to those described above with respect to vendor-specific data , but are from the perspective of the application owner's objectives\/constraints): central processing unit; volatile memory; non-volatile memory; physical location of computer resources; availability; average latency; security minimums; hosting costs; vendor identity; and any other suitable parameters. Application parameters  may be represented by thresholds expressed as percentages or in any other suitable manner, according to particular needs.","Application owner  may provide application parameters  to broker module  in any suitable manner. For example, the application owner may access a portal and\/or API generated by broker module  to provide application parameters  to broker module . In certain embodiments, rather than separately define each value of application parameters , an application owner may be provided with a number of hosting profiles that specify predefined combinations of values for application parameters .","In operation of an example embodiment of system , broker module  may access application parameters  associated with application . Broker module  may access vendor-specific data  for the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Broker module  may determine from among the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  and based on application parameters  and vendor-specific data  for the various provisioned computing environments , a first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., vendor-specific provisioned computing environment ) for hosting application . In certain embodiments, broker module  may initiate hosting of application  using the determined first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment . An application  being hosted by a provisioned computing environment  may mean that the application  is running using one or more computing resources of the provisioned computing environment . However, the present disclosure contemplates any suitable type of \u201chosting\u201d of an application  by one or more provisioned computing environment .","Although determining a first vendor-specific computing environment  is primarily described, it should be understood that broker module  may determine multiple vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  for simultaneously hosting application . For example, application parameters  may indicate that application  should be simultaneously hosted in at least two provisioned computing environments  that have different corresponding vendors. This may provide a level of redundancy for the application owner, which may be useful in the event that one of the provisioned computing environments  fails or is otherwise down. As a particular example, broker module  may determine, based on application parameters  and vendor-specific data  for provisioned computing environments , a second vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., provisioned computing environment ) for hosting application . Broker module  may initiate hosting of application  in both the first and the second vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  (e.g., environments and ) at substantially the same time such that application  is hosted simultaneously using computing resources of both the first and second vendor-specific provisioned computing environments .","Once an application  is being hosted in a provisioned computing environment , broker module  may substantially continuously or at any other suitable regular or irregular interval determine whether hosting of application  should be moved to one or more other vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  (e.g., to another vendor's corresponding provisioned computing environment ). For example, broker module  may monitor or otherwise check for changes in the application parameters  for application  and\/or vendor-specific data  for the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . If changes are detected (or for any other suitable reason), broker module  may make a new determination, based on the updated application parameters  and\/or updated vendor-specific data  for provisioned computing environments , a second vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., provisioned computing environment ) for hosting application . It should be noted that even in light of this updated information, broker module  may determine a \u201csecond\u201d vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  that is the same as the \u201cfirst\u201d vendor-specific provisioned computing environment .","If broker module  determines that it is appropriate to move application  from the first provisioned computing environment  (e.g., environment associated with vendor A) to the second provisioned computing environment  (e.g., environment associated with vendor B), then broker module  may initiate termination of hosting of application  using the first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., environment ) and initiate hosting of application  using the second vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., environment ) such that hosting of application  is moved from the first environment to the second environment ","Additional details of an example method that may be performed using system  are described below with reference to .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["200","100","100","102","202","204","206","106","200","100","200","100"]},"As described above with reference to , client system  may include one or more computer systems at one or more locations.

In general, client system  submits application  to broker module  of processing system , along with suitable application parameters , to allow broker module  to broker for hosting of application  the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Client system  may provide application  and application parameters  to processing system  (e.g., to broker ) in any suitable manner according to particular needs. For example, using a browser or other suitable network access program, an application owner may use client system  to access a portal provided by processing system . In certain embodiments, the application owner may use an application programming interface (API) available via the portal to provide application  and application parameters . The portal and API are described in greater detail below with reference to .","Network  facilitates wireless or wireline communication. Network  may communicate, for example, IP packets, Frame Relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) cells, voice, video, data, and other suitable information between network addresses. Network  may include one or more local area networks (LANs), radio access networks (RANs), metropolitan area networks (MANs), wide area networks (WANs), mobile networks (e.g., using WiMax (802.16), WiFi (802.11), 3G, or any other suitable wireless technologies in any suitable combination), all or a portion of the global computer network known as the Internet, and\/or any other communication system or systems at one or more locations, any of which may be any suitable combination of wireless and wireline.","Processing system  may include one or more computer systems at one or more locations.

The components of broker module  may be implemented using any suitable combination of hardware, firmware, and software.","Client interface  may facilitate communication between broker module  and client system . In certain embodiments, client interface  provides the mechanism through which an application owner submits (using client system ) application  and application parameters  to broker module , and by which broker module  receives application  and application parameters  from client system . Client interface  may provide a mechanism for communicating any suitable reports to client system .","Client interface  may be implemented in any suitable manner, according to particular needs. As just one example, client interface  may be implemented at least in part as a portal through which client system  accesses broker module  and\/or other functionality provided by processing system . For example, client system  may access the portal using a browser or other suitable network access program. Broker module  (e.g., client interface ) may be operable to generate the portal for receiving from client system  application  and application parameters  associated with application .","Client interface  (e.g., the portal) may provide the mechanism through which an application owner can manage the life cycle of application . For example, client interface  may provide the main portal through which application owners can manage their running applications , change application parameters  (e.g., price\/performance values), publish new applications , and perform other suitable operations.","In certain embodiments, broker module  may be operable to provide one or more reports to the application owner (e.g., via client system ). For example, broker module  (e.g., client interface ) may communicate using the portal (or other suitable client interface ) instance information showing the running instances of application  in one or more provisioned computing environments , usage data or other performance data associated with application  and\/or the one or more provisioned computing environments  in which application  is running, cost information associated with hosting application  in the one or more provisioned computing environments  in which application  is running, and\/or any other suitable information.","In certain embodiments, a portion or all of client interface  may be implemented as one or more APIs. Using APIs may provide a scalable option for publishing application  and managing metadata (e.g., application parameters ) from an application owner's environment (e.g., client system ).","Vendor interfaces  may include the mechanism by which broker module  interacts with the different vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Vendor interfaces  may provide the primary abstraction API through which broker module  interacts with the vendor-specific computing resource environments . In certain embodiments, vendor interfaces  comprise a set interface with specific abstractions for any vendor. For example, vendor interfaces  may be abstracted such that broker module  interacts with each vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  in a substantially similar manner. In such embodiments, vendor interfaces  may use an interpretive shim that handles the actual communication with the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments .","Broker module  may use vendor interfaces  to gather vendor-specific data , current vendor parameters , and any other suitable information from vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Vendor interfaces  may be configured with the appropriate security\/login credentials for accessing the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . Vendor interfaces  may also provide broker module  with functionality for deploying, starting, running, stopping, and deleting applications  using the various vendor-specific provisioned computing environments .","Environment analyzer  may be operable to evaluate application parameters , vendor-specific data , and any other suitable information to determine at a given time one or more appropriate vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  for hosting an application . Environment analyzer  may use any suitable techniques such as any suitable modeling techniques to perform this analysis. In operation of certain embodiments, environment analyzer  may access application parameters , vendor-specific data , and any other suitable information, and may analyze this infoimation to determine which one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  should be used to host application . As described above, environment analyzer  may operate on a substantially continuous basis or at any other regular or irregular interval to reevaluate whether hosting of application  should be moved among provisioned computing environments  in a way that is best for the application owner (e.g., per the application parameters  specified by the application owner).","Environment proxy  may receive and route requests for use of applications  that broker module  has instantiated in one or more provisioned computing environments . For example, once broker module  has initiated hosting of application  in one or more provisioned computing environments , proxy  may receive actual user requests for application  and route those request to the current hosting location (at a provisioned computing environment ) of application  for processing. Thus, rather than contacting the actual location of the application with user requests (i.e., at the provisioned computing environment ), user requests are routed through broker module  (and, in particular, environment proxy ). Environment proxy  may be updated dynamically as application  is moved among provisioned computing environments .","To the extent an application  is hosted simultaneously in multiple provisioned computing environments , environment proxy  may provide certain load balancing or other functionality for determining to which provisioned computing environment  user requests for application  should be routed. For example, environment proxy  may distribute, according to one or more load balancing policies, user requests for application  across the simultaneously-hosted instances of application  in the multiple provisioned computing environments . Handling this load balancing functionality at broker module  may reduce or eliminate the handling of such load balancing and\/or other routing functionality from an application owner (e.g., client system ) and\/or application .","In operation of an example embodiment of system , environment proxy  may receive a first user request for use of application . The first user request may be received at a time during which application  is hosted using a first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., provisioned computing environment ). Environment proxy  may route the first user request for use of application  to the first vendor-specific provisioned computing environment (e.g., provisioned computing environment ) for processing. Environment proxy  may receive a second user request for use of application . The second user request may be received at a time during which application  is hosted using a second vendor-specific provisioned computing environment (e.g., provisioned computing environment ). Environment proxy  may route the second user request for use of application  to the second vendor-specific provisioned computing environment (e.g., provisioned computing environment ) for processing.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":["106","100","200"]},"At step , broker module  may receive an application  to be hosted using one or more vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . For example, broker module  (e.g., using client interface ) may receive application  from an application owner via client system . In certain embodiments, the application may be submitted by the application owner in an application container, as described above. At step , broker module  may store application , in storage module for example.","At step , broker module  may receive application parameters  associated with . For example, broker module  (e.g., using client interface ) may receive application parameters  for application  from an application owner via client system . As described above, application parameters  may define constraints for hosting application  using one or more of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . At step , broker module  may store application parameters , in storage module for example.","At step , broker module  may access application parameters  for application . For example, broker module  (e.g., environment analyzer ) may access application parameters  stored in storage module ","At step , broker module  may access vendor-specific data  for vendor-specific provisioned computing environments . For example, broker module  (e.g., environment analyzer ) may access vendor-specific data  for vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  stored in storage module . Vendor-specific data  may be the last vendor-specific data  about vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  that was acquired by broker module  using vendor interfaces .","At step , based on application parameters  and vendor-specific data , broker module  (e.g., environment analyzer ) may determine from among the plurality of vendor-specific provisioned computing environments particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  (e.g., environment ) for hosting application . In certain embodiments, broker module  determines, from among vendor-specific provisioned computing environments , the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  for hosting application  by comparing application parameters  to vendor-specific data  for the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  to determine one or more of the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  capable of satisfying application parameters , and by determining, from among the determined one or more of the vendor-specific provisioned computing environments  capable of satisfying application parameters , that the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  is capable of best satisfying application parameters .","In certain embodiments, an application owner may be able to override the determination made by broker module  as to which vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  should host application . For example, prior to or after broker module  initiates hosting of application  using the determined particular provisioned computing environment , broker module may communicate to client system  (e.g., via client interface , such as the portal) a notification indicating the determined particular vendor-specific computing resource environment  in which application  will be hosted. If the application owner does not approve of the determined particular provisioned computing environment , broker module  may receive an indication from client system  (e.g., the owner of application ) that application  should not be hosted using the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment . Broker module  may then communicate another notification to client system  indicating and alternate provisioned computing environment  in which the application will be hosted. This process may continue until a satisfactory vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  is determined.","At step , broker module  may initiate hosting of application  using the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  determined at step . In certain embodiments, broker module  may initiate hosting of application  using the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  by requesting of the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  that a subset of the computing resources of the particular vendor-specific provisioned computing environment  be dedicated for use in hosting application . In other words, as described above, provisioned computing environments  may include computing resources that may be provisioned for use over a network by a variety of entities. As part of initiating hosting of application  using the particular provisioned computing environment , broker  may request that a portion of the computing resources available to be provisioned by the particular provisioned computing environment  be set aside for use in hosting application .","In certain embodiments, broker module  may use deploy (or invoke an already-deployed instance of) a machine image to the determined provisioned computing environment techniques. This machine image may be deployed at the time of instantiation or may preinstalled at the different provisioned computing environments . A machine image generally includes a packaged environment that includes all the appropriate bits to set up and boot an instance in a provisioned computing environment . Broker module  may provide the instance with application , so that application  may be hosted in the determined provisioned computing environment .","At steps -, broker module  may substantially continuously or at any other suitable regular or irregular interval monitor for changes in application parameters  and\/or vendor-specific data  and determine whether to move hosting of application  to another vendor-specific provisioned computing environment . In certain embodiments, this may allow broker module  to dynamically move hosting of a running application  to the one or more computing environments  that best meet the constraints identified in application parameters .","At step , broker module  may determine whether application parameters  have been updated. For example, broker module  may detect whether an application owner has submitted changes to applications parameters  for application  using client system  (e.g., via client interface . Although termed a \u201cdetermination,\u201d it should be understood that in certain embodiments broker module  may not make an explicit determination of whether or not application parameters  have been updated, but may simply detect receipt of updated application parameters  (e.g., from client system  via client interface ).","If broker module  determines at step  that it has not received updated application parameters , then at step , broker module  may determine whether hosting of application  should be terminated. For example, broker module  may detect whether an application owner submitted a request to broker module  (e.g., using client system  and via client interface ) to terminate hosting of application  using provisioned computing environments . Although termed a \u201cdetermination,\u201d it should be understood that in certain embodiments broker module  may not make an explicit determination of whether or not termination has been requested, but may simply detect receipt of a request to terminate hosting of application  (e.g., from client system  via client interface ).","If broker module  determines at step  that hosting of application  should be terminated, then at step  broker module  may initiate termination of hosting of application . For example, broker module  may access application information record  for application , determine from the current vendor parameters  the one or more provisioned computing environments  currently hosting application  (in this example, the particular provisioned computing environment ), and initiate termination (via the appropriate vendor interface ) of hosting of application  by the particular provisioned computing environment .

For example, broker module  may detect whether new vendor-specific data  has been received from one or more vendor-specific computing environments  via one or more vendor interfaces . As another example, broker module  may have predefined knowledge of certain changes in certain vendors-specific data  upon occurrence of certain events and may detect an \u201cupdate\u201d on the occurrence of such events. For example, stored vendor-specific data  for a particular vendor's provisioned computing environment  may indicate a predefined pricing schedule for use of computing resources of the particular vendor's provisioned computing environment , indicating that prices change according to the time of day. In such a scenario, broker module  may detect an update at that time of day, regardless of whether new vendor-specific data  has been received from the vendor. Although termed a \u201cdetermination,\u201d it should be understood that in certain embodiments broker module  may not make an explicit determination of whether or not vendor-specific data  has been updated, but may simply detect receipt of updated vendor-specific data  (e.g., from client system  via client interface ) or the occurrence of some other event tied to an update of vendor-specific data .","If broker module  determines at step  that it has not received updated vendor-specific data , then at step , broker module  may determine whether hosting of application  should be terminated.
