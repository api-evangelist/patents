title: Entertainment system on-board a vehicle for visualizing on a display real-time vehicle data
abstract: An entertainment system is provided on-board a vehicle for visualizing real-time vehicle data on a display mountable on-board the vehicle. The system has a visualization computer system for acquiring real-time data from the on-board vehicle computer representing one or more parameters of vehicle operation, and visualizing entertaining images on the display having graphics with one or more characteristics updated in real-time in accordance with such real-time data. The parameters of vehicle operation may represent those available from the vehicle computer via an On-Board Diagnostic port of the vehicle, e.g., vehicle speed, engine RPM, or air intake temperature. The graphics can represent two or three dimensional geometric object(s) or a graphical model, and the characteristics updated may represent one or more of speed of movement, shape, size, or color of such objects, or elements of the model, and as such, images of these graphics are distinctly different from typical dashboard instrumentation for operating a vehicle.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention relates to a system for visualizing real-time vehicle data on-board a vehicle, and particularly to a system for visualizing real-time vehicle data on a display mounted in or on a vehicle for entertainment distinct from the dashboard instrumentation for operating a vehicle. The invention is useful for entertainment purposes where images on the display are of graphics, such as two or three-dimensional geometric object(s) or graphical model, which move at a speed, or change in shape, size, and\/or color, in real-time in accordance with real-time changes in vehicle data, such as available via the on-board diagnostic port of the on-board vehicle computer.","In order to facilitate maintenance, diagnosis, and repair of vehicles, such as cars and trucks, vehicles have on-board diagnostics (OBD) available from the on-board vehicle computer which controls and monitors engine operation of most vehicles available today. The OBD is available through an OBD port located in the vehicle, which is coupled by a cable to computerized diagnostic machinery when the vehicle requires maintenance by repair technicians.","The OBD port uses a communication protocol and connector standard presently referred to as On-Board Diagnostic Level 2 (OBDII) published by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) as an industry standard for vehicular diagnostics in all automobiles manufactured after 1996. The OBD port and vehicular information from this port, such as vehicle speed, engine RPM, or air intake temperature, has traditionally been limited for diagnostic and repair purposes. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,884,202 describes a modular wireless diagnostic test and information system having a vehicular communication interface to the OBD port, and a user interface and command module for diagnostic programs upon such data received from the OBD port and other wireless meters connected to the engine. Other uses for vehicular information from this OBD port have been suggested, but these have been for a complex in-car network using a software upgradeable dashboard, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,253,122. This patent provides graphical images of dashboard instruments, such as may be used by a person in operating the vehicle. It would be desirable to provide a system which graphically displays information from the OBD of a vehicle for entertainment purposes, rather than for diagnostic and repair of a vehicle or for dashboard instrumentation.","Although non-dashboard displays have been provided in vehicles for entertainment purposes, they are for TV, video or DVD players, or for playing electronic games, and thus do not provide visualization of graphics related to information from the OBD of the vehicle.","It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a system on-board a vehicle for visualizing on a display real-time vehicle data using vehicle information from the on-board vehicle computer for entertainment distinct from dashboard instrumentation for operating the vehicle.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a system for visualizing graphics on a display mountable on-board a vehicle having one or more characteristics updated in real-time in accordance with real-time acquired data from the vehicle computer representing one or more parameters of vehicle operation.","Briefly described, the entertainment system embodying the present invention includes a display mountable on-board the vehicle, and a visualization computer system for acquiring real-time data from the on-board vehicle computer system representing one or more parameters of vehicle operation, and visualizing images on the display having graphics with one or more characteristics updated in real-time in accordance with the acquired data, which is updated in real-time by the visualization computer system from the vehicle computer system. The parameters of vehicle operation may represents those available from the vehicle computer via a standard on-board diagnostic port of the vehicle, e.g., vehicle speed, engine RPM, or air intake temperature. The graphics can represents two or three dimensional geometric object(s) or a graphical model, and the characteristics updated may represent one or more of speed of movement, shape, size, or color of such objects or elements of the model.","In the preferred embodiment, the visualization computer is coupled to the OBD port of a vehicle through an interface that enables the visualization computer system to request and receive data from the vehicle computer. The interface may instead be connected directly to the OBD bus of the vehicle computer, or coupled to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle.","The images provide entertainment distinct from dashboard instrumentation of the vehicle, and for example, may represent, a rotating cube which changes in speed and\/or color with vehicle speed and\/or RPM, two or three-dimensional model of the vehicle engine in which the engine's pistons rise and fall at a rate proportional with RPMs, two or three-dimensional model of the vehicle having wheels which rotate proportional to vehicle speed, ricocheting three-dimensional spheres having ricochet rate related to vehicle speed, screen color change with air intake temperature level, or other two or three dimensional entertaining graphics, which would be impractical for a driver to use to operate a vehicle while in motion.","Referring to , a block diagram of a system  is shown having a visualization computer system  for visualizing on a display  real-time vehicle data obtained from a vehicle computer system  via an interface  to the OBD port  of a vehicle. The display  may be a LCD screen, preferably color, mounted on-board the vehicle, such as to the vehicle's dashboard  as shown in FIG. . Display  may also be mounted on-board elsewhere in the interior of the vehicle, such as on the back of a vehicle seat or visor, or may be mounted on-board along the exterior  of the vehicle , such as on a door, as shown for example in , or other location, such as the trunk, bumper, hood, side mirror, or roof. Mounting of the display may be, for example, by adhesive, Velcro, screws, or other attachment means suitable for mounting an LCD screen display (or monitor), and may use bracket(s) to facilitate mounting. The display  has a resolution suitable for viewing high resolution graphics, such as 800 by 600 pixels, and is connected by a video cable  to the visualization computer system, which has typical hardware\/software for outputting, via cable , signals representing images on the display, as typical of computer systems. Preferably, the computer has a 3-D video accelerator card with TV-output to facilitate output of graphics in three-dimensions to display .","Although one display is illustrated, multiple displays may be used at different location mounted in the interior or along the exterior of the vehicle by splitting signals from video cable  to other cables coupled to other display(s). Also, the size of the display  may differ depending on its location on-board the vehicle, for example, door mounted display of  may be larger in size than an interior mounted display. Further, although an LCD screen is preferred, display  may be a CRT, and could represent an LCD screen or CRT mounted in the dashboard.","The visualization computer system  may represent a personal computer system, laptop computer, or any microprocessor based computer system programmed in accordance with the present invention. The visualization computer system  is located on-board the vehicle, such as in the trunk. The interface  is connected to the OBDII port  by an OBDII cable , which has a connector for engagement to the OBDII port. Also, the interface  is connected by serial cable , such as a DB9 serial cable, to a compatible serial port on the visualization computer system . The interface  may be located under the vehicle's dashboard, in the trunk, or elsewhere in the vehicle by proper sizing of the length of cables  and . The location of the OBD port  may be different in different vehicles, but often the port is located in the interior of the vehicle near the vehicle's steering column or elsewhere within three feet of the driver's seat.","The interface  enables data communication between the visualization computer system  to and from the OBD system of the vehicle computer , via the OBD port , by converting the serial communication protocol into OBD communication protocol and vice versa. For purposes of illustration, the invention is described as using On-Board Diagnostic Level 2 (OBDII) standard as set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), however, other OBD standards may be used. Further, serial communication is described as RS232 serial communication, but other serial communication protocols may be used, such as via a USB. Interface  is commercially available from Multiplex Engineering, Inc. of Santa Barbara, Calif., and for example may be their interface for SAE standard J-1850, Part No. T16-002 or T16-003. This interface defines the communication protocol between the interface  and visualization computer . For the T16-002 or T16-003 Interface, the communication protocol between the automobile data bus (via the OBD port ) and RS-232 can be found in the tech manual for this interface from Multiplex Engineering, Inc., at web site address, www.multiplexengineering.com\/tech\/manual. The interface  preferably is a separate component, but may alternatively be on a circuit card in visualization computer  without serial cable . The features of interface  will be more apparent from later discussion on operation of system . However, other interfaces may be used so long as they enable the visualization computer system to obtain data from the OBD system of an on-board vehicle computer.","Power is supplied to the display  and visual computer system  (and to interface , if needed) from the vehicle power supply or battery . This may be by power cables  connected to the power distribution system of the vehicle, such as used in typical car\/audio visual equipment added to the vehicle after its manufacture, or via a power adapter to the cigarette lighter\/power socket of the vehicle. One or more cigarette lighter\/power sockets may be located in a vehicle.","Referring to , A and B, the operation of the system  and programming of visualization computer system  will now be described. Upon start-up of the visualization computer system, an executive process  and two independent processes, a data acquisition process  and a visualization process , which operate in parallel, are started. Although not described, the computer system  has an operating system, such as Windows, or Linux or other Unix systems, upon which processes - represent application programs compiled from C++ programs, but other programming languages may be used. The data acquisition process  and visualization process  may represent two POSIX threads, but other data structures may be used which allow independent processes to share common variables. See, Programming with POSIX Threads, Addison Wesley, 1997. The computer system  has memory , such as RAM, hard drive disk, floppy disk, and\/or optical disk, storing these programs, and also providing memory for shared variables  for use by processes -.","The data acquisition process  enables acquiring of data in real-time from the vehicle computer , via the interface , representing one or more parameters of vehicle operation. The vehicle computer  may represent any typical vehicle computer system of a car, bus, truck, SUV, or other type of automobile, having typical sensors for sensing operation of the vehicle, and provides an OBD system accessible via an OBD port. The parameters of vehicle operation represents those available from the vehicle computer via the OBD port of the vehicle, as described by Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard, such as, for example, J-1850, or other Standards published by the SAE for communication with OBDII compliant vehicles. Reference is made to SAE book No. HS-3000\/99, entitled SAE On-Board Diagnostics for Light and Medium Duty Vehicle Standards Manual for Information on OBD Systems, OBD Communication, and the OBD Codes Available. As described below, the data acquisition process  using one of the OBD codes process serially requests a parameter of vehicle operation, for example, vehicle speed, engine RPM, air intake temperature, manifold pressure, coolant temperature, fuel pressure, and throttle position, but any other data typically available from a vehicle computer via the OBD port may also be requested. The executive process  defines a shared variable Vehicle Metric in shared memory , which represents a number or code representative of the parameter of the vehicle the data acquisition process  will obtain.","Referring to , data acquisition process  of the visualization process  is shown. First, the value of variable Vehicle Metric is read (step ), and then in a look-up-table in memory associates that value with the corresponding OBDII code (step ). For example, Vehicle Metric may be set to a value of 1, which is associated with hexadecimal value Hex0D, e.g., an OBDII code for vehicle speed, or value of 2, which is associated with hexadecimal value Hex0F for air intake temperature. The data acquisition process  formats a request message in the communication protocol for serial communication to interface  (step ). This request message includes multiple fields: Security field, Communication Type field, OBD field, and Verification Field. The Security field may be a one byte field containing the unique security number or code for use with the particular one of interface  in system . This security code for the interface  is stored in memory of the visualization computer system . The Communication Type field may be a one byte field containing a number representing one of the three communication types by which interface  may communicate with vehicles of different manufactures. At start up, arbitrary one of the communication types is located in this field, such as the value 1. The interface  is capable of communication in each of the three different communication protocols with OBD of the vehicle. The OBD field may be eleven bytes long, and contains the OBDII code (such as a HEX number) for the vehicle parameter being requested. The Verification field may be a one byte field used to verify the request message to the interface . It may represent the last byte of the addition of the first thirteen bytes (96 bits) of the message. The request message may contain other fields if required by interface .","At step , the data acquisition process  sends the request message as a packet serially over the serial cable  to the interface , which receives and reads the different fields of the packet. If the security code in the Security field matches that stored in memory of the interface , then the interface formats and sends a request for the OBDII code in the OBD field using the communication protocol in accordance to the type of the Type field of the received message. The data acquisition process  then waits for a return message from interface  before sending the next request message.","If an invalid request message is received by the data acquisition process  from the interface  (step ), the same request message is resent with the Communication Type field set to a different communication type, such as by indexing the value of this field to reference the next communication type (steps  and ). This continues until a return message is received (step ). At step , if no response is received from the interface  within a period, for example 3 seconds, a timeout has occurred, resulting in ceasing of system  operation, and the visualization computer  will need to be restarted once the cause of the cause of the failure (e.g., communication failure, such as cable  disconnects from OBD port ) has been resolved. The return message includes a Header field, Verification field, Vehicle data field; and other vehicle manufacturer specific field(s). The data acquisition process waits on the serial line from interface  until it reads the proper header byte in the Header field of the return message. It then retrieves the value in the Vehicle Data field of the received return message (step ), and a shared variable Vehicle Info in shared memory  is set to that value (step ). For example, the value in the Vehicle Data field may be 14 bytes (112 bits) long. The data acquisition process  then formats and sends the next request message to interface  in accordance with the variable Vehicle Metric, as described above, with the value of the Communication Type field of the last request message successfully sent and received. This process repeats in this manner continuously updating in real-time variable Vehicle Info with the desired vehicle parameter. The fields of each return message other than the Header and Vehicle Data fields need not be used, however, data in the Verification field could be used by the data acquisition process  to verify the return message, such as providing a Checksum value of other data in the return message. Optionally, the executive process  may have another shared variable to instruct the data acquisition process  how many times to send the same request message before checking the variable Vehicle Metric for any change.","The data acquisition process  updates variable Vehicle Info in real time to provide real-time vehicle information while the vehicle is in operation. The rate of receiving return messages can differ for different vehicles. However, OBD operating rate is typically 10 times per second, thus the data acquisition process  can obtain 10 updates of the desired vehicle information in Vehicle Info every second. The data acquisition process  is also capable of operating at other OBD rates.","Operating in parallel with the data acquisition process , the visualization process  enables visualizing of images on the display having graphics with one or more characteristics updated in real-time in accordance with the value of Vehicle Info acquired by the data acquisition process . The visualization process  utilizes graphic application program(s) stored in memory of the visualization computer . These programs operate upon a set of input graphics parameters specifying points defining the lines or shapes of the graphics (screen pixel locations, and\/or geometric values, e.g., diameters or sizes), color, and effects, such as lighting, shading, reflection, motion blurring, or degree of rotation for three-dimensional shaped objects, or other graphics, or patterns, for the particular graphics to be visualized.","The visualizing process  has a rendering process  for defining the input graphics parameter set, and a display process  for generating the graphics in accordance with this set. The system  may optionally allow a user to select one of different graphics for display. If so, the executive process  defines a shared variable Graphics Select in shared memory  which is set to a value in accordance with one of the selected graphics available in memory of the visualization computer. An optional user interface for enabling such selection is described later.","Referring to , the rendering process  of the visualization process  reads the value of Graphics Select (step ), and using this value locates in memory of the visualization computer  the input graphic parameter set for the selected graphics, and instructions on updating (modifying) such parameter(s) of this set by value of Vehicle Info (step ). The rendering process  initializes the input graphic parameter set to a default set of values for the desired geometries of the graphics (step ). Next, variable Vehicle Info is read (steps ), and the rendering process updates (modifies) one of more of the parameters of the input graphics parameter set in accordance with read variable Vehicle Info (step ), depending on the desired effect on the graphics being imaged. The input graphics parameter set is then sent to the display process  (step ). The display process  receives the input graphic parameter set from the rendering process , and utilizing the graphic application program(s) in memory of the visualization computer  generates an image for output as signals to the display  to visualize such graphics (step ). The display process  uses the particular graphical Application Programming Interface(s) stored in memory for the selected graphics as set by the value of Graphics Select. The association to the value of Graphics Select at steps  and  to program code in memory may be performed by look-up-table to file names, memory locations, or addresses.","In one embodiment, the display process  utilizes OpenGL 3D libraries available from Silicon Graphics, Inc. to provide Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) stored in memory of the visualization computer. These APIs have defined set of input parameters for their graphics as set forth by the programming protocol for using such OpenGL 3D libraries. Reference is made to the book entitled, OpenGL Programming Guide 3Edition, Addison Wesley, 1999, on using this programming protocol. For example, the API's may define a rotating cube , such as shown in the display  of  or . The speed of the vehicle provided by the value of Vehicle Info is scaled to a value representing the change of each rotation (0-359 degrees) of the object. In this example, if the vehicle speed returned in Vehicle Info is 55 miles\/hour and the maximum speed of the vehicle is stored in memory as 150 miles per hour, then amount of change in each rotation would be about 132 degrees. Thus, the Vehicle Info value may be scaled in accordance with the percentage of change of the graphics desired.","Examples of graphics include, a rotating cube which changes in speed and\/or color with vehicle speed and\/or RPM, two or three-dimensional model of the vehicle engine in which the engine's pistons rise and fall at a rate proportional with RPMs, two or three-dimensional model of the vehicle having wheels at a rotation proportional to vehicle speed, ricocheting three-dimensional spheres having ricochet rate related to vehicle speed, screen color change with air intake temperature level, or other two or three dimensional entertaining graphics.","The rendering process  continuously checks the Vehicle Info value and updates the input graphics parameter set accordingly. This provides real-time changes in the graphics generated by the display process  in images on display . As data acquisition process  updates variable Vehicle Info at a rate slower (e.g., 10 times per sec.) than the rate graphics of the visualization process  are outputted to the display (e.g., 60 frames per sec.), the rendering process  uses the last value for Vehicle Info, until it detects that Vehicle Info has changed. Thus, graphics on different successive frames appear to smoothly transition on display .","Optionally, the system  may have a user interface provided by display  having a touch screen. The visualization computer  can output a graphical user interface (GUI) from its memory providing one or more screens having a list of the graphics available on system , and the user by touching areas of the screen associated with a particular graphics listed can selects such graphics, as typical of touch screen displays. The visualization computer  then sets the value of Graphics Select for the particular graphics selected. For example, various three dimensional objects may be selected such as a rotating three-dimensional cube(s), sphere(s), or other geometric shapes, two or three dimensional representations of fireworks, ricocheting spheres of or other objects, a two or three dimensional model of the vehicle's engine with moving elements such as pistons. Upon start up, a default graphics may be selected, which when visualized on the display, may be interrupted by the user touching the screen of the display, or the visualization computer can wait for input via the user interface.","Other user interfaces may also be provided, such as a wireless keypad for communication to the visualization computer, which has a wireless data communication interface to the keypad, to enable a user to select graphics shown as a list on the screen by entry of key strokes, or toggle through each of the graphics stored until a desired graphic is shown. In a further alternative, a configuration program may be provided from an optical or floppy disk in a drive of the visualization computer, specifying the desired input graphics parameter set of graphics and the graphical application program(s), which may be used by the visualization process. The configuration program setup may be defined on another computer system and stored on optical or floppy disk, which may then be loaded into the visualization computer system  at start up.","The above describes system  obtaining one vehicle parameter to effect characteristic(s) of the graphics in images outputted to the display . Multiple vehicle parameters may also be obtained and used to effect such graphics. This may be achieved by the executive process  setting each value of multiple shared variables for each of the multiple vehicle parameters, such as shared variables Vehicle Metric, Vehicle Metric, Vehicle MetricN, where N is the number of vehicle parameters to be obtained. The data acquisition process  sends successively a request message having the OBD code for each of the different shared variables Vehicle Metric, Vehicle Metric, . . . Vehicle MetricN. After a return message is received in response to each request message, the data acquisition process  updates the corresponding one of multiple shared variables Vehicle Info, Vehicle Info, . . . Vehicle InfoN, where N is the number of different vehicle parameters being obtained. The rendering process  reads shared variables Vehicle Info, Vehicle Info, . . . Vehicle InfoN, and uses one or more of them to effect different characteristics of the graphics in images outputted to the display. For example, in the case of two parameters being used to effect graphics, vehicle speed for Vehicle Info and air intake temperature for Vehicle Info, then the results of return messages would be set as Vehicle Info and Vehicle Info, respectively. In this example, changes in vehicle speed may effect speed of rotation or movement of object(s) or elements in the image, and air intake temperature may effect brightness of the color red in the image.","Optionally, when certain parameters change more frequently than others, the parameters changing more frequently can be the subject of more request messages every interval, such as a second, than those obtained which change less frequently. This may be achieved by providing shared weight variables Weight, Weight, . . . WeightN corresponding to each of the multiple shared variables Vehicle Info, Vehicle Info, . . . Vehicle InfoN, respectively, to define how many times the same request will be repeated in an interval for each vehicle parameter. In the example mentioned above, vehicle speed may change more frequently than air intake temperature, thus, Weight may be 9 (or 0.9) and Weight set to 1 (or 0.1), and in the case where ten request messages are sent every interval, in each interval the first nine would request OBD code for Vehicle Info and the last one request OBD code for Vehicle Info.","The visualization computer  is shown in  coupled via the interface  to the OBD port . Alternatively, the interface  may instead be connected directly to the internal bus (or data bus) of the vehicle computer  as indicated by the dotted line . In a further alternative, the visualization computer  may be coupled to the vehicle computer , via the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) of the vehicle, where interface  and cables  and  are not required, and the existing ECU of the vehicle is replaced with an ECU  capable of receiving data from the internal vehicle bus and transmitting such data over a cable (such as a serial cable), indicated by dotted line , to the visualization computer . ECU data represents data including parameters of vehicle operation, such as vehicle speed. For example, a replacement ECU is commercially available from Hondata, Inc. of Torrance, Calif., or may represent a Link Programmable Computer from Flyin' Miata of Grand Junction, Colo.","The system  can easily be attached to a vehicle by coupling of the visualization computer  via interface  to OBD port  (or direct to the internal OBD bus, or via the ECU), and mounting display  to a desired location in or on the vehicle. In contrast with traditional use of OBD for vehicle diagnostic, repair, and maintenance by vehicle repair technicians, the system enables entertaining display of graphics to occupants of the vehicle (or viewers of the vehicle if exterior display(s) are used) distinct and located separate from dashboard instruments, such as the speedometer or RPM gauge used to operate the vehicle.","Optionally, additional sensor(s)  () of vehicle operation may be provided in the vehicle separate from any sensors associated with the vehicle computer . Such sensor(s)  may be connected by cables to input ports of the visualization computer , and used by system  similar to data obtained from the vehicle computer . For example, such sensor(s)  may represent a sensor for braking energy, such as used in auto racing, or a sensor for measuring lateral G-force. Data from sensor(s)  represents parameter(s) of vehicle operation which may be used by the visualization computer  in combination with data acquired from the vehicle computer , or data from sensor(s)  may be used by the visualization computer  exclusive of data from the vehicle computer , and thus with or without inclusion of interface , and cables  and  in system .","From the foregoing description, it will be apparent that an entertainment system for visualizing on a display real-time vehicle data on-board a vehicle has been provided. Variations and modifications of the herein described system will undoubtedly suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the foregoing description should be taken as illustrative and not in a limiting sense."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The foregoing objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from a reading of the following description in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00012","num":"00012"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00013","num":"00013"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00014","num":"00014"},"figref":["FIG. 2A","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00015","num":"00015"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00016","num":"00016"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00017","num":"00017"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 1"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
