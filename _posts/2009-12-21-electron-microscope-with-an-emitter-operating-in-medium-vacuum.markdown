title: Electron microscope with an emitter operating in medium vacuum
abstract: An electron microscope is described. This electron microscope includes an electron emitter that has an evaporation or sublimation rate that is significantly less than that of tungsten at the reduced pressures around the electron emitter during operation of the electron microscope. As a consequence, the electron microscope may be able to operate at reduced pressures that are much larger than those in existing electron microscopes. For example, at least during the operation the reduced pressure in the electron microscope may be greater than or equal to a medium vacuum. This capability may allow the electron microscope to use a roughing pump to provide the reduced pressure, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the electron microscope, and improving its reliability. In addition, the size of the electron microscope may be reduced, which may enable a hand-held or portable version of the electron microscope.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/268,695, entitled \u201cElectron Microscope With Emitter Operating in Low Vacuum,\u201d by David L. Adler, filed on Jun. 14, 2009, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.","The present disclosure relates generally to an electron microscope and associated methods. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to an electron microscope with an emitter that can operate at a pressure greater than or equal to a medium vacuum.","Electron microscopes are widely used in micro-analysis because of their high depth of field and resolution. Typically, existing electron microscopes use electron-emitter materials that have a high evaporation or sublimation rate in environments that contain oxygen, such as tungsten or lanthanum hexaboride. Consequently, to extend the life of the electron emitter, during operation these existing electron microscopes usually maintain reduced pressures in the high to ultra-high vacuum region (for example, between 10and 10Torr) in a region around the electron emitter. Indeed, as the oxygen pressure in this region in existing electron microscopes is increased from 10to 10Torr, the lifetime of the electron emitter decreases from several hundred hours to less than one hour.","However, the vacuum pumps and associated hardware (such as valves) used to create and maintain such reduced pressures (such as turbo-molecular pumps or diffusion pumps) are expensive, can make existing electron microscopes difficult to use, and can increase the size and weight of the existing electron microscopes. These characteristics can limit the number of potential applications and users of electron microscopes.","Therefore, there is a need for an electron microscope without the problems listed above.","One embodiment of the present invention provides an electron microscope, which includes: an electron emitter, a housing (such as a column), and a vacuum-generating mechanism. At least during operation of the electron microscope, the electron emitter provides an electron beam. This electron emitter and the electron beam are at least partially enclosed within a cavity defined by an inside wall of the housing. Furthermore, the vacuum-generating mechanism, which is mechanically coupled to the housing, provides a reduced pressure greater than or equal to a medium vacuum in the cavity at least during the operation of the electron microscope. For example, the medium vacuum may include a pressure approximately greater than 10Torr.","In some embodiments, the vacuum-generating mechanism includes a roughing pump. However, the vacuum-generating mechanism may exclude a turbo-molecular pump or a diffusion pump.","Furthermore, the electron emitter may have an evaporation or sublimation rate that is significantly less than that of tungsten at the reduced pressure, such as an evaporation or sublimation rate that is at least two orders of magnitude smaller. In some embodiments, the electron emitter is a ceramic, such as a carbide-based material. For example, the electron emitter may include: hafnium carbide, hafnium dioxide, hafnium diboride, zirconium carbide, zirconium dioxide, zirconium diboride, tantalum carbide and\/or compounds that include two or more of these compounds. More generally, the electron emitter may include a material other than: tungsten, lanthanum hexaboride, a carbon nanotube (and, more generally, an allotrope of carbon) and\/or cerium hexaboride.","In some embodiments, the electron microscope includes a filter to remove particulate matter from the cavity at least during the operation of the electron microscope. For example, the filter may include an electrostatic filter. Note that the filter may be replaceable.","Additionally, the electron microscope may be portable. For example, the electron microscope may be hand held. In some embodiments, the housing has an opening defined by an edge, and the electron microscope includes a seal (such as a sliding seal or an airbearing) that is mechanically coupled to the housing, which removeably mechanically couples the housing to a surface external to the electron microscope. This seal may facilitate displacement of the housing along the surface when the housing is mechanically coupled to the surface.","In some embodiments, the electron microscope may be operated using a removable power source, such as batteries.","In some embodiments, the vacuum is generated manually.","In some embodiments, the electron microscope includes a positioning stage that is mechanically coupled to the housing, which displaces a sample relative to the electron beam. Alternatively, the positioning stage may not displace the sample relative to the electron beam.","Furthermore, the electron microscope may include control logic that deactivates the vacuum-generating mechanism and\/or the electron emitter during a standby operating mode, and that activates the vacuum-generating mechanism and\/or the electron emitter during a normal operating mode.","Additionally, the electron microscope may include a valve (or a relay or another device) that selectively mechanically couples the vacuum-generating mechanism and the housing. The control logic may provide first control signals to the valve so that the valve selectively mechanically decouples the vacuum-generating mechanism and the housing and\/or the sample during the standby operating mode. Then, during the normal operating mode, the control logic may provide second control signals to the valve so that the valve selectively mechanically couples the vacuum-generating mechanism and the housing and\/or the sample.","Note that the electron microscope may be used in conjunction with another micro-analysis technique. For example, the other micro-analysis technique may include: energy dispersive x-ray analysis, optical imaging, optical microscopy, optical fluorescence imaging or spectroscopy, wavelength dispersive spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, x-ray fluorescence and\/or electron-beam backscattered diffraction.","In some embodiments, the electron microscope includes an electro-optical mechanism that is external to the cavity, which scans, deflects, focuses and\/or stigmates the electron beam. For example, the electro-optical mechanism may include: a magnetic deflection mechanism, an electron lens, a stigmator, a deflector and\/or an alignment coil. Furthermore, the electron emitter may include an electrode that forms the electron beam.","Note that the electron microscope may include multiple electron emitters and associated housings, which facilitate faster imaging or writing. Additionally or separately, at least the electron emitter and\/or the housing may be fabricated using a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication technology.","Another embodiment provides an x-ray source that uses the electron beam provided by the electron microscope.","Another embodiment provides a method for generating the electron beam for use in the electron microscope. During this method, the reduced pressure greater than or equal to the medium vacuum is provided in the cavity that includes the electron emitter at least during the operation of the electron microscope. Then, the electron beam is generated in the cavity using the electron emitter at least during the operation of the electron microscope.","Another embodiment provides a method for using an electron microscope. During this method, the opening of the housing in the electron microscope, which includes the electron emitter within the cavity defined at least in part by the wall of the housing, is positioned over a sample, thereby making at least a partial vacuum seal with a surface around the sample. Then, the electron emitter provides an electron beam, which impinges on the sample.","Another embodiment provides a method for irradiating an object (such as food or a parcel) using the electron beam provided by the electron microscope, thereby sterilizing the object.","Another embodiment provides a method for inspecting an object (such as an airplane, a train, a bridge, or in failure analysis of a machine that is susceptible to stress fractures or cracks) or reviewing features on the object (which may be identified via another technique) using the electron beam provided by the electron microscope.","Another embodiment provides a method for imaging or irradiating at least a portion of an animal (such as a patient or a biological sample associated with the patient) using the electron beam provided by the electron microscope, thereby performing a diagnostic test or implementing a medical therapy.","Another embodiment provides a method for writing patterns onto a semiconductor wafer, a photo-mask, a MEMS substrate, a substrate for an optical device, or another substrate material during a lithographic process using the electron beam provided by the electron microscope.","Note that like reference numerals refer to corresponding parts throughout the drawings. Moreover, multiple instances of the same part are designated by a common prefix separated from an instance number by a dash.","The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the claims.","Embodiments of an electron microscope, associated methods, and of an x-ray source are described. This electron microscope includes an electron emitter that has an evaporation or sublimation rate that is significantly less than that of tungsten or lanthanum hexaboride at the reduced pressures around the electron emitter during operation of the electron microscope. As a consequence, the electron microscope may be able to operate at reduced pressures that are much larger than those in existing electron microscopes. For example, at least during the operation the reduced pressure in the electron microscope may be greater than or equal to a medium vacuum.","This capability may allow the electron microscope to use a medium vacuum to provide the reduced pressure instead of a high-vacuum pump, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of the electron microscope, and improving its reliability and ease of use. For example, the cost of the electron microscope may be ten times less than existing electron microscopes. Furthermore, the electron microscope may be simpler to operate. In addition, the size and weight of the electron microscope may be reduced, which may enable a hand-held or portable version of the electron microscope. Consequently, the electron microscope may provide increased commercial success, and may allow the electron microscope to be used in additional applications.","We now describe embodiments of the electron microscope.  presents a block diagram of an electron microscope . This electron microscope includes: an electron emitter -, a housing - (such as a column), and a vacuum-generating mechanism . At least during operation of electron microscope , electron emitter - provides an electron beam -. This electron emitter and the electron beam are at least partially enclosed within a cavity - defined by an inside wall - of housing -. Furthermore, vacuum-generating mechanism , which is mechanically coupled to housing -, provides a reduced pressure that is approximately greater than or equal to a medium vacuum in cavity - at least during the operation of electron microscope . For example, the medium vacuum may include a pressure approximately greater than 10Torr (such as 10Torr). Moreover, the reduced pressure may be less than or equal to atmospheric pressure, such as less than or equal to 1 Torr or less than or equal to 10Torr. Thus, the reduced pressure may correspond to a soft or low vacuum. (Note that the medium vacuum around electron emitter - in electron microscope  is distinct from a configuration in which a sample is placed in an internal chamber that is at a higher pressure than the high vacuum that is typically used around the electron emitter in electron microscopes other than the electron microscope in this discussion.)","Electron emitter - may be selected based at least on two physical properties: it should emit electrons (and, more generally, charge carriers) when operated at the reduced pressure; and it should not evaporate or sublimate quickly under these conditions. The first physical property is determined by the work function of the electron-emitter material. The work function is the energy needed to liberate an electron from a surface. For a given material, the work function is typically a combination of bulk and surface properties. That is because many materials that are good emitters can easily become poor emitters depending on the vacuum conditions. Because the work function depends on the details of the very top monolayer of atoms on the surface of the electron emitter, it can be difficult to predict, a priori, how a given material will behave in a poor vacuum (such the soft or low vacuum during the operation of electron microscope ). Note that the top layer of atoms can be the electron-emitter material, something adsorbed onto the surface, or an impurity from the bulk has segregated to the surface. Depending on the chemistry of the top few layers, these can either poison electron emission or improve it. As a practical matter, it is often necessary to measure the work function of an electron emitter under the conditions that it will be operated in order to know how well it will emit electrons.","The second of these physical properties determines the lifetime of electron emitter -. If the bulk material evaporates quickly, as it does with tungsten or lanthanum hexaboride in an oxygen-containing environment (such as air or water vapor), then the electron emitter may either mechanically fail or may change its position within the electron optics of electron microscope . The former cannot be corrected. For example, if a tungsten wire in a so-called \u2018hairpin\u2019 configuration breaks, the electron emitter is dead. However, if the electron emitter has a so-called \u2018pointed rod\u2019 configuration, then as the rod evaporates it grows shorter, changing the electric fields that extract the electrons. This change in geometry can be somewhat compensated by adjusting the extraction voltage. Lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten Schottky emitters fall into this latter category.","Based on this discussion, to ensure a sufficient lifetime (such as 50-2000 hours) at the reduced pressure, electron emitter - may have an evaporation or sublimation rate that is significantly less than that of tungsten or lanthanum hexaboride at the reduced pressure in cavity -, such as an evaporation or sublimation rate that is at least two orders of magnitude smaller. Note that a mounting or fixture that holds electron emitter - may include a variety of construction materials. (For example, electron emitter - may be held by a carbon support structure, which in turn is mechanically and electrically coupled to molybdenum contacts. During operation of electron emitter -, electrical current may be passed through the carbon support via the molybdenum contacts, thereby heating electron emitter -.) In the present discussion, electron emitter - refers to a material or materials that emit the electrons for electron beam -. In some embodiments, electron emitter - is a ceramic, such as a carbide-based material that has a low oxidation rate even at high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. The oxides of many carbide-based materials are not typically volatile, and therefore the evaporation or sublimation of electron emitter - may be reduced or eliminated when at the reduced pressure during the operation of electron microscope . In particular, the oxide typically forms a protective layer over the carbide-based material, thereby inhibiting further oxidation (thus, the oxide may be self-limiting). Consequently, carbide-based materials usually exhibit \u2018parabolic kinetics,\u2019 in which the oxide is self-passivating and grows more and more slowing with time (for example, varying as the square root of time).","In some embodiments, electron emitter - may include a bulk or a thin-film outer coating of: hafnium carbide (HfC), hafnium dioxide, hafnium diboride, hafnium nitride, zirconium carbide, zirconium dioxide, zirconium diboride, tantalum carbide, tantalum diboride, tantalum nitride, rhenium, boron nitride, titanium carbide, niobium carbide, thorium dioxide and\/or compounds that include two or more of these compounds (which may include non-stoichiometric compounds, such as HfCor HfC). This electron-emitter material may be crystalline, polycrystalline or amorphous, and may include additional materials, such as silicon dioxide, cerium oxide (which is sometimes referred to as \u2018ceria\u2019), etc., to improve mechanical and\/or electrical properties. If a thin-film outer coating is used, a wide variety of materials may be used for the substrate. More generally, the electron emitter may include a material other than: tungsten, lanthanum diboride, lanthanum hexaboride, a carbon nanotube, another allotrope of carbon and\/or cerium hexaboride.","Moreover, carbide-based materials, such as hafnium carbide or zirconium carbide, have been found to exhibit improved electron emission in environments that contain oxygen. Consequently, the reduced pressure during the operation of electron microscope  may not poison the surface and prevent emission by electron emitter -.","In some embodiments, during the operation electron emitter - may be heated above ambient temperature, may be cooled below ambient temperature or may be at approximately ambient temperature. Note that electron emitter - may operate in a space-charge limited mode, a temperature-limited mode or somewhere in-between. Alternatively or additionally, electron emitter - may be a photo-emitter, in which electrons are emitted due to the photoelectric effect. Alternatively or additionally, electron emitter - may be a field emitter or a field-enhanced emitter, such as a Schottky emitter or a thermal field emitter.","Because electron emitter - has a significantly smaller evaporation or sublimation rate, the reduced pressure in cavity - at least during the operation of electron microscope  may be larger than that used in existing electron microscopes. Consequently, lower cost materials (such as those that are not compatible with high-vacuum systems) may be used in housing -. For example, housing - may include plastic. Furthermore, vacuum-generating mechanism  may be simpler (for example, it may use a single pump as opposed to a multi-stage pumping system), may be more reliable, and may have lower cost than the vacuum-generating mechanisms in existing electron microscopes. For example, vacuum-generating mechanism  may include a medium-vacuum pump (such as a roughing pump, a sliding-vane rotary pump, a rotary-piston pump, a rotary-plunger pump, a roots pump, an absorption pump, a diaphragm pump, a drag pump and\/or a scroll pump) instead of a high-vacuum pump (such as a turbo-molecular pump, a diffusion pump, an ion pump, a cryopump and\/or a sublimation pump). Therefore, vacuum-generating mechanism  may be incapable of generating a vacuum that is better than the medium vaccuum. However, a wide variety of vacuum-generating mechanisms may be used in electron microscope , such as a getter pump or a manual vacuum-generating mechanism.","Upper bounds on the reduced pressure in cavity - may be determined based at least on electron scattering and\/or arching. In particular, if the reduced pressure in cavity - is raised too high, a significant fraction of electrons will scatter from gas atoms before they hit sample . This may reduce the image contrast, thereby reducing the resolving power of electron microscope . Using a Monte Carlo model, electron scattering at low vacuum levels can be calculated. For example, at a pressure of 10Torr (in air), an electron-beam energy of 15 kV, and a working distance of 10 cm, it is estimated that only 5% of electron beam - may be scattered by the gas. While this may result in a 5% loss of contrast, and a 2.5% decrease in signal-to-noise, the impact is insignificant.","Furthermore, if the reduced pressure in cavity - is increased too much, vacuum arcing may occur. The Paschen Curve specifies the minimum voltage needed to create an arc due to gas pressure. At a pressure of 10Torr (in air), and an electrode separation of one inch, the gas breakdown voltage is close to 100 kV, which is well above the typical operating voltage of electron microscope . Consequently, electron microscope  may be operated at reduced pressures that are less than or equal to atmospheric pressure, such as less than or equal to 1 Torr.","Note that electron microscope  may include an optional positioning stage  (such as a bellows) that is mechanically coupled to housing -, and which may or may not displace sample  relative to electron beam -. (Thus, housing - may mechanically couple to a sample chamber such as cavity -, optional positioning stage , or both, for example, via a proprietary mechanical interface.) This stage may be located outside of cavity -, i.e., outside of the reduced-pressure region. In some embodiments, optional positioning stage  is removeable, for example, it may be located proximate to or as part of a door (not shown) to housing -. Furthermore, electron microscope  may include control logic  that deactivates electron emitter - and\/or vacuum-generating mechanism  during a standby operating mode, and that activates electron emitter - and\/or vacuum-generating mechanism  during a normal operating mode. As described further below with reference to , this may be of use in a portable or hand-held embodiment of the electron microscope.","In some embodiments, electron emitter - includes an optional electrode - that forms electron beam -. Furthermore, electron microscope  may include one or more optional electro-optical (EO) mechanism(s)  that is external to cavity -, and which scans, deflects, focuses and\/or stigmates electron beam -. For example, optional electro-optical mechanisms  may include: a magnetic deflection mechanism, an electron lens, a stigmator, a deflector and\/or an alignment coil. In addition, electron microscope  may include one or more detectors . These detectors may include secondary electron (SE), back-scattered electron (BSE) and\/or in-lens detectors. Furthermore, detector(s)  may be located on the opposite side of the sample from electron emitter -, in order to detect and image transmitted electrons, for example, as is the case in a transmission electron microscope (TEM).","Moreover, electron microscope  may be used in conjunction with another micro-analysis technique, such as that provided at least in part by optional micro-analysis mechanism  (which may be a source, a detector and\/or an analyzer), and which may share some of the same components as electron microscope  (such as control logic , housing - or optional positioning stage ). For example, the other micro-analysis technique may include: energy dispersive x-ray analysis, optical imaging, optical microscopy, optical fluorescence imaging or spectroscopy, wavelength dispersive spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, x-ray fluorescence and\/or electron-beam backscattered diffraction. As described further below with reference to , in some embodiments the source for the other micro-analysis technique may involve electron beam -.","Note that while electron microscope  is shown with EO mechanism  external to housing -, some or all of EO mechanism  may also be located within housing -. Furthermore, while electron microscope  is illustrated with a single electron emitter -, in other embodiments there may be multiple electron emitters and\/or associated housings. This may facilitate a higher total electron-beam current, and thus faster imaging or writing using the electron microscope. This is shown in , which presents a block diagram of an electron microscope  with multiple electron emitters  and associated housings . Note that at least one or more of the electron emitters , optional electrodes , EO mechanism , and\/or associated housings  (such as electron emitter - and\/or housing -) may be fabricated using a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) fabrication technology.","As noted previously, by operating at the reduced pressure, the size, weight and\/or power consumption of the electron microscope can be reduced so that it may be portable or even hand-held. This is shown in , which presents a block diagram of an electron microscope . In this electron microscope, housing  has an opening  defined by an edge  of housing . However, in some embodiments, instead of opening , housing  includes an electron-permeable window in a region defined by edge .","Furthermore, electron microscope  may include an optional seal  (such as a sliding seal or a differentially-pumped airbearing) that is mechanically coupled to housing , which removeably mechanically couples housing  to a surface external to the electron microscope (as described further below with reference to ). This optional seal may facilitate displacement of housing  along the surface when housing  is mechanically coupled to the surface. As described further below with reference to , this capability, in conjunction with or separately from the reduced size of electron microscope , may facilitate additional applications of electron microscope , such as sliding opening  over the surface while performing failure analysis of an object, such as an airplane wing.","In some embodiments, electron microscope  includes an optional filter  to remove particulate matter from the cavity at least during the operation of the electron microscope. For example, optional filter  may include an electrostatic filter. Note that optional filter  may be replaceable. In addition, in some embodiments electron microscope  includes an optional removable power source  (such as one or more batteries).","As shown in , which presents a drawing illustrating use of electron microscope  (), in an exemplary embodiment opening  may be positioned over a current sample  or a region to which electrons will be impinged upon (such as a portion of an object) during the standby operating mode, and optional seal  may provide at least a partial vacuum seal with a surface  surrounding sample . Then, control logic  may provide one or more signals that transition the electron microscope to the normal operating mode, thereby activating electron emitter - and\/or vacuum-generating mechanism . In some embodiments, optional seal  allows the electron microscope to be displaced or moved along surface , thereby dynamically changing sample .","Furthermore, prior to operation, control logic  may provide one or more first signals to an optional valve  (or a relay or another device) in electron microscope  so that optional valve  selectively mechanically couples vacuum-generating mechanism  and housing  and\/or the sample (such as sample  in ). When this occurs, optional filter  may remove large particulate matter that entered cavity - when opening  was positioned over sample . (Similarly, when electron microscope  is transitioned to or in the standby operating mode, control logic  may provide the one or more second signals to optional valve  so that optional valve  selectively mechanically decouples vacuum-generating mechanism  and housing  and\/or the sample, i.e., optional valve  may seal off vacuum-generating mechanism  from cavity -.)","As noted previously, in some embodiments electron beam - may be used as a source in another micro-analysis technique. This is shown in , which presents a block diagram of an x-ray source . In particular, x-rays  are provided by x-ray source  by imaging electron beam - on a target .","The preceding embodiments of the electron microscope may be used in a wide variety of devices or systems, including those that uses an electron beam to image the sample, such as in: a scanning electron microscope (SEM), a transmission electron microscope (TEM), a scanning-transmission electron microscope (STEM), a low-energy electron microscope (LEEM), a secondary emission electron microscopes (SEEM), a mirror-electron microscope (MEM), and\/or a variation on these types of microscopes. In addition, the preceding embodiments of the electron microscope may be used in displays (such as a television) and\/or in a communication system (such as in a traveling wave tube).","While the present disclosure has been described in connection with specific embodiments, the claims are not limited to what is shown. Consequently, electron microscope  (), electron microscope  (), electron microscope  (), and\/or x-ray source  may include fewer components or additional components. For example, in  there may be a vacuum valve between housing - and cavity - or optional positioning stage  that is either manually or automatically actuated, such as by control logic . Moreover, two or more components may be combined into a single component and\/or a position of one or more components may be changed.","In some embodiments, electron emitter - () includes an optional identifier  (), such as an integrated circuit, a register, a resistor, a fuse, or a radio-frequency identifier tag, that specifies a manufacturer of electron emitter - (), and thus a suitability for use in the embodiments of the electron microscope. Note that if optional identifier  () is an integrated circuit, some of the functionality of electron microscope  () may be implemented using this integrated circuit. In particular, optional identifier  () may, at least in part, facilitate the implementation of an electron emitter with a regulated output. This may be of use in embodiments, such as electron microscope  (), in which there are multiple electron emitters  (). Alternatively or additionally, the interface between the housing - () and optional positioning stage  () may include an optional identifier, such as a mechanical or electrical register that specifies the manufacturer of optional positioning stage  () or housing - ().","In the preceding embodiments, some components are shown directly connected to one another, while others are shown connected via intermediate components. In each instance the method of interconnection, or \u2018coupling,\u2019 establishes some desired electrical or mechanical functionality between two or more components in these devices. Such coupling may often be accomplished using a number of configurations, as will be understood by those of skill in the art, including adding additional intervening components and\/or removing intervening components.","In some embodiments, functionality in these circuits, components and devices is implemented in hardware and\/or in software as is known in the art. For example, some or all of the functionality of these embodiments may be implemented in one or more: application-specific integrated circuit (ASICs), field-programmable gate array (FPGAs), and\/or one or more digital signal processors (DSPs). Additionally, a portion of the software (such as core functionality in an embedded operating system that prevents damage to the electron microscope) may be closed to users other than a manufacturer or supplier of the electron microscope, while another portion of the software (such as an application programming interface) may be \u2018open\u2019 to these users. In this way, an open-source community may generate user applications, which are stored on one or more computer-readable media, and which execute on or in conjunction with the electron microscope.","Furthermore, circuits in the preceding embodiments may be implemented using bipolar, PMOS and\/or NMOS gates or transistors, and signals in these embodiments may include digital signals that have approximately discrete values and\/or analog signals that have continuous values. Additionally, the circuits may be single-ended or differential, and\/or may be multiplexed or use multiple connections.","We now describe embodiments of methods of generating an electron beam in an electron microscope (such as the electron microscopes in ) and using the electron beam provided by the electron microscope.  presents a flow diagram of a method  for generating an electron beam for use in an electron microscope. During this method, the reduced pressure greater than or equal to the medium vacuum is provided in the cavity that includes the electron emitter at least during the operation of the electron microscope (operation ). Then, the electron beam is generated in the cavity using the electron emitter at least during the operation of the electron microscope (operation ).","In some embodiments, a sample is optionally positioned in the cavity in the electron microscope, and a door to the housing in the electron microscope may be optionally closed, prior to providing the reduced pressure (operation ).","As noted previously in the discussion of , the electron microscope may include opening , which may facilitate additional uses and applications. This is shown in , which presents a flow diagram of a method  for using an electron microscope. During this method, the opening of the housing in the electron microscope, which includes the electron emitter within the cavity defined at least in part by the wall of the housing, is positioned over a sample (operation ), thereby making at least a partial vacuum seal with a surface around the sample. Then, the vacuum-generating mechanism in the electron microscope optionally provides the reduced pressure in the cavity (operation ). Next, the electron emitter provides the electron beam, which impinges on the sample (operation ).","In some embodiments, methods  () and\/or  include additional or fewer operations. Moreover, the order of the operations may be changed and\/or two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.","Thus, the embodiments of the electron microscope may facilitate a wide variety of uses and applications, including those that utilize a portable or hand-held electron microscope. For example, the electron beam provided by the preceding embodiments of the electron microscope may be used to irradiate an object, such as food or a parcel (or, more generally, an object that is shipped or mailed), thereby sterilizing the object, i.e., eliminating or reducing the presence of pathogens (such as bacteria or instances of a virus). Alternatively or additionally, the electron beam provided by the preceding embodiments of the electron microscope may be used to inspect an object (such as an airplane, a train, a bridge, or in failure analysis of a machine that is susceptible to stress fractures or cracks) or to review features on the object (which may be identified via another technique).","In some embodiments, the electron beam provided by the preceding embodiments of the electron microscope is used to image or irradiate at least a portion of an animal (such as a patient or a biological sample associated with the patient), thereby performing a diagnostic test or implementing a medical therapy. For example, opening  in housing  () may make a partial vacuum seal with a body part of a human or an animal. Then, the electron beam may be used to image or perform spectroscopic analysis on a suspicious growth, such as a mole on a patient's skin. In some embodiments, results of these measurements may be analyzed by software and\/or hardware that is in or associated with the electron microscope to assist a healthcare provider (such as a physician) in determining if the growth may be cancerous, in which case a biopsy may be performed.","More generally, the electron microscope may be used to study biological samples, such as samples on glass slide (which may include wet biologic or in-vivo samples). In particular, opening  () may be positioned on the glass slide to form at least a partial vacuum seal, thereby allowing rapid electron-beam imaging and\/or micro-analysis to be performed. As described previously with reference to , this approach and\/or the use of optional seal  () may allow the electron microscope to be used in automated or continuous processing of a wide variety of biological and non-biological samples.","In some embodiments, the electron beam provided by the preceding embodiments of the electron microscope is used to write patterns onto: a semiconductor wafer (such as silicon), a photo-mask, a MEMS substrate, a substrate for an optical device, and\/or another substrate material during a lithographic process. For example, the photo-mask may include: a chromium-on-glass photo-mask, an alternating phase-shifting photo-mask, an attenuating phase-shifting photo-mask, and\/or a multiple-exposure photo-mask (i.e., those where patterns printed using two or more photo-masks are combined to produce a desired pattern). Thus, the electron beam may be used to fabricate or repair the photo-mask. Furthermore, the lithographic process may include a direct-write lithographic process or a photo-lithographic process, including those with positive or negative photo-resist materials.","While the preceding examples illustrate several of the applications of the embodiments of the electron microscope, there are many additional applications, including in: the cosmetic industry, forensics, the pharmaceutical industry, biomedical applications, paper manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, steel manufacturing, the food industry, semiconductor fabrication, optics or photonics, and\/or MEMS manufacturing and inspection. For example, the ability to operate at or above medium vacuum permits the elecron microscope to be integrated into process equipment, such as semiconductor fabrication equipment, including but not limited to: etching and deposition systems and\/or metrology and inspection equipment. Alternatively or additionally, the electron microscope may be integrated with systems that utilize statistical process control (SPC) or factory automation.
