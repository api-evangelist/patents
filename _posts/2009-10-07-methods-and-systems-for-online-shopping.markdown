For example, at step , a catalog mode can be provided. A catalog mode provides a user with the ability to view and navigate a website's current catalog of products (e.g., all of which may be available for purchase during the visit). At step , a closet mode may be implemented. The closet mode provides shoppers with the ability to add items from the catalog to a personal closet to store the item indicating a state of added interest while the shopper is in the website and wherein the shopper can add items from the closet to a shopping basket to finalize a purchase or select to remove items from the closet. The closet mode can be configured to provide a shopper with a tool that persists so that as a user moves to other parts of the catalog items of interest (previously added to the closet) are carried along.

For example, the site may store whether different users are friends and provide tiers of connection and by way of such relationship information, establish circles of contacts for a user. This data can be used to implement the sharing of ones closet with friends. It can also be used to provide peripheral information based on the type of relationship. For example, parents or relatives may receive visual displays about their children or relatives about items or outfits that the child or relative themselves or their friends like or dislike without sharing the child's closet with the relative (e.g., but sharing the closet with the child's friends). At step , the relationship or other information can be used to receive evaluation input (e.g., number of stars or textual input) about an outfit that a user has put in his closet. This provides an incentive to return to the website over time to see how others such as his friends have rated or given input on the clothing.","Other community tools can also be implemented as illustratively described herein such as widget. A shopper may add a widget associated with the shopping site in a third party site such as a blog or social networking site.

The ability to invoke the canvas is something that can be available from inside the closet (e.g., regardless of where a user's main panes are currently located) and can be triggered from an item or outfit, and this feature may not necessarily be tied other features described herein.","At step , a user can move an item incrementally forward and back in layers in comparison to other items on the canvas. As shown in , item  can be moved forward in the layers above item , or vice versa. Any of number of items can be moved in any level of the layer of items. The user can use a drop down menu, key menu, or other input to change the layering of the items. The layering of the items is stored and associated with the outfit for later retrieval. The ability to relayer items is something that can be available from inside the closet (e.g., regardless of where a user's main panes are currently located) and can be triggered from an item or outfit, and this feature may not necessarily be tied other features described herein.","At step , a user can inspect an item on the catalog, canvas, or closet (or any other part of the shopping site) by invoking a hover menu to appear above an icon of the item.

A button to add the item to an outfit (and canvas) may appear with the hover information, if the item is in the closet. A button to add the item to re-layer the item may appear with the hover information, if the item is in the canvas. For example, button  may enable a user to buy an outfit. The ability to display a hover box is something that can be available from inside the closet (e.g., regardless of where a user's main panes are currently located) and can be triggered from an item or outfit, and this feature may not necessarily be tied other features described herein. Processing then returns to other processing.","In some embodiments, the process of  and the interfaces of , and  may be embodied in a computer implemented method, system, apparatus or media as disclosed herein.","The foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The nature and various advantages of present inventive systems, methods, or media will become more apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 1A-1F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A-2K"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0050","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0051","num":"0050"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0053","num":"0052"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A-7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":"FIG. 8"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
