{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"p":["This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 14\/371,046 filed Jul. 8, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, which is a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7371 of PCT App. No. PCT\/EP2013\/050381, filed Jan. 10, 2013, which claims priority to German Application 102012200349.5 filed Jan. 11, 2012.","The present application relates to novel substituted fused pyrimidines and triazines, to processes for their preparation, to their use alone or in combinations for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, and to their use for producing medicaments for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of diseases, in particular for the treatment and\/or prophylaxis of cardiovascular disorders.","One of the most important cellular transmission systems in mammalian cells is cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Together with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which is released from the endothelium and transmits hormonal and mechanical signals, it forms the NO\/cGMP system. Guanylate cyclases catalyse the biosynthesis of cGMP from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The representatives of this family known to date can be divided into two groups either according to structural features or according to the type of ligands: the particulate guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by natriuretic peptides, and the soluble guanylate cyclases which can be stimulated by NO. The soluble guanylate cyclases consist of two subunits and very probably contain one haem per heterodimer, which is part of the regulatory site. This is of central importance for the activation mechanism NO can bind to the iron atom of haem and thus markedly increase the activity of the enzyme. Haem-free preparations cannot, by contrast, be stimulated by NO. Carbon monoxide (CO) is also able to bind to the central iron atom of haem, but the stimulation by CO is much less than that by NO.","By forming cGMP, and owing to the resulting regulation of phosphodiesterases, ion channels and protein kinases, guanylate cyclase plays an important role in various physiological processes, in particular in the relaxation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, in platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion and in neuronal signal transmission, and also in disorders which are based on a disruption of the abovementioned processes. Under pathophysiological conditions, the NO\/cGMP system can be suppressed, which can lead, for example, to hypertension, platelet activation, increased cell proliferation, endothelial dysfunction, arteriosclerosis, angina pectoris, heart failure, myocardial infarction, thromboses, stroke and sexual dysfunction.","Owing to the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects, a possible NO-independent treatment for such disorders by targeting the influence of the cGMP signal pathway in organisms is a promising approach.","Hitherto, for the therapeutic stimulation of the soluble guanylate cyclase, use has exclusively been made of compounds such as organic nitrates whose effect is based on NO. The latter is formed by bioconversion and activates soluble guanylate cyclase by attack at the central iron atom of haem. In addition to the side effects, the development of tolerance is one of the crucial disadvantages of this mode of treatment.","Some years ago, a number of substances have been described which stimulate soluble guanylate cyclase directly, i.e. without prior release of NO, such as, for example, 3-(5\u2032-hydroxymethyl-2\u2032-furyl)-1-benzylindazole [YC-1; Wu et al., 84 (1994), 4226; Miilsch et al., 120 (1997), 681]. The more recent stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase include among others BAY 41-2272, BAY 41-8543 and riociguat (BAY 63-2521) (see, for example, Stasch J.-P. et al., 2006; 5: 755-768; Stasch J.-P. et al., 2009; 4: 853-865. Stasch J.-P. et al., 2011; 123: 2263-2273). Interestingly, some of these sGC stimulators, for example YC-1 or BAY 41-2272, also exhibit PDE5-inhibitory action in addition to direct guanylate cyclase stimulation. In order to maximize the cGMP pathway, it is pharmacologically desirable to stimulate the synthesis of cGMP and simultaneously to inhibit degradation via PDE-5. This dual principle is particularly advantageous in pharmacological terms (see, for example, Oudout et al., Eur. Urol. 2011, 60, 1020-1026).","The dual principle is fulfilled in the context of the present invention when the inventive compounds exhibit an effect on recombinant guanylate cyclase reporter cell lines according to the study in B-2 as the minimal effective concentration (MEC) of \u22663 \u03bcM and exhibit inhibition of human phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) according to the study in B-6 as IC50<100 nM.","Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) is the name of one of the enzymes which cleave the phosphoric ester bond in cGMP, forming 5\u2032-guanosine monophosphate (5\u2032-GMP). In humans, phosphodiesterase-5 occurs predominantly in the smooth musculature of the corpus cavernosum penis and the pulmonary arteries. Blockage of cGMP degradation by inhibition of PDE5 (with, for example, sildenafil, vardenafil or tadalafil) leads to increased signals of the relaxation signalling pathway and specifically to increased blood supply in the corpus cavernosum penis and lower pressure in the pulmonary blood vessels. They are used for treatment of erectile dysfunction and of pulmonary arterial hypertension. As well as PDE5, there are further, exclusively cGMP-cleaving phosphodiesterases (Stasch J.-P. et al. 2011).","As stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, WO 00\/06568 and WO 00\/06569 disclose fused pyrazole derivatives, and WO 03\/095451 discloses carbamate-substituted 3-pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines. 3-Pyrimidinylpyrazolopyridines with phenylamide substituents are described in E. M. Becker et al., 1 (13), 2001. WO 2004\/009590 describes pyrazolopyridines with substituted 4-aminopyrimidines for treatment of CNS disorders. WO 2010\/065275 and WO 2011\/149921 disclose substituted pyrrolo- and dihydropyridopyrimidines as sGC activators. As sGC stimulators, WO 2012\/004259 describes fused aminopyrimidines, and WO 2012\/004258, WO 2012\/143510 and WO 2012\/152629 fused pyrimidines and triazines. WO 2012\/28647 discloses pyrazolopyridines with various azaheterocycles for treatment of cardiovascular disorders.","It was an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and as stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (dual principle) and have an identical or improved therapeutic profile compared to the compounds known from the prior art, for example with respect to their in vivo properties, for example their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and\/or their metabolic profile and\/or their dose-activity relationship.","The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00001","num":"00001"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00001","he":"48.01mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US09505786-20161129-C00001.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0001","list-style":"none"},"li":["A represents nitrogen or CR,\n    \n    ","L represents a #\u2014CRR\u2014(CRR)\u2014#group\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl or halogen,","Rrepresents benzyl,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of the N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides or salts thereof."]}},"The present invention provides compounds of the general formula (I)",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0058"},"chemistry":{"@attributes":{"id":"CHEM-US-00002","num":"00002"},"img":{"@attributes":{"id":"EMI-C00002","he":"48.01mm","wi":"69.93mm","file":"US09505786-20161129-C00002.TIF","alt":"embedded image","img-content":"chem","img-format":"tif"}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":["A represents nitrogen or CR,\n    \n    ","L represents a #\u2014CRR\u2014(CRR)\u2014#group\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, fluorine, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, (C-C)-cycloalkyl or halogen,","Rrepresents benzyl, 3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-yl, 4,4,4-trifluorobut-1-yl or 3,3,4,4,4-pentafluorobut-1-yl,\n    \n    ","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","Rrepresents hydrogen, cyano, (C-C)-alkyl, (C-C)-alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl or (C-C)-cycloalkyl,","and the N-oxides, salts, solvates, salts of the N-oxides and solvates of the N-oxides or salts thereof."]}},"Compounds according to the invention are the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, the compounds, comprised by formula (I), of the formulae mentioned below and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts and the compounds comprised by formula (I), mentioned below as working examples, and their salts, solvates and solvates of the salts, if the compounds, comprised by formula (I), mentioned below are not already salts, solvates and solvates of the salts.","Preferred salts in the context of the present invention are physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention.

The present invention therefore encompasses the enantiomers and diastereomers, and the respective mixtures thereof. The stereoisomerically uniform constituents can be isolated from such mixtures of enantiomers and\/or diastereomers in a known manner; chromatography processes are preferably used for this, in particular HPLC chromatography on an achiral or chiral phase.","Where the compounds according to the invention can occur in tautomeric forms, the present invention encompasses all the tautomeric forms.","The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound according to the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound according to the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass than the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound according to the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as H (deuterium), H (tritium), C, C, N, O, O, P, P, S, S, S, S, F, Cl, Br, I, I, I and I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound according to the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with H or C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. Furthermore, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic advantages as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds according to the invention may therefore, in some cases, also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds according to the invention can be prepared by the processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described below and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and\/or starting compounds.","Moreover, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention. Here, the term \u201cprodrugs\u201d refers to compounds which for their part can be biologically active or inactive, but are converted (for example metabolically or hydrolytically) into compounds according to the invention during their dwell time in the body.","In the context of the present invention, the substituents, unless specified otherwise, are each defined as follows:","Alkyl in the context of the invention is a straight-chain or branched alkyl radical having the number of carbon atoms specified in each case.

In all species, oral administration of the dissolved substance is performed via gavage, based on a water\/PEG400\/ethanol formulation. The removal of blood from rats is simplified by inserting a silicone catheter into the right Vena jugularis externa prior to substance administration. The operation is effected at least one day prior to the experiment with isofluran anaesthesia and administration of an analgesic (atropine\/rimadyl (3\/1) 0.1 ml s.c.). The blood is taken (generally more than 10 time points) within a time window including terminal time points of at least 24 to a maximum of 72 hours after substance administration. The blood is removed into heparinized tubes. The blood plasma is then obtained by centrifugation; if required, it can be stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until further processing.","An internal standard (which may also be a chemically unrelated substance) is added to the samples of the inventive compounds, calibration samples and qualifiers, and there follows protein precipitation by means of acetonitrile in excess. Addition of a buffer solution matched to the LC conditions, and subsequent vortexing, is followed by centrifugation at 1000 g. The supernatant is analysed by means of LC-MS\/MS using C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures. The substances are quantified via the peak heights or areas from extracted ion chromatograms of specific selected ion monitoring experiments.","The plasma concentration\/time plots determined are used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC, C, biz (terminal half life), MRT (mean residence time) and CL (clearance), using a validated pharmacokinetic calculation program.","Since the substance quantification is performed in plasma, it is necessary to determine the blood\/plasma distribution of the substance in order to be able to adjust the pharmacokinetic parameters correspondingly. For this purpose, a defined amount of substance is incubated in heparinized whole blood of the species in question in a rocking roller mixer for 20 min. After centrifugation at 1000 g, the plasma concentration is measured (by means of LC-MS\/MS; see above) and determined by calculating the ratio of the c\/cvalue.","B-5. Metabolic Study","To determine the metabolic profile of the compounds according to the invention, they are incubated with recombinant human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, liver microsomes or primary fresh hepatocytes from various animal species (e.g. rats, dogs), and also of human origin, in order to obtain and to compare information about a very substantially complete hepatic phase I and phase II metabolism, and about the enzymes involved in the metabolism.","The compounds according to the invention were incubated with a concentration of about 0.1-10 \u03bcM. To this end, stock solutions of the compounds according to the invention having a concentration of 0.01-1 mM in acetonitrile were prepared, and then pipetted with 1:100 dilution into the incubation mixture. Liver microsomes and recombinant enzymes were incubated at 37\u00b0 C. in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with and without NADPH-generating system consisting of 1 mM NADP, 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate and 1 unit glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Primary hepatocytes were incubated in suspension in Williams E medium, likewise at 37\u00b0 C. After an incubation time of 0-4 h, the incubation mixtures were quenched with acetonitrile (final concentration about 30%) and the protein was centrifuged off at about 15 000\u00d7g. The samples thus stopped were either analysed directly or stored at \u221220\u00b0 C. until analysis.","The analysis is effected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-UV-MS\/MS). To this end, the supernatants of the incubation samples are chromatographed with suitable C18 reversed-phase columns and variable mobile phase mixtures of acetonitrile and 10 mM aqueous ammonium formate solution or 0.05% formic acid. The UV chromatograms in conjunction with mass spectrometry data serve for identification, structural elucidation and quantitative estimation of the metabolites, and for quantitative metabolic assessment of the compound according to the invention in the incubation mixtures.","B-6. Inhibition of Human Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE 5)","PDE 5 preparations are obtained from human platelets by disruption (Microfluidizer\u00ae, 800 bar, 3 passes), followed by centrifugation (75 000 g, 60 min, 4\u00b0 C.) and ion exchange chromatography of the supernatant on a Mono Q 10\/10 column (linear sodium chloride gradient, elution with a 0.2-0.3M solution of sodium chloride in buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 2 mM magnesium chloride). Fractions having PDE 5 activity are combined (PDE 5 preparation) and stored at \u221280\u00b0 C.","To determine their in vitro action on human PDE 5, the test substances are dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted. Typically, dilution series (1:3) from 200 \u03bcM to 0.091 \u03bcM are prepared (resulting final concentrations in the test: 4 \u03bcM to 0.0018 \u03bcM). In each case 2 \u03bcl of the diluted substance solutions are placed into the wells of microtitre plates (Isoplate-96\/200W; Perkin Elmer). Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl of a dilution of the above-described PDE 5 preparation are added. The dilution of the PDE 5 preparation is chosen such that during the later incubation less than 70% of the substrate are converted (typical dilution: 1:100; dilution buffer: 50 mM Tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA, 0.2% BSA). The substrate, [8-H] cyclic guanosine-3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (1 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcl; Perkin Elmer) is diluted 1:2000 with assay buffer (50 mM tris\/hydrochloric acid pH 7.5, 8.3 mM magnesium chloride, 1.7 mM EDTA) to a concentration of 0.0005 \u03bcCi\/\u03bcl. By addition of 50 \u03bcl (0.025 \u03bcCi) of the diluted substrate, the enzyme reaction is finally started. The test mixtures are incubated at room temperature for 60 min and the reaction is stopped by adding 25 \u03bcl of a suspension of 18 mg\/ml yttrium scintillation proximity beads in water (phosphodiesterase beads for SPA assays, RPNQ 0150, Perkin Elmer). The microtitre plates are sealed with a film and left to stand at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, the plates are analysed for 30 s per well in a Microbeta scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer). ICvalues are determined using the graphic plot of the substance concentration against percentage PDE 5 inhibition.","Representative ICvalues for the inventive compounds are reproduced in the table below (Table 3):",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0952","num":"1690"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":[{},"TABLE 3"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]},{"entry":[{},"Example No.","IC[nM]"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":{"entry":{}}}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"char","char":"."}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"126pt","align":"char","char":"."}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"1","1200"]},{"entry":[{},"2","490"]},{"entry":[{},"3","2400"]},{"entry":[{},"4","1300"]},{"entry":[{},"5","260"]},{"entry":[{},"5-1","350"]},{"entry":[{},"5-2","250"]},{"entry":[{},"6","1100"]},{"entry":[{},"7","340"]},{"entry":[{},"7-1","200"]},{"entry":[{},"7-2","350"]},{"entry":[{},"8","150"]},{"entry":[{},"9","2000"]},{"entry":[{},"10","15"]},{"entry":[{},"11","250"]},{"entry":[{},"12","580"]},{"entry":[{},"13","660"]},{"entry":[{},"14","2000"]},{"entry":[{},"15","40"]},{"entry":[{},"16","410"]},{"entry":[{},"17","260"]},{"entry":[{},"18","150"]},{"entry":[{},"19","38"]},{"entry":[{},"20","920"]},{"entry":[{},"21","22"]},{"entry":[{},"22","130"]},{"entry":[{},"23","140"]},{"entry":[{},"24","48"]},{"entry":[{},"25","1500"]},{"entry":[{},"26","3400"]},{"entry":[{},"27","215"]},{"entry":[{},"28","310"]},{"entry":[{},"29","420"]},{"entry":[{},"30","130"]},{"entry":[{},"31","260"]},{"entry":[{},"32","110"]},{"entry":[{},"33","870"]},{"entry":[{},"34","1200"]},{"entry":[{},"35","120"]},{"entry":[{},"36","1100"]},{"entry":[{},"37","500"]},{"entry":[{},"38","690"]},{"entry":[{},"39","240"]},{"entry":[{},"40","250"]},{"entry":[{},"41","1600"]},{"entry":[{},"42","1300"]},{"entry":[{},"43","1750"]},{"entry":[{},"44","870"]},{"entry":[{},"46","120"]},{"entry":[{},"49","4000"]},{"entry":[{},"51","140"]},{"entry":[{},"52","3900"]},{"entry":[{},"53","41"]},{"entry":[{},"54","145"]},{"entry":[{},"55","190"]},{"entry":[{},"56","570"]},{"entry":[{},"57","320"]},{"entry":[{},"58","660"]},{"entry":[{},"61","15"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}]}},"br":{}},"The organ-protective effects of the sGC stimulators were shown in a therapeutically relevant \u201clow nitric oxide (NO)\/high renin\u201d hypertension model in rats.
