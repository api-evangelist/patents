title: Automatic client-side user-behavior analysis for inferring user intent
abstract: User intent may be inferred from mouse movements made within a user interface. Client-side instrumentation may be provided that collects mouse movement data that is provided to a classification engine. The classification engine receives the mouse movement data and creates a mouse trajectory. The mouse trajectory may be split into segments, and features associated with each segment may be determined. Features representing the context of the search, that is, content of the search result page, previous queries submitted, and interaction features such as scrolling, may be included. By examining the features associated with the mouse trajectories within the context of a search session, the user intent may be classified into categories using machine learning classification techniques. By inferring user intent, Web search engines may be able to predict whether a user's intent is commercial and tailor advertising accordingly.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61\/109,261, filed Oct. 29, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","Advertisers try to distinguish between users who are browsing and those that are searching for goods and services. Users searching for specific goods and services may be responsive to targeted, contextual advertising, while those browsing without specific commercial goal may be targeted in other ways. However, it is difficult to understand the user's mindset in the online environment, which makes it difficult for advertisers to choose the most appropriate type of targeting for their advertising campaigns.","Web search engines typically are the starting point from which users begin their browsing for goods and services. Advertisers seek to take advantage of this and may pay for selected keywords that are correlated to advertising campaigns. As such, certain advertising may be displayed in response to the keywords being entered within a user's search query. In order to determine the success of an advertising campaign, a click through rate may be determined that represents the number of times an ad is clicked divided by the number of times the ad is shown. Higher click through rates are indicative of a successful advertising campaign, whereas lower click through rates may be indicative of a poor campaign that is not targeted at the correct user base.","While valuable, click through rates do not tell the whole story of the user's interaction with the search results page. For example, they do not indicate why the user clicked on a particular result, or which other results they considered, and did not click, before making a choice. These \u201cabandoned,\u201d un-clicked ads are highly indicative of user intent, however, click through rates and other measurement techniques cannot quantify user interests from un-clicked advertisements.","User intent may be inferred from observed mouse movements made within a user interface. Mouse movements may be tracked during user interaction sessions to determine the intent behind, e.g., a search query. Client-side instrumentation may be provided that collects mouse movement data that is provided to a classification engine. The classification engine receives the mouse movement data and creates a mouse trajectory. The mouse trajectory may be analyzed to determine discrete features, such as a trajectory length, a vertical range, or a horizontal range. In addition, the mouse trajectory may be split into segments, and features associated with each segment, such as an average speed, and its average duration, a slope, and a rotation angle may be determined. Different classes of intent may be defined to distinguish user intent, such as navigational vs. informational queries, commercial vs. non-commercial searches, etc.","In some implementations, the mouse movement data may be used to determine and classify cognitive abilities of the user and provide useful diagnostic information about the user.","In some implementations, the determined state of mind, user intent, or cognitive abilities may be used to adapt a user interface in which information is presented to the user by, e.g., rearranging information, re-ranking results, and\/or by providing more relevant information or results.","The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.","In accordance with implementations disclosed herein,  is a block diagram of an example online environment . The online environment  may facilitate the identification and serving of content items, e.g., web pages, advertisements, etc., to users. A computer network , such as a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), the Internet, or a combination thereof, connects advertisers and , an advertisement management system , publishers and , user devices and , and a search engine . Although only two advertisers (and ), two publishers (and ), and two user devices (and ) are shown, the online environment  may include many thousands of advertisers, publishers, and user devices.","In some implementations, one or more advertisers and\/or may directly or indirectly enter, maintain, and track advertisement information in the advertising management system . The advertisements may be in the form of graphical advertisements, such as banner advertisements, text only advertisements, image advertisements, audio advertisements, video advertisements, advertisements combining one of more of any of such components, etc., or any other type of electronic advertisement document.","A user device, such as user device , may submit a page content request  to a publisher or the search engine  using a web browser application running on the user device . In some implementations, the page content  may be provided to web browser running on the user device in response to the request . The page content may include advertisements provided by the advertisement management system . Example user devices  include personal computers (PCs), mobile communication devices, television set-top boxes, etc. The user device is described in more detail below with reference to .","Advertisements may also be provided from the publishers . For example, one or more publishers and\/or may submit advertisement requests for one or more advertisements to the system . The system  responds by sending the advertisements to the requesting publisher or for placement on one or more of the publisher's web properties (e.g., websites and other network-distributed content).","Advertisements may also be provided through the use of the search engine . The search engine  may receive queries for search results. In response, the search engine  may retrieve relevant search results from an index of documents (e.g., from an index of web pages). Search results may include, for example, lists of web page titles, snippets of text extracted from those web pages, and hypertext links to those web pages, and may be grouped into a predetermined number of (e.g., ten) search results.","The search engine  may also submit a request for advertisements to the system . The request may include a number of advertisements desired. This number may depend on the search results, the amount of screen or page space occupied by the search results, the size and shape of the advertisements, etc. The request for advertisements may also include the query (as entered or parsed), information based on the query (such as geo-location information, whether the query came from an affiliate and an identifier of such an affiliate), and\/or information associated with, or based on, the search results. Such information may include, for example, identifiers related to the search results (e.g., document identifiers or \u201cdocIDs\u201d), scores related to the search results (e.g., information retrieval (\u201cIR\u201d) scores), snippets of text extracted from identified documents (e.g., web pages); full text of identified documents, feature vectors of identified documents, etc. In some implementations, IR scores may be computed from, for example, dot products of feature vectors corresponding to a query and a document, page rank scores, and\/or combinations of IR scores and page rank scores, etc.","The search engine  may combine the search results with one or more of the advertisements provided by the system . This combined information may then be forwarded to the user device that requested the content as the page content  to be displayed in the web browser running on the user device . The search results may be maintained as distinct from the advertisements, so as not to confuse the user between paid advertisements and presumably neutral search results.","The advertisers , user devices , and\/or the search engine  may also provide usage information to the advertisement management system . This usage information may include measured or observed user behavior related to advertisements that have been served, such as, for example, whether or not a conversion or a selection related to an advertisement has occurred.","In some implementations, the observed user behavior may include determining or inferring user intent by tracking mouse movements. Mouse movements may be tracked during user interaction sessions to determine the intent behind, e.g., a search query. The mouse movement data may be forwarded to a classification engine  that applies machine learning classification techniques to the mouse movement data to classify and determine the user's intent or state of mind. Different classes of intent may be defined to distinguish user intent, such as navigational vs. informational queries, commercial vs. non-commercial searches, etc. Yet further, the mouse movement data may be used to determine and classify cognitive abilities of the user and provide useful diagnostic information about the user. Still further, the determined state of mind, user intent, or cognitive abilities may be used to adapt a user interface in which information is presented to the user by, e.g., rearranging information, re-ranking results, and\/or by providing more relevant information or results.","Referring to , there is illustrated an operational flow of a process  to capture mouse movements. At , a browser is launched having a client-side data gather application. In some implementations, JavaScript code may be included into a toolbar loaded as the browser launches to track the user behavior of searching and browsing. For example, a LibX toolbar may be loaded as a library-specific extension for the Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers to enables users to search and use services offered by libraries.","In some implementations, the JavaScript instrumentation code may be downloaded automatically by including it with the content returned to the browser. This implementation does not require a toolbar application to be downloaded and installed as part of the web browser.","In some implementations, the client-side data gathering application may be a Java applet, Active Server Page (ASP), .Net, or ActiveX control downloaded to the browser from the server.","At , a page request is made and content received. This may occur when the user enters a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into an address bar of the browser, selects a bookmark\/favorite, enters a search string into the toolbar, or enters a search string into a text box on a displayed web page. The request is made to a target web server or service (e.g., search server ) when the user presses an enter key on the keyboard, clicks a search button, or clicks a \u201cgo\u201d arrow provided on the browser navigation controls. Content may be received from the web server or service as web pages, search results, advertisements, etc.","At , the client-side application executes to gather data about a user's interaction with the returned content. For example, the JavaScript code may sample events such as mouse movements on a web search result page. An on Mousemove event is fired each time a user moves the mouse one pixel. Mouse movements may be sampled by capturing the mouse coordinates as the on Mousemove events are fired. Additional events such as page scroll, mouseDown, mouseUp, etc. are also captured.","At , it is determined if a threshold number of events has been sampled. For example, the JavaScript code may capture the user's mouse coordinates at every one out of ten on Mousemove events (however, if the user moves the mouse too fast, ten on Mousemove events may result in a trajectory of more than ten pixels). Other movement amounts may be specified in accordance with on Mousemove events.","If the threshold number of events has been reached, then the mouse coordinates may be captured at  as mouse movement data. For example, the mouse movement data (events) may be encoded in a string stored in a buffer on the user device . Once the buffer is filled, the string may be forwarded to the classification engine  for classification of the mouse movement data. If the threshold has not been reached, then the process loops back to .","At , it is determined if a stop indication has been received. For example, the user may click a link on the displayed web page, enter a new URL, close the browser, change behavior, or a predetermined time out period may expire, etc. to indicate that he\/she has completed a review of the displayed page or has selected an organic result or ad placed on the results page. The process  then ends. In some implementations, the process  may loop back to  upon receiving another page request or new content in the browser to perform additional mouse movement data gathering.","In some implementations, to utilize mouse movement data to determine or infer user intent, training data may be developed by randomly sampling known query instances made to a search engine, such as the GOOGLE search engine. Using the process , or similar to ascertain mouse movement, a first representation of mouse movement data may be ascertained. As shown in , for a search results page , mouse movements with the page  may have a trajectory . The trajectory has a horizontal range, a vertical range and a trajectory length that may be sampled.","The queries made to the search engine may be manually classified as, e.g., either navigational or informational. User initiated mouse movements associated with viewing the query results may be correlated into trajectories. Statistics for a sample set of trajectories are shown in Table 1, where is it shown that the average trajectory length of navigational queries is shorter than that of informational queries. The average vertical range of the informational queries is larger, while their horizontal range is relatively smaller than that of navigational queries. Thus, it may be concluded that for navigational queries, users often go directly to the interested result (spending little time on reading the page), whereas for informational queries, users spend more time reading the result page (which results in longer and more complex mouse trajectories).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"70pt","align":"center"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 1"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Type","Navigational","Informational"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Average trajectory length (px)","738 (\u03c3 = 325)","1,297 (\u03c3 = 1,162)"]},{"entry":["Average vertical range (px)","253 (\u03c3 = 77)\u2002","374 (\u03c3 = 177)"]},{"entry":["Average horizontal range (px)","552 (\u03c3 = 228)","526 (\u03c3 = 244)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"From this information, training data may be developed to seed a machine learning classification system with data about navigational and informational queries such that automatic classification may be performed using mouse movements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIGS. 5A-5B","FIG. 5A","FIG. 5B"]},"Additionally or alternatively, a second representation of the mouse movements may be ascertained. As shown in , to distinguish the patterns in different stages of the user interactions with the search results, the mouse trajectory  within the search results page  may be broken into five stages: an initial stage (segment ), an early stage (segment ), a middle stage (segment ), a late stage (segment ), and an end stage (segment ). Information such as speed, acceleration, rotation and other precise characteristics of the mouse movements may be used to infer intent.","Each of the five segments may contain 20% of the sample points of the trajectories . Other percentages may be applied to each of the segments. Then, for each segment of the mouse trajectory the average speed, average acceleration, slope and the rotation angle between the current segment and the segment connecting the beginning and the end (the click position) of the trajectories may be determined.

In a sample set of data containing commercial and non-commercial queries, such features may capture a user's commercial or non-commercial interest in a fine-grained manner (e.g., a user moves the mouse towards her interested ads without hovering the mouse over them). The sample set also provides an understanding of the contribution of the features identified in Table 2. For example, Table 3 shows the information gain of each feature. As shown, the more relevant features include trajectory length, vertical and horizontal range, and different aspects of mouse trajectories (e.g., rotation, slope, speed) in the initial and end stages.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00003","num":"00003"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"112pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":[{"entry":"TABLE 3"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["Information",{}]},{"entry":["Gain","Feature"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["0.305\u2002","RotationAngle (segment 5)"]},{"entry":["0.2273","Slope (segment 5)"]},{"entry":["0.1996","Slope (segment 1)"]},{"entry":["0.196\u2002","TrajectoryLength"]},{"entry":["0.1848 ","RotationAngle (segment 1)"]},{"entry":["0.1601","VerticalRange"]},{"entry":["0.1436","HorizontalRange"]},{"entry":["0.1037","AvgSpeed (segment 5)"]},{"entry":["0.0708","AvgSpeed (segment 1)"]},{"entry":["0.0678","RotationAngle (segment 2)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}}},"In some implementations, training data or manual labeling may not be used to seed knowledge of the classification engine . Rather, certain assumptions may be made about the user's intent (e.g., all searches are non-commercial, all searches are informational, etc.) and using machine-learning techniques and feedback, classification and refinements of classification of user intent may be performed by the classification engine , as described below.","Referring to  there is illustrated an operational flow of a process  to analyze mouse movements in a search results page to determine intent. At , the user interactions are replayed. To classify query intent, the user interactions with the web page  are \u201creplayed\u201d against the results for user query. At , the replayed events are used to create the corresponding mouse trajectories  and query terms on a snapshot of the result page.","At , the trajectory is classified. Using identified features, the trajectories (interactions) may be represented as feature vectors to which machine learning\/classification methods may be used to classify query instances according to user intent. The input data provided to the machine-learning algorithm may be provided as a feature vector from each event on the trajectory , and the feature vector may be constructed from several different features (e.g., the features identified in Table 2) or segments of the trajectory data.","In some implementations, conventional machine learning classification techniques may be used at . For example, a Weka2 implementation of the Support Vector Machines (called SMO) may be used. Alternatively, the classification may be performed using decision trees. Using standard Information Retrieval (IR) and classification metrics, several methods of classification may be defined. A first is a naive baseline, where the initial guess by the classification engine  is the majority class (i.e., non-commercial). A second method is classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained using the sample set of described above with regard to commercial\/non-commercial queries. A third is a trained SVM, as noted above, that is tuned by using the Weka.SMO default parameters with the exception of: \u201cNormalizedPolyKernel-C 250007-E 2.0\u201d.","Thus, the processes of  may be used to capture mouse movements and determine or infer commercial query intent from the captured mouse movements, respectively. Mouse movements may be used to classify query intent into commercial and non-commercial classes. From the mouse movement trajectories, commercial queries may be determined even though an ad is not clicked by the user (i.e., users are likely to perform a wider horizontal range of mouse movements to hover over the ads).","For example, as shown in , the user query was \u201cnorth face backpacks sale.\u201d The results of that query are show in  with ads displayed on the right-hand side and organic results on the left-hand side. The user moved the mouse to hover over the ads, but later noticed a satisfactory result in the list of organic results. Thus, from the features associated with the mouse trajectory, it may be concluded that the user had commercial intent and that the ads were relevant to the user intent.","As shown in , the user query was \u201c\u2018hearing aid\u2019 analog.\u201d The first organic result was satisfactory to the user. The query was information in nature (non-commercial). The features associated with mouse trajectory shown in  would lead to a classification of a non-commercial intent. Here, it may be beneficial not to provide ads at all in the results display.","Additional information is included in the context (session) information of the user. That is, a model may be developed that captures both the behavior over a particular search result page, but also includes behavior from previous search pages within the session, by means of graphical models. Specific implementations may include the Conditional Random Field (CRF) or hierarchical Na\u00efve Bayes model to represent both actions on a page and transitions between searches within a session.","An example implementation using contextualized interaction mining, as outlined above, is to predict the user interest in advertising for future searches within the session. That is, our system can be used to predict future clicks on ad search results.","As another example implementation, the method could be used to predict whether to include search advertising on the search results pages for the current user based on the inferred intent. The corresponding graphical model  is shown in  where the user intent is modeled as a hidden state (e.g., R for receptive to advertising and N is for non-receptive). The system then would predict the appropriate hidden state to represent the users' state of mind, which can in turn be used to better target the search advertising.","The results of accuracy tests of one particular implementation of this idea are shown below in Table 4. The first row, QC, corresponds to a previous state-of-the-art prediction method \u201cQuery Chains\u201d, that does not consider client-side behavior.

One or more programs may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the presently disclosed subject matter, e.g., through the use of an application programming interface (API), reusable controls, or the like. Such programs may be implemented in a high level procedural or object-oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However, the program(s) can be implemented in assembly or machine language, if desired. In any case, the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and it may be combined with hardware implementations.","Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter in the context of one or more stand-alone computer systems, the subject matter is not so limited, but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment, such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further, aspects of the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices, and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include personal computers, network servers, and handheld devices, for example.","Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and\/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or acts described above. Rather, the specific features and acts described above are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 4A-4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 5A-5B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 7"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 8"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 11"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
