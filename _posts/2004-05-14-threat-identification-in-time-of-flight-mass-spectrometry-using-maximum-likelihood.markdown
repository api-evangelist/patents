abstract: A method for determining a threat substance encountered by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) using a pre-computed threat library is described. The method comprising the steps of acquiring a spectrum of a test substance, wherein the acquired spectrum is an average of individual spectra acquired from a plurality of laser shots on the analyte; identifying mass/charge (m/z) values corresponding to each of a plurality of spectral peaks of the acquired spectrum; assigning a corresponding ranking code to the acquired spectrum based on the plurality of its spectral peaks and troughs, wherein a peak presence is indicated by a numeral 1, while peak absence is indicated by a numeral 0, relative to each of a set of substances in a threat library; comparing the assigned rankings of the acquired spectrum over all threat substances stored in the threat library; and identifying the threat substance as that which produced the highest ranking.

Scott Hayek et al., the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. MDA972-01-D-0005; awarded by DARPA. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The invention relates to mass spectrometry, mass spectrometers and applications thereof.","Mass spectrometers provide a fundamental tool of experimental chemistry and have proven useful and reliable in identification of chemical and biological samples. Mass spectrometry is a technique used to determine the masses of molecules and specific fragmentation products formed following vaporization and ionization. Detailed analysis of the mass distribution of the molecule and its fragments leads to molecular identification. The combination of specific molecular identification and extreme sensitivity makes molecular spectroscopy one of the most powerful analytical tools available.","However, the typical mass spectrometer is confined to the laboratory or other fixed sites due to its relatively large size and weight, as well as its high power and cooling requirements. Thus, mass spectrometer technology has not been used as a field portable detection system. Other impediments to field use include the requirements for large amounts of fluids to collect and process samples. Field samples are often much smaller in quantity and detection of such small samples is often essential (for example, in the case of detection of a chemical or biological agent that is lethal at small doses). In addition, typical scanning mass spectrometers have high data acquisition times, which is also inconsistent with field use. Also, stationary and level mounting configurations of typical mass spectrometers are inconsistent with adaptation to field use. Rapid and frequent placement and replacement of a sample is often inconsistent with the vacuum design of the typical stationary mass spectrometer.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","10","16","18","16"]},"If there are ions of different masses, the different flight times will give rise to a number of detection times. The trigger time and the one or more detection times thus provide one or more flight time intervals which, as noted, are related to the mass of the ion. The mass of the ion is related to the flight time interval t as follows:\n\n2()()\n\nwhere D is the drift region as shown in  and eV is the acceleration energy imparted by the potential difference in the extraction region.\n","Different masses are thus determined based on the different flight times t of the ions. The TOF mass spectrometer thus records the entire mass spectrum for every ionization event that occurs to the analyte . Unlike other types of mass spectrometers, a TOF mass spectrometer does not rely on a scanning mass analyzer and therefore does not experience loss of signal due to scanning. The TOF mass spectrometer is also one of the simplest chemical analyzers, comprising principally an ion source, field-free tube for a drift region, and an ion detector, as shown in .","In addition, the TOF mass analyzer is particularly suited to measure the mass of biomolecular ions by using matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization (\u201cMALDI\u201d). With MALDI, the analyte  is mixed with an appropriate organic matrix, inserted into the ionization region (for example, in the region occupied by probe  of ), and desorbed from the surface into the TOF drift region D. The matrix absorbs radiative energy from the laser  and undergoes a phase change from solid to gas. During the phase change, the analyte gains a H+ ion and is thus accelerated by the potential difference in the extraction region, in the manner described above. MALDI treatment is particularly advantageous for ionization of larger molecules because the matrix provides a buffer between the energy of the laser and the sample. This prevents the larger molecules from being broken into small fragments, where analysis of these larger fragments simplifies the identification of the analyte.","Although ions produced by MALDI can be measured on a variety of mass spectrometers, a TOF mass spectrometer is particularly qualified for MALDI applications because it has no theoretical upper mass limit. Thus, MALDI is especially suited to the desorption of the larger macromelocules required for the application of chemotaxonomic methods. Larger mass ions, such as proteins and fragments of DNA strands, are still readily processed since they only take more time to reach the detector. Consequently, both the absence of any scanning requirement and an unlimited mass range make TOF mass spectroscopy a popular method for biomolecular analysis using MALDI.","For example, recent development of TOF mass spectroscopy using MALDI has included the detection of biological weapons whose mass signatures are often found in the 10 to 100 kDa range. Another valuable application is its ability to identify peptides and proteins with very high specificity and sensitivity. This area has led to the commercial development of TOF mass spectrometers for drug development in the pharmaceutical industry. Such applications indicates that TOF mass spectrometers are also well suited for biological threat detection of mid-range toxins (on the order of 1000 to 50,000 Da) in which subfemtomole sensitivity is required.","The resolution that arises from the lack of scanning has been exploited in the laboratory for many years, and the additional advantages that arise due to the TOF mass analyzer's ability to measure the mass of biomolecular ions by using MALDI has been exploited for approximately 10 years. However, the linear TOF mass spectrometer is inconsistent with use as a field portable detection system. One problem associated with adapting a linear TOF mass spectrometer includes limitations relating to mass resolution. Mass resolution of the linear TOF mass spectrometer is expressed in time units as t\/2t, where t is the total flight time and t is the peak width of each TOF mass peak in the recorded spectrum. (The peak width arises principally from a small spread of energy (eV\u2200U) imparted to ions of the same mass by the potential difference.) Therefore, assuming a constant peak width t for each ion packet (group of ions having the same mass, with the mentioned energy spread), a longer total flight time will produce a larger dispersion between ions of different masses and thus increased resolution. Accordingly, many linear TOF mass spectrometers have used long drift regions to maximize mass resolution. A long drift region, of course, is incompatible with use as a field portable detection system.","A variation of the linear TOF mass spectrometer, known as the reflector or reflectron TOF mass spectrometer, is as shown in . Like the mass spectrometer of , a laser  desorbs and ionizes an analyte , which is accelerated by the potential difference V across the extraction region and into the drift region. However, the ions travel into a reflector or reflectron region at the end of the drift region, which applies a voltage that increases linearly with distance that the ion penetrates the reflectron region (as shown in ). The ion reflector or reflectron generally comprises a series of equally spaced conducting rings that form a retarding\/reflecting field in which the ions penetrate, slow down gradually, and reverse direction, thereby reflecting the ion's trajectory back along the incoming path, as shown in . Ions of a given mass pass into the reflector and are turned around at the same nominal depth within the retarding field. As shown in , however, the energy spread \u2200Ufor ions of the same mass having a nominal energy eV results in ions having the same mass penetrating the reflector slightly more or less than the nominal depth of an ion of energy eV. Because ions having a higher energy (and velocity) penetrate deeper into the opposing field, they spend more time in the reflectron and will lag slower ions having the same mass upon exiting the reflectron. However, the lagging ions exit the reflectron at a higher velocity and thus catch up with the slower ions. Thus, instead of continuing to disperse through the drift region (as in the linear TOF mass spectrometer), the reflectron imparts a focusing effect on the ions traveling in the drift region.","For the reflectron configuration of , the time of flight is given by:\n\n(2 )exp(\u22121\/2) [L+L+4\n\nThe voltage placed on the last lens element Vis generally slightly larger than the accelerating volgate V, so that the average penetration depth d will be slightly shorter than the reflectron depth. Using this geometry, first-order kinetic energy focusing at the detector  for ions having the same mass is achieved when L+L=4d.\n","Thus, the reflectron configuration tends to improve the resolution while also providing a more compact total drift region. However, the above description applies to ions formed during the laser pulse (\u201cprompt\u201d fragmentation), not to fragment ions formed after the laser pulse that are the product of either slow unimolecular decay or bimolecular collisions (\u201cmetastable\u201d ions). If these late-forming fragment ions are created before they exit the extraction region, the resulting TOF mass peaks are asymmetrical in the time domain and exhibit skewed peak shapes. If, on the other hand, the metastable ions are formed during their flight through the drift region (e.g., by collision with background gas), they are called post-source decay (PSD) ions. PSD peaks in TOF mass spectrometer data are particularly prevalent among peptides (small fragments of proteins), due to their propensity to break the peptide linkage along the amino-acid backbone long after the initial acceleration. The PSD product ion peaks are thus attributable to amino-acid chain fragments of the original peptide precursor.","While detection of PSD ions can be useful in biochemical analysis due to the sequencing information they yield, detection of PSD ions can be difficult. Relying on the property that all ions acquire the same energy within the source, traditional TOF mass spectrometers function by causing dispersion of ion velocities proportional to the ions' respective masses. However, PSD product ions are formed during the drift period, thus their velocities equal that of their precursor. Hence, their energies, rather than their velocities, are dispersed in direct proportion to their masses. Under these circumstances, a linear TOF (such as that shown in ) cannot detect the presence of product ions, since their arrival at the detector occurs simultaneously with that of their parent ions (i.e., no field gradient exists to separate the ions in time).","In addition, for the reflectron TOF mass spectrometer, the fragment of a PSD ion will retain half the initial kinetic energy of the precursor ion. Hence the fragment will penetrate only halfway into the reflector shown in . If the focal point has been selected so that the total TOF drift region L=L+L=4d, as described above, then d must be reduced by a factor of 2 for focusing of the fragment. L is consequently reduced to satisfy the focusing relationship, thus the focal point for the fragment is shifted closer to the reflector. Each PSD fragment ion (as well as the original ion) is therefore focused to a different point in space.","In several commercial TOF instruments, focusing across the entire PSD spectrum is accomplished by stepping the voltage of the reflectron using 10 to 20 reflectron segments. The reflector voltage is decreased for successive laser desorption and ionization of the analyte; thus, progressively lower mass portions of the PSD spectrum are focused as the reflector voltage is decreased. The entire spectrum is then reconstituted by \u201cstitching\u201d together the individual spectral fragments, in effect, constructing a unified spectrum using the successive segments. This brute-force method of acquiring PSD spectra has the effect of converting the TOF mass spectrometer into a scanning instrument. This defeats a primary strength of the TOF mass spectrometer, namely the ability to rapidly acquire a complete mass spectrum without the need for any type of scanning procedure. As a result, precious sample may be consumed by the laser desorption process during the time required for the reflectron scanning process. Calibration is also difficult since each segment of the PSD spectrum corresponds to a different calibration curve. Additional power is also consumed.","A TOF mass spectrometer having a reflectron with an electric field determined by the equation for a circle, as shown in provides focal points that are considerably closer to one another, thus enabling the recording of ions (as well as PSD fragments of ions) over the entire mass range at high resolution from a detector located at one position in the focal region. This electric field may be accomplished by tailoring the voltages to the plates comprising the reflectron so that the voltage magnitudes for successive plates increase in accordance with the equation of a circle. Further details of such a nonlinear reflectron TOF mass spectrometer is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,985 to Cornish et al., entitled \u201cNon-linear Field Reflectron\u201d, issued Nov. 7, 1995, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","Existing methods for association of mass spectral peaks with threat substances either rely on amplitudes of mass spectral peaks, which is non-specific when using the matrix assisted laser desorption (MALDI) approach, employ heuristic rules, or use knowledge networks that can consume significant set-up and computation time. Additionally existing approaches do not utilize robust peak detection algorithms for real-time, highly accurate decomposition of a continuous spectrum into a bi-valued \u201cpeaks present\u201d spectrum.","Such existing methods include an earlier rule-based system proposed by S. Hayek and W. Doss of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU\/APL), a \u201cBayesian Belief Network\u201d approach suggested by A. Feldman and J. Lin of (JHU\/APL), a \u201cWeighted Training Set Classification\u201d approach suggested by N. Beagley, K. Wahl, S. Wunschel, K. Jarman of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and a \u201cHyperspace Feature Vector Projection\u201d approach suggested by T. Falcone of Alphatech.","One difficulty with both a linear and nonlinear reflectron TOF mass spectrometer is their use with ions having a relatively large mass. All ions lose some of their velocity in the reflectron. Particles having a large mass have a relatively slow initial speed. These particles are relatively slow moving and lose a portion of that velocity in the reflectron. Thus, detection of these ions requires the detector have a higher sensitivity, which also requires more sampling in order to distinguish from background noise.","In addition to these particular problems that render known TOF mass spectrometers inconsistent with a field portable detection system, any attempt to adapt TOF mass spectrometers to such use would also have many of the other difficulties described above for such use of mass spectrometers in general. These include the stationary and level mounting configurations of typical designs that is inconsistent with field use, vacuum designs that are often inconsistent with the need for rapid and frequent placement and replacement of samples in field use, as well as other impediments.","In addition, there is typically an abundant sample available for analysis in TOF and other mass spectrometers located in a laboratory. Thus, a highly resolved spectrum may be achieved by repeated ionization and detection of the analyte. By contrast, in the field, only a small and diffuse sample may be available for collection from the environment. In addition, for a laboratory mass spectromenter, the samples are often prepared in a liquid state and placed in the extraction region. Because the extraction region of a typical laboratory mass spectrometer is relatively large, the small protrusion of such a liquid sample into the extraction region does not provide a substantial impact on the acceleration of the emitted ions. However, if such a liquid sample were used in a more compact extraction region of a mass spectrometer adapted for portable field use, the protrusion would affect the resulting energy imparted to the ions. In addition, liquid sample preparation in a field adapted mass spectrometer would be susceptible to freezing, spoiling, etc.","Among other things, it is thus an object of the invention to provide a field portable detection system that uses a mass spectrometer. It is an object to provide such a field portable detection system that reliably and rapidly detects small levels of biological and chemical samples that are found in the field. In addition to short analysis times (for example, less than 5 minutes), it is an objective to provide a system that has high sensitivity, wide agent bandwidth, portability, low power consumption, minimal use of fluids, extended unattended operation and automated detection and classification.","Still another object of this invention is to automatically determine if a matrix assisted laser desorption (MALDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) has encountered a threat substance, by computing the likelihood of the observed \u201cpeak present\u201d spectrum (a multivariate Bernoulli random variable), given an existing threat library. Both the library and the computation of likelihood are derived from probabilities of observing individual peaks in the spectrum. This determination is robust to \u201cnoise\u201d in the MALDI mass spectrum, e.g., baseline shifts and randomness in spectral peak heights.","In using a mass spectrometer for such detection, it is an objective to rapidly collect, pre-treat and transport the sample into the sample region of the mass spectrometer. Among other things, it is an objective to provide a vacuum configuration that allows for rapid placement and re-placement of the sample within the spectrometer.","It is also an objective to provide such a field portable detection system that uses a TOF mass spectrometer. It is an objective to provide a TOF mass spectrometer that has a compact drift region and that time focuses PSD fragments of a precursor without a scanning mechanism. It is also an objective to provide rapid and reliable molecular identification by applying identification processing (for example, algorithms and rules) to the raw spectrometer data provided by a field sample.","In accordance with these objectives, the invention provides a field portable mass spectrometer system comprising a sample collector and a sample transporter. The sample transporter interfaces with the sample collector to receive sample deposits thereon. The system further comprises a time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The time of flight mass spectrometer has a sealable opening that receives the sample transported via the sample transporter in an extraction region of the mass spectrometer. The system further comprises a control unit that processes a time series output by the mass spectrometer for a received sample and identifies one or more agents contained in the sample.","The sample collector may comprise, for example, an inlet having a vacuum therein, the inlet collecting an environmental specimen via the vacuum. The sample transporter may comprise a tape that receives the sample deposits from the sample collector, the tape being received at the sealable opening of the mass spectrometer. This allows a sample thereon to be received in the extraction region of the mass spectrometer.","The sealable opening and the extraction region of the TOF mass spectrometer may be, for example, provided in a housing of the TOF mass spectrometer. The housing may further comprise a roughing vacuum chamber portion that extends from the sealable opening of the housing to a vacuum valve. The housing may further comprise a removable cover that is engageable with the sealable opening, the removable cover and the sealable opening forming a vacuum seal when engaged. A roughing pump may interface with the roughing vacuum chamber portion and serve to evacuate the roughing vacuum chamber portion when (a) the vacuum seal is formed between the removable cover and the sealable opening and (b) the vacuum valve is closed. The extraction region may be located in the roughing vacuum chamber portion and the drift region of the TOF mass spectrometer may extend from the roughing vacuum chamber portion through the vacuum valve and into a main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber. The main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber may comprise at least a part of the drift region, a detector and a reflectron. A turbo or other high vacuum pump that interfaces with the main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber may serve to evacuate the main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber. The turbo or other vacuum pump may also serve to evacuate the main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber and the roughing vacuum chamber portion when the valve is opened, thereby providing a connected vacuum between the main mass spectrometer vacuum chamber and the roughing vacuum chamber portion when the valve is opened.","The TOF mass spectrometer may comprise a linear TOF mass spectrometer and a reflectron TOF mass spectrometer. The electric field in the nonlinear reflectron may be substantially determined by the equation of a circle.","The invention also comprises a controller that processes the mass spectrum of a sample provided by a detector of a mass spectrometer, for example, by a field portable mass spectrometer system. The controller provides a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) processing of the mass spectral data received. The CFAR processes the mass spectral data to determine noise included in the mass spectral data and outputs spectral peaks when the mass spectral data exceeds a threshold that reflects the noise included in the spectral data. The output peaks are compared with spectral peaks for known threats stored in a database and a notification that a known threat is present in the sample is provided if there is a correspondence between one or more output spectral peaks and one or more spectral peaks of a known threat as stored in the database.","The processing of the mass spectral data by the CFAR to determine noise included in the mass spectral data may, for example, comprise determining an estimate of the noise for a sample test cell of the mass spectral data. The determination of when the mass spectral data exceeds a threshold that reflects the noise included in the spectral data may further comprise determining whether the mass spectral data for the sample test cell exceeds the threshold. Determination of the threshold value may comprise substituting the noise estimate in a noise distribution for the mass spectrometer.","The spectral peaks for known threats stored in the database may have a corresponding ranking code. After the comparison by the processor of the output peaks with spectral peaks for known threats stored in a database determines that one or more output peaks corresponds to one or more spectral peaks for a known threat, then the one or more ranking codes of the corresponding one or more spectral peaks for the known threat may be used to determine whether the known threat is present in the sample.","Referring to , the principle components of an embodiment of the system  of the present invention are shown. The components of the system  may be mounted atop a portable platform, within a carrying case, etc. As will become evident below, the system  is designed to run automatically. That is, it may be placed in where detection of chemical or biological agents is desired, and it will sample the environment and analyze and identify such agents on an ongoing basis.","Air or other environmental specimen is drawn (via a vacuum) into a collector  via an inlet . Upon entering the collector , the specimen passes through a concentrator  and a second stage impactor . The impactor  serves to separate particles from the airflow and provide sample deposits  on a transport tape  (described further below) through a number of impaction nozzles \u2032. The air collection portion so configured has a high throughput and high collection efficiency. Thus, a high concentration of dry particles are withdrawn from the environment and deposited on a small area of the tape  as samples , as shown. The collector  therefore collects particulate agents from the environment, such as biological agents and chemical agents that are attached to particles (such as residue of explosive material in the earth left by mine placement). Thus, samples  are not collected or transported in a liquid state, thus avoiding freezing, spoiling, etc. In addition, samples  deposited on the tape  are extremely thin, which is advantageous when introduced into the extraction region of the mass analyzer, as described further below.","Collection of the sample may be improved by using a pulsed infrared laser adjacent the inlet  and directed at the surface suspected of being contaminated or containing a specimen. The laser is optimized in wavelength, power and pulse width to that is optimized to the compound of interest. By applying a threshold power that is sufficient to thermalize the suspected chemical or biological agent into vapor, other less volatile components remain in the solid phase and thus do not contribute to background readings in the analysis. A control unit  (introduced further below) may tune the laser to a wavelength and power that corresponds to a compound input by a user (via, for example, a GUI and menu that interfaces with software in the control unit ). It may also adjust associated focusing optics (for example, by providing control signals to a stepper motor associated with focusing lenses) in order to provide the power and focusing of the laser light required for the suspected compound. A number or category of suspected compounds may also be input and the laser is tuned in succession to pulse at various wavelengths and powers associated with each while the sample is being collected. The lenses may also be adjusted in succession. Alternatively, the wavelength, power and lens position may be adjusted to one setting that takes into account each suspected compound (for example, by averaging). Pulsed laser sampling is described in further detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/208,089, entitled \u201cPulsed Infrared Laser Sampling Methodology For Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer Detection Of Particulate Contraband Materials\u201d of inventor Wayne A. Bryden, filed May 31, 2000, also owned by the assignee of the present invention. The contents of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/208,089 are hereby incorporated by reference.","After collection, the samples  are transported by the tape  for treatment and analysis. The tape  may be a standard VHS tape, which is withdrawn from a tape supply end of a videocassette \u2032 and collected at the tape collection end . The videotape  from the tape supply side lies below the impaction nozzles \u2032 (from which the samples  are deposited, as described above) and a base . Base  is movable away from the main portion of collector  (for example by a stepper motor that receives control signals from a control unit  (described below)), thereby allowing the tape  to be moved without disturbing the collected samples . The tape  is wound in a loop pattern between the drive shaft and a rubber tape roller of a first stepper motor , around a tensioning rubber tape roller , and between a drive shaft and a rubber tape roller of a second stepper motor . The tape  then passes through an input portion to the mass analyzer , as described in more detail below, and is then collected by the cassette \u2032 at the tape collection end ","Referring to , a side cross-section of the drive shafts , and the rubber tape roller , is shown, with the tape  therebetween. As shown, both the drive shafts , and the tape rollers , have a reduced diameter at a mid region M than at end regions E. The end regions E between the drive shafts , and the tape rollers , serve to pinch the edges of the tape , while the middle region M allows the sample  to pass through untouched. The friction created by pinching the tape  between the drive shafts , and the tape rollers , allows the drive shafts , to advance the tape .","Driving of the tape uses commercially available stepper motor drivers for the positioning of the tape. The embodiment of  includes a three axis stepper motor driver  that receives control signals from control unit . The stepper motor driver  independently controls first stepper motor , second stepper motor  and a third stepper motor (not shown) that serves to load the video cassette \u2032. By sending the appropriate control signals to the first stepper motor , a portion of the tape is positioned in the collector . By sending appropriate control signals to the second stepper motor  and coordinating simultaneous collection of the tape into the cassette by the third stepper motor, samples  may be positioned in the mass spectrometer vacuum interface . Thus, the tape segment associated with the collection of the samples  moves independently of the segment associated with the analysis of the samples . Thus, additional samples may be collected by the collector  while a particular sample continues to be analyzed by the mass spectrometer . When the analysis is completed, the second stepper motor  is stepped by the control unit  along with the third stepper motor to move the next sample into the mass spectrometer vacuum interface . Likewise, a sample may continue to be collected by collector  while a previously collected sample is moved into the mass spectrometer vacuum interface . When the sample collection is completed, the first stepper motor  is stepped by the control unit  to move fresh tape into the collector  for collection of a subsequent sample. Tension is maintained in the tape  during independent movement of stepper motors ,  because roller  moves against spring tension as required in the directions of the arrows shown in  associated with roller .","The stepper motors ,  (as well as the cassette stepper motor) may, of course, also be stepped together to position a collected sample  from the collector  to the mass spectrometer vacuum interface . This may occur, for example, if the sampling is initiated manually (for example, by a security office at an airport gate), or during automatic collection and processing where the analysis of the last sample has been completed before collection of the subsequent sample is completed. In either case, the control unit  keeps track of the movement of each sample  leaving the concentrator  by using magnetic write head  to write a reference marking on the tape  adjacent the exiting sample . As described below, a read head prior to the mass analyzer is used to identify and provide a position of the sample  to the control unit . (Alternatively, an optical writer and reader, for example, may be used.) Thus, the control unit  does not need to keep track of the position of the sample  while being transported between the collector  and the mass spectrometer vacuum interface . (Keeping track of the position of the samples also allows, for example, collection of multiple spots. The field analysis of some of these spots may be skipped, and the untouched sample may be retained for later analysis in a laboratory.) For ease of description, the ensuing description will focus on the collection of a single sample  by the collector  and its treatment, transport and analysis by the field portable mass spectrometer system .","After collection of sample  by collector , association of a reference marking by write head  and movement of the sample  through the tape loop of the stepper motors (described above), a magnetic read head  reads the reference marking on the tape  associated with sample  provided by write head . This identifies the sample  to the control unit  and also provides a reference position for subsequent movement by the control unit . Using the reference position, the control unit  steps stepper motor  by a known amount to position sample  adjacent the nozzle of a MALDI micro sprayer . MALDI micro sprayer  adds a small amount of MALDI matrix or other sample treatment to the sample to facilitate ionization in the mass spectrometer  (described below), especially for desorption of large macromolecules previously described. The MALDI treatment provides a small amount of matrix, thus the sample  remains relatively flat. The MALDI micro-spray does not create a liquid sample; instead the fine mist enables the matrix material to bind with the sample . In addition, the MALDI treatment occurs just prior to introduction into the mass analyzer, thus avoiding exposure to the elements and possible freezing, spoilage, etc.","The control unit  then steps stepper motor  by a known amount to move treated sample  into the mass spectrometer . The software run by the control unit  and the stepper motors position the sample  within 0.1 mm in the sample target region of the mass spectrometer , thus ensuring that the sample  is illuminated with the laser, as described further below.","The mass spectrometer  shown in  comprises ionization grid and vacuum interface , mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  and associated turbo pump  (for evacuating mass spectrometer vacuum chamber ), and ionizing laser . Since components of the mass spectrometer (housed in elements  and  as described below) of the system must be housed in a high vacuum chamber, introduction of a sample  requires that the vacuum seal be broken and re-sealed while the tape  is moved to position the sample  in the mass spectrometer .","Referring to , additional details of the ionization grid and vacuum interface  of the mass spectrometer  is shown. The interface  comprises housing  having a roughing vacuum chamber portion  therein. A sample  is introduced into the vacuum system of the mass analyzer by moving tape  so that sample  is positioned in upper opening  of roughing vacuum chamber portion . An insulating disc  surrounds the upper opening  and is supported by flange  that projects axially from the roughing vacuum chamber portion . The upper surface of the insulating disc  is flush with the upper surface of the housing , thus providing an even surface across which tape  extends. An O-ring  is positioned in circumferential groove  in the surface of the insulating disc .","With the sample  in position at the upper opening , a cover in the form of a platen  is positioned over the sample and the upper opening . Platen  is an insulating material with a thin electrode on its bottom surface, described further below. The platen  has a circumferential groove and O-ring in its bottom surface opposite the circumferential groove  and O-ring  of the insulating disc . When the platen  is positioned as shown and the roughing vacuum chamber portion  is evacuated by the roughing pump  and turbo pump  as described in further detail below, the platen  is drawn downwards and the compression of O-rings , creates a vacuum seal in the roughing vacuum chamber portion .","While the sample  is being positioned, the roughing vacuum chamber portion  is exposed to atmospheric pressure. A ball valve  is closed during the positioning process to isolate the high vacuum (micro-Torr) in the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber . This is done via a stepper motor (not shown) associated with the ball valve  that receives commands from the control unit  when a new sample  is to be positioned. The roughing pump  is switched off by the control unit  and the vacuum in roughing vacuum chamber portion  rises to atmospheric pressure. Control unit  moves platen  away from upper opening  in the Z direction by sending the appropriate stepping signals to stepper motor , which removes platen  via cantilever arms . Stepper motor  is then stepped by control unit  so that tape  positions sample  in upper opening . Because the sample  is dry and flat, it remains intact even if it engages the top surface of housing  and insulating disc  during positioning.","When the sample  is positioned, the stepper motor  is stepped by control unit  to positioned platen  against insulating disc  with O-rings , mating as described above. Referring momentarily back to , one or more pins (not shown) protruding from base  pierces tape  at piercing points (see ) adjacent sample . As seen, piercing points are closer to the circumference of opening  so that they do not interfere with the sample . Control unit  initiates a vacuum roughing pump , which evacuates the roughing vacuum chamber portion  through port . The piercing of tape  provided by piercing points facilitate the evacuation of any gas trapped between the tape  and the platen . The ball valve  is then opened and the vacuum in the roughing vacuum chamber portion  is connected with the vacuum in the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber , which, as described below, is maintained in the micro-Torr range by a turbo pump. The seal between the platen  and the O-ring  has a leak rate of less than 10cc\/s, which is well within the capability of the turbo pump to maintain the required micro-Torr vacuum.","Referring back to , laser  is used to ionize the sample  positioned as shown in . In the embodiment, laser  is a 300 \u25a1J pulsed UV laser. The laser light is delivered to the ionization grid and vacuum interface  by fiber optic transmission channel , thus providing for rugged use. A large diameter, multi-mode or specialized fiber core is used because it has a greater ability to accept and thus maximize input power than a small diameter, single-mode optical fiber core. The output beam pattern of a multimode fiber from a highly coherent light source is not Gaussian as is the case for a single-mode fiber. The beam pattern is a time and position varying \u201cspeckle\u201d pattern that is dependent on the number of propagating modes. However, the large number of propagating modes minimizes any associated effects in the ionization of the sample, described below. The fiber optic is a fused silica multimode fiber with a 100 \u25a1m core and a 140 \u25a1m cladding.","At the laser  side of the fiber optic , there is combined output coupler and power attenuator, which are well-known in the art and thus not depicted for convenience. The output coupler is a series of lenses, which focuses the beam produced by the laser (on the order of 5 mm by 7 mm) into the optical fiber core. Power coupling efficiency varies from 20% to 90% depending on the lens configuration and size of the optical core. For the above-described fiber optic there is an input power coupling efficiency on the order of 80%. This provides a compromise between coupling efficiency and the fiber flexibility needed for packaging.","As noted, the laser  side of the fiber optic  also includes a variable power attenuator for varying the output power. The attenuator comprises a stepper motor that controls the position of a variable position screw, and which is adjustable by the stepper motor to partially block the output of the beam prior to passing through the output coupling lenses described above. The stepper motor associated with the variable position screw, and thus the degree of attenuation provided by the attenuator, is controlled by control unit . The attenuation range is continuously variable from 0 dB to 30 dB. Both ends of the fiber optic, the attenuator and the output coupler have standard FC\/PC connectors.","The opposite end of the optical fiber  interfaces with the ionization grid and vacuum interface  of the mass spectrometer  as shown in . Housing  includes optical port . Cap  screws onto port . The top of cap  has an opening along the axis of the port , and an FC PC connector  projects therefrom and receives the FC\/PC connector  of the optical fiber . A focuser  comprised of a variable position biconvex lens is supported or fixed to the inside of cap . The cap  has an associated stepper motor (not shown) that receives control signals from the control unit , thus allowing the control unit  to adjust the focal length of focusing lens  by moving the cap  and lens  affixed thereto.","As seen in , laser light  emitted from the fiber  enters housing via port , and is reflected by mirror  so that it is incident on sample  positioned in optical port  of roughing vacuum chamber portion . The optical port  has a translucent surface that allows the laser light to enter the roughing vacuum chamber portion; thus, the portion of housing  that houses mirror  and photodetector  is not under vacuum. The distance from the focuser  to the sample  to be ionized is thus fixed. The magnification of the focuser is nominally 6.5 at 76 mm. The spot diameter of the light output by the fiber  is nominally 0.65 mm diameter due to the size of the fiber core and the distance of the core from the lens of the focuser . The spot diameter can thus be readily focused to a diameter from 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm at the sample .","As noted, the settings of both the attenuator and the focusing lens  are controlled by control unit  via associated stepper motors. The control unit  may thus provide a spot size and an intensity that is matched to the size of the molecule of a suspected sample type. Alternatively, the spot size and intensity may be stepped through various intensities and sizes for a sample , in order to provide good ionization of an unknown sample.","One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the fiber optic may be replaced by fixed optical elements (for example, reflecting surfaces and lenses) to direct the light emitted by the laser  onto the sample . An attenuator and focusing lens (or lenses) may also be readily incorporated into such an alternative arrangement.","The previously mentioned pulsed laser methodology described in the Bryden U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60\/208,089 referred to above (entitled \u201cPulsed Infrared Laser Sampling Methodology For Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer Detection Of Particulate Contraband Materials\u201d) may also be used to improve the ionization of the sample from the tape . As in its application to the sampling front end, the laser is optimized in wavelength, power and pulse width to provide a degree of specificity for the chemical or biological agent of interest. By applying a threshold power that is sufficient to thermalize the suspected compound into vapor, there is a more efficient ionization of suspected compound (if present in the MALDI matrix) than other less volatile components. Control unit  may tune the laser  to a wavelength and power that corresponds to a compound input by a user (via, for example, a GUI and menu that interfaces with software in the control unit ). It may also adjust the focuser  (for example, by providing control signals to a stepper motor associated with cap  and\/or attenuator screw) in order to provide the power and focusing of the laser light required for the selected compound. A number or category of suspected compounds may also be input and the laser may be tuned in succession to pulse at various wavelengths and powers associated with each while the sample is being collected. The lens may also be adjusted in succession. Alternatively, the wavelength, power and lens position may be adjusted to one setting that takes into account each selected compound (for example, by averaging).","As described above, the sample  is moved into position as shown in , a vacuum seal is created between O-rings , , the roughing vacuum chamber portion  is first evacuated by roughing pump  with ball valve  closed, and then by turbo pump of the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  with the ball valve  open. Control unit  sends control signals to laser  and, as described above, laser light is pulsed through the fiber optic  and focuser  and into housing , and reflected by mirror  onto sample . The sample  is ionized by the incident laser light, which may also involve adjusting or stepping the settings associated with the attenuator and\/or the focusing lens .","The electrode on the bottom surface of platen  is maintained at a voltage on the order of 4.6 kV and thin grid plate  inserted between flange  and insulating disc  is maintained at ground. This creates a ground plane across roughing vacuum chamber portion  as shown by the dotted line. Thus, the ions released from the sample  are accelerated by the potential difference and travel down the axis labeled Z of the roughing vacuum chamber portion  and into the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber . The segment of the roughing vacuum chamber portion  between the electrode of the platen  and thin plate  serves as the extraction region of a TOF mass spectrometer. The segment of the roughing vacuum chamber portion  below thin plate  is part of the drift region of the TOF mass spectrometer. (Additional components and the operation of the TOF mass spectrometer configuration will be described in more detail below with respect to .) A series of electrodes (not shown in ) surrounding the Z axis between the extraction region and the ball valve  serves to focus the ions along the Z axis.","Referring to , a partial perspective view of the ionization grid and vacuum interface  and mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  is shown. Aspects of the ionization grid and vacuum interface  include the insulating disc , groove , upper opening  of roughing vacuum chamber portion , roughing pump port  and port \u2032 for ball valve . The axis Z referred to in  (which is the nominal drift axis of the accelerated ions) is also shown in  as running through the center of the ionization grid and vacuum interface  and mass spectrometer vacuum chamber . The external housing  of the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  is a ruggedized vacuum housing made of stainless steel. Bottom opening  of housing  receives an internal frame  that supports additional structure of the TOF mass spectrometer, as described with respect to  below. An end cap  of internal frame  interfaces with end flange  of housing  and uses piston-type o-ring seals to provide a vacuum seal. ISO-NW flanges for three evenly-spaced access ports  also provides highly reliable sealing for the vacuum chamber provided by the housing .","Turbo pump port \u2032 provides a standard vacuum interface for turbo pump , which evacuates the housing into the micro-Torr region. The pump-down time, and hence power requirements of the chamber are reduced by adopting a cylindrical design with as little internal volume as possible.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0076","num":"0075"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["260","280","280","280","280","280","280"],"i":["a","b ","c","d "]},"As noted above, a portion of the TOF mass spectrometer is comprised of the ionization grid and vacuum interface , namely the extraction region (between platen  and thin grid plate  of ) and a portion of the drift region (below thin grid plate  of ). Thus, the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  is referred to as such because it includes many of the components of the mass spectrometer (described immediately below). However, it is understood that this terminology is a convenient reference and does not indicate a strict demarcation of the mass spectrometer components. It is also again noted that, when the spectrometer is in use, the vacuum in the ionization grid and vacuum interface  and the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  is connected.","The axis Z referred to in  (which defines the nominal drift axis of the accelerated ions) is shown in  as running through the center of mass spectrometer vacuum chamber . Comparison of  demonstrates that end plate is inserted first into the opening  of housing  and thus lies closest to ionization grid and vacuum interface . Thus, a hole in the center of end disc further defines the drift region of the mass spectrometer, which extends further into the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  along the Z axis and into the plates  of the reflectron, as described immediately below.","The mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  houses plates  of the reflectron of the TOF mass spectrometer. In particular, grooves in the interior edges of rails , support plates  and provide an insulator between the plates . (Not all of the reflectron plates  are shown in  to provide further clarity and perspective to the figure.) The reflectron is made up of 31 circular plates  with a 1.3 inch diameter hole through the center, thus allowing ions entering the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  to pass into the reflectron. As previously described, the path of travel of the ions is slowed and reversed in the reflectron and detected by ion detector , which is located closer to end plate than the reflectron. This serves to increase the drift region of the mass spectrometer in a more compact space. It is also noted that the drift region of the mass spectrometer thus extends from the electrode  that defines the end of the extraction region (visible in ) into the reflectron of the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber  of .","For the particular TOF mass spectrometer used in the embodiment, the plates step down in voltage steps starting at 6000 volts on the plate  furthest from end plate to ground for the plate  nearest end plate . A network of resistors between each plate  have values that step down the voltage according to the equation of a circle, as discussed above for the nonlinear reflectron TOF mass spectrometer. Resistors of the resistor network are not visible in , but are located at the ends of teeth of dielectric resistor stock, and extend through bores in top rail so that they are interposed between plates . Thus, ions that are accelerated along the Z axis by electrodes , in the extraction region of the roughing vacuum chamber portion  are slowed in the reflectron, reverse their direction, and are focused for detection at the detector , regardless of their mass.","In addition, the mass spectrometer includes a second detector toward the end flange  of the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber . With power not supplied to plates  of the reflectron, ions will thus travel directly to the second detector , thus providing a traditional linear TOF mass spectrometer (as in ). This mode may be selected when greater sensitivity is required, for example, where the suspected sample includes ions having a larger mass. Alternatively, the mode can be switched by control unit  while the laser is being pulsed for an unknown sample. For example, where the attenuator and focusing lens  is stepped by the control unit  so that the laser light is better matched for larger molecules, the control unit  may also simultaneously power down the reflectron and receive data from second detector ","As noted above, for a typical sample  positioned into opening, once the vacuum is established and the ball valve  is opened (thus connecting the drift region of the roughing vacuum chamber portion  and the mass spectrometer vacuum chamber ), the control unit  initiates pulsing of the laser  to ionize the sample . The signal created by detection of the ions (either by detector  if the reflectron is used, or by second detector if the mass spectrometer is operated in a linear fashion without the reflectron) is sent to the control unit , thus enabling the control unit  to determine the time of flight of the ions between the time of laser pulsing and the detection. The laser is repeatedly pulsed for a sample , thus providing the control unit  multiple data points of detected signal strength versus time of flight. As noted above, the control unit  may step the adjustment of the attenuation and focusing lens  as the laser is pulsed, in order to provide optimum matching across a range of particle sizes in an unknown sample. The laser wavelength may also be adjusted. In addition, when the parameters are adjusted for relatively larger sized particles, the control unit  may power down the reflectron plates  and receive data from the second detector , in order to increase sensitivity.","The multiple data points for a sample  thus provides the control unit  with a time series of detected signal strength versus time (time of flight). The data for the sample  is then analyzed by software in (or accessible by) the control unit , which, in conjunction with a database (either in or accessible by the control unit ) of spectral data pertaining to biological and chemical agents, identifies the sample .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["160","108","160","108","283","283","160","108","160","160","108","108","160"],"i":"a"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0085","num":"0084"},"figref":"FIG. 7","b":["300","304","306","310","314","160"]},"Each substance (i.e., biological agent, chemical agent, etc.) that is of concern and desirable to be detected has a corresponding set of mass \u201cbands\u201d that is obtained and classified, for example, using comprehensive mass spectral analysis performed under repeated and controlled conditions in the laboratory. The laboratory data is stored in a database  associated with the threat band discriminator module . The processing in the threat band discriminator module  determines whether one or more peaks identified from the sample in the detector module  fall within one or more bands of a substance as stored in the database .","Logical operations may be invoked by the threat band discriminator module  or in a subsequent logic module  to require peaks to be present in multiple bands in the database substance before the corresponding substance is declared present in the sample. A scoring for the detected substance may also be computed in the logic module (which may be based upon spectroscopists' previous assessment of the importance of each band or other statistical analysis) and the score is presented on a display, an alarm is invoked, etc. (module ).","The processing provided by software of the control unit  is now described in more detail. The CFAR , feature extraction  and related processing, collectively referred to as the mass spectrum signal detector , is depicted in more detail in . The inputs to the detector module  from the detector (, ) of the mass spectrometer are the averaged spectral intensity values, their corresponding M\/Z values, the number of spectra used to compute the average, and the minimum non-zero value out of the A\/D (not shown).","Prior to processing by the CFAR module , the data received from the A\/D converter is scaled by the signal detector in block . First, all samples with zero intensity are removed if required. This is done to compensate for the skew in the distribution when the A\/D converter in the mass spectrometer (for example, a Kratos MALDI IV mass spectrometer) is set above the local noise level. This step can be skipped when the A\/D is set such that the lowest bit is toggled by the background noise.","The scaled spectral data is input to the CFAR module , which also has a model of the background noise of the spectrometer. Modeling the noise of the particular instrument is generally pre-programmed and may be done theoretically, empirically, based on manufacturer's specifications, or any other manner. Depending on the particular instrument, the noise may be a recognizable distribution, such as a Poisson distribution or a log normal distribution. Alternatively, it may not conform to a recognized function and may be modeled in an entirely empirical manner based on taking noise measurements over the mass spectrum for the spectrometer. Also, the noise distribution may change based on the location in the mass spectrum for a device. For example, the noise spectrum may be a Poisson distribution at low masses and a log normal distribution at high masses. Alternatively, the noise spectrum may be a recognized distribution at low masses and a purely empirical function at higher masses. The processing of the CFAR module  provides a statistical comparison of the sum of the intensities in sample test cells of the mass spectral data (described further below) to that expected by an estimate of the local noise background. To determine the CFAR threshold used in the determination of whether a particular substance is in a sample, the threshold is computed with respect to a distribution that is determined from measuring the noise distribution(s) of the spectral data.","For example, a Poisson distribution provides the best model of the performance of the Kratos MALDI IV mass spectrometer. (Although the processing for a Poisson distribution is the focus of the following description of the embodiment, it will be understood that the modeling of the noise distributions may be different depending on the particular instrument used, as described directly above.) The spectral data is scaled by the number spectra used to compute average and the minimum non-zero value from the A\/D in block .

Thus, the intensity of sample test cell x is provided from one-half of a signal resolution cell w (which itself is comprised of the much smaller time intervals corresponding to the mass spectrum sequence number (sampling interval)).

As k ranges from kto kfor each x(k)\u2267T(k), the following information is determined and stored for each cell (k) tested:\n\n","After a sample test cell is tested, the procedure advances over the user-input fraction of a resolution cell f described above to arrive at the next sample test cell (x\u2032 in ) and the computations are repeated. (The actual advancement in the mass spectrum is carried out by increasing the indices k for the sampling interval by a corresponding amount k). As noted, a typical amount of advancement is \u00bd of a resolution cell.","Referring back to , as the sample test cell advances to the right in the mass spectrum, the right-hand noise band NB moves by a corresponding amount, thus enveloping a new portion of the mass spectral data shown as DNB. Since the purpose of the noise band is to evaluate the next sample test cell (x\u2032), the new portion DNB is evaluated to determine if it might contain signal data instead of noise. The CFAR module  determines if the spectrum takes a sharp rise (indicating signal) and, if so, discounts the contribution of DNB to the noise band temporarily to determine if it is noise or signal. Thus, before being used to estimate the noise, the net intensity I(k) of the sampling intervals kin DNB is tested against a threshold computed from the inverse Poisson cumulative distribution function, the current MLE for the noise background \u03bb, and a \u201cpeak shear\u201d probability, in an equation analogous to Eq. 3. The \u201cpeak shear\u201d probability is substituted for P, in Eq. 3. The peak shear value is input or selected by the user (for example, via a GUI) and gives the user flexibility to adjust the probability so that it is greater or less than the false alarm rate Pdiscussed above. In general, the peak shear probability used to evaluate DNB may be set to be the same as the false alarm probability as in Eq. 3.","If the intensity of the new spectral interval included in the noise band DNB is greater than the computed threshold, it is replaced for noise computations by a random sample generated using a Poisson random number generator and the current MLE for the background noise \u03bb. The purpose for this replacement is to minimize the contribution of possible signal peaks in the noise bands when evaluating the next sample test cell x\u2032 for signal or noise.","This procedure is implemented by CFAR module  for the next sample test cell as the processing advances through higher masses in the spectral data (as discussed above, by an amount given by sampling interval kdetermined by the fraction f of a resolution cell) in the following manner:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0113","num":"0133"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00006","num":"00006"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["k","new"]}}},{"mo":["{","}"],"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["k","new"]}}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["k","new"]}}}},{"mi":"T","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}],"mo":"\u2264"}}]},{"mtd":[{"mrow":{"mi":"PoissRand","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}}}},{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"if","mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.8em","height":"0.8ex"}}},"mrow":{"mi":"I","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"msub":{"mi":["k","new"]}}}},{"mi":"T","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}],"mo":">"}}]}]}}],"mo":"="}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0011-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0012","list-style":"none"},"li":["where","k+k+p\u2266k\u2266k+k+l","p=lower bound of noise band","l=upper bound of noise band","T(k) is obtained by solving"]}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0114","num":"0139"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00007","num":"00007"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","FAshear"]},"mo":"=","mrow":{"msubsup":{"mo":"\u222b","mrow":{"mi":"T","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},"mi":"\u221e"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mfrac":{"msup":{"mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},"mi":"x"},"mrow":{"mi":"x","mo":"!"}},"mo":["\u2062","\u2062","\u2062","\u2062"],"mstyle":[{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}},{"mspace":{"@attributes":{"width":"0.3em","height":"0.3ex"}}}],"msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mo":"-","mrow":{"mi":"\u03bb","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}}}},"mrow":{"mo":"\u2146","mi":"x"}}}}}},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0013-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0014","list-style":"none"},"li":"\u2003for user-supplied PPoissRand (\u03bb(k))=random draws on a Poisson dist. with \u03bb from the current noise window"}}}},"As discussed in detail above, the Poisson distribution is used as the noise distribution of the spectrometer in the exemplary embodiment. However, other noise distributions are possible and will be dependent on the characteristics of the mass spectrometer. The particular noise distribution for the mass range under consideration for the particular instrument is used in the evaluation of whether a signal or noise is present at the sample test call, as well as the determination of whether the intensity of the new spectral interval included in the noise band DNB is signal or noise.)","The outputs of the CFAR module  noted above are processed further in extraction module  to extract signal features. Extraction module first locates contiguous blocks of sample test cells that have been characterized as \u201csignal\u201d (i.e., exceed the thresholds), as represented in block of . (At this point, a contiguous block may include one sample test cell.) For each such contiguous block, the base width Bw, the edge M\/Z values, and the SNR are determined. The SNR for a block is determined as the maximum SNR of the sample test cells comprising the block, where the SNR of each individual sample test cell is given by the x(k)\u03bb\u2032(k). The extraction module  then identifies the local maxima of signal intensity of sample test cells within each contiguous block (as represented by block of ). For each such local maxima of a block, the M\/Z value M, the SNR, Bw and the mean intensity I (i.e., the average intensity of sampling intervals in the sample test cell) of the corresponding sample test cell are output to the threat band discrimination module  (shown in ). (As noted, at least at this point, a contiguous block of sample test cells may comprise one sample test cell.)","Each contiguous block of signal resolution cells that are characterized \u201csignals\u201d thus potentially corresponds to a characteristic spectral band of a biological or chemical agent. Although module  is referred to as a \u201cthreat band discriminator module\u201d, it is understood that the term \u201cthreat\u201d is a shorthand for a chemical or biological substance or agent that is desired to be detected. The threat band discriminator module  processes the data corresponding to each contiguous block using three criteria:\n\n","The first criterion applied by the threat band discriminator module  distinguishes a valid mass spectrum line from noise or detector anomalies based on shape of the peak. For example, a block that is too \u201cspiky\u201d, that is, has multiple local maxima, is contrary to the expectation that a valid spectrum line will typically have width on the order of the mass resolution of the spectrometer and decrease smoothly on both sides from one maximum value. Thus, module  considers whether the block of sample test cells includes multiple local maxima, for example, two. If so, then the discriminator module  concludes the block is an anomaly and ignores it for further consideration in identification of the sample. (In addition, where a \u201cblock\u201d of contiguous sample test cells comprises one sample test cell and the sample test cell is one-half a resolution cell, then the discriminator module  will conclude that the block is an anomaly and ignore it.)","In addition, a block of signals where the peak is relatively broad is often the result of an overabundance of ions produced by excessive laser power. In order to eliminate a signal that is due to an isolated, high intensity sample, the discriminator module requires that the block of contiguous cells comprising signals be wider than a lower limit of bandwidth and not exceed an upper limit of bandwidth. Thus, for a block Bw, the discriminator module  determines whether:\n\nBw\u2266Bw\u2266Bw, where\n\n","The remaining bands (blocks of contiguous cells identified as signals) identified from the sample  are used in the second criterion referred to above, thus providing the fundamental step in the band detection method. The threat band discriminator module  has an associated database  of threat agent identities and corresponding characteristic spectral bands (signature bands) for each particular threat agent. The spectral bands for a threat agent comprise mass intervals that bound the signature bands. Spectral signatures used for threat agents stored in database  are carefully developed using mass spectrometers under laboratory conditions and have proven to be constant to a few parts in a thousand of the m\/z value, in particular, for spectral signatures below 88,000 Da. (Such highly stable signatures permit narrower band limits, hence better false alarm rejection.)","The threat band discriminator module  compares the bands (or single band) identified from the sample  with the signature bands of the threat agents stored in the database . If a band (or multiple bands) identified from the sample correspond to a signature band (or multiple signature bands) of a threat agent in the database , that provides an indication that the threat agent as identified in the database  is present in the sample.","Thus, a band {M, I, Bw} identified from a sample  is determined by the threat band discriminator module  to fall within a signature band Bof a threat agent in the database  (i.e., {M, I, Bw}\u03b5B) if Mis greater than or equal to the lower mass interval that bounds the signature band m\/z and less than or equal to the upper mass interval that bounds the signature band. If one or more bands identified from a sample  is determined to fall within a signature band of a threat agent in the database , that provides an indication that the threat agent is present in the sample . Of course, if there are two or more bands identified from a sample , the discriminator module  may determine that they indicate the presence of multiple threat agents in the sample.","The threat band discriminator module  outputs the identity of the threat agent indicated in the sample  and the band or bands identified from the sample  to expert system rules module . The premise of the expert system rules module  is that some agents may be indicated reliably by one particular spectrum line, while others may only be indicated reliably with the presence of multiple lines. The expert system rules module  includes a database of threat agents and a corresponding characterization of their signature bands. (Alternatively, the system user may provide inputs for the band classifications for an indicated threat agent.) The signature bands may be categorized, for example, as follows:\n\n","Each threat agent included in the expert rules database has at least one band designated as category one, or two or more bands designated as category two. The designations are the product of laboratory experiments by specialists or field experience by operators. Other bands (if any) are categorized as categories three, four or five. (These are useful in a scoring, described below.) The expert system rules module  uses the identity of the threat agent indicated in the sample  to access the database to withdraw the classifications of the bands for the indicated threat agent. In order to classify a threat agent as present in a sample , all category one bands and at least M of the N bands designated as category two must be present in the spectrum.","The rules module  calculates a score, for example, a number between zero and one inclusive, that is based on the presence of spectral bands in the sample  for the indicated threat agent and the corresponding category designation for each band. In general, in order to get a score of one, all bands must be present, regardless of category. The scoring formula reflects the desire, but not the necessity, to have the \u201cextra\u201d bands specified by categories two, three, four and five present. (For category 2, the case that at least M of the N category two bands must present, the \u201cextra\u201d bands in category two are the extra N minus M bands. If more than M bands are present, then these bands are considered \u201cextra\u201d.)","A score for a threat agent indicated in the sample may be given, for example, by:\n\nScore=(1\u2212\u0394)*\u03b1+(*\u0394*\u0394*\u0394*\u0394)\n\nwhere\n\n","A threshold between zero and one may be input or stored. If the score exceeds the threshold, the control unit  determines that the threat agent is present in the sample  and the user is alerted in block  of the presence of the threat agent. The threshold is set, for example, to require that the \u201cmust have\u201d bands of category 1 and\/or 2 for the agent must be found in the sample before the score exceeds the threshold.","It is noted that the processing by the control unit  depicted in  and described in the related text above is not necessarily limited to a field portable mass spectrometer. The processing may be applied to any mass spectrometer that provides the substantially the same spectral inputs as that described above. Thus, for example, the processing described above may be applied to laboratory and commercial spectrometers. It is also not limited to a TOF mass spectrometer.","The above-described system is particularly useful in the detection of a broad range of biological and chemical agents. This includes toxins, such as peptides and proteins, and viruses, which have a relatively simple structure. It also includes bacteria, including vegetative bacteria and spores, that may have a large, complex structure comprising DNA and RNA.","As repeatedly referenced in the description above, the control unit  may coordinate and control all of the components so that all of the tasks performed by the system  starting with collection of a sample  by the collector  and ending with identification of a chemical or biological agent contained in the sample  by the control unit processing and output to a user is performed automatically, without the requirement of user input.","The system  may also provide for user input for various parameters also discussed above. For example, the user may provide the probability of false alarm Pused in the CFAR module  in the sample identification processing as discussed above. As another example, the user may also select a subset of the threats maintained in the database  of the threat band discriminator module , and the control unit  will only evaluate the sample data against the spectral lines for those threats. The parameters used for the scoring and\/or the threshold in the rules module  may also be adjusted by a user. Alternatively, the system may allow the user to bypass certain processing modules or steps described above. For example, the rules module itself may be bypassed if the user is interested in being notified of any match between the sample  and a chemical or biological agent in the database  found by the threat band discriminator module .","Such user input may be provided, for example, through a GUI that presents a user with menus for the various options and parameters. The GUI may also provide output to the user, such as a list of detected substances, visual alerts, etc. The GUI may be remote from the system  itself and may interface with the control unit  wirelessly, via a network, etc. Once the inputs are provided, as noted, the system may automatically provide all sample collection transport and analysis under the control of the control unit .","In addition, certain of the above-described elements of system  may be replaced with substitute procedures, eliminated, etc. For example, criteria  of the threat band discriminator module  relating to peak width range described above may be eliminated. While this may provide a slightly greater incidence of false alarms, it will still provide reliable identification of actual threats.","In another embodiment, described below, the use of \u201cthreat bands\u201d as used by expert system rules module  can be replaced with a maximum likelihood algorithm for identifying threat.  illustrates the steps for using a threat\/background library in a maximum likelihood algorithm to identify presence of a threat substance in the time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) acquired spectrum. Assuming that TOF-MS spectra from threats of interest are available prior to instrument deployment, the objective of determining if the TOF-MS has encountered a threat substance can be met by comparing a newly acquired spectrum (MS)  to previously acquired spectra of the threat substances stored in a threat library .","After the new spectrum , typically an average of individual spectra from multiple laser shots on the analyte, is acquired, as described above, it is subjected to a peak picking algorithm  that identifies spectral peaks. The peak picking algorithm used in development and test of this invention was the CFAR technique described earlier in this application. Other algorithms for peak picking could also be used. The mass\/charge (m\/z) values at which the peaks occur are stored as a set representation (MSPP) . In this set representation peak presence is indicated by 1, while peak absence is indicated by 0. The constant false alarm (CFAR) algorithm , described above with reference to , for peak selection, effectively accomplishes this. The present inventive method permits real time adaptation to changes in local noise in the background mass spectrum when combined with a fast spectral peak picker approach, e.g. CFAR algorithm. Use of consistent values defining successive mass bins based on the mass spectrometer's inherent resolution simplifies cross-spectral comparison.","A threat library is compiled using frequency of occurrence of peaks over large collections of previously gathered spectra. The threat library may be compiled according to a method illustrated in , where characterization of threat spectra is used. This exemplary method of threat library construction is performed as follows. Prior to instrument deployment in the field, trials are conducted to characterize each threat's spectrum. For each threat, multiple spectra  are measured using the TOF-MS. The peak picking algorithm  identifies m\/z values corresponding to the threat's spectral peaks. The frequency of occurrence of each peak is calculated using the multiple TOF-MS measurements of the threat spectrum and is preserved as a set representation . The library entry  for the threat is the set of probabilities, i.e., frequencies of occurrence, of peaks P(1), and absence of peaks P(0) for each relevant m\/z. A background spectrum, where no threats are present, can be characterized, and entered in the library  as a \u201cnon-threat\u201d. Various types of background can be accommodated by giving each a separate entry  () in the library .","Returning to , for each of a predetermined set of masses (k, k=1 to N) derived from the threat library, the likelihood of the corresponding subset of the representation MSPP  being observed is computed, assuming each threat library  member  were present. The threat or non-threatening background call is made based on the ranking of the likelihood thus computed. The threat or background member , whose presence would most likely result in observing representation , is identified as a source of the newly acquired spectrum . The likelihood of the corresponding subset of the representation MSPP  in the MS  is calculated according to Equation:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0138","num":"0187"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00008","num":"00008"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"Likelihood","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mi":["MS1","a"],"mo":"|"}}},{"mrow":[{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"MSPP1","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},"mo":"=","mn":"1"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"1","mo":"|","mi":"a"}}}}},{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"munder":{"mo":"\u220f","mrow":{"mrow":{"mi":"MSPP1","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"k"}},"mo":"=","mn":"0"}},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"msub":{"mi":["P","k"]},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mn":"0","mo":"|","mi":"a"}}}}}],"mo":"\u2062"}],"mo":"="},"mo":","}}},"br":{},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0023","list-style":"none"},"li":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0023-0001","num":"0000"},"ul":{"@attributes":{"id":"ul0024","list-style":"none"},"li":["(a) is a member spectrum in the threat library,","P(1|a) is the probability of observing a \u201c1\u201d at mass k in (a), and","P(0|a) is the probability of observing a \u201c0\u201d at mass k in (a)."]}}}},"Thus, although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, but rather it is intended that the scope of the invention is as defined by the scope of the appended claims."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":"a "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"i":"b "},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0040"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0042"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0045","num":"0044"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 8","FIG. 7"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIG. 9"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0047"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0049","num":"0048"},"figref":["FIG. 11","FIG. 10"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
