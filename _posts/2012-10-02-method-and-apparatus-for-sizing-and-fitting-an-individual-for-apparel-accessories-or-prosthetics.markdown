{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["PRIORITY CLAIM","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/548,079, filed on Oct. 17, 2011, and Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61\/561,627, filed on Nov. 18, 2011, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.","This invention relates to measurements of the surface of a person's body. The term \u201cmeasurement\u201d as used herein refers to the establishment of a distance, angle, volume, or qualitative description pertaining to one or more portions of an individual's body. Examples of measurements include: the circumference of a person's waist, hip, neck, head, torso, or upper arm; the length of an arm from shoulder to wrist, or of a leg from hip to ankle; the length or width of a foot; an individual's height; the volume and outline of space occupied by an individual's abdomen; or the curve in space that would be described by a ribbon placed starting at the small of the back, then following the surface of the skin across the crotch and up to the navel.","An important use of measurements is to size individuals for apparel, accessories, or prosthetics. The term \u201capparel\u201d may encompass garments of any kind: shirts, trousers, shoes, hats, etc. The term \u201caccessories\u201d may encompass items that are carried but not generally considered clothing: jewelry, purses, etc. The term \u201cprosthetics\u201d may encompasses devices that replace or augment body parts that are missing or damaged; artificial limbs, orthotic shoes etc.","It is clear that body measurements may be used for many other purposes\u2014such as surgical fitness applications, and biometrics\u2014and although this document will focus on sizing individuals for garments, the scope of the system and method includes all applications that may be realized through measurements of a person's body.","Manual measurement of a person's body has been conducted for thousands of years. Today, the most common way of measuring a person\u2014for example, for sizing a suit\u2014is with a fabric tape measure (often abbreviated to \u201ctape\u201d), optionally accompanied by a set of pins, markers, and pre-sized measurement garments. The tape is used to gauge the length, width, or circumference, of various body portions\u2014for example, the circumference of the neck, or the length of the arm from shoulder to wrist\u2014and the pins, markers, and pre-sized garments are used to mark off the measurements from the fabric tape measure, and to establish the overall shape of volume of the body portion. For example, a pre-sized shirt may be donned by an individual, and then portions of that shirt marked or pinned to confirm to the individual's body shape, in this way creating a physical \u201cshell\u201d or envelope of the person's approximate shape.","Manual measurement suffers from many drawbacks:\n\n","Accordingly, many schemes have been proposed to partially or fully automate the process of body measurement. Some methods of automation in the prior art involve the use of a 3D body scanner. Such a scanner can obtain a complete, essentially \u201c360-degree\u201d 3D scan of a person's body. Common to such methods is emitting electromagnetic or sound energy\u2014such as laser light or sonar\u2014onto a person's body (wherein such energy is transmitted from multiple different directions or angles), and then mathematically reassembling the reflected electromagnetic or sound pattern (as received, again, from multiple directions or angles) to build a complete computer 3D model. Because of the need to transmit and receive the electromagnetic energy from many different directions, 3D scanners must use either many different transmitters and sensors set up simultaneously at different locations around the consumer, or else use an array of transmitters and sensors that rotate, in a tomographic fashion, around the consumer, typically at a fixed rate of angular change.","This burden of transmitters and sensors means that 3D body scanners are necessarily large, complex devices. For example, Unique Solutions manufactures (as of September 2011) the \u201cMyBestFit\u201d \u201cIntellifit Virtual Fitting Room Bodyscanner\u201d, which is a human-sized stand-alone box-like device within which an individual stands in order to be scanned by \u201cradio waves\u201d. A similar large device is the \u201cNX-16 Whole Body Scanner\u201d manufactured by Shape Analysis Corporation.","3D body scanners suffer from drawbacks. First, their size and complexity prevent them from being used at home; a consumer must travel to a retail store, or tailor, who happens to have installed a 3D body scanner.","Second, it is difficult to use a 3D scanner to generate the types of sizing that are common in the garment industry; even if a mass of, say, 3D mesh data is obtained from the scanner, there remains the need to extract measurements of interest, such as arm circumference or foot length, from that same data; and since the measurements could have as easily been obtained from direct measurements of the person in the scanner, this problem begs the question whether the 3D scanner was even needed in the first place.","Third, because home measurements with a 3D scanner are infeasible, 3D body scanners fail to eliminate the problems of inconvenience and perishable measurements.","Fourth, because of the large amount of data gathered, coupled with the need to rotate sensors around the individual or to perform a raster scan, 3D scanners are typically slow.","Fifth, because 3D scanners cannot be mass-manufactured for use in consumer's homes (for the reasons above), there may be long lines to use the few machines that are assembled, and economies of scale are not available to bring manufacturing costs down.","Sixth, 3D scanners prevent real-time interaction\u2014they do not give real-time feedback, cannot respond in real-time to user commands, and cannot adjust to real-time changes in the user's position. This limits the utility and entertainment value of user interfaces to 3D scanners.","Other methods of automation in the prior art involve the use of special tapes or markers. Common to all such methods is having a person display special markings on their body such its ruled lines, which can then either be manually entered by an operator or automatically measured by a computer program. These methods of automation are necessarily inconvenient (because either the individual to be measured, or another operator, must take the time to learn, assemble, and place the special markers) and prone to error (since the accuracy of measurement depends on the skill with which the special markers are placed). Indeed, these methods of automation do not really automate the measurement of body portions, so much as \u201cparallelize\u201d the manual process of tape measurements.","Other methods of automation in the prior an utilize computerized images of a person, upon which human operators manually superimpose markings which allow relevant garment measurements to be made. Common to all such methods is the requirement for a second person (the operator) to act upon the digitized data, e.g., by using a computer console to manually highlight landmarks on the computerized images. Therefore, these methods do not automate the act of manual measurement, so much as postpone it to a later time or to a different physical location.","Overall, known methods of automated garment sizing suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages:\n\n","Known methods may obtain limited depth knowledge about a scene, \u201cDepth knowledge\u201d or \u201cdepth data\u201d, as used herein, refers to gathering information\u2014possibly partial, or incomplete\u2014about the spatial positions of objects in space relative to a known coordinate system, \u201cImage knowledge\u201d or \u201cimage data\u201d, as used herein, refers to gathering an image of a scene, which may be in visual wavelengths or in other wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. \u201cColor image knowledge\u201d or \u201ccolor image\u201d, as used herein, refers to gathering a visual image of a scene, using color wavelength, similar to the way in which a standard digital camera gathers a visual image. The term \u201ccamera\u201d, as used herein, refers to any sensor that may gather information about the environment, especially (though not limited to) electromagnetic measurements, such as visible or infrared light. \u201cCamera\u201d, as used herein, is thus a general-purpose term, and does not refer specifically to, nor is limited to, visual-light devices.","US patent publication 2011-0211044 (Shpunt) teaches a method of gathering depth knowledge about an object through the use of an illumination module, which projects patterned optical radiation onto a scene, and an image capture module, which captures an image of the reflected pattern.","Image and\/or depth data may be combined to identify the spatial location of specific human body portions. US patent publication 2011-0052006 (Gurman) teaches a method of locating portions of a humanoid form using a temporal sequence of depth maps, where each depth map represents a scene as a two-dimensional matrix of pixels indicating topographic information. US patent publication 2011-0211754 (Litvak) teaches a method which processes image and depth data in such a way that specific parts of a body, such as the head, may be identified in the image and depth data. Thus, post-processing of image and\/or depth data can generate so-called \u201cskeleton data\u201d or \u201cjoint data\u201d, describing the approximate locations in space of specific parts of a person's body.","To substantially overcome the above-described problems, embodiments of the present invention do not rely on 3D body scanners, nor on wearable tapes or markers, to gather information about a scene. Instead, some embodiments of the inventive method and system rely on a minimum number of close-to-instantaneous \u201cdata-snapshots\u201d that are each obtained from a single viewpoint, as described below, wherein each data-snapshot contains at least depth data, and preferably a combination of image, depth, skeleton, and or pixel label data. Some other embodiments of the inventive method and system rely on ongoing acquisition of such \u201cdata-snapshots,\u201d rather than on a minimum number. Body surface measurements, suitable for apparel, accessory, and prosthetic sizing and fitting, are then obtained from one or more such data-snapshots. Embodiments of the present system and method include the following advantages, which are not intended to be an exhaustive list:\n\n","There are many useful applications of this low-cost, convenient, and private system and method of sizing virtually any desired surface portion of a person's body. The following recitation of useful applications is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but merely points out the wide and divergent fields in which embodiments of the present system and method find application.","The present-day difficulty of sizing clothing is easily apprehended. The sizes of clothing items are not consistent across manufactures or countries, and desired sizes are often out-of-stock at retail stores, or simply non-existent. Consumers must typically travel from store to store seeking clothing that fits \u201cwell enough\u201d. Embodiments of the present system and method prepare standardized types of measurements that are applicable to all types of clothing and that may be translated across all brands.","Although, as noted above, kiosks utilizing 3D scanners are becoming available in the retail setting, they still impose wait times on the consumer, who must go to the location of the scanner; may impose wait times on the consumer, who might have to stand in line behind others to use the 3D scanner; and require the consumer to return to the store if any measurements were missed or have to be repeated. Embodiments of the present system and method are designed to be used at home, as much and as often as the user wishes.","In-store measurements also raise privacy concerns. 3D scanners are necessarily operated by third parties, and the detailed body-shape data that they generate\u2014which may be used to reconstruct nude images\u2014are also stored by third parties, out of the control of the consumer. The system described herein is designed to allow clothing consumers to measure themselves, and then purchase, custom-fit clothing privately and in the comfort and convenience of their own home. The system does not require, use, obtain, nor store full-body 3D scans.","The desire for privacy may assume particular prominence in some special circumstances, such as illness or injury. For example, breast cancer victims who have undergone mastectomies may wish to carry out private measurements to aid in the purchase of specially-shaped bras.","Some embodiments of the system are able to carry out measurements using electromagnetic waves that are only in the visual or near-visual spectrum (e.g., infrared). Such waves are ubiquitous in nature and harmless to humans. The system does not require the use of potentially harmful electromagnetic waves or radiation, e.g., lasers, which pose potential eye hazards, or x-rays.","Similar to the sizing situation for clothing, it is challenging to size accessories, such as necklaces, watches, sunglasses, or hats. For example, it is not unusual for a consumer to be gifted a necklace which doesn't fit correctly, requiring the consumer to take the necklace back to the source store for resizing of the necklace chain. The advantages of the present system and method for clothing apply in equal measure to accessories.","For individuals suffering from medical conditions that require special devices attached to the body, such as orthotic shoes or prosthetic legs, sizing is often an even more arduous process. For example, such individuals may have difficulty traveling to a practitioner who can correctly size them for the device question; and if devices of different sizes need to be purchased over time (for example, a prosthetic leg for a young amputee), the inconvenience and expense are magnified. Embodiments of the present system and method allow individuals who require medical devices or specialty clothing to easily and affordably measure and order the relevant body parts from home, without the need to travel or to incur the expense of seeing a practitioner.","Embodiments of the present system and method can be used to track parameters of the person's body itself (as opposed to items that are worn). This can be useful in the setting of health and fitness, home care, weight loss, diabetes, or other situations where an individual wishes to track their size and shape over time.","Embodiments of the present system and method can be used to generate custom-fit devices for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from consumer to industrial to military\u2014for example, EEG sleep monitors to be worn for sleep studies; body-hugging swimwear; or body armor.","Embodiments of the present system and method are not limited to humans. They may be applied to animals, such as cats, dogs, or horses: for example, if custom clothing, harnesses, or saddles are desired.","It is also possible to continuously execute embodiments of the present system and method over time, thereby creating \u201cmovies\u201d of changing measurements\u2014for example, to examine the motion of a muscle, or the change in a person's gait. Time-motion studies of this nature offer potential applications in, for example, medical rehabilitation, surgical recovery, and fall prevention.","The above examples show that embodiments of the present system and method are useful in many applications, ranging from apparel to medicine to animal husbandry to home care:","Specifically, one embodiment of the present method includes:\n\n","Another embodiment of the present method includes:\n\n","In another embodiment, a method of sizing and fitting an individual for apparel, accessories, or prosthetics includes capturing data corresponding to the individual moving within a field-of-view or remaining stationary for a predetermined amount of time within the field-of view, of at least one pattern emitter and one image capture device; calculating depth data for the field-of-view based on the emitted pattern and received image; and calculating one or more spatial measurements of a portion of a body surface of the individual based on the depth data for the field-of-view.","Embodiments the present invention are designed to automate taking physical measurements of portions of a user's body in ways that are compact, portable, private, affordable, repeatable, rapid, and convenient. The system may utilize a single energy sensor to obtain, at a minimum, depth data; or two energy sensors of non-overlapping frequencies to obtain a combination of depth data and spectral data (for example, color image data). Skeleton data (which consists of the approximate locations in space of joints, or of other ambiguous and\/or diffuse anatomic structures) may in turn be calculated from the acquired depth and\/or spectral data. Pixel label data (which consists of labeling pixels in acquired depth maps or color image maps, such that the labeled pixels correspond to the body surfaces of humans in the field-of-view) may also be calculated from the acquired depth and\/or spectral data.","Any collection of distance measurements to (or between) objects in a field-of-view is referred to herein as \u201cdepth data\u201d. There are many ways to acquire, calculate or otherwise generate depth data for a field-of-view.","For example, depth data may be calculated based on a \u201ctime-of-flight\u201d method. In this method, light with known physical characteristics (such as wavelength) is emitted into a field-of-view. An energy sensor, such as a camera, receives the light that is reflected from the field-of-view. Changes in the physical characteristics of the light between its being emitted and its being received\u2014for example, the round-trip transit time of a light raise, or the phase shift of an emitted waveform\u2014allow calculation of the distance to various objects (that reflect the light) in the field-of-view. If light pulses are utilized (for example, to measure round-trip transit time), the emitter can be, for example, a pulsed LED. If continuous light is utilized (for example, to measure phase shift), the emitter can be, for example, a laser. Time-of-flight cameras are a subset of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies, in which emitted-and-reflected light is used to remotely gauge the distance or other properties of a target. LIDAR cameras are similar to radar devices; the main difference is that radar bounces radio waves off target objects, but LIDAR uses ultraviolet, visible, or near-infrared light, Mesa Imaging AG, of Zurich, Switzerland, is an example of a company that manufactures devices to acquire depth data through time-of-flight: for example, its SR4000 time-of-flight camera.","Besides LIDAR, a different method of calculating depth data is through the use of \u201cpattern deformation methods,\u201d also sometimes called \u201clight coding\u201d. In pattern deformation methods, a light pattern with known physical characteristics (such as pattern shape and spacing) is emitted into a field-of-view. An energy sensor, such as a camera, receives the light pattern that is reflected from the field-of-view. Changes in the pattern between its being emitted and its being received\u2014for example, gridlines moving closer further apart, or average distances between speckled dots growing or shrinking\u2014allow calculation of the distance to various objects (that reflect the light) in the field-of-view.","In contrast to time-of-flight or LIDAR, the specific wavelengths or transit of the emitted light are not crucial; what matters in pattern-deformation methods are the emitted pattern in which the light is placed, and how that emitted pattern is subsequently reflected and deformed by objects in the field-of-view. Because the specific wavelength is less important in pattern-deformation methods, a common choice of wavelength in such methods is infrared, which light cannot be seen by the human eye, and can be superimposed on a scene without disturbing people. If the light pattern is relatively fixed and constant, it is called \u201cstructured light\u201d\u2014often, structured-light patterns are grids of regular lines.","If the light pattern exhibits random or pseudorandom variation, it is called \u201ccoded fight\u201d\u2014often, coded-light patterns are lattices of dots. (The reason why random or pseudorandom variations may be used light patterns is so that small areas of the pattern will \u201ctook slightly different\u201d compared to each other, enabling easier lining-up and registration of the emitted and reflected patterns.) PrimeSense Limited, of Tel Aviv, Israel, is an example of a company that manufactures sensors to acquire depth data through pattern deformation: its sensors are embedded in, for example, the Microsoft Kinect device (Microsoft Corp., Seattle, USA) and the Asus Xtion device (Asustek Computer Inc., Taipei, Taiwan).","Besides time-of-flight, LIDAR, and pattern deformation, a different method of acquiring depth data is through the use of emitted energy that is not light. For example, sound (rather than light) may be emitted and bounced off objects; the reflected physical characteristics of the sound, such as round-trip transit time, or frequency or phase shift, may be used to calculate depth or other characteristics of the objects in the field-of-view. Sommer Mess-Systemtechnik, of Koblach, Austria is an example of a company that manufactures devices to acquire depth data through ultrasonic impulse: for example, its USH-8 sensor, which uses ultrasonic impulses to measure snow depth.","Embodiments of the present invention may use any type of entitled and received energy, including but not limited to visible light, ultraviolet light, infrared light, radio waves, audible sound waves, ultrasonic frequencies, and pressure vibrations, in order to acquire depth data. Embodiments of the present invention are agnostic as to the source of depth data. As used herein, \u201cdepth data\u201d refers to measurements of the distances to objects (or portions of objects) in a field-of-view.","Note that the term \u201ccamera\u201d is used herein for convenience only, and any energy sensor, or image capture device, or energy capture device, or data capture device using various ranges of electromagnetic radiation or other types of energy may be used and substituted therefore. The terms \u201cenergy sensor\u201d, \u201ccamera,\u201d \u201cimage capture device.\u201d \u201cenergy capture device,\u201d and \u201cdata capture device\u201d are used interchangeably herein. Some such devices need not emit electromagnetic radiation, because they capture energy based on reflected radiation already present in the environment. Other such devices may emit electromagnetic radiation and capture reflected radiation, such as ultrasonic transducers, and the like, where such emitted electromagnetic or other energy radiation is not present in the environment to a sufficient degree or sufficiently present in known directions relative to a target.","Additionally, the number of energy sensors are not limited to one or two such devices: one energy sensor, two energy sensors, or more than two energy sensors may be used (for example, to generate additional stereoscopic data, or to cover a larger region of space), as well as a single energy sensor.","\u201cImage data\u201d or \u201cimage\u201d as used herein may refer to data or image captured by any of the above-mentioned devices or sensors, such as an energy sensor, a camera, an image capture device, an energy capture device, and\/or a data capture device, and need not necessarily refer to the optical range, in one embodiment, image data may refer to the same visual-spectrum data that would be generated by a standard digital camera, consisting of a 2D photographic pixel map, where each pixel represents a visible color. Note that in general, \u201ccolor\u201d as used herein may refer to all the colors et the visual spectrum or a grayscale spectrum, or any other palette of visual colors that are perceptible by the human eye. As used herein, \u201ccolor image data\u201d refers to visual (visible to the human eye) image data, similar to that captured by a standard consumer digital camera.","\u201cDepth data\u201d is less intuitive than color image data. Depth data represents the distance from a sensor to a nearest object in space.  show two representations of depth data. The preferred representation of depth data, shown in , is a 2D bitmap, also sometimes referred to as a depth map. However, alternate representations are also possible. The value of each (x, y) pixel in the 2D bitmap shown in  represents the distance from a common reference plane\u2014typically a vertical plane established by the sensor itself, with the x-axis running horizontally, and the y-axis running vertically\u2014to the closest physical object, along a normal ray projected outward from the common reference plane at that (x, y) coordinate. (In such a coordinate system, since the y-axis extends floor-to-ceiling, and the x-axis extends to left-and-right, of the sensor, it follows that the z-axis extends straight out from the sensor into the field-of-view.)","A 2D depth data bitmap therefore corresponds to a quantized contour, or topographic, map of the sensor's field-of-view. Equivalently, a pixel value z at position (x, y) in the data bitmap indicates that the surface (or edge) of a real-world object exists at coordinate position (x, y, z) in physical space.","A depth bitmap can represent, depth data only for aspects of an object that are visible to the sensor: any aspects of an object that are out-of-view of the viewpoint are \u201cinvisible\u201d and not represented in the depth bitmap.","For example, if we were to obtain a depth data bitmap of the Moon as taken from standing on the Earth, we would find that a collection of pixels in the middle of the bitmap formed the shape of a circle. The pixels in the center would have, the lowest distance values (they would correspond to the central part of the Moon which is closest to the Earth), and the pixels at the edge of the circle would have the highest distance values (they would correspond to the edge of the visible face of the Moon). Pixels outside the circle, of the Moon, representing the void of space, would have maximum distance values (essentially equivalent to infinity). The \u201cdark side of the Moon\u201d, invisible to us, would not be represented in the bitmap at all.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0070","num":"0119"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0071","num":"0120"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":"200"},"As shown in , energy emitter  bathes the field-of-view with energy. As described previously, the energy emitted may comprise visible light or non-visible light, or sound, or any other type of energy. The energy emitted may bathe the entire field-of-view all at once, or may bathe different parts of the field-in-view in turn. Energy sensor  gathers the energy that is reflected or received from objects in the field-of-view. Depth calculation module  calculates the distances to objects in the field-of-view using the information acquired by energy sensor . As described previously, such depth calculation may performed using time-of-flight, or LIDAR, or pattern deformation, or any other method suitable for calculating depth measurements. Depth calculation module supplies depth data , where, for example, depth data  may be structured in a form similar to that shown in .","In , depth calculation module  uses the captured energy data from energy sensor  to calculate depth data  corresponding to the objects in the field-of-view. Such calculation may also rely on knowledge of the characteristics of the most recent energy characteristics or energy patterns emitted by energy emitter , and\/or on past energy characteristics or energy patterns emitted by energy emitter , or captured by energy sensor , or on any other information required to carry out depth calculations.","Sensor portion  encapsulates a minimal sot of components required by some embodiment of the present inventive method, viz., an energy emitter, an energy sensor, and a depth calculation module. Because of the similarity to energy sensor , optional color image sensor  is included for convenience within sensor portion . It is important to note that sensor portion  is a label of convenience, roughly corresponding to the typical hardware components required for some real-world embodiments of the present inventive method, and so any components of the present inventive method, including all of those, for example, shown in , may be brought in or out sensor portion . For example, optional skeleton calculation module  could appear inside sensor portion  in some embodiments of the present inventive method.","The depth data  may be used by optional skeleton calculation module  in order to construct optional skeleton data , consisting of a set of approximate spatial locations of anatomic joints (e.g., the [x, y, z] locations of shoulder, hip, and ankle). The data from depth calculation module  may also be used by optional pixel label calculation module  in order construct optional so-called \u201cpixel label\u201d data , consisting of labeling individual pixels in a depth map (such as the depth map shown in ) that correspond to a human being in the field-of-view. A wide variety of machine learning methods are known in the art that may be utilized by optional skeleton calculation module  and optional pixel label calculation module , and are not discussed further here.","Spatial measurement module  uses depth data  to calculate measurements in space, as described further below. Spatial measurement module  supplies body measurements . For example, a body measurement  might be the distance between the most-lateral point of an elbow, and the ulnar bone of an arm.","It is possible to calculate body measurements using only depth data ; however, the accuracy of the depth pattern, or of body measurement calculations derived from depth data alone, may insufficient, and it may also be difficult to clearly delineate separate objects using depth data alone. Therefore, in some applications it may be preferable to also include a standard color image sensor , which gathers visual data in the same way as a standard digital camera. Optional color image sensor  supplies optional color image data .","For example, if two objects in the field-of-view are close together, such that the energy received by energy sensor  does not lead to clearly distinguishable depth data , their different visual colors received by the color image sensor  may be used to help distinguish the objects front each other. However, for many applications of system , the color image sensor  and the color image data  are optional.","As noted above, it is possible to calculate body measurements using only depth data . However the speed of body measurement calculation may be improved by drawing upon additional calculations performed on depth data . For example, optional skeleton data  may be calculated from depth data , and used to improve the speed of calculating body measurements . For example, optional label data  may be calculated from depth data , and used to improve the speed of calculating body measurements . As described previously, optional skeleton data  describes the approximate spatial locations of anatomic joints (for example, the three-dimensional [x, y, z] locations of shoulder, hip, and ankle). As described previously, optional pixel label data  distinguishes which pixels in a depth map (if any) correspond to a human being, and which do not.","In , the depth data  consists of a set of calculated depth data, where such data may conform, for example, to the representation shown in . The optional color image data  consists of a set of image data; such data may, for example, be represented in the way as images that are acquired by a typical everyday consumer digital camera, such as by using a pixel array or raster. The optional skeleton data  consists of a set of calculated spatial measurements of the approximate locations of portions of a user's body, for example, shoulders and knees; such data may, for example, be represented by a set of (x,y,z) coordinates. The optional pixel label data  consists of a set of pixel labels delineating which pixels correspond to a human being in the field-of-view; such data may, for example, be represented by a pixel array or raster.","Embodiments of the system  preferably utilize a combination of depth data , optional color image data , optional skeleton data , and optional pixel label data , to conduct measurements of an individual's body surface.

In particular, for an individual measurement of the user, the system  requires only a single data-snapshot of the user. Thus, in some embodiments, the user may need to stand relatively still for only a predetermined amount of time, for example 0.001 second to 0.1 second, which in an optical camera, may be determined by the amount of lighting, shutter speed, and aperture size. Other types of image capture or energy capture devices may operate on a much faster basis so that such capture is substantially instantaneous, at least from the perspective of the user.","In other embodiments, the user need not necessarily stand in one position or maintain a particular position for any amount of time, and may be able to move real-time within the field of view of the capture device. Individual measurements from different data-snapshots may also be combined or operated upon further, for example by adding them or averaging them, as described below.","The term \u201cdata-snapshot\u201d or \u201csnapshot\u201d, as used herein, refers to a single set of depth, and\/or image, and\/or skeleton data, and\/or pixel label data, wherein the data are gathered substantially simultaneously with each other. As noted previously, a single data-snapshot cannot account for any \u201cinvisible\u201d or \u201cdarkside\u201d aspects of objects in the field-of-view. Where necessary to complete a measurement, therefore, the system  \u201cfills in\u201d for invisible aspects by using heuristics that may take advantage of the symmetry of the human body\u2014for example, by doubling a visible half-circumference to estimate the full circumference of a limb. This process is described in further detail below.","The original construction of optional skeleton data  may utilize multiple calculations on depth and\/or image data over time. The system  is agnostic as to the means by which optional skeleton data  are generated. From the point of view of the system , a single\u2014substantially instantaneous\u2014data-snapshot of depth, and\/or image, and\/or skeleton data, and\/or pixel label data, is sufficient to obtain a particular body surface measurement, regardless of the prior post-processing that was necessary to generate the content of that data-snapshot.","Similarly, the original construction of depth data may utilize multiple calculations on data received from either energy sensor  or optional color image sensor  individually, or from both energy and color image sensors  and  collectively over time. For example, a particular image received at one moment in time by either energy sensor  or optional color image sensor  may serve as a so-called reference image at a subsequent moment in time, such that two or mote images taken slightly apart in time are used to calculate depth data. Again, the system  is agnostic as to the means by which depth data, including depth data , are generated, including image processing that may occur over time, or different physical methods such as time-of-flight, LIDAR, or pattern deformation.","Through the use of a substantially instantaneous snapshot of data, gathered from one or more stationary cameras, the system  avoids the use of a 3D scanner, as well as of wearable markings. As is described further below, this method also avoids, the need for manual intervention\u2014in particular, the need for a second person to conduct body measurements. Some embodiments of the system  may be thought of as draping \u201cvirtual measuring tapes\u201d in three-dimensional space on top of different parts of the user's body, simultaneously and almost instantly, acting as a sort of \u201cvirtual intelligent tailor.\u201d","In some embodiments of system , energy sensor  and optional color image sensor  may be placed near each other, as a substantially co-located array, rather than being physically dispersed throughout different points on the perimeter of a field-of-view. Such co-location is ideally as close as possible in order to have the field-of-view be similar for each sensor. The feasible co-location separation distance depends upon the size attic physical components. For example, if energy sensor  and optional color image sensor  are instantiated as CMOS chips, the chips and their supporting electronics and optics may be placed such that their borders are, for example, approximately 5 mm apart, and the centers of their lenses are, for example, approximately 2 cm apart.","In general, the co-located sensors are preferably positioned with a separation distance of millimeters to centimeter, although smaller and larger distances are possible. Similarly, the angles of view of the co-located, sensors are preferably within a few degrees of each other. This means that embodiments of the present system and method may be very compact and portable, e.g., fitting easily on a shelf or at the base of a television at home.","Depth calculation module , optional skeleton calculation module , optional pixel label calculation module , spatial measurement module , and all other modules described herein, may be implemented in circuitry as a physical component or processing element, whether integrated or discrete, or may be implemented to the extent possible, in software to be executed by the processor or specialized processing circuitry.","The depth data  might be relative, instead of absolute\u2014that is, a depth pixel value of \u201c8\u201d may delineate a distance that is twice as far as a depth pixel value of \u201c4\u201d, without specifying how many absolute centimeters in the real world correspond to values of \u201c8\u201d or \u201c4\u201d. However, the system  necessarily requires a means to measure real-world distances. For this reason, the system  may employ a calibrator. The purpose of the calibrator is to scale depth bitmap pixel distances to real-world physical distances. The preferred shape of the calibrator is spherical, so that its widest dimension is constant regardless of the angle from which it is viewed.","The calibrator is preferably given either a unique thermal (i.e., infrared) or color signature (e.g., neon green), so that it may be easily distinguished from other objects within, respectively, either a depth or color image bitmap. Because the calibrator is of known physical dimensions, its extent along die x and y axes (image bitmap) and z axis depth bitmap) allows physical distances to be mapped to pixel distances along all three axes. These mappings are accomplished using scaling factors referred to herein as \u201ccalibration metrics\u201d. In some embodiments, the calibrator may be used, while in other embodiments it may be omitted.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0107","num":"0156"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["300","200","200"]},"Assuming that the calibrator  is known to be, say, 8 cm in diameter, it follows that 20 (equal to 30-10) pixels along the z-axis occupies 4 cm (equal to half of the diameter) of physical space. This ratio of 20 pixels to 4 cm is the z-axis; calibration metric. Similar metrics may be derived for the x-axis and y-axis. Subsequent body surface measurements may then be calibrated using these metrics: for example, it the user's neck circumference were found to be 200 pixels along the x-axis, then a calibrator metric of 20 pixels to 4 cm would indicate that the neck circumference was 40 cm in the physical world.","Note that in , the X axis is labeled as \u201c\u2212X\u201d. This is because the positive direction of the x-axis is to the left of the sensor, and the negative direction of the x-axis extends to the right of the sensor.","As disclosed, in a preferred embodiment, the calibrator  may be spherical. In some embodiments, the calibrator  is substantially like a spherical ball used in a sports game, e.g., tennis ball, golf ball, Ping-Pong ball, or basketball. However, many other embodiments of the calibrator  are possible. For example, the calibrator may be a shallow fence that is placed upon the floor surrounding the user; or the calibrator may be one or mote L-shaped towers, that are arrayed around the user. Some attributes for any calibrator are 1) it is easy to distinguish from other objects in the FOV, and 2) it provides calibration metrics alone at least one, and preferably alone all three, axes: x y, and z.","Note that if the depth calculation module  is inherently able to deliver reliable absolute measurements in physical space, then the calibrator may not be needed. For this reason, the calibrator is optional. One embodiment of the system  makes use of the calibrator , due to the difficulty of establishing precise real-world depth data from non-calibrated 2D bitmaps\u2014to the difficulty experienced by an human being eyeing a scene and then trying to judge the absolute size of objects in those scene, down to the centimeter level, merely by evaluating their relative sizes to each other. In other words, the depth data  are likely to be reasonably accurate on a relative scale, but not on an absolute scale, and so the calibrator  is intended to compensate accordingly.","For a single measurement, certain embodiments of the system  requires only a single data-snapshot of the user, taken from a single point of view. This is because the system  may use heuristics\u2014such as the inherent symmetry of the human body\u2014to \u201cfill in\u201d, or compensate for, any invisible depth or image information that is invisible to the sensor portion . Furthermore, multiple measurements may be drawn from a single snapshot.","However, for a measurement of a body portion to be taken, that body portion should be substantially in view of the file sensor portion . As a general rule, about half of the body portion is preferably visible to the sensor in order for that body portion to be measured (because symmetry or heuristics can be used to deduce the shape of the other half).","For example, to measure the volume of the abdomen, the user typically substantially faces the sensor; if the user presents a back profile (equivalent to a back view) to the sensor portion , then the front of the user is invisible altogether, and the abdominal volume cannot be measured. Conversely, to measure the volume of the seat, aside or back profile of the user may be required, because the seat is invisible from a front view. Similarly, to measure the length or width of a foot, either the foot must be profiled so that the sole of the foot is facing the sensor, allowing both measurements to be conducted from the same data-snapshot; or else the length must be measured on its own front a side profile (of the foot), and the width measured separately using a front back profile (of the foot).","Another reason that multiple data snapshots may be required is due to noise in the system. It the inputs or outputs at any component of sensor portion  are noisy\u2014that is, varying randomly or non-randomly, due either to inherent aspects of sensor portion  or to external environmental conditions, then multiple data snapshots may be required to extract improved signal from the noisy background. For example, data snapshots may be averaged over time, using signal processing methods, in order to have noise \u201ccancel out\u201d and thereby diminish over time, while constructively adding together (strengthening) the valuable signal. If such averaging over time is performed, then multiple data snapshots may be required for higher-accuracy measurements.","Therefore, although any one measurement may require only a single snapshot, nonetheless, in some embodiments, more than one snapshot may be required to obtain a complete set of desired measurements (e.g., to size someone for a pair of trousers). It is preferable to minimize the number of data snapshots, because the fewer the number of snapshots, the quicker and easier is the sizing for the user. To achieve this goal of minimizing the number of snapshots, some embodiments of the system  may minimize the number of separate profiles, or views, that are be presented by the user to the sensor portion  for processing.","There are 5 primary profiles, or views, that the user may present to the sensor portion :\n\n","Many additional profiles, besides the five listed above, are possible\u2014for example, facing the sensor\u2014with arms related at both sides\u2014and so the list of profiles above is not intended to be exhaustive. Additional profiles are within the scope of the system . For example, a different set of poses is preferable for disabled persons (e.g., a set of profiles in which the person would sit instead of stand). For example, for shirt-sleeve sizing, a preferred profile may consist of the user placing hands on hips, with elbows bent, corresponding to a pose commonly assumed by customers during the sizing oil shirt sleeve by professional tailors. For example, for bra sizing, a preferred profile may consist of the user facing sensor portion , with hands on hips, and rotated slightly either left or right, in order to allow points on the sides and front of the breasts to be acquired and measured by the system .","The relationship of measurements to the 5 primary profiles is shown in . For each measurement shown in , the \u201cpreferred profile\u201d is the first-choice profile of the user with which to conduct that measurement, and the \u201calternate profile\u201d is a backup choice that may be used in place of (or in addition to) the preferred profile.","The number of data-snapshots may be minimized as follows. First, a desired collection of measurements is ascertained. For example, these might be the collection of measurements required to fit a shirt or blouse. Such collections may be defined ahead of time, e.g., by predetermined lookup tables, or decided dynamically based on the requirements of the user. Second, the system  may access a table similar to that shown in  to determine the minimum set of profiles to fulfill the entire collection of measurements. For example, if the desired measurements are \u201cshoulder-to-wrist length\u201d, \u201cshoulder-to-shoulder distance\u201d, and \u201cupper-leg circumference\u201d, then the minimum number of profiles is equal to one, because all three measurements can be collected from a single snapshot of a front profile of the user.","One way of finding the minimum set of profiles, given a collection of measurements, is to isolate the rows of  that correspond to the desired collection of measurements, and then to add up the number of times each profile occurs across both the Preferred and Alternate columns. A comparison of the profile counts, versus the total number of measurements, gives the minimum number of profiles needed to collect all the measurements. For example, if there are three measurements, and any profile appears three times across all the columns, than that profile alone is the only profile that is needed; otherwise, if any profile appears two times, then that profile and one other are the minimum needed; otherwise, three profiles may be required. This reasoning may be extended to any arbitrary number of measurements.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0122","num":"0176"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","505","505","510","510","515","505","520","515"]},"For example, the user's front profile might be chosen. In Step , the user may be prompted to adopt the profile . For example, if the front profile was chosen in Step , then the user would be prompted to stand facing the sensor, with arms extended to the sides. In Step , a data-snapshot is acquired, as previously described. In Step , a subset of the collection of body measurements is drawn from the snapshot, as described below. In Step , the system  checks whether all measurements in the collection of measurements  have been obtained. If \u201cno\u201d, then Step  repeats, selecting an unused profile from the set of user profiles that was generated in Step . If \u201cyes\u201d, then the current measurement collection process is complete (Step ).","Because of the user profile minimization process described previously, the user will be prompted to perform the lowest number of poses necessary to collect all the desired measurements; and because a single data-snapshot is virtually instantaneous, this means that embodiments of the present system and method may act very rapidly. For example, a measurement of neck circumference (e.g., for a necklace) may require only a single data-snapshot, occupying literally a fraction of a second\u2014the sizing-and-fitting equivalent of taking a single photo from a digital camera.","As described above, if the system is noisy, then some embodiments of the present inventive method may acquire multiple data snapshots in order to better extract signal from the noisy background. In such cases, Step  checks whether all desired measurements have been acquired according to a desired accuracy or threshold. An example of an accuracy might be, continue acquiring and averaging data snapshots until a pre-specified standard deviation of the data value is achieved. An example of a threshold might be, acquiring 60 data snapshots, at a rate of 30 data snapshots per second, and averaging depth map data values across (hem. Another example of a threshold might be, that the user views the results of the data measurement and process and decides whether to continue acquiring additional measurements or not. In general, Step  allows any type of calculation or decision-making process to improve signal extraction from noise.","It is also possible for the system to respond, in real-time, to the user's posture and profile, and opportunistically acquire measurements as the user moves around, in any order of measurements. Such embodiments of system , which enable real-time interactivity, are described further below and displayed in .","As set forth in  and, more generally in other embodiments, it is possible to perform measurements of not just the user's body surface, but of garments that the user is wearing. Step  highlights that worn-garment measurements may be collected instead of, or in addition to, user body surface measurements. For example, the user could put on a favorite pair of jeans, and an accordance with a specific embodiment, measurements may be acquired of the (now being-worn) jeans instead of (or in addition to) the users body surface, for example, by employing the same or similar steps as shown in .","One reason such worn-garment measurements would be valuable is that they could enable new garments to be identified, for example, from a warehouse or an online store that possessed purchasable garments having similar size and shape characteristics to the user's favorite pair of jeans (or any other worn item of clothing). So, in general, the steps in  may apply to either the user's body surface, or to garments that the user is wearing at the time of measurement.","Throughout this document, for purposes of brevity and clarity, we will refer to measurements of the user's body surface; but it should be understood that measurements of garments worn by the user also fall, in all respects, within the scope of the system and method, and that all discussions and figures herein pertain both to the measurement of a user's body as well as to measurement of any garments that may be worn by the user at the time of measurement.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0130","num":"0184"},"figref":["FIG. 6","FIG. 6","FIG. 6"],"b":["600","535","605","610","615","605","610","615"]},"Step  might be implemented using a queue data structure that is created and initially populated in Step . Step  might be implemented using a lookup table similar to , but with columns that are body portions (e.g., upper arm, torso, head) rather than user profiles.","There are six primary types of body surface measurements:\n\n","It should be appreciated that the lists of measurements and of qualitative descriptions shown above are not exhaustive, and that the scope of embodiments of the present system and method is not limited to these specific measurements and qualitative descriptions; additional types of body surface measurements may be identified and carried out by the system.","Embodiments of the present inventive method may use the identification of landmarks on the human body in order to conduct body measurements. A \u201clandmark\u201d as used herein is any point, or border, or in general, any distinguishing location or set of locations, on the body surface, or on worn garments, that may be identified and tracked in three-dimensional space with accuracy sufficient for the body-sizing application at hand. For example, in sizing garments, examples of landmarks might include the spatial position of the head of the ulna of the right arm (for shirt-sleeve-sizing); the lower border of the strap of a worn bra (for bra-sizing); or the upper border of the bridge of the nose (for eyeglass-sizing). For sizing garments, an example of a typical required accuracy might be approximately a half-centimeter to a centimeter; so that, for example, a shirt-sleeve-sizing application might identify and track the 3D spatial location of the head of the ulna for the right arm (among other measurements) within approximately a centimeter accuracy in real-time.","Landmarks are distinguished iron the skeleton data  by the precision, reproducibility, and reliability of landmarks. Skeleton data , if present, generally consist of approximate locations of nebulously defined portions of the body, or collections of anatomic structures. Skeleton data can be thought of as guideposts general regions of the human body. Most often, they correspond to joints of the human skeleton, such as the shoulder or knee, because machine recognition algorithms may be employed to recognize structures that stay relatively constant in shape while moving, such as arms and legs, and therefore these algorithms may also be used to identify the approximate articulation regions between, say, arms and legs.","An example of skeleton data would be the approximate 3D spatial location of the right shoulder joint. The right shoulder joint is of nebulous definition both structurally and spatially; it consists of multiple anatomic components (portions of the arm, ribcage, surrounding musculature, and so forth) and cannot be precisely located on the human body, only approximately outlined. The skeleton data corresponding to the right shoulder joint, therefore, cannot be used to precisely locate and track (over time) a specific portion of the shoulder, because these skeleton data do not refer to any particular part of the shoulder joint.","Furthermore, skeleton data may be erratic or \u201cjitter\u201d over time, depending on the underlying machine recognition algorithms being employed, again because they don't refer to any specific, particular location in space. Skeleton data are therefore, in general, incapable of being used to conduct precise measurements.","Landmarks are further distinguished from the pixel label data  by the precision, reproducibility, and reliability of landmarks. Pixel label data , if present, consist of labels that may be applied to individual pixels in depth data , or to individual pixels in optional color image data . The use of these labels, when they are present, is to distinguish human beings from each other, and from the ambient environment, in a field-of-view.","For example, it depth data  were represented by a 640 by 480 pixel depth map of a field-of-view, and if the depth pixel at coordinate (400, 200) corresponded to a distance to a portion of the body surface of a human being; the depth pixel at coordinate (500, 300) corresponded to a distance to a portion of the body surface of a different human being; and the depth pixel at coordinate (20, 50) corresponded to a distance to a door or a wall in the local environment, then depth pixel (400, 200) might be labeled \u201cperson #1\u201d, depth pixel (500, 300) might be labeled \u201cperson #2\u201d, and depth pixel (20, 50) might be labeled \u201cnon-person\u201d.","Similar reasoning applies to optional color image data . In sum, if depth data  or optional color image data  are represented as pixels\u2014for example, in an array or raster representation\u2014such pixels may be attached with labels that distinguish whether the pixel corresponds to a person or a non-person, and if a person, an arbitrary identifies for the person, where such labels are maintained in system  as optional pixel label data .","As with optional skeleton data , the optional pixel label data  generally cannot be used to precisely locate and track (over a specific portion of the human body. Optional pixel label data  are generally able to signify, for example, that a specific pixel in a particular data snapshot belongs to a surface of a human body and not the ambient environment; or that two different pixels belong to two different human bodies.","Optional pixel label data  generally cannot uniquely identify person's identity for example, they cannot label that a person is \u201cJohn H. Watson who lives at 221B Baker Street\u201d, as opposed to \u201cperson #1\u201d, nor can optional pixel label data generally label a portion of a body (for example, they cannot label that a pixel belongs to \u201cperson #1's right shoulder\u201d as opposed to just \u201cperson #1\u201d). Optional pixel label data  are therefore equivalent to a type of \u201cmask\u201d, as the term is known in computer science\u2014applying this pixel label \u201cmask\u201d to depth data  or to optional color image data  highlights which pixels, if any, correspond to an arbitrarily numbered human being.","Furthermore, similar to optional skeleton data , optional pixel label data  may be erratic or \u201cjump\u201d over time, depending on the underlying machine recognition algorithms being employed or on the noise the overall system . Pixel label data are therefore, in general, incapable of being used to conduct precise measurements.","A wide variety of methods to calculate skeleton data and\/or pixel label data as outputs, using depth data and\/or color image data as inputs, are known in the art, and may draw upon machine learning, statistical, or other technologies or methods. For example, the Microsoft Kinect For Windows Software Development Kit (SDK), from Microsoft Corp. of Seattle, USA, provides software routines to calculate skeleton data and pixel label data (called \u201cplayer identification\u201d in the Kinect for Windows SDK) from depth data and\/or color image data.","For example, the OpenNI open-source software framework, under the auspices of the OpenNI Organization, similarly provides software routines to calculate skeleton data (called \u201cjoint data\u201d in OpenNI) and pixel label data (called \u201cfigure identification\u201d in OpenNI) from depth data and\/or color image data. The Kinect for Windows SDK and the OpenNI framework employ different computational methods, utilize different APIs, have different operating characteristics, and represent information differently. They are mentioned here as illustrations of potential methods to calculate skeleton data  or pixel label data . The system  is agnostic as to the means by which skeleton data  or pixel label data  are generated. In distinction, \u201clandmarks\u201d as used herein are, by definition, of sufficient accuracy to conduct body measurements suitable for the particular application at hand, including real-time applications such as gait analysis. The word \u201cterminus\u201d, as used herein, is a special case of \u201clandmark\u201d: a terminus is a landmark that is a single point on the surface of the body (as distinguished from, for example, a border or a curve or a set of locations).","Note that some embodiments the present inventive method use types of energy, such as infrared light from IP light emitter , that cannot penetrate worn garments. Other embodiments may employ energy patterns that are able to penetrate worn garments. However, because suck penetrating, radiation may be harmful to human health, or may pose privacy hazards, some embodiments preferably rely on omitted energy of types, such as infrared, that do not penetrate worn garments. For many applications, such as sizing apparel, it is important to be able to measure either the surface of the human body directly, or of interposed worn garments that closely approximate the surface of the human body. As a result, some embodiments may place constraints on the nature of the clothing worn during execution of a particular application. For example, a shirt-sleeve-sizing application may require the user to wear a relatively tight-fitting shirt that does not have collars or cuffs, so that the system  can discern the correct underlying shape of the human body. Similarly, for example, a pants-sizing application may require the user to forego baggy cargo pants and the like.","In the descriptions and Figures that follow, it should be appreciated that often only depth data are required to carry out body measurements. For example, depth data alone\u2014or, optionally, a combination of depth data, and the skeleton data that are calculated from the depth data\u2014may be sufficient to carry out a measurement of shirt-sleeve size, because such data may enable identification of all necessary body landmarks (e.g., points on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist) and measure distances between those landmarks, in other cases, depth data are preferably combined with color image data, or a combination of depth data, calculated skeleton data, calculated pixel label data, and color image data may be preferable. In general, identifying the position of a body landmark requires utilizing some combination of depth data , optional skeleton data , optional pixel label data , and optional color image data , but the specific combination, and the specific requisite calculations carried out on that combination, differ from landmark to landmark.","For example, a combination of depth data, calculated skeleton data, and color image data may be preferable for determining bra size, because if the user is currently wearing a bra, the image data may be more accurate than the depth data for determining some spatial demarcations or borders of the bra. For example, the lower border of the bra, along the flattened and gradated abdomen, may be difficult to precisely locate using only depth data, but the color difference between the bra material and the exposed skin color beneath it may readily reveal the border with the use of color image data.","Steps  through  of  refer to additional Figures, respectively, to pursue each specific type of measurement to conduct.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0150","num":"0216"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIG. 6"],"b":["700","705","615","705","710","222","201","715"]},"Step  may alternately determine that multiple joints bound the body portion that was determined in Step  of . For example, the upper arm is bounded by shoulder and elbow joints (two joints in total); and the torso is bounded by two shoulder joints and two hip joints (four joints in total). Step  determines the approximate position of each joint, again using either skeleton data or image-segmentation methods.","In Step , the local body-surface outline, or silhouette, is determined around each joint or landmark position. For example, if a position corresponds to the elbow, then the local silhouette of the elbow is determined. The silhouette may be determined from a combination of depth data and\/or color image data and\/or pixel label data, using image-segmentation methods. The silhouette may be determined from depth data alone; in some cases, this may result in a degradation of accuracy (for example, if two body portions overlap too closely). The preferred representation of each outline generated by Step  is as a \u201cmask\u201d or labeling of pixels that is superimposed on the color image data  and depth data . Each outline thus describes a set of (x, y, z) locations of pixels that correspond to the body surface local to each joint or landmark position.","In Step , each outline from Step  is assigned a single terminus. The word \u201cterminus\u201d, as used herein, refers to a single point that corresponds to a location on the surface of the user's body; a terminus may be represented, for example, as an pixel location in a depth or image bitmap, or as an (x, y, z) point in space. The assignation of a terminus may be done using heuristic or computational methods. For example, the terminus of an elbow outline might be the point on the elbow midline that is furthest away from the ground in a front profile (in which profile the arm is extended to the side, as described previously).","As another example, the terminus of the top of the head might be the point on the surface of the head that is most distant from the ground. Step  invokes Step  if more than two terminuses were identified. Step  reduces the number terminuses to exactly two, using heuristic or computational methods. For example, if the height of the torso is being measured, then the two shoulder terminuses might be collapsed to a single terminus halfway between them, and similarly for the two hip terminuses, thus reducing the original tour terminuses to just two terminuses.","In Step , the straight-line spatial distance between the two terminuses of Step  or  is calculated. In Step , this straight-line spatial distance is optionally scaled to a real-world distance using a calibrator metric, as described previously. In Step , the straight-line spatial distance measurement may be stored for further use, and the routine exits at Step .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0156","num":"0222"},"figref":"FIG. 8","b":["800","805","820","705","720","825","820","810","815","825"]},"This determination of Step  is preformed in a similar fashion to Step  described previously; however,  determines the outline of a single body portion that is bounded by joint or landmark positions, rather than, as , the outline of separate areas that are each local to a joint or landmark. This determination  provides an incomplete representation of the surface of the body portion in question, because approximately half of the body portion is invisible to the sensor at any one time; for example, only half of the upper arm is visible to the sensor at any one time.","Step  may use heuristic or computational methods to assign one or more (x, y, z) terminuses to the outline of the body portion identified in . For example, if the upper arm is the body portion of interest, one terminus might be assigned to the point on the outline most distant front the ground (corresponding to the top of the thickest point of the biceps muscle), and the other terminus assigned to the point on the outline directly opposite (corresponding to the bottom of the arm directly below the thickest part of the biceps muscle). Another way to assign terminuses would be to select periodically-spaced points along the path of steepest curvature following the body portion surface.","Step  calculates the distance of the curvature, tracking the surface of the user's body, that connects together the terminuses of Step . An arbitrary number of terminuses may be so connected, in order to better approximate the real-world distance along the surface of the body portion of interest.","Step  multiplies the distance that was calculated in Step  by a so-called \u201cvisibility scaling factor\u201d. This factor compensates for the \u201cinvisible\u201d aspect of the body portion. Because a body portion will typically be hall-visible to the sensor, this factor is preferably simply the number 2 (reflecting the approximate symmetry of the human body). The result of Step  is a full circumference value.","Step  optionally scales the circumference value from Step  to a real-world distance using, a calibrator metric, as described previously.

If an angle compared to another body portion is desired (for example, the angle between upper arm and lower arm at point of the elbow), then Step  repeats Steps  through  to arrive at second line equation (corresponding to the second body portion of interest), and Step  calculates the resultant angle between the two computed line equations.

For example, if the abdomen is viewed from the front, then the back part of the abdomen will be hidden from view of the sensor portion .

For example, if the volume of the abdomen is being measured from the front profile, leaving a \u201chole\u201d in the back of the surface model where the abdomen is invisible to sensor portion , then Step  might close the 3D model under the modeling assumption that the back wall of the abdomen is a flat vertical plate.","Step  calculates the volume of the now-closed surface model, and Step  may store the volume measurement for future use.

For example, if the user happens to be facing the sensor portion  straight-on, then the current profile is a front profile; or, if the user happens to be turned sideways to the sensor portion , then current profile is a side profile. There are many different ways to determine the user's current profile.","For example, one way is to evaluate the relative approximate positions of the user's joints, such as shoulders and knees, relative to each other and\/or to the sensor portion . For example, another way is to apply facial recognition technologies to find the user's face and, if estimate the angle of the face relative to the sensor portion .","Optionally, the detected profile may be communicated to the user in Step , or at any other point in . For example, a screen display may indicate to the user that system  has identified the user to be in (for example) front profile. The user may then respond or adjust to the detected profile. For example, if the user intends to present a side profile to system , but the system  erroneously detects a front profile, the user is given an opportunity to become aware of the error, and may adjust his\/her position and stance to aid system  in detecting the correct profile.","Once the user's profile has been determined, a data-snapshot is acquired in Step , and a set of measurements is collected in Step . Steps  and  are equivalent to the like-numbered steps in .","Next, the measurements in Step  are optionally adjusted or updated. For example, to measure the shoulder-to-shoulder width of the user, the system  might perform a series of measurements over time during which the apparent shoulder-to-shoulder width may vary widely, as the user alternately faced the camera, or turned so present a side view to the camera. The process would then retain the largest such measurement under the assumption that the widest shoulder-to-shoulder measurement acquired by the system  would best match the real-world shoulder-to-shoulder distance.","Alternatively, the system  may calculate a running average of measurements, for example, by averaging the most-recent 100 measurements of the length of the left arm, so as to dampen signal noise. The purpose of Step , essentially, is to compensate for ongoing motions or varied stances of the user, so that measurements may be acquired or refined opportunistically, even while the user moves about naturally.","In Step , the results of Steps  and\/or  may be stored for further use. For example, if averaging certain measurements over time is desired, as described above, then Step  may be responsible for maintaining a stored series of measurements so that the running average may be calculated.","Optionally, the obtained measurements may be communicated to the user in Step , or at any other point in . For example, a screen display may indicate to the user that system  has measured the user's sleeve length to be for example) 31 inches. Or, for example, a screen display may draw rendered \u201cvirtual measuring tapes\u201d superimposed on an image of the user's body, thus indicating graphically some of the underlying calculations leading to the obtained measurements. The user may then respond or adjust to ale obtained measurements.","For example, if the user notices that the system  erroneously placed an end of a \u201cvirtual measuring tape\u201d on the user's finger, instead of the correct location on the user's wrist, then the user is given an opportunity to become aware of the error, and may adjust his\/her position and stance to aid system  in detecting the correct points for the \u201cvirtual measuring tape\u201d to lock onto. Thus the system  and the user may adjust and respond to each other, interactively, real-time. This interactivity applies whether the user is moving or stationary, as in both cases, the system  may continue to acquire data snapshots on an ongoing basis (for example, at a rate of 30 snapshots per second).","If graphical representations are employed by system , then to safeguard the user's privacy, it may be desirable to avoid displaying, an image of the user's face or head, while preserving the remainder of the user's body and the communication of measurements. For example, if body measurements are communicated to the user graphically by draping \u201cvirtual measuring tapes\u201d onto an image of the user's body, then before displaying the graphical representation, the system  may identify the portion of the user's body that represents the face or the head, and \u201cblank out\u201d or delete the visual information corresponding to that portion. In this way, the user's privacy may be safeguarded when needed.","As noted previously, in some embodiments, the system  may not gather any color image information at all. In other embodiments, the system  may gather color image information only temporarily, in order to use the color image information to carry out a set of measurements, and then immediately afterward discard the color image information. In general, for applications where user privacy is important, it is preferable to either gather no color image data at all; or, if color image data is required for some measurements, to gather color image data only as long as needed to determine the measurements, and then discard the color image data as soon as possible, without further storing or transmitting the color image data.","Step  then checks whether all body measurements have been obtained, to a desired level of accuracy or threshold, and if so, Step  exits the process. For example, Step  might transition to exit if the set of measurements in Step  remains constant within (for example) 1\/10 of a centimeter during (for example) 90 contiguous measurements. For example, Step  might transition to exit it the user views a set of measurements on a display screen and chooses to stop acquiring new measurements. Although not shown in  for reasons of brevity, it is appreciated that other decision points, besides step , are possible and would tall within the scope of the present system and method.
