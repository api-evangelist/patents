{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to self-service kiosks and more specifically to a system and method of processing payment of bills from multiple bill providers.","Kiosks provide a publicly accessible computing platform for displaying World Wide Web (web) pages and other web-delivered content from web sites. Kiosks may be located within a retailer's transaction establishment or elsewhere, such as in shopping malls. Kiosks may be easily networked to web sites using the TCP\/IP protocol. Web pages from web sites may be displayed using known and available web software, such as Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer software.","Customers seek an effective way to pay bills. Customers receive bills from multiple bill providers and must individually process payments to these bill providers.","Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a kiosk which can process payment of bills from multiple bill providers.","In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a system and method of processing payment of bills from multiple bill providers is provided.","The system includes a display for displaying a list of bill providers, an input device for recording customer selections of a number of the bill providers from the list, a payment accepting device, such as a check reader, card reader, or cash acceptor, and a processor for establishing connections to computers of the bill providers through the APIs which are resident on the kiosk in response to the customer selections, for sending customer identification information to the computers, for receiving and displaying customer account information from the computers, for recording the payments from the payment accepting device, and for sending payment information to the computers.","A method of processing a payment of a bill includes the steps of recording a customer selection of a bill provider from a list of bill providers displayed by a bill payment computer, connecting to a computer of the bill provider through an API of the bill provider resident on the bill payment computer, recording customer identification information by the bill payment computer, sending customer identification information to the computer of the bill provider by the bill payment computer, receiving and displaying customer account information from the computer of the bill provider by the bill payment computer, recording the payment by the bill payment computer, and sending payment information to the computer of the bill provider by the bill payment computer.","It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a system and method of processing payment of bills from multiple bill providers.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a kiosk which can process payment of bills from multiple bill providers.","Turning now to , system  includes kiosk  and bill provider host systems . Kiosk  is preferably located in a bill provider's establishment or a public place. Kiosk  may include an NCR  computer.","Kiosk  primarily includes processor , touch screen , memory , and storage medium . Kiosk  additionally includes a number of peripherals, including card reader , printer , cash acceptor , cash dispenser , check reader , and personal identification number (PIN) keypad .","Processor  executes bill payment application , which records bill payer information, retrieves bill information from bill provider host systems , displays instructions for completing payment of bills to bill providers, records bill payment via card reader , cash acceptor , or check reader , and dispenses change through cash dispenser .","In order to take cash or check payments, bill payment application  must also provide balancing functions, just like a point-of-sale terminal. This helps the kiosk owner create its deposit slip and balance the kiosk.","Bill payment application  communicates with bill provider host systems  over a network connection, such as one which uses the TCP\/IP protocol. Kiosk  may be connected to the World Wide Web (web) and may obtain web content from web servers. Bill provider host systems  may be external web servers.","Bill payment application  interacts with each bill provider host system  through system-specific application programming interfaces (APIs) . APIs  include a different API for each bill provider host system.","Advantageously, use of multiple APIs allows a bill payer to use a single kiosk to pay bills from a plurality of bill providers through corresponding APIs. APIs  may be developed and provided by the bill providers or developed otherwise with system information provided by the bill providers.","Bill payment application  determines what messages need to be constructed and where they need to be sent. Following receipt of payment, bill payment application  sends a message to bill provider host system  containing the amount of the payment. Bill provider host system  credits the payment against the bill.","Processor  may also execute web browser software  and web wrapper software .","Web browser software  allows an operator to display information in a format established by the World Wide Web (WWW or \u201cweb\u201d). Bill payment application  may be written as a web application which displays bill and payment information in the form of web pages , although bill payment application may also be a non-web application and operate without web browser software  and web wrapper software . Web pages  may be written using hypertext markup language (HTML) or other suitable web page language.","Web browser software  may include commercially available web browser software, such as Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer web browser software. Microsoft\u00ae Internet Explorer web browser software is configured into a kiosk operation using a \u201c-k\u201d command line option. This option hides toolbars and menu bars to prevent operator access to those functions.","Web browser software  may also display a start or \u201chome\u201d page within web pages  which operates as a default page from which kiosk operation begins and to which operation returns when an operator is finished using kiosk . Web browser software  may also facilitate purchase of goods from retailers and may also serve to display advertisement when not in use.","Web wrapper software  provides security functions. During operation, web wrapper software  prevents an operator from accessing kiosk files, or other applications, or the operating system software, or basic input-output system (BIOS) firmware, and prevents the operator from causing kiosk  to reboot.","Touch screen  includes display  and input device . Display  and input device  may also be separate units. Input device  may record bill provider selection information from a bill payer.","Storage medium  stores web pages  for use by bill payment application  and other applications. Some of web pages  may be obtained from web servers.","Memory  is used by processor  to store executed program information.","Card reader  reads loyalty, credit, debit, SMART, and\/or other types of cards carried by a bill payer. Card reader  may record payment information from a bill payer.","Printer  prints receipt information.","Cash acceptor  accepts cash in multiple denominations.","Cash dispenser  dispenses change.","Check reader  reads checks and includes a magnetic ink character (MICR) reader. Check reader  also includes printer  for printing information on checks.","PIN keypad  records PIN numbers for debit card transactions.","Kiosk  may additionally include barcode reader , which may be used to scan barcode labels on bills. The barcode labels contain bill payer identification and account information.","Bill provider host systems  are associated with different bill providers. Bill provider host systems  receive payment information from kiosk , credit payments against the bills, and report successful receipt of payment information back to bill payment application .","Turning now to , operation of kiosk  is illustrated in detail beginning with START .","In step , kiosk  waits for a user to operate kiosk . During this time, kiosk  may be displaying advertisements or other web content.","In step , kiosk  records selection of a bill payment option from the start page by a bill payer to start bill payment application .","In step , bill payment application  displays a list of bill providers represented by kiosk .","In step , bill payment application  records a customer selection for a bill provider.","In step , bill payment application  connects to the associated bill provider host system  through the associated API .","In step , bill payment application  records customer identification information through touch screen , card reader , or barcode reader .","In step , bill payment application  sends customer identification information to bill provider host system .","In step , bill payment application  obtains account information from bill provider host system . Bill payment application  also determines what payments methods are valid for this bill payer or bill provider. For example, if a bill payer has written too many bad checks, then bill provider host system  may block payment by check for this bill payer.","In step , bill payment application  displays payment options.","In step , bill payment application  records payment.","In step , bill payment application  sends payment to bill provider host system . Bill provider host system  credits the bill payer account and sends a message to bill payment application  indicating successful receipt of payment.","In step , bill payment application  prints a receipt.","In step , bill payment application  displays a message indicating that payment is completed and determines whether the bill payer wishes to pay another bill. If the bill payer wishes to pay another bill, operation returns to step  to select another bill provider following operator selection. If not, operation proceeds to step  following operator selection.","In step , kiosk  closes bill payment application .","Operation ends at step . At this point the bill payer may use kiosk  for other purposes or leave. After the bill payer has left, operation returns to step  to await another user.","Although the present invention has been described with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, variations and modifications of the present invention can be effected within the spirit and scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["Additional benefits and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which this invention relates from the subsequent description of the preferred embodiments and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 2A and 2B"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
