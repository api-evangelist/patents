Field of the Invention","The present invention generally relates to information processing apparatuses and methods, and recording media therefore. More particularly, the invention relates to an information processing apparatus and method for storing, for example, information concerning purchase and repair information of electronic apparatuses, and to a recording medium for storing a program implementing the above-described method.","2. Description of the Related Art","In a home network system using, for example, an IEEE-1394serial bus, a plurality of electronic apparatuses, such as an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) and a digital video cassette recorder (DVCR) are connected to each other, and information is transmitted and received therebetween, thereby reading or recording images or sound information. In the IEEE-1394 serial bus, one electronic apparatus controls other electronic apparatuses by sending an audio video\/control (AV\/C) command to them.","As middleware which hides the AV\/C command from various types of application software, the home audio\/video interoperability architecture (HAVi) (trademark) is known. According to the HAVi, electronic apparatuses are controlled by a device control module (DCM).","When such electronic apparatuses break down, they need repairing. Normally, a guarantee card is attached to an electronic apparatus in order to guarantee failures occurring during a predetermined period after purchasing the apparatus. A repair technician checks the guarantee card and repairs the defect free of charge if the failure has occurred within the predetermined guarantee period.","However, it is troublesome to keep the guarantee card and it is also easy to lose it. If the guarantee card is lost, the user has to pay for the services, even within the guarantee period.","Accordingly, for managing electronic apparatuses, a special writer may be used for recording repair information and guarantee-card information in the electronic apparatuses, and a special reader may be used for reading the information from the electronic apparatuses.","In order to implement such a technique, however, it is necessary to connect the electronic apparatus to the special reader\/writer so as to transmit and receive information. Additionally, it is necessary for the repair technician to bring the special reader\/writer every time the electronic apparatus is repaired, which is troublesome.","Accordingly, in view of the above background, it is an object of the present invention to make the management of guarantee cards easy by storing purchase and repair information of electronic apparatuses and reading such information from the apparatuses without requiring a special reader\/writer.","In order to achieve the above object, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an electronic apparatus. The information processing apparatus includes a control-information acquiring unit for acquiring, from the electronic apparatus, control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the electronic apparatus. A control-information identification\/storage unit identifies the control information acquired by the control-information acquiring unit and stores the acquired control information therein. A product-history updating unit updates the product history information stored in the electronic apparatus based on the control information stored in the control-information identification\/storage unit.","In the aforementioned information processing apparatus, the information signal may be sent and received via a network system. In this case, the network system may include an IEEE-1394 serial bus.","The aforementioned information processing apparatus may further include a product-history storage unit. In this case, the product history information may be read from the electronic apparatus based on the control information stored in the control-information identification\/storage unit, and may be stored in the product-history storage unit.","The aforementioned information processing apparatus may further include: an apparatus-identification-number reading unit for reading an apparatus identification number of the electronic apparatus from the electronic apparatus; and a central storage unit for centrally storing the product history information stored in the product-history storage unit together with the apparatus identification number of the electronic apparatus into an external electronic apparatus.","The aforementioned information processing apparatus may further include a product-history reading unit for reading the product history information of the electronic apparatus from the product history information stored in the external electronic apparatus by the central storage unit based on the apparatus identification number of the electronic apparatus.","The above-described product history updating unit may further include a product-history display unit. The product history information may be read from the electronic apparatus based on the control information and may be displayed by the product-history display unit.","The aforementioned product history updating unit may further include a product-history input unit for inputting new product history information concerning the electronic apparatus from an external source based on the product history information displayed by the product-history display unit.","The above-described control-information acquiring unit may acquire the control information from the electronic apparatus when a communication connection with the electronic apparatus is established.","The information processing apparatus may further include a purchase-information determining unit for determining whether the purchase information has already been written into the electronic apparatus. In this case, the product-history updating unit may not write new purchase information into the electronic apparatus when the purchase-information determining unit determines that the purchase information has already been written.","The above-described product-history updating unit may not overwrite the repair information concerning the electronic apparatus.","The above-described purchase information may include at least one of the date on which the electronic apparatus was purchased, the name, the address, and the telephone number of a store at which the electronic apparatus was purchased, and a digital signature of the store.","The above-described repair information may include at least one of the date on which the electronic apparatus was repaired, the item and the type of repair, a contact number, the name of a repair company, and information concerning a repair person.","According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing method for use in an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an electronic apparatus. The information processing method include: a control-information acquiring step of acquiring, from the electronic apparatus, control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the electronic apparatus; a control-information identification\/storage step of identifying the control information acquired in the control-information acquiring step and of storing the acquired control information therein; and a product:-history updating step of updating the product history information stored in the electronic apparatus based on the control information stored in the control-information identification\/storage step.","According to still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recording medium for storing a computer-readable program which controls an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an electronic apparatus. The computer-readable program includes: a control-information acquiring step of acquiring, from the electronic apparatus, control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the electronic apparatus; a control-information identification\/storage step of identifying the control information acquired in the control-information acquiring step and of storing the acquired control information therein; and a product-history updating step of updating the product history information stored in the electronic apparatus based on the control information stored in the control-information identification\/storage step.","According to the foregoing information processing apparatus and method, and the program stored in the recording medium, the control information used for reading or writing the product history information including at least one of the purchase information and the repair information concerning the electronic apparatus is acquired from the electronic apparatus. The acquired control information is then stored, and based on the control information, the product history information stored in the electronic apparatus is updated. It is thus possible to easily manage an electronic guarantee card without installing a guarantee FCM in advance.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an external information processing apparatus. The information processing apparatus includes a control-information storage unit for storing control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the information processing apparatus. A product-history storage unit stores the product history information to be updated by an instruction from the external information processing apparatus. A control-information sending unit sends the control information stored in the control-information storage unit to the external information processing apparatus in response to a request from the external information processing apparatus.","In the aforementioned information processing apparatus, the control signal may be sent and received via a network system. In this case, the network system may include an IEEE-1394 serial bus.","The aforementioned information processing apparatus may further include an apparatus-identification-number storage unit for storing an apparatus identification number of the information processing apparatus. In this case, in response to an instruction from the external information processing apparatus, the apparatus identification number may be read from the apparatus-identification-number storage unit, and the stored product history information may be read from the product-history storage unit.","The aforementioned information processing apparatus may further include a product-history display unit for displaying the product history information stored in the product-history storage unit.","The above-described control-information sending unit may send the control information to the external information processing apparatus when a communication connection with the external information processing apparatus is established.","The above-described purchase information may include at least one of the date on which the information processing apparatus was purchased, the name, the address, and the telephone number of a store at which the information processing apparatus was purchased, and a digital signature of the store.","The above-described repair information may include at least one of the date on which the information processing apparatus was repaired, the item and the type of repair, a contact number, the name of a repair company, and information concerning a repair person.","According to a yet further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an information processing method for use in an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an external information processing apparatus. The information processing method includes: a control-information storage step of storing control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the information processing apparatus; a product-history storage step of storing the product history information to be updated by an instruction from the external information processing apparatus; and a control-information sending step of sending the control information stored in the control-information storage step to the external information processing apparatus in response to a request from the external information processing apparatus.","According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a recording medium for storing a computer-readable program which controls an information processing apparatus for sending and receiving an information signal to and from an external information processing apparatus. The computer-readable program includes: a control-information storage step of storing control information used for writing or reading product history information which includes at least one of purchase information and repair information concerning the information processing apparatus; a product-history storage step of storing the product history information to be updated by an instruction from the external information processing apparatus; and a control-information sending step of sending the control information stored in the control-information storage step to the external information processing apparatus in response to a request from the external information processing apparatus.","According to the foregoing information processing apparatus and method, and the program stored in the recording medium, the control information for writing or reading the product history information including at least one of the purchase information and the repair information concerning the information processing apparatus is stored. Then, the product history information to be updated by an instruction from an external information processing apparatus is stored. Based on a request from the external information processing apparatus, the stored control information is sent to the external information processing apparatus. The electronic guarantee card can thus be easily managed.","Referring to the block diagram of , a home network system configured in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is formed of an IRD  and a DVCR . The IRD  and the DVCR  are connected to an IEEE-1394serial bus . When being connected to the IEEE-1394 serial bus , the DVCR  sends a device control module (DCM) and a functional component module (FCM), which will be discussed below, to the IRD  via the IEEE-1394 serial bus . The IRD  detects the state of the apparatuses connected to the IEEE-1394 serial bus  from the received information (DCM and FCM), and displays a graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling such apparatuses on a built-in liquid crystal display (LCD)  shown in .","The user operates a touch panel  () provided for the IRD  based on the display of the LCD  so as to instruct the DVCR  connected to the IEEE-1394 serial bus  to execute processing. In response to the user's instruction, the IRD  generates a control signal and supplies it to the DVCR  via the IEEE-1394 serial bus . Upon receiving the control signal, the DVCR  performs processing, such as recording or playing back images or sound.","The IRD  is configured, for example, as shown in . A signal transmitted from the DVCR  is input into a central processing unit (CPU)  via the IEEE-1394 serial bus , an IEEE-1394 interface , and an internal bus . When the touch panel  is operated by the user, the corresponding signal is also input into the CPU  via an input\/output interface  and the internal bus . The touch panel  can be operated according to a message (GUI) displayed on the LCD . The IRD  may be remotely controlled by a remote controller (not shown) rather than being operated through the touch panel .","The CPU  reads a program stored in a read only memory (ROM)  or a hard disk  and executes it according to the received signal. The CPU  then outputs the processing result to the LCD  via the input\/output interface  and displays it on the LCD  as required. The CPU  also generates character\/image data representing, for example, a message for assisting the user's operation, outputs it to the LCD  via the internal bus  and the input\/output interface , and displays it on the LCD . Additionally, the CPU  generates et control signal for controlling the DVCR  and transmits it to the DVCR  via the internal bus , the IEEE-1394 interface , and the IEEE-1394 serial bus . A random access memory (RAM)  temporarily stores a program executed by the CPU , data created by the execution of the program, data required for executing processing by the DVCR , etc.","An antenna  supplies received satellite broadcast signals to a tuner  of the IRD . The tuner  selects and receives a signal of the broadcast channel instructed by the CPU  from among the satellite broadcast signals received from the antenna . In the hard disk , various types of application and middleware executed by the CPU  are stored. A magnetic disk , an optical disc , a magneto-optical disk , and a semiconductor memory  may be loaded in a drive .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["3","2","53","1","51","52","60","53","59","52"]},"The CPU  reads and executes a program stored in a ROM  based on a received signal so as to output a control signal to, for example, a recording\/playback processor  via the internal bus , and also sends the DCM and FCM stored in the ROM  to the IRD  via the internal bus , the IEEE-1394 interface , and the IEEE-1394 serial bus .","A non-volatile memory  is formed of, for example, electrically erasable and programmable read only memory (EEPROM), and includes a purchase-information storage area  and a repair-information storage area , as shown in . The purchase-information storage area  stores purchase information (the date on which and the store where the DVCR  was purchased (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cpurchase date and purchase store\u201d), and a digital signature of the purchase store), while the repair-information storage area  stores a plurality of items of repair information (the date on which and the store where the DVCR  was repaired (hereinafter referred to as the \u201crepair date and repair store\u201d), repair technician's name, contact number, repair company, etc.). The RAM  temporarily stores a program to be executed by the CPU , data created by the execution of the program, data required for executing the processing by the DVCR , etc.","The recording\/playback processor  reads data recorded on a medium (in this example, a video cassette tape, which is not shown) loaded in the DVCR  according to the signal received via the CPU . The recording\/playback processor  then returns the data to the IRD  via the internal bus , the IEEE-1394 interface , and the IEEE-1394 serial bus , or outputs it to an LCD  via the internal bus  and the input\/output interface  and displays it on the LCD . The recording\/playback processor  also records data transmitted from the IRD  via the IEEE-1394 serial bus , the IEEE-1394 interface , and the internal bus  on the video cassette tape (not shown) loaded in the DVCR .","A memory in cassette (MIC) communication unit  communicates with a MIC, for example, a semiconductor memory or a Memory Stick (trademark), stored in the video cassette tape inserted into the DVCR  so as to detect information recorded on the MIC. The MIC stores an ID (ID number) unique to the video cassette tape. By reading the ID recorded on the MIC via the internal bus , the CPU  is able to identify a new cassette tape loaded in the DVCR . The ID recorded in the MIC is also read into the IRD  via the internal bus , the IEEE-1394 interface , and the IEEE-1394 serial bus . This enables the IRD  to identify the video cassette tape inserted into the DVCR .","To perform the operation by the apparatuses on the network shown in  in association with each other, middleware for controlling and managing the network is required. The middleware is positioned between an operating system (OS), a network control program, or lower software, such as a database system, and upper application software, so as to provide various services to the application software. When apparatuses produced by different manufactures are connected to the network, common standards to which the middleware should conform are also required for the accurate operation of the network and the mutual operation of the apparatuses. In this embodiment, the HAVi is used as the middleware for controlling and managing the network, and a network system implementing this HAVi is discussed below.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0068","num":"0067"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 5"],"b":["30","2"]},"The 1394 driver is a module which describes portions dependent on the IEEE-1394 serial bus , and provides a common procedure to the higher software modules for accessing devices. Communication media manager (CMM)-1394 serves as an interface for connecting the IEEE-1394 serial bus  with the HAVi software modules and the application. The CMM1394 provides a transmission mechanism for transmitting and receiving signals between the apparatuses connected to the IEEE-1394 serial bus . The CMM1394 thus monitors the operation status of the IEEE-1394 serial bus  and provides the corresponding information to the other software modules.","A messaging system serves as an application programming interface (API) for the communication between the software modules of the apparatuses on the network, so as to send messages between the software modules. Accordingly, on the network using the HAVi, the sender and the receiver are able to send and receive messages without being aware where they are placed on the network.","A DCM manager installs a DCM, a DVCRFCM, and a guarantee card FCM, which are discussed below, on each apparatus on the network. On the network using the HAVi, when a new apparatus is connected to the network, the DCM manager installs the DCM, the DVCRFCM, and the guarantee card FCM corresponding to the new apparatus, and when an apparatus is disconnected from the network, the DCM manager uninstalls the DCM, the DVCRFCM, and the guarantee card FCM corresponding to the disconnected apparatus.","An event manager is used for generating an event and sending it to another software module when the status of the network changes, such as when a new apparatus is connected to or disconnected from the network. Accordingly, in the network using the HAVi, plug-and-play can be implemented.","A registry stores or updates information concerning apparatuses, such as the type of apparatuses connected to the network, or the type of functions possessed by the apparatuses, and achieves interactivity between different types of apparatuses. An application program obtains required information from this registry. By referring to the registry, each apparatus on the network is able to check where the basic software modules of the other apparatuses are located on the network.","A stream manager monitors and manages the flow of stream data (sequential data), such as images and sound, on the network, and enables real time transmission of the stream data. The stream manager also manages the connection between components of the apparatus and the connection between the apparatuses, and retains and opens network resources and also provides information of the connection state of the entire network. Additionally, the stream manager supports the re-connection of apparatuses after resetting the bus of the network.","A resource manager monitors the network so as to handle a conflict problem for the right to use devices, manage scheduled events, such as events reserved in the connected apparatuses, and check whether there is no apparatus disconnected after being registered.","The application controls and manages a guarantee card FCM for controlling the apparatuses connected to the network. This guarantee card FCM is used for reading the electronic guarantee card (purchase information or repair information) of the corresponding apparatus and writing data into the electronic guarantee card. Details of the guarantee card are described below.","The DCM, which is installed from the DVCR , is used for controlling the apparatuses. An application program controls each apparatus connected to the network via the corresponding DCM rather than directly controlling the apparatus. The DVCRFCM is installed from the DVCR , and represents the content (function) of the control to be executed on each apparatus by the application program. The DVCRFCM sends an AV\/C command to the apparatus designated by the DCM.","The guarantee card FCM, which is installed by the DVCR , is used for accessing the electronic guarantee card (purchase information or repair information) stored in the non-volatile memory . The guarantee card FCM represents the content (function) of access made to the electronic guarantee card of each apparatus by the application program, and sends an AV\/C command designated by the DCM, as in the DVCRFCM.","The DCM, the DVCRFCM, and the guarantee card FCM serve as APIs, and thus, it is not necessary for the application program to consider the difference between the types of apparatuses. Accordingly, in the network using the HAVi, an apparatus on the network is able to identify the functions of the other apparatuses connected to the network so that it is able to remotely operate the other apparatuses.","The individual software modules of the software stack shown in  are read from the hard disk  to the RAM  and are executed by the CPU , though a description thereof is not given.","The above-described software modules are possessed by each apparatus connected to the network according to the class of the apparatus designated by the HAVi. In the HAVi, the following four classes are defined.","A full AV device (FAV) corresponds to an apparatus having a network managing function, and includes all the HAVi software modules (FAV may not possess a DCM, a DVCRFCM, and a guarantee card FCM, but such modules may be installed from a base AV device (BAV), which is described below). The FAV is able to execute an application using Java (trademark), which employs HAVi byte code. Accordingly, the FAV is able to possess the DCMs, the FCMs, and the guarantee card FCMs of the other apparatuses so that they are operated under the control of the FAV.","As in the FAV, an intermediate AV device (IAV) corresponds to an apparatus having a network managing function. However, unlike the FAV, the IAV contains DCMs, FCMs, and guarantee card FCMs of the other apparatuses since it is unable to execute an application using Java, which employs HAVi byte code.","A base AV device (BAV) corresponds to a controlled apparatus which can be directly connected to a network using the HAVi, and possesses a DCM, a FCM, and a guarantee card FCM of its own.","A legacy AV device (LAV) corresponds to an apparatus whose function is limited to being connectable to the IEEE-1394serial bus . However, since the LAV responds to an AV\/C command, it can be operated as a controlled apparatus as well as being operated singly.","In the present invention, it is assumed that the IRD  is an FAV (IEEE-1394 interface  corresponds to the 1394driver and the CMM1394 shown in ) and the DVCR  is a BAV.","By installing the DCM, the DVCRFCM, and the guarantee card FCM of the DVCR , which is a BAV, as shown in , the IRD , which is a FAV, is able to operate the DVCR  under the control of the IRD .","A description is given below, with reference to the flow chart of , of the message analyzing processing executed by the guarantee card FCM installed in the IRD .","In step S, a guarantee card FCM connects to the messaging system, and registers a call back function. In step S, the messaging system delivers ID information (SEID) of the guarantee card FCM to the guarantee card FCM.","Upon receiving the SEID from the messaging system, in step S, the guarantee card FCM determines whether the call back function is called by the application. If not, it waits for the call back function to be called by the application. If it is found in step S that the call back function is called, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM analyzes a message from the application. More specifically, it is determined in step S whether the analyzed message indicates setInfo. If so, the guarantee card FCM outputs the AV\/C command corresponding to setInfo to the DVCR  via the internal bus , the IEEE-1394interface , and the IEEE-1394 serial bus , and the process then proceeds to step S.","In step S, by referring to the purchase-information storage area  of the non-volatile memory  of the DVCR , the guarantee card FCM determines whether purchase information of the DVCR  has already been written into the purchase-information storage area . If so, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM sends a message to the sender (application) indicating that the writing of the purchase information has failed. The guarantee card FCM then returns to step S, and repeats the above-described processing.","If it is found in step S that purchase information of the DVCR  has not been written into the purchase-information storage area , the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the guarantee card FCM writes purchase information of the DVCR  into the purchase-information storage area  of the non-volatile memory , and sends a message to the sender indicating that the purchase information has been successfully written. The guarantee card FCM then returns to step S, and repeats the above-described processing.","If it is found in step S that the analyzed message does not indicate setInfo, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM further determines whether the analyzed message indicates getInfo. If so, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM reads the purchase information from the purchase-information storage area  of the non-volatile memory  and sends it to the sender. The process then returns to step S, and the aforementioned processing is repeated.","If it is found in step S that the analyzed message does not indicate getInfo, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM further determines whether the analyzed message indicates addHistory. If so, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM writes repair information of the DVCR  into the repair-information storage area  of the non-volatile memory . Then, the process returns to step S, and the aforementioned processing is repeated.","If it is determined in step S that the analyzed message does not indicate addHistory, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM further makes a determination as to whether the analyzed message indicates getHistory. If so, the process proceeds to step S in which the guarantee card FCM reads repair information from the repair-information storage area  of the non-volatile memory  and sends it to the sender. The process returns to step S, and the above-described processing is repeated.","If it is found in step S that the analyzed message does not indicate getHistory, the process returns to step S, and the above-described processing is repeated.","A description is now given of the message analyzing processing executed by the application of the IRD  with reference to the flow chart of . The DVCR  has already been connected to the network, and this processing is started when the requester (user) inputs an instruction to access the electronic guarantee card stored in the non-volatile memory  of the DVCR .","In step S, the application connects to the messaging system and registers a call back function, and then receives a SEID of the IRD  from the messaging system.","In step S, the application searches the registry for the SEID of the guarantee card FCM. In step S, the application displays the initial screen for sending a command to the guarantee card FCM having the SEID searched for in step S. Then, a GUI, such as the one shown in , is displayed.","The application determines in step S whether any one of the buttons, such as a purchase-information input button , a purchase-information display button , a repair-information input button , a repair-information display button , and a close button , has been touched by the user's operation on the touch panel . If not, the application waits until one of the buttons  through  is touched.","If it is found in step S that one of the buttons  through  has been touched, the process proceeds to step S. In step S, the application determines whether the pressed button is the purchase-information input button . If so, the process proceeds to step S in which the application displays a purchase-information input screen on the LCD . Then, a GUI, such as the one shown in , is displayed.","On the GUI shown in , by using, for example, a keyboard displayed on the touch panel , a requester (for example, a salesclerk) fills the date on which the apparatus (DVCR ) was purchased in a purchase date area , the name, address, and telephone number of the purchase store in a store input area , and a digital signature of the store in a digital-signature input area .","The application then determines in step S whether the salesclerk has filled required data in the GUI shown in  and has pressed an OK button  by operating the touch panel . If not, the application waits until the required data has been filled in.
