{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention relates to a display system for a vehicle and particularly to one which provides a display of selected names of points of interest arranged by category and elemental directions to a selected point of interest. One embodiment provides a graphic display of cross-streets or addresses as the vehicle travels along a local roadway.","There exist numerous vehicle navigation systems which provide graphic map displays, which allow the vehicle operator, through significant manipulation of controls, to plan a travel route and obtain information about arrival destinations, typically by address. Some systems provide navigation control through the use of voice recognition programs and control circuits. All of these systems are relatively expensive, complicated and difficult for a vehicle operator to utilize, particularly when preoccupied with surrounding traffic in congested areas. Some suggested simplified navigation systems allow the vehicle operator to either identify his or her current location by street address and forthcoming intersection information, as well as basic points of interest information. Such systems are relatively inexpensive but do not provide the operator with the flexibility of providing points-of-interest information in a user-friendly format nor additional desirable features, such as easily accessible alternate displays of forthcoming highway exits, street intersections, or street addresses when traveling on a local street.","Thus, there remains a need for a display system for a vehicle which is relatively inexpensive and is user-friendly to operate using a minimum number of intuitive controls. Such a system needs to provide desirable features, such as points of interest in selected categories which can be easily accessed with minimal operator intervention and yet provide the operator with sufficient information to be able to locate and travel to such points-of-interest.","The system of the present invention satisfies this need by providing a point-of-interest display system in which an updateable database includes road network information, which can be updated at relatively infrequent time intervals, and point-of-interest information which can be user-updated at more frequent intervals, as new points of interest become available. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the database is carried on the vehicle in the form of a flashcard or other removable memory device or loaded into flash memory residing in the vehicle via a data communication system. The database interfaces with a microprocessor on the vehicle which receives data from a current position detector, such as a GPS receiver, providing the system with current vehicle location and direction of travel information. A display provides the operator textural and elemental graphic display information, and one or more control switches are positioned in an easily accessible location within the vehicle such that the operator, by scrolling through displayed highway exits, can select categories of points of interest, and points of interest within a category upon the actuation of a minimal number of switches in an intuitive sequence.","In one embodiment of the invention, two modes of operation provide point-of-interest information either while the vehicle is traveling on a limited access highway or, once the vehicle has exited the highway, provides more specific point-of-interest directions. In another embodiment of the invention, the operator can, when on a local road, select the textural display of forthcoming and past intersecting streets, which is updated as the vehicle travels along the roadway. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the navigation system provides a display of the street addresses on which the vehicle is traveling and increments, decrements, or otherwise updates the address as the vehicle moves. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, each of these features are incorporated in a system which allows selection between the features, either manually or automatically as the vehicle moves between a limited access highway and a local roadway.","These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the following description thereof together with reference to the accompanying drawings.","Referring initially to , there is shown a vehicle , such as an automobile, van, sports utility vehicle, truck, or the like, which incorporates a point-of-interest display system of one embodiment of the present invention. The point-of-interest display system  is mounted in one embodiment in an overhead console , although it can be mounted at any conveniently accessible location within easy reach of the vehicle operator, such as in the instrument panel. The point-of-interest system includes a switch group  and a display section , shown in detail in . The point-of-interest system can be mounted within a housing , which includes both the display  and switch section , as well as a memory card slot  for receiving a removable memory card , such as a flashcard on which the point-of-interest and road network data is programmed. Alternatively, separate mounting of the components is possible.","The memory card  typically will be at least a 128 meg card, although 256 or 512 meg cards may be preferred. The memory card is removable from slot , such that data thereon, including road network information and point-of-interest (POI) information, can be separately programmed in layers thereon, such that the road network and POI data can be refreshed at different, periodic intervals. Memory card  includes nonvolatile memory and contains a handshake code to communicate with a microprocessor  () of the system, so the microprocessor can read data on the memory card . The system, as seen in , also includes a programmable SRAM memory , which contains the program for the sequential operation of the system, as shown in . The flow diagram for the program is shown in , B, and C, described below. In one embodiment memory card  can be obtained from a car dealer with an update subscription service for refreshing the data on the card either annually, in the case of road network information, or more frequently as new points of interest may become available, such as, for example, on a monthly basis. Alternatively, the user may subscribe to a web site providing download information for refreshing the data on memory card  on a personal computer if desired. Card  may also be updated through other means. Typically, the memory card will have data sufficient for a regional area in which the vehicle normally travels and will contain points of interest according to categories, such as gas, food, and lodging, as well as all the major (i.e., limited access) and secondary road identifications and street addresses for secondary roads.","The map database is composed of at least two layers, at least one of which includes data like points of interest that change frequently. It is, therefore, desirable to update this information frequently. Another layer or layers of data contain information like the road network that may be undated less frequently. The data layers are linked and each layer may be updated either independently or in combination with other layers. This allows the consumer to obtain updated information without excessive download time when refreshing the data through the Internet, since the update can be limited to the part of the data that changes frequently.","Each layer is contained within a single file on the flashcard  for a given geographical area. Every POI record, whether for highway or local coverage, references a street name record in the road network file. This reference is stored in the POI file as an index into the street name table in the road network file.","As the latest POI information is released and compiled, every POI file that is created is associated with the latest road network file available. In addition, any new points of interest that are associated with roads that are not yet compiled into the latest road network file are added to the POI file but are flagged as being without a street name. All other POI attributes, such as telephone number, latitude\/longitude and name, are still available in this case. Details of some aspects of the programming of they system to provide the various modes of operation are disclosed in application Ser. No. 60\/419,934, entitled SMDVLPII, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference and in connection with the flow diagrams of .","The system, as best seen in , includes a current location detection device, such as GPS receiver , having an antenna  for receiving global positioning satellite signals from multiple satellites and providing current location data to one or more microprocessor(s) , which can be a Motorola MC9512DJ64 or its equivalent, through a universal asynchronous receiver\/transmitter connection . Other current location detection sources of data, such as a Loran receiver, gyro compass, or dead reckoning information sources, may also be employed but a GPS receiver represents the current best mode of receiving such data. The microprocessor receives vehicle location data from the GPS receiver and point-of-interest and road network data from the flashcard , which is inserted into slot  and coupled to the one or more microprocessor(s) . An SRAM memory  is also coupled to the microprocessor(s)  and contains the system program. The microprocessor is also coupled to one or more operator-actuated switches in the switch section  and to a display , such as a dot matrix display, for selectively displaying information, such as shown in FIGS.  and -, to the vehicle operator.","The point-of-interest circuit  is coupled to the vehicle power system, as shown in , and includes an ignition input for receiving power when the ignition is either in the run or accessory position, a B+ input drawing a maximum of 300 micro amps when the system is deactivated, a coupling to the system ground and a pulse width modulated dimming input circuit for dimming the back-lighted switches of the switch bank  and the dot matrix display  based upon the operator's selected lighting level for instrument displays. In some installations, the system could be coupled directly to the vehicle's power supply through the ignition switch and vehicle ground. In another, dimming information is received from the vehicle bus. The microprocessor  is also coupled to other vehicle systems, such as a vehicle compass  for displaying in the normal mode of operation, when the point-of-interest system is not being employed, the outside temperature, the compass heading, the time and date information, as seen in . The microprocessor may also be coupled to and employed for other vehicle control functions, such as a Homelink\u00ae brand programmable transmitter , and may be coupled to the vehicle bus  for receiving PWM dimming information, ignition run, accessory information, and the like. An outside temperature sensor and circuit  may be coupled to the microprocessor(s)  or the vehicle bus , as shown in , to provide the temperature display as seen in . Also, a trip computer  may be coupled to the microprocessor(s)  or to the vehicle bus , as shown in , to provide typical trip functions, such as a resettable odometer, fuel consumption, average speed, and estimated time of arrival information, which can be displayed on display .","The user-friendly, intuitive switch controls  are seen in  and incorporate a menu switch , a scroll forward switch , a scroll back switch , which are physically positioned on the console pointing in a forward and rearward position, respectively, with arrows thereon so as to intuitively indicate to the vehicle operator that the actuation of the scroll switches advances the display to a point of interest or highway exit forward or behind the vehicle. The switch controls  also includes a select switch  for selecting a given entry highlighted by the movement of a display cursor  () through actuation of scroll switches  and  and a back switch , which allows the operator to move back one entry. Additionally, keys , , and  are provided and are aligned with display icons showing \u201cgas\u201d, \u201cfood\u201d, and \u201clodges\u201d, respectively, as seen in . When the system is employed with a HomeLink\u00ae brand trainable transmitter, the switches can, when the POI system is off (), provide the dual function of operating any one of the three programmed transmitting frequencies and codes for up to three different garage doors, home appliances, security gates, or the like.","The operation of the system seen in  is best understood by reference to the program flow diagram of , B, and C together with the menu diagram with  in connection with the displayed information, as seen in FIGS.  and -. Initially, when this system is powered up, as shown in , the system searches for satellites and displays a message, as shown by . In the event a memory card or flashcard  has not been inserted, the system displays the message shown in , either that the \u201cmemory card is not inserted\u201d or the message shown in , that \u201cthe vehicle is out of the current data coverage zone.\u201d Assuming the memory card is in place and the vehicle is in the data coverage zone and satellite signals have been received, the display screen of  is displayed allowing the operator the option of selecting points of interest (POI) by scrolling, utilizing switches  and , current information which provides any combination of the compass heading, time, date, and\/or outside temperature information of  or trip computer information (not shown). The operator may also select the street sign selection showing either the address of a street on which the vehicle is traveling, if on a secondary road, as shown by , or, if the scroll button is advanced and street signs has previously been selected, to the street sign display of .","Assuming the vehicle is on a limited access highway and the operator has selected \u201cpoints of interest\u201d by scrolling to move the cursor , shown in , to the \u201cpoints of interest\u201d selection, the operator enters select by actuating switch , and the highway point-of-interest mode, as shown in , is displayed on display . Such display provides information as to points of interest according to categories of gas, food, or lodging, which are displayed as shown by display icons , , and  in . Display  also displays the forthcoming exit which the vehicle is approaching, as indicated by display area  (), the name of the street associated with the exit, as indicated by display element , and the distance to the exit, as shown by display element . To the left of display icons , , and  is a numerical display  for indicating the number of gasoline stations available at that exit (i.e., 4 for exit ), a numerical display  indicating the number of restaurants available at that exit (i.e., 10), and a numerical display  indicating the number of lodges or sleeping accommodations available at that exit (i.e., 3). By actuating scroll switches  or , the operator can scroll forward to display, for example, the information available at the next exit (No. , for example) or the previous exit (No. , for example) if at exit  a desired POI is not available. Thus, while in the highway POI mode, the vehicle operator can look ahead or behind for points of interest and, as discussed below, select and review available points of interest at a selected exit. This enables the operator to find, for example, a favorite restaurant while traveling when meal time is approaching.","As the vehicle travels along the highway, the operator can actuate any one of the three keys , , or  aligned above the display  of \u201cgas\u201d, display  of \u201cfood\u201d, or display  of \u201clodges\u201d, respectively, to select details of the establishments in the available categories at a selected exit. Thus, if the gas key  is actuated, the display of  appears, and the \u201cgas\u201d icon  is illuminated. The display of  provides three service stations available at the selected exit and their distance. A similar display presentation for restaurants is shown in  and for lodging is shown in .","The operator then can scroll to the desired establishment, such as a Marathon station, as shown in , by actuation of switches  and  and select the establishment aligned with the cursor  to be presented with a more detailed route to point-of-interest display, as shown in . In , the operator has scrolled up to the Marathon station and actuated the select switch . The detail display  shows the distance to the Marathon station (i.e., 5.7 miles), and an arrow  shows the general direction of the station. The street address  of the service station, as well as its telephone number \u2032. As the vehicle travels to the exit from which the POI was selected in the highway mode, this information is dynamically updated. Thus, arrow  changes direction and the distance information  of  is continuously updated. The distance displayed is the combined distance to the exit and from the exit to the Marathon station.","When the vehicle exits the highway, for example, at exit A, as shown in , the microprocessor detects from GPS signal and stored road network data programmed in the memory  that it is on a secondary road and automatically switches to one of the local point-of-interest displays shown in  or B, which, unless a POI has previously been selected as seen in , automatically displays the categories of points of interest available, the number of points of interest in each category through the icons , , and , and the nearest points of interest within a selectable range of, for example, two to four miles of the nearest points of interest regardless of the category. Again, the operator can select any one of the categories by actuating the switches , , and  after which the selected category will be displayed as shown in , and a go-to point of interest can be selected by movement of the cursor through actuation switches  and  and entry of a highlighted point of interest by select switch  to obtain the information for that point of interest, as represented, for example, by . If a POI had previously been selected, the display of  remains displayed to the operator.","If there are no points of interest found at a forthcoming exit, the display of  is displayed to the vehicle operator indicating that, at that exit, no selected category points of interest are available. The operator can either scroll forward to exits ahead of the vehicle or scroll backward using switches ,  to a previous exit to look for a desired point of interest and determine which is the closest point of interest which satisfies the operator's needs. If on a local road and no POI are found within an initial search range, the system will expand the search range until a POI is found and display either the  or  display to the operator.","In addition to the point-of-interest mode of operation, the operator can enter the street sign mode from the main menu by pushing the menu switch  and scrolling to street signs (). By actuating the select switch , the display of  is presented to the operator, which shows the direction  of travel of the vehicle, the road  on which the vehicle is traveling, and a street address display , which shows the street numbers and which increments or decrements as the vehicle travels along the street, to provide the operator with the ability to locate a point of interest which may have previously been identified by street number or is otherwise known to the operator. This display is particularly helpful where the point of interest is set back from the road, such as, for example, in a shopping mall or the like, and the address is not readily visible from the road. As is well known, the displayed address is interpolated from two known locations and the current vehicle position with respect to such locations as determined by the GPS information.","If the operator scrolls forward utilizing switch  while in the street sign mode displaying addresses, as shown in , the system enters the display of cross streets, as shown in , in which two streets ahead of the vehicle (e.g., Second Avenue and Third Avenue in ) are presented, as are arrows  indicating the location of the vehicle between Second Avenue and recently passed First Avenue. This provides the operator with an easily recognizable display of cross streets on a roadway defined by converging graphic lines , which includes arrows  to provide a clear graphic diagram to the vehicle operator as to the vehicle's location with respect to forthcoming cross streets. In the event that the area does not provide cross-street information or street addresses for a given location of the vehicle, a display is provided to the operator, indicating that such information is not available and the operator must return to the main menu and enter the highway or local point-of-interest mode for guidance. The operator can always select the current information display of  by actuating the back button  when in any of the other modes until the information is displayed or actuate the menu button and actuate cursor switches ,  to align cursor  with current information and actuate the select switch  to provide the compass, temperature, time, and date information display of .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIGS. 22A","FIG. 4"],"b":["100","22","22","31","40","29","100"]},"Turning initially to , the main menu  of  is displayed and the program looks at block  to determine if a highlighted entry has been selected and, if it has, whether the point of interest has been selected at block . If a point of interest display has been selected, the program moves to block  () and displays the point-of-interest menu of  or , depending on the location of the vehicle, either on a limited access highway or on a local roadway. If no entry has been selected in block , the program cycles through the main menu until such time as something has been selected by scrolling to and highlighting a desired entry. If no point of interest has been selected, the program detects at block  whether the street sign has been selected and, if not, at block , whether the current information has been selected. If current information has been selected, the display of  is presented, as shown by block . If street signs has been selected, the display of current address of  is presented as shown by block . If street signs is not selected and current information is, the program automatically updates from the data received from the compass, temperature sensor, and internal clock the information displayed in . The program then continues to detect at blocks  and  () whether or not menu or back has been selected. If not, it remains with the current display of .","If, at block , current information has not been selected, the program tests at block , whether the off selection has been entered and, if not, the program returns to the main menu . If off has been selected at block , the display is turned off, as indicated by block  (), and the system is idle until such time as any switch has been depressed, as indicated by block . When this occurs, the program returns to the main menu block  of .","If a point of interest display has been actuated as indicated by an affirmative decision in block , the program moves to block  (), displaying either the  or  menu, as indicated above. If a point of interest is not selected as indicated by a no decision in block , the program continues to look to see if menu or back has been selected at ,  and, if not, cycles through the loop, including blocks  and , until such time as either a lodging point-of-interest key  () has been actuated as indicated by block , a gas point-of-interest key  () has been actuated, or a food point-of-interest key  has been selected as indicated by blocks -, respectively, in . If one of these categories has been selected as indicated by block , the point of interest distance, direction, and location of  is displayed. The program then detects whether a menu or back select switches have been actuated at blocks  and  and, if so, the program returns to either the main menu or displays the point-of-interest menu, as indicated in block .","If \u201cstreet signs\u201d is selected as indicated in block  () and the address of  is displayed, the program tests to determine if a menu select or back select switch has been actuated as indicated by blocks  and  (). If the menu select switch has been actuated, the program returns to the main menu of block . If not and the back select switch has been actuated by an affirmative decision in block , the program also returns to the main menu. If the back select switch has not been actuated, the program tests to determine if the down arrow at block  has been actuated. If it has, the program displays the street sign mode of , as shown at block  and continues to display that until such time as either the menu select switch at block  has been actuated or the back select switch at block  has been actuated or the up arrow as indicated by block  has been actuated.
