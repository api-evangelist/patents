No. 11\/760,600, filed Jun. 8, 2007, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.","1. Field of Art","The present invention generally relates to the field of system management, in particular to information technology (IT) assets and services discovery, IT search, and change management.","2. Description of the Related Art","A network typically includes a variety of interconnected component systems (also referred to as component systems, network\/service elements). Each of the component systems provides one or more services and works together with the rest to collectively provide aggregate services to users. For example, in Voice Over IP service (VoIP), session border controllers work in conjunction with gateways, phones, billing systems, Domain Name System (DNS) servers, Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)\/Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication servers, and underlying IP infrastructure, to constantly validate and ensure that phones can be registered, that phone calls can be made, that the caller is authenticated, and that the phone calls are billed properly.","Because component systems can be added, removed, and changed (e.g., reconfiguration, patching, upgrading) overtime, the landscape of a network evolves overtime. In addition, because of the interdependent nature of the component systems, changes made in one component system (e.g., configuration changes) can inadvertently affect other component systems dependent upon it. The unintended impact can cause inter-component dependencies to breakdown and thereby break the service. Therefore, it is important to track the component systems and their status and functional relationships.","Traditional best practice techniques of managing hosts on a network and their configurations are summarized in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL). In the context of asset management, such technologies mostly revolve around node-based views of the network. Tremendous efforts have gone in to enumerate and list out what's on the network and when it was provisioned. Unfortunately, such efforts have mostly resulted in a static spreadsheet view of the network that has to be manually updated. This is not only laborious, but also error prone. In the context of change management, such technologies mostly revolve around Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) based monitoring, log-based management-by-exception, and Change Management DataBase (or Configuration Management DataBase, CMDB). SNMP-based monitoring provides a large amount of details without revealing the configuration and supported services of the underlying component system. Log management records what has happened in the underlying component system without revealing the actual impacts or the causes. CMDB typically involves a spreadsheet for network operators to track configuration changes manually, which is both tedious and error prone. In addition, the traditional way of enumerating applications within known hosts involves installing agents in each of the known hosts which further explore and discover applications, file systems and other aspects internal to the host. This approach is defective because installing agents on hosts are intrusive and can potentially destabilize the hosts.","Therefore, there is a need for a system and method for automatically discovering network components and their statuses and functional relationships in real time.","The present invention overcomes limitations of the prior art by providing a discovery system (and corresponding method and computer program product) for discovering assets and functional relationships among the assets in a network system. In one embodiment, the discovery system executes protocol queries against the network system. The discovery system contextually analyzes query responses for determining references to assets in the network system and their roles and functional relationships based on corresponding protocol grammars. The discovery system determines queries associated with the newly discovered assets based on their roles and functional relationships, and recursively applies the above process to the newly discovered assets to discover additional assets and their roles and functional relationships.","In one aspect of the present invention, the discovery system is scheduled to periodically interrogate assets for up-to-date information of the assets and functional relationships among the assets. Such information can be indexed and searched.","Other aspects of the disclosure include software, systems, components, and methods corresponding to the above, and applications of the above for other purposes.","The present invention describes a methodology and corresponding system and computer program product to discover assets in a network system and their roles, statuses, and associations (also called functional relationships) with each other. An asset is defined as an entity that supports one or more protocols, such as a network, a physical host, a service that runs on the host as well as virtual hosts.","According to one aspect of the present invention, a seed asset in a network system and its supporting protocol commands are represented by a seed object and associated methods. The methods of the seed object are invoked to interrogate the seed asset. The responding messages from the corresponding seed asset is normalized into Document Object Models (DOMs) and contextually analyzed to identify references to other assets, their roles and functional relationships with the queried asset. The identified assets are represented by objects. Protocol commands supported by the identified assets are represented by methods associated with the corresponding objects and invoked for responses. The responses are then normalized and analyzed for further assets. This process can be recursively applied to newly discovered assets to discover additional assets available in the network system and their roles and functional relationships. This process can also be applied continuously by a discovery system to make multiple periodical passes of the assets to extract real time status and functional relationship information.","The discovered information can be used to construct a network functional topology map, and to provide advanced services such as searches, change management, and customizable advanced visualization. This map beneficially identifies functional relationships between services and hosts that are closely relevant in troubleshooting and diagnosing service-related problems. This map is one layer above physical connectivity that, while interesting, masks the complex service-level dependencies in most modern networks.","Protocol Normalization and Message Abstraction (DOM)","Communications among computing devices generally involve the exchange of data or messages in a known, structured format (a \u201cprotocol\u201d). Typically a computing device supports one or more protocols by implementing them in software or hardware modules within the device. Each of these protocols can be described by a concrete formal grammar (e.g., a context-free grammar) through a process called normalization (also known as canonization). The grammar can be represented by a generic data structure, and can be used to generate and verify protocol messages. Further information regarding normalization and representing protocols using a generic data structure is found in U.S. application Ser. No. 11\/514,809, filed Sep. 1, 2006, titled \u201cAutomated Generation of Attacks for Analyzing the Security of Communication Protocols and Channels\u201d, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.","A protocol typically includes one or more messages (or commands). A protocol message can be expressed as a method call, with its fields represented by parameters of the method call. Similarly, a responding protocol message can be expressed using markup language such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and stored in a normalized document object model (DOM). Responding protocol messages can be parsed according to the corresponding protocol grammar. The parsing result can be expressed in XML and stored in the DOM. Further information regarding protocol message representation and normalization is found in U.S. application Ser. No. 12\/234,450, filed Sep. 19, 2008, titled \u201cTest Driven Deployment And Monitoring Of Heterogeneous Network Systems\u201d, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. As a result of the normalization process, the complexity of the protocol communication (e.g., layers of communication protocols used in the actual transmission) is hidden behind the method call and the returned canonical DOM.","A responding protocol message typically includes information of interest. For example, a message responding to an inquiry about a digital certificate contains information regarding when the digital certificate expires. Such information can be stored and indexed for subsequent searches, and used for testing purposes. A responding protocol message often contains information referencing other devices, hosts, and\/or services (collectively referred to assets) available in the network. For example, in response to a received DHCPREQUEST message, a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server returns a DHCP Acknowledgement message identifying itself as the DHCP server. The DHCP Acknowledgment message may also contain information such as information about local DNS (Domain Name System) server(s) (e.g., its IP (Internet Protocol) address). Such reference information can be identified using protocol grammars, generic data structures, and\/or contextual information in the responding message (e.g., associated tagging information).","The reference information extracted from responding messages can be used to discover other assets available in the network and their roles and functional relationships with the queried asset. The assets identified by the reference information can be interrogated for further reference information identifying additional assets. This process can be recursively applied to discover assets in the network and their roles and functional relationships (or associations, logical correlations). A system that utilizes the process to discover assets and functional relationships among assets is described in detail below.","Computing Environment",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","110","120","120","110","120"]},"The discovery system  (also referred to as crawler system, service crawler, crawler) is configured to discover assets and their roles and functional relationships in the network system . The discovery system  is configured to conduct the discovery by recursively interrogating known assets (e.g., seed assets, discovered assets) though method invocations  for response messages , and contextually analyzing the response messages  for references to other assets (also referred to as hyperlinks). Alternatively or in conjunction, the discovery system  is configured to continuously interrogate known assets to detect changes (e.g., changes in roles, configurations, and functional relationships) in the network system .","The discovery system  can be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both. Regarding software, the discovery system  can be, for example, a single application (executing within a single operating system or single physical device) or a collection of applications communicating with each other to correlate discovery operations. Regarding hardware, the discovery system  can be, for example, a standalone computer or a collection of physical devices with out-of-band synchronization. In one embodiment, the discovery system  is a portable appliance that can be transported to different locations to conduct discovery in different network systems.","The network system  includes multiple assets (not shown). An asset is an entity that supports one or more protocols, each of which including one or more protocol commands (or functions, methods). When invoked thorough one of such supported protocol function calls, the asset returns one or more responding messages. Each of the assets includes hardware and\/or software subject to discovery. Software includes, for example, services, interfaces, domains, applications, operating systems, and\/or communications systems. Hardware includes, for example, one or more devices. A device can be, for example, a server, host, subnet, switch, bridge, router, packet filter, firewall, Virtual Private Network (VPN) concentrator, proxy, intrusion detection\/prevention system, or network protocol analyzer. An asset (e.g., a subnet) can include multiple devices that are coupled at various communication layers to form a system or network of devices. Each of the component devices can in turn be an asset. The assets communicate with each other through networks such as the Internet, an intranet, a wireless local area network (LAN), a cellular network, or any combination thereof. The assets receive the method invocations  from the discovery system  and respond by sending the response messages .","In one embodiment, the discovery system  and\/or assets in the network system  (or computer systems executing the discovery system  and\/or assets) are structured to include a processor, memory, storage, network interfaces, and applicable operating system and other functional software (e.g., network drivers, communication protocols).","A system architecture of the discovery system  is discussed below according to one embodiment of the present invention.","System Architecture of Discovery System",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["110","110","210","220","222","230","240","110"]},"A protocol suite  is a parameterized atomic protocol command (or transaction, method, function) for a protocol. A protocol suite  is a method call where arguments (or parameters) are defined but the actual values for the arguments are not known. For example, DNS requests can be represented by the following protocol suite:\n\n","An asset object  is an object representing a known asset (e.g., a seed asset or a discovered asset) in the network system . Initially the discovery system  may only have one or a few asset objects  (hereinafter referred to as seed objects). The discovery system  discovers other assets through recursively interrogating known assets, contextually analyzing the query responses for additional assets, and then interrogating the additional assets at run-time.","As illustrated, each asset object  has one or more queries . A query  represents a configured protocol suite where the customizable parameters of the underlying protocol suite  are defined and specified. Because parameters of a protocol suite  can take various values, a single protocol suite  can be associated with multiple queries , each having a same or different configuration. For example, the DNS request protocol suite  illustrated above may have numerous queries  associated with various IP addresses, such as the following query  soliciting information about the uspto.gov domain:\n\n","In one embodiment, objects of certain types of assets have a set of default queries. For example, objects for network components (e.g., hosting computers) by default include a TCP scan query and a UDP scan query. The TCP scan query enumerates through potentially available TCP ports and attempts to communicate with the interrogated network component to discover its supported protocols and assets resided within. Similarly, the UDP scan query attempts to interrogate though potential UDP ports for discovery. Based on the discovery result, the discovery system  creates new asset objects  and attaches new asset specific queries  accordingly. For example, after finding out that a web server supports several services through TCP port 80, the discovery system  can create objects  for the newly discovered services, and attach service-specific queries  of the newly created objects  to that port.","The DOM analyzing component  (also referred to as spider) is configured to contextually analyze query results to discover references to other assets (also referred to as hyperlinks) and the functional relationships between the queried asset and the other assets. The DOM analyzing component  also generates new asset objects  for the discovered assets and associated new queries  based on the roles and functional relationships of the discovered assets. Responding messages  from assets are canonical, normalized DOMs, structured data containing salient portions of the underlying protocol exchanges. Therefore, the context and structure of the DOMs is determined by the underlying protocols. In one embodiment, the discovery system  creates a DOM analyzing component  for each protocol suite  and configures the DOM analyzing component  to specially handle the associated query results.","The following is a DOM for a query result of a DNS request. The example DOM is represented using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, even though other formats (e.g., XML) can also be used.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0041","num":"0042"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"left"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":"{\u201cstatus\u201d=>:NOERR,"},{"entry":"\u2003\u201cquestions\u201d=>[{\u201cqname\u201d=>\u201cldap.musecurity.com\u201d,"},{"entry":"\u201cqtype\u201d=>:A, \u201cqclass\u201d=>:IN}],"},{"entry":"\u2003\u201canswers\u201d=>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003[{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201cldap.musecurity.com\u201d,"},{"entry":"\u201ccname\u201d=>\u201cstan.musecurity.com\u201d},"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201cstan.musecurity.com\u201d, \u201ca\u201d=>\u201c10.10.3.1\u201d}],"},{"entry":"\u2003\u201cauthorities\u201d=>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003[{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201cmusecurity.com\u201d,"},{"entry":"\u201cns\u201d=>\u201cthemole.musecurity.com\u201d},"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201cmusecurity.com\u201d,"},{"entry":"\u201cns\u201d=>\u201ckyle.musecurity.com\u201d}],"},{"entry":"\u2003\u201cadditional\u201d=>"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003[{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201ckyle.musecurity.com\u201d, \u201ca\u201d=>\u201c74.85.18.162\u201d},"},{"entry":"\u2003\u2003\u2003{\u201clabel\u201d=>\u201cthemole.musecurity.com\u201d,"},{"entry":"\u201ca\u201d=>\u201c10.10.3.110\u201d}]}"},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["230","220","222"]},"As another example, the resulting DOM of a query for mount points in the Host Resource Management Information Base (Host Resource MIB) using SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) includes the following information:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0043","num":"0044"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"2"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"21pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"196pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"{\u201cmounts\u201d=>"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003[{\u201chost\u201d=>\u201cbertha\u201d, \u201cpath\u201d=>\u201c\/amanda\u201d},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003{\u201chost\u201d=>\u201cbertha\u201d, \u201cpath\u201d=>\u201c\/mu\u201d},"]},{"entry":[{},"\u2003\u2003{\u201chost\u201d=>\u201cclyde\u201d, \u201cpath\u201d=>\u201c\/home\/build\/cruise\u201d}]}"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}},"br":{},"b":["230","230","220","222"]},"In addition, the above example shows that the functional relationship identified through executing a query  of a protocol is not necessarily tied to the query protocol. In this example, the query protocol is SNMP, and the queried asset and the identified systems (remote mount points) are connected through the Host Resource MIB (or the Network File System). SNMP is a means for the discovery system  to discover the remote mount points and does not impose any restriction on the underlying functional relationships. Because the DOM analyzing component  associated with the SNMP query is configured with knowledge of the protocol grammar, it can accurately identify the remote mount points and their roles and functional relationships with the queried asset.","The data storage component  is configured to store information related to the discovery process of the discovery system . Examples of such information include protocol grammars (e.g., supported protocol commands), discovered assets (e.g., information extracted from responses from the assets, DOMs), their roles and functional relationships (e.g., hyperlinks and associated information). The data storage component  may be a relational database or any other type of database that stores the data, such as a flat file.","Because inquiries to known assets are expressed as queries , the query results are represented by DOMs and contextually analyzed for references to other assets, an analogy can be made between web pages and DOMs, and between hyperlinks in the web pages and asset references in the DOMs. Therefore, spidering technologies can be applied to crawl the network to discover available assets.","A methodology for the discovery system  to recursively interrogate known assets to discover additional assets and their roles and functional relationships is described in detail below.","Asset and Functional Relationship Discovery Methodology",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0048","num":"0049"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","110","110","120","300","300","300","110","300"]},"The discovery system  coordinates the DOM analyzing components  to discover assets and their roles and functional relationships in the network system . Initially, the discovery system  has one or a few seed objects representing known assets (also referred to as seed assets). Examples of such seed assets include a local network interface, and hosts associated with a specific range of IP addresses. The seed object(s) can be pre-configured with the discovery system  or provided by users.","The discovery system  (or the DOM analyzing component ) executes  queries  associated with a seed object by transmitting the corresponding protocol messages to the corresponding seed asset. The responding messages from the seed asset are normalized into DOMs and passed on to the DOM analyzing component  corresponding to the executed queries . The DOM analyzing component  contextually analyzes  the DOMs to identify hyperlinks to other assets and determine their roles and functional relationships. The DOM analyzing component  determines  whether the identified assets are already known to the discovery system  (e.g., represented by an asset object ). If an identified asset is already known to the discovery system , the DOM analyzing component  merges  the results (e.g., by storing information about the asset together). Otherwise, the DOM analyzing component  creates  an asset object  and associated queries  for the asset based on the relevant contextual information in the DOM. Information about the DOM, the functional relationships, and the identified assets are also stored in a persistent data store (e.g., the data storage component ).","The discovery system  (or the DOM analyzing component ) subsequently executes  queries  associated with newly created asset objects  (or newly created queries  for existing asset objects ), and passes on the query results to the corresponding DOM analyzing components  for contextual analysis . The method  can be applied recursively to newly created asset objects  and\/or queries  to discover assets and their roles and functional relationships in the network system . In one embodiment, the asset objects  (or the queries ) are placed in a data structure such as a queue and a stack. The discovery system  retrieves asset objects  from the queue to execute  associated queries , and adds to the queue newly created asset objects  representing assets discovered in results of the queries . The discovery system  can repeat the process until the queue becomes empty. This process of recursively applying the method  is also referred to as crawling.","In one embodiment, the discovery system  periodically crawls through the network system , and stores resulting information of the assets in the data storage component . Assuming the assets in the data store is retrievable by the last-updated time stamp, the discovery system  can interrogate one known asset at a time by executing all queries for the asset and merging the resulting changes back into the data storage component . Each pass either discovers new assets or new queries or generates change records that identify exactly which part of the known asset was changed and how. By having the normalized query results from all known assets in the data storage component  continuously updated by the discovery system , a real-time snapshot of the network system  including all known assets and their roles and functional relationships can be constructed. As will be described in further detail below, such information can be used to provide various advanced services to users that are unavailable before.","The method  is further illustrated through the following example. Assume the discovery system  has a seed asset object  representing a network interface. The seed object  is associated with the following default queries: arp-enum, dhcp-discover, icmp-broadcast-ping, and ssdp-search. The arp-enum query uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to methodically query for all hosts in the subnet connected to the network interface. The dhcp-discover query searches for the existence of DHCP servers on the network. The icmp-broadcast-ping query sends a broadcast ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packet to the network and collects responses from the responding hosts in the network. The ssdp-search query sends an SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) multicast request to identify all UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) devices (e.g., printers) in the network.","The discovery system  places the seed object into a queue (the only object in the queue) and initiates the method . The discovery system  retrieves the seed object from the queue and executes  associated queries by issuing corresponding query messages to the network interface. The network interface broadcasts (or multicasts) the protocol messages. As a result, hosts in the network connected to the network interface receive the protocol messages and respond by sending query results to the discovery system  (through the network interface).

shown, by recursively applying the method , the discovery system  can discover assets in the network system  and their roles and functional relationships by following hyperlinks identified in normalized query results. In addition, by repeatedly crawl through the network system , the discovery system  can maintain a constantly updated database of information regarding the network system , the assets within, and their roles and functional relationships. As described below in further detail, the data collected through method  can be used to provide advanced user services (or functions).","Starting with the network interface as the seed asset, the discovery system  could potentially identify hosts that are outside the subnet range of the network interface or the network range(s) specified by users. In one embodiment, as new hosts are identified, the discovery system  can be configured to automatically compare the IP addresses of the newly identified hosts against these ranges to ensure that the discovery system  does not leak out into the Internet. Information about such outside assets and their functional relationships can be indexed such that users can query against assets that are outside their realms of control.","Example Usage of Collected Data","As described above, the discovery system  can discover new assets and their roles and functional relationships, along other important information about the assets by interrogating known assets (e.g., seed assets, discovered assets). In addition, the discovery system  can keep such information up-to-date through automatic continuous crawling. As a result, the discovery system  is aware of everything on the network and their configuration (or available services), and how things are actually correlated between each other. This information can be utilized to provide user services. The following are a few examples.","A. Visualization and Data Mining","The updated asset data can be used to provide various visibilities about the network system. For example, the asset data can be used to construct a real-time functional map of all known assets in the network system  with new assets added as they are discovered in real time. The functional map identifies assets by their roles and connects assets through their functional relationships. The functional graph not only identifies related assets but also specifies exactly their roles and how they are related. This functional graph is useful for purposes such as determining impact radius of a certain asset in the network system .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0063","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A and 4B","FIG. 4A","FIG. 4B"]},"Because the collected information not only identifies the discovered assets and their status, but also specifies their roles and functional relationships, a user can drill downward, upward, or sideway, or apply other data mining techniques through the visualization. For example, a user can click the service mount in  to view , and click the hyperlink clyde.musecurity.com in  to view a visualization of assets and services related to the underlying asset.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0066"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":"120"},"Other examples include a calendar view of life spans of SSL certificates for all known assets. A user can easily identify expiring SSL certificates in real time. In addition, tests, assertions, alerts, and\/or triggers can be attached to the underlying asset data. For example, a trigger can be set to send an email to a network administrator  days before an SSL certificate expires.","B. Index and Search","The collected data can be kept up-to-date, indexed, and available for searches.  is a screenshot illustrating a user search for the keyword \u201cit\u201d, which instantly results in various keywords being matched, according to one embodiment of the present invention. These keywords further lead to specific assets that match the entered word. The search result also includes assets that has \u201cit\u201d in its profile or a host name that starts with \u201cit\u201d. The sources of the searched information can be extracted from real time results from queries of a number of different protocols, such as DOMs of DNS requests, NetBIOS, and SSL Certificates.","C. Asset Profiling","Up-to-date asset data can be used to construct real time profiles for all known assets on the network system . The asset profiles can be used to conduct similarity comparisons among assets, and generate distance metrics for the assets based on their similarities. For example, asset information can be converted into normalized documents that are subject to document comparisons. In addition, assets can be classified based on their similarities or compliance with customizable signatures. Such classification can be visualized to users.  is a screenshot including a diagram showing the web applications running on various assets according to one embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is useful, for example, for organizations to plan for capacity as well as to eliminate under-utilized resources.","D. Change Management","The discovery system  can be scheduled to periodically crawl the network system . The resulting data can be stored with associated time stamp. As a result, the data can be used to detect changes in system behavior, either configuration or service degradation on an on-going basis. Such time-stamped asset information can be used to create timeliness. A common aspect of change management is tracking progress towards a goal in the form of checklists. By tying a search parameter directed to a goal, a dynamic checklist refreshed constantly can be generated by the discovery system . One example of such a use case is upgrading hosts that are running a particular application. The discovery system  can keep track of how many hosts have not yet been updated. Historically such a task has been tracked and managed using static spreadsheets.","Services other than those listed above can be provided using the crawled data. For example, the collected asset data can be used to conduct tests and verifications. As another example, while deploying a network system, the discovery system  can be used to discover and track assets and functional relationships among the assets in the network to ensure proper deployment. Further information about the test driven deployment is found in U.S. Utility patent application Ser.
