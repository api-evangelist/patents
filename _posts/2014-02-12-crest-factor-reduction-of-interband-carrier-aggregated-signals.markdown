No. 61\/831,339, filed Jun. 5, 2013, entitled \u201cCREST FACTOR REDUCTION OF INTER-BAND CARRIER AGGREGATED SIGNALS\u201d, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61\/886,317, filed Oct. 3, 2013, entitled \u201cCREST FACTOR REDUCTION OF INTER-BAND MULTI-STANDARD CARRIER AGGREGATED SIGNALS\u201d, the entirety of which both are incorporated herein by reference.","This written description is directed to radio transmitters, and in particular, to crest factor reduction of inter-band carrier aggregated signals in radio transmitters of a communication system.","An absence of frequency spectrum bands that can support wide transmission bandwidths gives rise to intra-band or inter-band aggregation of multiple carriers according to specific sets of technical requirements. Such carrier aggregated signals have characteristics, such as high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), also commonly referred to as crest factor (CF), and wide bandwidth. The amplification of these carrier aggregated signals by a single power amplifier (PA) poses several challenges. A PA is required to maintain good power efficiency over multiple frequency bands. This has motivated recent research attempts to develop high efficiency, multiband and broadband devices such as Doherty PAs and envelope tracking systems. In addition, due to the high CF of the carrier aggregated signals, these PAs are often required to operate in the large back off region from their peak power to meet linearity requirements. Consequently, these PAs yield poor power efficiency.","Several techniques have been devised for crest factor reduction (CFR) of single band signals and consequently enhance PA efficiency and reduce the dynamic-range requirement imposed on digital to analog converters. These techniques can be divided into two categories: distortion-less methods (commonly called linear CFR techniques), such as selected mapping, partial transmit sequence, tone injection, tone reservation, and coding; and distortion-based methods (also called nonlinear CFR techniques) such as clipping\/windowing, companding, active constellation extension (ACE), and generalized ACE methods.","Linear techniques can achieve greater CF reduction than their nonlinear counterparts without altering signal quality. However, linear techniques usually require modifications to the receiver that may be incompatible with existing communication systems. Linear techniques have been applied to multicarrier\/single-standard signals through proper modulation and coding. However, the generalization of linear techniques to carrier aggregated signals is not possible due to the dissimilarity between the modulation schemes employed in each carrier.","The nonlinear CFR techniques are generally carefully applied to obtain the highest possible CF reduction while not exceeding the distortion threshold. These techniques, and in particular, the clipping\/windowing technique, have been applied to multi-carrier signals co-located in the same spectrum band. However application of clipping\/windowing techniques to carrier aggregated signals, especially when each carrier is located in different and widely spaced frequency bands, is very challenging because the clipping\/windowing techniques may require very high, and thus, impractical sampling rates.","A carrier aggregated signal over two bands, such as shown in , can be expressed as\n\n()=()+()=()()\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nwhere x(t) is the carrier aggregated signal, x(t) and x(t) are the mixed mode signals in each band, and {tilde over (x)}(t){tilde over (x)}(t) denote the baseband envelopes of x(t) and x(t) around the angular frequencies \u03c9and \u03c9, respectively. As shown in , the individual signals x(t) and x(t) have bandwidths B1 and B2, respectively, and are separated by a frequency gap S.\n","The carrier aggregated signal can be represented as a broadband signal with an angular carrier frequency",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}},"br":{}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00002","num":"00002"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mtable":{"mtr":[{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mi":"x","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"mrow":[{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}}],"mo":"+"}],"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mover":{"mi":"x","mo":"~"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u00b7","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}}}}},{"mtd":{"mrow":{"mo":["=","\u2062"],"mi":{},"mrow":{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mrow":{"mrow":[{"mrow":{"mover":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"1"},"mo":"~"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u00b7","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"-"},"mn":"2"}}}},{"mrow":{"mover":{"msub":{"mi":"x","mn":"2"},"mo":"~"},"mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mi":"t"}},"mo":"\u00b7","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}}],"mo":"+"}},"mo":"\u2062","msup":{"mi":"\u2147","mrow":{"mi":["j","t"],"mo":["\u2062","\u2062"],"mfrac":{"mrow":{"msub":[{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"1"},{"mi":"\u03c9","mn":"2"}],"mo":"+"},"mn":"2"}}}}}}}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"2"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"The classical clipping\/windowing nonlinear CFR technique can be applied to {tilde over (x)}(t).

A device for implementing the classical clipping\/windowing method is shown in . As can be seen, in addition to the clipping  and filtering modules , the SISO CFR of  includes an up-sampler , a digital up-converter , a down-sampler  and a down-converter . As this technique is a nonlinear operation, inband distortions and out of band spectrum regrowth are induced. In order to achieve an acceptable adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR), the clipped signal is filtered. The clipping threshold is set so that the CF is reduced while conforming to error vector magnitude (EVM) and ACPR specifications.","The frequency spacing S between the two carriers is generally significantly greater than the bandwidths of x(t) and x(t), i.e. Band B, especially in the case of inter-band aggregation scenarios. Hence, f\u2032 would need to be considerably larger than the frequencies fand fneeded to digitize {tilde over (x)}(t) and {tilde over (x)}(t), respectively (f\u22672\u00b7B, f\u22672\u00b7B).","For example, assume a carrier aggregated signal is composed of a 15 MHz wide band code division multiple access (WCDMA) signal around 2.1 GHz and a 10 MHz long term evolution (LTE) signal centered in 2.4 GHz. For such a combination, the minimum theoretical sampling frequency f\u2032 must be higher than 610 MHz. This sampling frequency is significantly higher than the sampling frequencies needed to represent the WCDMA and LTE signals individually. The direct application of the SISO clipping\/windowing to {tilde over (x)}(n\u2032) is thus seen to imply a high and impractical sampling rate. The high sampling rate requirement associated with the conventional clipping and windowing approach makes this solution sub-optimal in the context of inter-band carrier aggregated signals.","The present invention advantageously provides a method and system for crest factor reduction of inter-band multi-standard carrier aggregated signals. According to one aspect, the invention provides a method of reducing a crest factor of inter-band carrier aggregated signals, the inter-band carrier signals comprising a plurality of carrier signals. The method includes calculating the amplitude of each of the plurality of carrier signals of the inter-band carrier aggregated signals. An estimate of an envelope of a combination of the carrier signals is produced based on a sum of the calculated amplitudes of the plurality of carrier signals. The estimate of the envelope of the combination of the carrier signals is compared to a clipping threshold to determine whether to clip each of the plurality of carrier signals.","According to this aspect, in some embodiments, a ratio of the calculated amplitude of a first carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals to the estimated sum of the amplitudes of each of the plurality of carrier signals is formed. The ratio is multiplied by the clipping threshold to clip the first carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals. In some embodiments, a first carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals is modulated as a wide band code division multiple access, WCDMA, carrier signal and a second carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals is modulated as a long term evolution, LTE, carrier signal.

In some embodiments, the method includes clipping each carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals separately. In some embodiments, a quantity of the plurality of carrier signals exceeds two. In some embodiments, the method further includes sampling each of the plurality of carrier signals at a rate that is at least twice a maximum bandwidth of the bandwidths of the plurality of carrier signals. The sampling rate may be substantially less than a least frequency spacing between any two carrier signals.","According to another aspect, the invention provides an apparatus for reducing a crest factor of inter-band carrier aggregated signals, the inter-band carrier aggregated signals comprising a plurality of carrier signals. The apparatus includes a plurality of signal amplitude calculators, one for each of the plurality of carrier signals. Each of the plurality of signal amplitude calculators is configured to calculate an amplitude of a corresponding carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals. An adder is configured to add the calculated carrier signal amplitudes to produce a composite signal that is an estimate of an envelope of the plurality of carrier signals. A plurality of clippers, one for each of the plurality of carrier signals, are configured to perform a clipping operation on a respective one of the plurality of carrier signals.","According to this aspect, in some embodiments, performance of the clipping operation of a clipper is contingent on the composite signal exceeding a clipping threshold. In some embodiments, the clipping is based on a ratio of a calculated amplitude of the respective one of the plurality of carrier signals to the composite signal, and the ratio is multiplied by the clipping threshold to clip the respective one of the plurality of carrier signals. In some embodiments, a first carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals is modulated according to a first modulation scheme and a second carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals is modulated according to a second modulation scheme different from the first modulation scheme. In some embodiments, the sampling rate is substantially less than a closest spacing between any two carrier signals of the plurality of carrier signals. In some embodiments, each carrier is sampled at a rate that is substantially less than a closest spacing between any two carrier signals of the plurality of carrier signals.","According to another aspect, the invention provides a crest factor reduction circuit. The circuit includes a plurality of inputs, one input for each of a plurality of carrier signals. The circuit also includes a plurality of signal amplitude calculators. Each signal amplitude calculator is coupled to a different one of the plurality of inputs to receive a different one of the plurality of carrier signals and is configured to calculate an amplitude of the received carrier signal. An adder is configured to add the calculated amplitudes from the plurality of signal amplitude calculators to produce a composite signal producing an estimate of an envelope of the individual carrier signal amplitude estimates. A comparator is configured to compare the composite signal to a threshold to determine whether to clip amplitudes of the plurality of carrier signals.","According to this aspect, in some embodiments, the circuit further includes a clipper for each carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals to clip an amplitude of the corresponding carrier signal if the composite signal exceeds the threshold. In some embodiments, each clipper forms a ratio of an estimated amplitude of a carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals to the composite signal and multiplies the ratio by the threshold to clip the carrier signal. In some embodiments, the circuit includes a sampler to sample each carrier signal of the plurality of carrier signals at a rate that is substantially less than a least frequency spacing between any two carrier signals of the plurality of carrier signals. In some embodiments, the circuit includes a low pass filter applied to each clipped signal to reduce spectrum regrowth due to the clipping.","Before describing in detail exemplary embodiments that are in accordance with the present invention, it is noted that the embodiments reside primarily in combinations of apparatus components and processing steps related to crest factor reduction of inter-band multi-standard carrier aggregated signals.

The proposed CFR approach was demonstrated on a 300 MHz dual-band and a 200 MHz tri-band multi-standard carrier aggregated waveform composed of LTE and WCDMA signals. The CF of the aggregated signal was successfully reduced from 11.3 dB to 9.5 dB while minimizing impacts on EVM and ACPR of the output signal.
