The Government has certain rights in the present invention.","1. Technical Field","The present invention relates to reticles for semiconductor processing in general, and in particular to a method and apparatus for verifying stitching accuracy of stitched chips on a wafer.","2. Description of Related Art","During a typical chip fabrication, a field in a reticle is repeatedly exposed on different areas of a wafer until the entire photoresist layer has been exposed on the wafer. A stepper device is commonly utilized to move the reticle between exposures on the wafer.","The field of exposure is defined as the photoresist area exposed through one field at a time. Conventional photolithography equipment has a relatively small field of exposure. However, the desirable chip size of an image sensor tends to far exceed the limited field of exposure of conventional photolithography equipment. Thus, the size of a chip that can be manufactured on a single wafer is limited by the field of exposure of the photolithography equipment used to pattern the interconnect structures of the chip.","In order to make a larger chip on a single wafer, it is often necessary to stitch exposure fields together during the photolithography process. The accuracy of the stitching overlaps basically dictates how well the larger stitched chip will function. Because optical methods of verifying stitching accuracy can be somewhat subjective, it would be desirable to provide an improved method and apparatus for verifying stitching accuracy of a stitched chip on a single wafer.","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a set of test structures are inserted within a reticle layout. An exposure program is executed to control a photolithography equipment having a stepper to perform multiple exposures of the reticle on a wafer to generate a stitched chip on the wafer. Electrical measurements are then performed on the test structures at actual stitch boundaries of the stitched chip to evaluate stitching accuracy of the stitched chip.","All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.","Referring now to the drawings and in particular to -, there are illustrated the process of forming multiple stitched chips on a single wafer, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown, a photomask (or reticle)  is initially designed for the purpose for forming a stitched chip, as shown in . Photomask  generally includes edges -. During exposure, some of edges -will be \u201cbladed off\u201d to form a stitched chip  that constitutes chip segments -, as depicted in ","In the example shown in , chip segment is shown to have all its edges \u201cbladed off\u201d while other chip segments are shown to have at least two of their respective edges \u201cbladed off\u201d to form one complete stitched chip . More than one stitched chip  can be formed on a single wafer. For example, five identical copies of stitched chip  can be formed on a single wafer , as shown in ","In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, multiple test structures are added to chip segment boundaries of a photomask, such as photomask , in order to assist the evaluations of stitching accuracy at the actual stitched boundaries (i.e., the boundaries where chip segments actually meet) of a stitched chip, such as stitched chip , on a wafer. For example, in , a test structure is added to a chip segment boundary adjacent to edge , a test structure is added to a chip segment boundary adjacent to edge , a test structure is added to a chip segment boundary adjacent to edge , and a test structure is added to a chip segment boundary adjacent to edge . After edges have been \u201cbladed off\u201d for the purpose of forming an actual stitched boundary, the test structures located on respective chip segments will be in electrical contact with each other. For example, in , test structure of chip segment should be in electrical contact with test structure of chip segment . Similarly, test structure of chip segment should be in electrical contact with test structure of chip segment ","Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements are then utilized to evaluate the stitching accuracy of each actual stitch boundary by precisely determining the resistances between test structure pairs located on separate chip segments. Different types of test structures are employed to assist the evaluations of stitching accuracy in X-directions and in Y-directions.","With reference now to -, there are illustrated a set of test structures for assisting the evaluations of stitching accuracy of a stitched chip in a X-direction, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , a test structure  is located at a chip segment boundary  of a first chip segment, and a test structure  is located at a chip segment boundary  of a second chip segment. Test structure  includes electrically conductive sub-structures -. Sub-structures -are substantially identical to each other with an electrically conductive vertical segment connected between two electrically conductive horizontal segments. In addition, one of the edges of each vertical segment of sub-structures -are flushed with chip segment boundary .","Similarly, test structure  includes electrically conductive sub-structures -. Sub-structures -are substantially identical to each other with an electrically conductive vertical segment connected between two electrically conductive horizontal segments. However, unlike sub-structures -, only sub-structure has its vertical segment flushed with chip segment boundary . The vertical segments of sub-structures -are located at various distance from chip segment boundary , with sub-structure being closest to chip segment  and sub-structure being farthest from chip segment .","After the first and second chip segments have been stitched together (i.e., chip segment boundaries  and  are in alignment), as shown in , Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements can be utilized to determine the resistance between different sub-structure pairs located on respective chip segments in order evaluate the stitching accuracy of the first and second chip segments in a X-direction. Specifically, Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements are performed on sub-structure pairs :, :, :and :. If the stitching of the first and second chip segments in a X-direction is sound, then the measured resistances of sub-structure pairs :, :, :and :should be from low (or zero) to high, accordingly.","Referring now to -, there are illustrated a set of test structures for assisting the evaluations of stitching accuracy of a stitched chip in a Y-direction, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in , a test structure  is located at a chip segment boundary  of a first chip segment, and a test structure  is located at a chip segment boundary  of a second chip segment. Test structure  includes three electrically conductive horizontal bars -that are substantially identical to each other. The distance between horizontal bars and is d, and the distance between horizontal bars and is also d.","Similarly, test structure  includes three electrically conductive horizontal bars -that are substantially identical to each other. The distance between horizontal bars and is d, and the distance between horizontal bars and is also dwhere dis slightly larger than d.","After the first and second chip segments have been stitched together (i.e., chip segment boundary  crosses over chip segment boundary  with an overlap distance d), Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements can be utilized to determine the resistance between different horizontal bar pairs located on respective chip segments in order evaluate the stitching accuracy of the first and second chip segments in a Y-direction. Specifically, Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements are performed on sub-structure pairs :, :and :. If the stitching of the first and second chip segments in a Y-direction is sound, then the measured resistances should be lowest for horizontal bar pair :, but higher for horizontal bar pairs :and :, accordingly. In addition, the measured resistances for horizontal bar pairs :and :should be substantially the same.","The measured resistance for horizontal bar pair :should be the lowest because horizontal bars and have the maximum overlap area. The measured resistance for horizontal bar pairs :and :should be higher because only part of the respective horizontal bar pairs overlap with each other. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the distance between horizontal bars and can be different from the distance between horizontal bars and to provide different resistance measurements for horizontal bar pair :and for horizontal bar pairs :","With reference now to , there is illustrated a flowchart of a method for verifying stitching accuracy of multiple chips on a wafer, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Starting at block , a reticle layout is initially designed, as shown in block . During the design process, proper overlaps for chip segments are included in the reticle. In addition, various test structures, such as test structures ,  from and test structures ,  from , are added to the chip segments for assisting the evaluation of stitching accuracy of a stitched chip. A wafer layout is then designed for the inclusion of multiple stitched chips, as depicted in block .","Next, overlap settings of a photolithography equipment having a stepper are adjusted, and an exposure program for controlling the photolithography equipment is then executed to perform multiple exposures on a wafer to generate a stitched chip on the wafer, as shown in block . Electrical tests, such as Kelvin (4-wire) resistance measurements, are subsequently performed on the test structures located on the stitched chip to evaluate the stitching accuracy of the stitched chip, as depicted in block . A determination is made whether or not the test structures pass the electrical tests, as shown in block . If the test structures do not pass the electrical tests, then the stepper parameters of the exposure program are adjusted and the exposure program is executed again, as shown in block , to generate another stitched chip.","As has been described, the present invention provides a method for verifying stitching accuracy of a stitched chip on a wafer.","It is also important to note that although the present invention has been described in the context of a fully functional computer system, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the present invention are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of computer recordable type media such as compact discs and digital versatile discs.","While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["The invention itself, as well as a preferred mode of use, further objects, and advantages thereof, will best be understood by reference to the following detailed description of an illustrative embodiment when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIGS. 1","i":["a","c "],"b":"1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIGS. 2","i":["a","b "],"b":"2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIGS. 3","i":["a","b "],"b":"3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
