{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION","Example 1","Examples 2 and 3"],"p":["The present invention relates to tobacco smoke filters, especially for cigarettes.","Some conventional filter cigarettes have a CO\/Tar delivery ratio (each measured in mg per cigarette) of a little less than unity, though this ratio is more usually unity or greater. Tar is herein defined as Particulate Matter, Water- and Nicotine-free (PMWNF). It is very desirable to reduce CO delivery, but prior measures aimed at achieving this have resulted in unsatisfying taste delivery and\/or in unsatisfactory draw performance, and\/or have involved expensive filter structures.","Applicants have now surprisingly found that reduced CO delivery and reduced CO\/tar delivery ratio with maintained smoker satisfaction can be provided by using a simple and cheaply constructed low tar retention filter having a relatively high draw resistance low tar retention downstream filtering plug, a relatively low draw resistance low tar retention upstream filtering plug spaced longitudinally upstream therefrom, and a filter wrapper engaged around and joining the spaced filtering plugs and defining a ventilated cavity therebetween.","The present invention provides a tobacco smoke filter which has a tar retention of at most 50% and comprises a relatively high draw resistance downstream filtering plug of at most 50% tar retention, a relatively low draw resistance upstream filter plug of at most 20% tar retention spaced longitudinally upstream therefrom, and a filter wrapper engaging around and joining the spaced plugs to define a cavity therebetween. The terms \u201crelatively high\u201d and \u201crelatively low\u201d are used to mean that the downstream plug draw resistance is higher than that of the upstream plug. The tar retention of the upstream plug is preferably less than that of the downstream plug. The downstream filtering plug preferably extends to the buccal end face of the filter. The upstream filtering plug preferably extends to the upstream end face of the filter. The cavity may contain particulate additive, e.g. particulate sorbent, preferably activated carbon.","In a filter cigarette according to the invention such a filter is joined to a wrapped tobacco rod with the upstream filter end towards the tobacco, and the cavity is ventilated\u2014i.e. a pathway is provided for external ventilating air to pass laterally into the cavity. The filter may for example be joined to the wrapped tobacco rod by ring tipping (which engages around just the adjacent ends of filter and rod to leave much of the filter wrapper exposed) or by a full tipping overwrap (which engages around the full filter length and the adjacent end of the rod).","The filter wrapper of the filter per se, before incorporation in a filter cigarette, may be a ventilating wrapper (which provides a pathway for the passage of external ventilating air laterally therethrough into the cavity) or it may be non-ventilating. The filter wrapper may have one or more air-permeable regions in register with the cavity, or it may be wholly of air-impermeable or inherently air-permeable material; in each of these cases the filter wrapper may have one or more ventilating holes or apertures (e.g. perforations) around the cavity, but this is optional and in many instances an apertured filter wrapper is not necessary for the unattached filter per se. Where the unattached filter has a filter wrapper of air-impermeable material and is to be used in conjunction with a full tipping overwrap of inherently air-permeable material, then it could be most convenient for the filter wrapper of the unattached filter to have one or more apertures in register with the cavity; this is not the most preferred arrangement, however, and more usually the filter wrappers of the unattached filters will not have ventilating apertures. Thus when the filter wrapper is of inherently air-permeable material, ventilating apertures (though not precluded) are usually unnecessary; and where an apertured filter wrapper is required, it will frequently be preferred to form the or each ventilating hole in the filter wrapper only during or after attachment of the preformed filter to a wrapped tobacco rod in production of the filter cigarette according to the invention.","In filter cigarettes according to the invention the wall around the cavity (e.g. the filter wrapper when ring tipping is used, or the combination of filter wrapper and tipping overwrap) must be ventilating\u2014i.e. provide a pathway for the passage of external ventilating air laterally therethrough into the cavity. A tipping overwrap in a filter cigarette according to the invention must thus be a ventilating overwrap around a ventilating filter wrapper; the tipping overwrap may for example have one or more air-permeable regions or be wholly of inherently air-permeable material, and\/or it may have one or more ventilating holes or apertures (e.g. perforations); and a ventilating pathway thus provided through the tipping overwrap should of course be in register with a ventilating pathway through the filter wrapper and with the cavity.","In one preferred embodiment of filter cigarette according to the invention the filter wrapper is of inherently air-permeable material, and an apertured (e.g. perforated) tipping overwrap, with one or more holes around the cavity, is employed to incorporate the filter in a filter cigarette. Another preferred embodiment uses a tipping overwrap with no ventilating holes to join a wrapped tobacco rod to a filter according to the invention having a filter wrapper with no ventilating holes, and coinciding holes or apertures (e.g. perforations) around the cavity are formed simultaneously through both overwrap and underlying filter wrapper to provide for ventilation into the cavity.","Ventilating perforations when present in a filter wrapper and\/or tipping overwrap will usually be distributed in one or more rows extending longitudinally of or around the cavity, but other arrangements are possible, and ventilation can be augmented (or provided instead) by larger holes or apertures of any arrangement or distribution.","The filter may be of conventional length\u2014e.g. from 25 to 30 mm. The cavity may for example be from 5 to 10 mm long. The downstream filtering plug may be of about the same length as the upstream filtering plug (e.g. about 10 mm), but the upstream plug could be the shorter of the two.","The pressure drop (PD)\u2014also termed draw resistance (DR)\u2014of the downstream filtering plug can for example be from 40 to 130 mm water gauge (WG), preferably from 60 to 110 mm WG, e.g. about 90 mm WG. The tar retention of the downstream filter plug is preferably from 30 to 50%, more preferably from 35 to 45%, e.g. about 40%. The pressure drop of the upstream filtering plug can for example be up to 20 mm WG, preferably from 8 to 16 mm WG, e.g. about 12 mm WG. The tar retention of the upstream filtering plug is up to 22%, preferably from 14 to 20%, e.g. about 18%.","The downstream filtering plug is preferably of bonded filamentary tow and its required performance can be obtained by using high denier filaments (for low retention) and high total denier tow (for high pressure drop per unit length). Filamentary cellulose acetate tow is preferred, suitably of a filament denier of at least 5 (e.g. 7 or 8 or 9) and a total tow denier of 70 to 80\u00d710(e.g. about 75\u00d710). An NWA (non-wrapped acetate) filtering plug is preferred\u2014made, for example, as described in GB-A-1,169,932. Other fibrous and non-fibrous downstream filtering plug materials and structures can however be used (e.g. a plug of staple fibres or cellular plastics material or a plug of plastics\u2014e.g. HDPE\u2014fibres or filaments) provided that they have appropriate low retention and high draw resistance.","The upstream filtering plug may also be of filamentary tow, which may be of high denier filaments. Filamentary cellulose acetate tow is preferred, suitably of a filament denier of at least 5 (e.g. about 9) but with a total tow denier much less than (e.g. about half) that of the downstream plug so as to ensure the required lower pressure drop; the total denier of the upstream plug tow is for example from 35 to 40\u00d710. A preformed WA (wrapped acetate) upstream filter plug is preferred. Other fibrous and non-fibrous upstream filter plug materials and structures can however be used (e.g. a plug of staple fibres or cellular plastics material or a plug of plastics\u2014e.g. HDPE\u2014fibres or filaments) provided that they give appropriate low retention and low draw resistance.","The degree of ventilation can be chosen according to the other details of the structure and the performance required of the final product, but will normally be high\u2014e.g. from 50 to 75% or higher.","Commercially viable filters according to the invention giving satisfactory taste and draw performance in filter cigarettes can provide low CO delivery (usually less than 5 mg per cigarette compared to the value of about 6 mg per cigarette usually delivered by conventional ventilated filter cigarettes) and a low CO\/Tar delivery ratio (usually less than 0.7 and preferably as low as 0.6 or less, compared to the usual value of about 1 for conventional ventilated filter cigarettes).","The filters according to the invention may be made by a continuous in-line single pass procedure. In this procedure upstream and downstream plugs are fed alternately at a constant spacing onto a continuously supplied and longitudinally advanced ribbon of filter wrapper material and the ribbon and plugs thereon are continuously passed into and through a garniture which forms the assembly into a continuous rod of spaced plugs within the cylindrical wrapper which is secured by a lapped and stuck seam. The initial continuous rod as it issues continuously from the machine outlet is cut into finite lengths for subsequent use. This cutting may be into individual filters as defined and described above, each of which is then attached to an individual wrapped tobacco rod to form a filter cigarette. More usually, however, the continuously issuing rod is first cut into double or higher multiple (usually quadruple or sextuple) lengths for subsequent use; when the initial cut is into quadruple or higher lengths, then the latter are subsequently cut into double lengths for the filter cigarette assembly\u2014in which the double length filter rod is assembled and joined (by ring tipping or full tipping overwrap) between a pair of wrapped tobacco rods with the combination then being severed centrally to give two individual filter cigarettes. For this purpose in the present invention the filter plugs in the initial continuously produced rod are double the lengths of the plugs of the eventual individual filters. The continuous rod and the multiple lengths cut from it have individual filters according to the invention integrally joined end-to-end in mirror image relationship, and the double length rod for the mentioned filter cigarette assembly has a double length downstream plug between opposed single length cavities closed at their distal ends by respective single length upstream plugs, the cut to make the individual filter cigarettes being made laterally midway through the central double length plug. The invention includes the described production procedure and the double and higher multiple length filter rods made thereby.","The  filter has a cylindrical buccal end filtering plug  which is of relatively high draw resistance (pressure drop) and low tar retention, a cylindrical upstream filtering plug  which is of relatively low draw resistance (pressure drop) and low tar retention, and a filter wrapper  engaged around the plugs to form a cavity  therebetween.","Purely for the purpose of illustrating an optional feature (the use for the unattached filter per se of an apertured filter wrapper), the filter wrapper  of  is shown as having a ring of ventilating perforations  therethrough around the cavity . In most instances, however, the filter wrapper  of the unattached filter will be without any ventilating apertures; thus when the filter wrapper  is of inherently air-permeable material it usually need not be apertured, and when an apertured filter wrapper is desired or necessary for the filter cigarette the perforation or other hole formation may best be performed only after assembly of the preformed filter with a wrapped tobacco rod.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["7","10","11","12","10","11","12","14","6","8","4","4","8","14","12","8","14","4","12","8","14"]},"The filter of  might alternatively be attached to wrapped tobacco rod ,  by ring tipping which extends only around the adjacent ends of the filter and tobacco rod, so that most of filter wrapper  is directly exposed to atmosphere. Filter wrapper  would then usually be of air-permeable material, and\/or provided with one or more apertures around cavity  (before or after filter cigarette assembly), to give ventilation into cavity .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","3","2","3","4","6","6","3","7","7","3","2","6","3","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1","FIGS. 1 and 2"],"b":"8"},"In a specific example of a filter and filter cigarette according to the invention as described with reference to , the filter is 27 mm long and about 25 mm in circumference.

A given tow specification can be processed differently to yield plugs of different performances; in this Example the processing is such that the 10 mm plug  has a PD of 45 mm\u00b7WG with a tar retention of under 35%. The upstream end plug  is a 10 mm long wrapped acetate (WA) plug\u2014i.e. a preformed wrapped plug of plasticised cellulose acetate filaments\u2014made from a 9\/37 denier tow; it has a PD of 10.5 mm\u00b7WG with a tar retention of about 16%.

Filter and filter plug retention efficiencies are calculated by smoking the cigarette with the filter enclosed (no ventilation) and measuring the weight of tar retention by the plug(s) concerned; the tar retention is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of this weight of tar retained in the used plug(s) to the total weight of said retained tar and delivered tar yield.
