{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CLAIM OF PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7119","BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60\/792,036 entitled \u201cPOPULARITY MEASURE FOR IMPROVED QOS PERCEPTION\u201d filed Apr. 14, 2006, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.","The disclosed aspects relate to wireless broadcast systems, and more particularly, to systems and methods for using data object popularity measurements to improve quality of service perception in wireless broadcast systems.","Large-scale deployment of mass media services\/media objects over wireless communication networks may utilize broadcast\/multicast network capabilities. Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) and Broadcast and Multicast Service (BCMCS), as proposed by telecommunications specifications-setting projects, such as the 3Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and 3Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), as well as, MediaFLO\u2122 technology as developed and available from Qualcomm Incorporated of San Diego, Calif., are targeted towards enabling multimedia content transfer to handheld communication devices over the wireless channel. The MediaFLO\u2122 broadcast network provides services that allow transfer of media objects, such as digital movie clips, sports broadcasts, video clips and music files. These media objects are delivered by a content provider to the MediaFLO\u2122 network, where they are stored until the scheduled transmission time.","An important characteristic of broadcast services is that the radio transmission cost is independent of the number of subscribers m the cell. This provides a resource-efficient way of delivering, services\/media objects to large user groups and, hence, improves the scalability of the network. However, resource-efficient broadcast\/multicast communication has some potential inefficiency. For example, diverse channel conditions between the sender and its many receivers make the problem of providing reliable transfer a challenging task. Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques would require redundancy levels sufficient to overcome transmission losses for the receiver in the worst-ease radio channel. Hence, system resources, such as channel data rate, channel code rate, transmit power, arid the like, are essentially a function of the worst-case radio channel.","Therefore, a need exists to develop a method for \u201cintelligently\u201d allocating network resources, such as throughput capacity\/bandwidth, in broadcast\/multicast networks. Intelligent allocation of network resources would overcome current inefficiencies in allocating resources based on a worst-case user\/radio channel.","The disclosed apparatus and methods provide for the use of data object popularity measurements to determine the allocation of wireless broadcast system capacity.","In particular, devices, methods, apparatus, computer-readable media and processors are presented that provide for data object popularity measurements to be used in determining, the allocation of broadcast system capacity, such as throughput bandwidth. Popularity measurements may be used in conjunction with theoretical mathematical equations, such as optimization problems, to calculate capacity for data objects. Alternatively, the popularity measurements may be used in conjunction with heuristic simulations to determine capacity for data objects. Allocated capacity may be reflected in adjustment to the delivery rate of data objects, e.g., adjusting the code rate at which a data object is sent in a given period of time or allocated capacity may be reflected in adjustment to the amount of redundant information delivered in code blocks. By allocating capacity based on popularity measurements, a perceived Quality of Service (QoS) is realized in the form of minimization of reception failures, minimization of reception errors or defects, minimization of data object access delays and minimization of the use of wireless device resources, such as battery power and processing capabilities.","Optimal channel capacity assignment can result in a reduction of the number of reception failures in the broadcast system versus assigning channel capacity equally to all the data objects in the broadcast system. Such a capacity assignment approach provides for improvement of the perception of the Quality of Service (QoS). Improvement of the QoS is perceived through a decrease in reception failures, a decrease in access delay and a decrease in wireless device power consumption.","Data object popularity may be defined, in terms of the utility or importance measure of the object amongst the users. Non-uniformity in Internet-based, data object request patterns is a well-documented phenomenon. Numerous studies, such as described in \u201cAnalysis of Educational Media Server Workloads\u201d, Almeida et al., NOSSDAV 2001 and \u201cCharacterizing User Access to Videos on the World Wide Web\u201d, Acharya et al., ACM\/SPIE Multimedia Computing and Networking, January 2000, have shown a skewed popularity of both data and web objects. Analysis of data\/media server workloads shows a high locality of accesses: 14-30% of the files accessed on the server account for 90% of the data\/media sessions. Thus, since a large fraction of users are interested in the most popular data objects, improving the delivery performance for those objects, improves the overall user experience.","In one aspect, a method is provided for formulating delivery of data content in wireless broadcast system is defined. The method includes receiving a popularity measurement associated with at least one data object. The method additionally includes allocating wireless broadcast system capacity for delivery of at least one data object based on the popularity measurement and formulating the delivery of at least one data object according to the allocated wireless broadcast system capacity. The method may be applied to real-time and non-real-time delivery of data content.","In some aspects the allocating of wireless broadcast system capacity may entail calculating capacity as a function of the popularity measurement, such solving an optimization problem related to a broadcast system allocation objective. Alternatively, allocating wireless broadcast system capacity may entail a heuristic simulation method. Once capacity has been allocated, the method may implement allocation by adjusting the delivery rate, e.g., increasing\/decreasing delivery repetitions in a given time period or adjusting the amount of redundant information in coded blocks.","In another aspect, at least one processor is defined that is configured to perform the actions of receiving a popularity measurement associated with at least one data object, allocating wireless broadcast system capacity for delivery of at least one data object based on tire popularity measurement and formulating the delivery of at least one data object according to the allocated wireless broadcast system capacity.","A related aspect is defined by a machine-readable medium including instructions stored thereon. The instructions include a first set of instructions for receiving a popularity measurement associated with at least one data object, a second set of instructions for allocating wireless broadcast system capacity for delivery of at least one data object based on the popularity measurement and a third set of instructions for formulating the delivery of at least one data object according to the allocated wireless broadcast system capacity.","Another aspect is defined by a wireless network device for allocating broadcast delivery capacity. The network device includes a computer platform including a processor and a memory. The network device also includes a capacity allocation module stored in the memory and executable by the processor. The capacity allocation module includes capacity allocation logic operable for receiving a popularity measurement associated with at least one data object and determining allocation of wireless network broadcast capacity for delivery of at least one data object based on the popularity measurement.

The method includes providing data object usage information to a network entity and receiving one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the usage information. The received broadcasted data items may have a delivery rate associated with the popularity measurement or may have a redundant data quantity associated with the popularity measurement. The method may provide for a decrease in the mean number of failures, data object access delay and\/or power consumption on the wireless device as a result, of receiving the one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated, wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the usage information.","In a related aspect, at least one processor is defined that is configured to perform the actions of providing-data object popularity information to a network entity and receiving one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated, wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the popularity information.","Another related aspect is defined by a machine-read-able medium including instructions stored thereon. The instructions include a first set of instructions for providing data object popularity information to a network entity and a second set of instructions for receiving one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the popularity information.","In yet another aspect, a wireless communication device is defined that includes a computer platform including a processor and a memory. The wireless device also includes a data object usage reporting module stored in the memory and executable by the processor, wherein the data object usage reporting module is operable for providing data object usage information to a network entity and a communications module operable by the processor and operable for receiving one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the popularity information.","Further, an aspect is defined for a wireless communication device that includes a means for providing data object popularity information to a network entity and a means for receiving one or more broadcasted data objects that are allocated wireless broadcast system capacity based on a popularity measurement associated with the popularity information.","As such, the present aspects provide for the allocation of broadcast delivery capacity based on popularity measurements associated with broadcasted data objects.
