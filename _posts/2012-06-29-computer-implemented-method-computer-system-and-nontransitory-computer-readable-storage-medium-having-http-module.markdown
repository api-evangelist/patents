No. 61\/584,745, filed on Jan. 9, 2012, entitled \u201cIDENTITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND METHOD,\u201d the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.","A computer implemented method, computer system and nontransitory computer readable storage medium having an HTTP module is provided. The method, system and storage medium may be configured for an identity management system. The identity management system may be configured for identity theft protection.","In one embodiment, a computer implemented method, a computer system or a nontransitory computer readable storage medium having an HTTP module is provided. The method, system or medium may be configured for use with a device having one or more processors and a memory storing one or more programs for execution by the one or more processors, the one or more programs may include instructions for processing information from multiple web sites served up from a web application, binding multiple secure socket layer (SSL) certificates to a single site supported by the web application, hosting the SSL certificates using an SSL accelerator, and intercepting incoming requests relayed from the SSL accelerator to the web application with the HTTP module.","In another embodiment, an identity management system and method is provided that uses human knowledge and experience and computer software programs and databases to anticipate forms of identity-related fraud. The identity management system facilitates the provision of affordable and effective products and services that help protect a customer's identity, on multiple fronts, on an ongoing basis. (The term \u201ccustomer\u201d may include a person, a group of people, a family, an organization, a corporation or any potential person or entity requiring identity management services.) The identity management system provides protection services that extend well beyond credit monitoring to address the entire spectrum of identity fraud sources including online hacking, mail fraud, credit cards, checks, public records, memberships and several others. The identity management system monitors activity associated with a customer's identity and makes available to the customer a set of reports and alerts about activity that may indicate identity theft or misrepresentation. In performing and displaying an identity theft protection service, the identity management system securely reviews and stores at least one or more of the following Protected Identity Elements: individual name(s), street address(es), e-mail address(es), telephone number(s), Social Security Number(s) and bank account or credit card number(s).","The identity management system employs Internet Monitoring, which searches certain data and records available on the Internet to identify any known risks involving the customer's Protected Identity Elements. The identity management system may include Credit Monitoring, which provides credit report monitoring using one or more bureaus and monitors \u201cpay day\u201d loans. The identity management system may include Public Records Monitoring, which monitors U.S. Postal Service (USPS) Changes of Address, Court Records, and Sex Offender Registries. The identity management system may include Name and Address Monitoring, which monitors a Customized Name, an Alias List and Customized Known Address List.","The service sends immediate email notifications when a change is reported on any of the monitors to which the customer subscribes. In addition, if the customer has no changes during the month, the identity management system may be adapted to send a courtesy email reminding the customer that the service is still active on behalf of the customer and pointing the customer to educational information about Identity Theft prevention and trends.","The identity management system performs its functions without a need for access to a customer's credit information. The customer is sent updates when there are changes in credit information but the identity management system will not be notified of the nature of such changes.","The identity management system permits customers to report any activity that is of concern through an Internet-based reporting system or by calling a Resolution Specialist via telephone.","To facilitate understanding of the identity theft protection system in its full context, the present specification includes the following:\n\n","The identity management system may comprise one or more of the following subsystems:\n\n","In some embodiments, an identity management system is provided comprising: a core gateway system, wherein the core gateway is configured to provide support for special offer codes and source codes that enable special pricing or promotional discounts, offer promotional trial periods on certain products, or identify a marketing channel used to attract the customer.","In some embodiments, an identity management system is provided comprising: a core gateway including: a self-service system; a core function system; a content and skinning; a product and catalog system; a partner integration system; a central manager; and an affiliate management system, wherein the core gateway is configured to provide support for special offer codes and source codes that enable special pricing or promotional discounts, offer promotional trial periods on certain products, or identify a marketing channel used to attract the customer.","In some embodiments, an identity management system is provided comprising: An identity management system comprising: a core gateway; a data processing engine; and a subscriber database.","In some embodiments, an identity management system is provided comprising a secure profile system.

The client can be any number of devices (e.g., computer, internet kiosk, personal digital assistant, cell phone, gaming device, desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet computer, a television with one or more processors embedded therein or attached thereto, or a set-top box) which may be used to connect to a communication network. The communication network may be a wireless, optical, wired or other type of network that facilitates the passage of information. It may include the Internet, one or more local area networks (LANs), one or more wide area networks (WANs), other types of networks, or a combination of such networks. The client application is an application that is executed by the client (e.g., browser, e-mail client, word processor) and that displays or presents information to a user of the client (the client application may also perform other tasks not relevant to the present discussion). Client may also include a location determiner for reporting a geolocation of the client.","A customer client system may include one or more processing units (CPU's), one or more network or other communications interfaces, memory, and one or more communication buses for interconnecting these components. The customer client system may include a user interface, for instance a display and a keyboard. The memory may include high speed random access memory and may also include non-volatile memory, such as one or more magnetic or optical storage disks. The memory may include mass storage that is remotely located from CPU's. The memory may store the following elements, or a subset or superset of such elements: an operating system that includes procedures for handling various basic system services and for performing hardware dependent tasks; a network communication module (or instructions) that is used for connecting the customer client system to other computers via the one or more communications interfaces (wired or wireless), such as the Internet, other wide area networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and so on; a client application as described above; a client assistant as described above; optionally, a cache of downloaded and a cache downloaded, as well as other information for viewing using the client application, and information retrieved by user selection of one or more items.","Identity Management System Core Gateway (CGW)","The identity management system may include a Core Gateway, which is an end-user portal for consumers to browse the various products in the identity management system suite, gather product information and complete the purchase and enrollment of various products. The site also provides various self-service functions such as requesting additional information on any identity management system product and reporting fraud-related activity. Finally, for certain products such as Identity Protection and a secure web based storage inventory of subscriber documents such as, for example, EZSHIELD VAULT, the Core Gateway serves as a central launching pad for additional product-specific services.","In this way the CGW is a Consumer Hub for items related to the identity management system. From a technical and architectural view-point, CGW is also a content delivery and commerce platform. As banks and other financial institutions (also known as Partners) adopt the identity management system product suite, the Core Gateway can be used by these Partners to deliver a custom-branded uniform experience consistent with the Partner's own brand identity and online presence.","Tools and Technologies","The Core Gateway facilitates rapid development and a stable and scalable platform. The Core Gateway comprises four core functions, as follows: language(s) and runtime environment (for example, in one embodiment, .NET Framework and ASP.NET); application framework and services, content management (for example, in one embodiment, DotNetNuke); object\/relational persistence layer (for example, in one embodiment, NHibernate); and configuration and dependency injection; additional app framework and services (for example, in one embodiment, Spring.NET).","Content and Skinning","The CGW implements a platform that can deliver a Partner-branded experience. In one embodiment, a basic site structure is defined that encompasses all of the site's features: delivery of information, product-specific services and launch pads, enrollment and self-service features. This generic structure can be easily applied to any Partner by default. To achieve a branded-look, several mechanisms may be utilized to tailor the content that is rendered and delivered to the end-user:\n\n","This approach enables achievement of several goals. Firstly, because the default structure and styles are fairly generic, using the identity management system, one can get a minimal Partner-branded site up and running very rapidly just by uploading a few Partner logo images and specifying a handful of Partner-specific style settings. Indeed a tool called the Partner JumpStart Toolkit does just that by providing a quick form-fill approach to defining a new Partner. (See below for a more detailed discussion of the Partner JumpStart Toolkit.)","Secondly, it allows the freedom to completely replace a subset of pages when a Partner requests a particular look for a set of pages if that look does not easily fit into the default structure and style.","Lastly, it facilitates a rapid response to specialized needs for Partners who may choose to include content that compliments but does not directly relate to the identity management system's site or products. In these cases, using the identity management system, one can add Partner-specific products to that Partner's catalog and define product detailed pages which can be navigated to via the product links or from a set of custom pages.","Products and Catalogs","The CGW implements a specialize product and catalog model dubbed the \u201cmini-catalog\u201d which is specially tailored to the service-oriented product selections of the identity management system suite. The catalog is also has special support for Partner-specific requirements. A Partner's catalog may define a subset of the identity management system's products the partner wishes to offer as well as the subset of the variations of those products. Variations allow defining pricing, price classes, product-specific content and even tax-related information on a per Partner+product combination.","Partner Integrations","The normal page flow for user enrollment has the user come to the CGW site (either the identity management system default site or the Partner-branded site), browse around the site to learn about the identity management system products, then begin the Enrollment process. The user selects one or more products to subscribe to, provides their contact and billing information and any product-specific options. The enrollment is submitted at which point a user account is created, billing information is process and any recurring billing is validated and scheduled.","For some Partners this normal process can be altered. For starters, instead of having users fill out their contact and personal information, a Partner may choose to integrate their user data into the identity management system.","The Partner can define data elements known as a \u201cPartnerUserKeys\u201d which can be used to uniquely verify a user's identity. Some examples would be a customer account number, the last four digits of their checking account number, a special offer code that may have been sent to the customer by the Partner, or the customer's account name. Any one of these or any combination (up to 3) of these data elements can be used.","There are three approaches that the Partner can use to integrate user data with the CGW.","Bulk data load\u2014For this approach the Partner sends and initial load of customer data and then agrees to send updates on a regular periodic basis. The data load defines the customer information that the identity management system would typically capture through the normal enrollment process along with the identifying information corresponding to the PartnerUserKey elements. The data may also identify the products that the user is eligible for and may also identify if a user's information has been updated or if their eligibility has expired, for example if a customer closes a checking account and is no longer eligible for Check Fraud Protection.","On-demand Data Push\u2014For this approach a Partner's customer typically would navigate directly from their own account on the Partner's own site (e.g., the user is logged into a Bank's account and billing services) and would follow a link to the Partner's branded CGW site. The Partner would need to track whether the customer is already enrolled in the identity management system's service, and if not, would need to send the necessary information to the CGW using the \u201cIntegration API\u201d, a collection of securely accessible Web Services. A one-time session token is generated from the API call and is used to identify the customer as she is forwarded from the Partner site to the CGW.","On-demand Data Pull\u2014For this approach the Partner has to expose a mechanism for the CGW to query back to the Partner the necessary information. The CGW supports most standard Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Web Service calls as well as some forms of REST-based service requests. (For this integration approach, some additional configuration and integration work on the CGW may be required for each Partner.) With this approach, the customer may either be forwarded from the Partner's site or may land on the CGW directly (e.g., following a Web link from an e-mail announcement, entering a URL from a mail campaign, performing an Internet search or simply by word of mouth). Again the customer would need to enter some qualifying information to identify themselves. The CGW would use this information to make a request back to the Partner to confirm their eligibility as well as retrieve necessary enrollment data.","Alter Codes","Most commerce sites have support for special offer codes and source codes that enable special pricing or promotional discounts, offer promotional trial periods on certain products, or simply help identify marketing channel used to attract the customer. In one embodiment, CGW offers a mechanism known as \u201cAlter Codes\u201d which offers these features and more. When a user first lands at the CGW, a session is constructed for that user and that session includes various state information including the originating site, which Partner they are affiliated with, and what Catalog of products are available to the user. As the user navigates through the site, their session is updated to reflect any changes in that state. For example, logging into the site updates the session with an authenticated user account that includes their enrollment history and account details.","An Alter Code is a generated code or word (generated by an Alter Code Generator) that finds its way to the user and then allows the user to enter that code during the enrollment process. If the Alter Code is of a valid form and not expired, understood for the given Partner, and applicable for the user's current session state, then the Alter Code's associated Processor has the ability to make some alteration in the user's session. This can include altering the effective product catalog which could adjust product pricing, give away items for promotional periods or enable products which would normal be hidden.","It can also be used to track the source location that a customer was referred from or import customer data from some external data source. In this way the Alter Code is complimentary with the Partner Integration mechanisms already mentioned.","Alter Codes can be durable meaning they are persistent in CGW's data store which is typical for a shared offer code that is blasted to many users, for example, during a marketing campaign that offers a 30 trial period on a subscription service. They can also be sparse meaning that they are not initially stored in the data store. Sparse codes are ones where many thousands of codes can be generated and a unique code is sent to individual users, who may or may not act on them. When a user redeems an Alter Code that is sparsely stored, then that Alter Code is then captured and stored and becomes effectively used-up such that it cannot be used again. A sparse code is good for targeting specific individuals. A good example would be the Partner Integration example above where an Alter Code is generated for each Partner customer and redeeming that Alter Code pre-populates the users contact information for enrollment.","Affiliates and the Partner JumpStart Toolkit","The Core Gateway supports the concept of an Affiliate\u2014a special Partner entity that itself has customers who are Partners, essentially a Partner of Partners. An Affiliate's customers are themselves banks, credit unions or other financial institutions and CGW has special support for this arrangement where an Affiliate has a large number of FI customers that the Affiliate wishes to target the identity management system's products for resale under the FI customer's identity.","In addition to specialized reporting and analysis tools (via EZTrac), the CGW offers the Partner JumpStart Toolkit as briefly mentioned before. JumpStart is a very basic form-fill-based tool that allows designated agents of an Affiliate (such as sales staff) to create and define a new Partner-branded site under the CGW. The JumpStart tool allows a handful of elements to be provided such as uploaded logos, Partner-identifying textual information, primary theme and color selections and default product catalog.","Within minutes of defining this information, the Affiliate agent can preview a working site. Once satisfied with the initial result the affiliate can request that the Partner be published. After completing a QA process by authorized identity management system agents, the site can be released to the public. Additional customizations and configurations, such as Partner Integration parameters, custom catalogs and specialized page flows, can be performed by identity management system agents and can be added at a later time, or can be added before the new Partner site goes live.","Overview","The identity management system processes pieces of information (referred to as feeds) inbound and outbound with each feed potentially being in a different format. Some examples of these feeds include billing, alert, payment, event, email and synchronization data but the most common type is sales. A standard way to process these feeds is by means of a custom piece of code, or package, to process each feed. With this prior art method, dozens, if not hundreds, of packages are managed to verify that each works properly and interdependencies are maintained.","As an alternative solution, the identity management system includes a Data Processing Engine (DPE). The DPE is a central platform to implement, manage and monitor the inbound and outbound feeds. Feeds are controlled and processed through pieces of meta data that define the feed settings. The advantages to this approach include code reusability, lower feed implementation times, central logging, shared business rules and consistent processing.","DPE Process Flow",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0089","num":"0104"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"200"},"File Retrieval","The DPE  has been designed to support flexible transmission settings that are defined in the meta data associated with a feed. An FTP Server Remote or internal Server  may be functionally connected to a File Retrieval system . The File Retrieval system  may comprise a Data Feed, TransmissionDetail and Data FeedJob.

While this solution provides a vast amount of flexibility to store different customer attributes, it did not allow for a consolidated view of the customer. Relatively simple tasks like reporting, customer lookup and fulfillment were very cumbersome to support. When the business asked a simple question such as \u201cHow many active customers are there right now?\u201d, the technology team was not able to answer with ease. To exacerbate the problems, a common set of customer attributes and common taxonomy were not present.","In order to address these concerns, the identity management system may be adapted to include a consolidated data store to hold this information. The key success requirements for the project included:\n\n","To solve the defined problems and meet the projects requirements, the team decided to leverage its existing expertise in a relational database management system (for example, in one embodiment, Microsoft SQL Server) to develop a customized schema tailored to an identity management system's business needs. The development was broken into several design, development, and release iterations as laid out below. Design development followed the Data Services Design Best Practices.","Partner Services","Using the Glossary of Terms above to establish terminology embodiments of the system and method create a schema to represent the identity management system's business. A need arose to develop a way to represent the attributes for a combination of a generic identity management system service, a package and a partner. Attributes that are unique to this combination are service term, pricing, billing frequency, volume discounts, step pricing and package requirements. To represent this, the concept of the Partner Service was developed. The Partner Service maintains referential integrity to the generic services offered but allows for partner and package specific customizations of attributes associated with that service.","Anonymous Subscribers","The next challenge identified relates to the management of anonymous subscribers. Some identity management system partner data feeds contain detailed demographic information (i.e., name, address, phone, and the like) while others contain only sales data (i.e., service X, date sold, and the like). In order to maintain referential integrity within the data model and fit both business cases, a null profile record (\u22121) is implemented that is referenced for anonymous subscribers. If the identity management system collects additional demographic information about a specific anonymous customer during the course of normal business, the associated records can be re-associated with a newly created profile record representing that additional data.","Provisional Enrollment Support","The identity management system's most common sales process involves a partner selling services to their customer. The partner then sends sales files to the identity management system, which is processed into SDB. The identity management system then sends an email to the customer directing them to activate their services via the CGW portal. During the activation process, CGW needs to validate the customer against the SDB record. This validation process is referred to as the provisional enrollment process.","To support the provisional lookup process (PSS), SDB needed to extend a validation mechanism to the CGW web site for real time customer verification. This was accomplished by creating a series of stored procedures which offer flexible validation options. Validation can be executed based on different combinations of customer information:\n\n","Once a customer is validated by CGW using these procedures, the customer can continue through the enrollment process.","CGW Synchronization","After creating customer records in SDB and CGW, a mechanism is identified to keep these systems in sync. When accounts are created in CGW, the system generates a unique identity management system ID for that customer. That ID becomes the primary key across CGW and SDB for the purposes of system synchronization. This occurs both during the provisional enrollment process and when a walk up customer is enrolled (a walk up customer goes directly to the CGW portal and purchases services).","Please refer to CGW documentation for information on how CGW flags records for synchronization. Flagged records are processed via DPE for synchronization with SDB on a daily basis.","Schema Extension","Since SDB's original development, the system has been extended to store data about outbound email triggers and the deliverability (sent, bounce, open, click, and the like) information about that message.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0121","num":"0154"},"figref":"FIG. 5","b":["500","500","510","520","530","540","550","560","565","570","575","580","590"]},"In , the abbreviations Primary Key (PK), Foreign Key (FK), Instance (I) and Update (U) are used and may be numbered, for example, FK, FK, I, I and the like.","SDBNotificationEvents  may comprise one or more of EventID, which may function as PK and FK, NotificationEventID, which may function as PK, NotificationCampaignID, which may function as FK, EventDate, Type, Reason, Code, OfferName, OfferURL, CreatedOn, CreatedBy, UpdatedOn and UpdatedBy fields.

This need presents an enormous risk to customers as well as in the event of a breach, both external and internal. While the identity management system ensures the safety and security of systems, the potential and threat for a compromise may still exist. To that end, a system was developed with the aim of reducing the risk of exposure of sensitive data, both through technology and process. This document describes the SecureProfile system, which is designed to address the need described thus far.","SecureProfile (SP) is a system that is designed as a repository of data with features and characteristics whose primary purpose is to ensure security and safety of the data which is stores. It offers the following features:\n\n","SecureProfile may be implemented as a standalone system with well-defined and constrained access mechanisms. As a stand-alone system, it allows reuse of functionality across multiple other systems (Web sites, integrations, tools, etc.) without hard-coding it or tying it any one system. It also facilitates a generic design to service multiple client systems and purposes.","Single Interface","Many systems provide support for multiple methods of access and interaction, such as via a Web-based or Client-based UI, an API interface, and even direct access to the underlying data store (DB). This often makes it necessary to facilitate flexibility and convenience for working with a system. However, SP is designed to only support a single, well-defined access mechanism which helps limit the attack surface for compromising the system, and it also helps to ensure a focus on securing that mechanism. The access mechanism is an API interface that allows external client systems to interact with SP.","However, the necessary flexibility and convenience to integrate with SP can still be achieved by building other specialized access points and integrations atop the API interface. This layering approach ensures that a single choke-point applies security protocols defined within SP.","Secure Context","The API layer is the exposed shell that provides access into SP, and it in turn interfaces into a Secure Context, an environment session attributed to a single, known entity known as a Subject. A Subject (also known as a Principal) is an entity that represents a known individual user or system within SP that can access the SP system and can interact with other elements exposed by SP, such as Profiles and Records.","As a first step to interacting with SP, a client first establishes a Secure Context by identifying itself and authorizing itself by presenting an authentication credential. This credential is used to directly unlock the Subject's identity and associate it with the Security Context. Further interaction with SP is implemented through the Security Context, which allows to always attribute any action (creating, reading, writing, and the like) against any entity (Subjects, Profiles, Records, and the like) to a known Subject. Security protocols and processes are also implemented within the Secure Context, again to create a single known choke-point against access to the SP system and the data it contains.","Encrypted Persistent Storage","The Secure Context persists its durable entities to a back-end data storage which can be implemented as a relational database (i.e., SQL Server in the current implementation) or some other facility such as a collection of files or an alternative database technology (for example, BDB, BigTable, Hadoop, or any other suitable database technology). The common factor being that data written to and read from the persistent storage is controlled by a Secure Context and the persistent representation always guarantees encryption of the sensitive data (i.e., any user supplied data, potentially excluding meta-data added by SP).","In this way the persistent storage is itself a black-box of information, which if isolated and stolen, would expose very little sensitive information without brute-force processing and attacking of the content.","Cryptographic Technology","SecureProfile makes use of various cryptographic techniques, including symmetric encryption (secret key), asymmetric encryption (public\/private key), secure hashing and shared secret to implement its supported features. As a general rule, SecureProfile does not employ any newly invented or crafted algorithms or protocols to support these techniques. Instead, it supports the application of any implementation that fits into a general framework for these techniques.","Any data that is secured and persisted under the transformation of these techniques is tagged with metadata that will identify the correct reverse transformation to recover the original, insecure form of the data. The metadata is used to resolve a concrete implementation and any instance-specific parameters necessary to perform both the encoding, and if applicable, the decoding of such data. SecureProfile maintains a dynamic, configuration driven library of implementations that are known as transformers. These transformers generalize the majority of the various cryptographic techniques identified above, and allow SP to decouple it security mechanisms from specific algorithms and protocols.","As an example, the following lists some specific transformer implementations that are supported by this framework:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0146","num":"0188"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00004","num":"00004"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"35pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"105pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"77pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Secure Hashing","MD5"]},{"entry":[{},{},"SHA"]},{"entry":[{},"Symmetric Encryption","Triple DES"]},{"entry":[{},{},"AES-256"]},{"entry":[{},"Asymmetric Encryption","RSA"]},{"entry":[{},{},"DSS"]},{"entry":[{},{},"ElGamal"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0147","num":"0189"},"figref":"FIG. 6.A"},"The Secure Profile system  may comprise a database system , a data access system , a controller system , a context system  and a service system , which may, in one example, include the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol  and the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework .

Microsoft's IIS 6, the Web server that CGW currently is deployed upon, has a limitation where it can only support a single SSL certificate bound across HTTPS endpoints associated with a single IIS site.","To overcome this limitation, the tier above the Web tier is utilized, at the load balancer (LB) appliance. The load balancer supporting the production environment also features SSL accelerator functionality, which includes the ability to host multiple SSL certificates, and direct traffic associated with each SSL cert to a target Web server (or servers). In the present case, SSL certificates associated with the CGW Partner sites are installed into the load balancer, and traffic associated with each of these certs is directed to the same CGW Web server end-point.","Because an HTTPS request is completely encapsulated in an SSL connection, the typical HTTP protocol negotiation and exchange does not take place until after the SSL connection is fully established. This means that the normal HTTP protocol exchange of target hostname information, which is normally used to support virtual hosting, or the ability to serve up multiple distinct domain-named sites from a singly HTTP endpoint, is not possible when served over SSL. So a unique combination of IP address+listening port number is required to distinguish each target Partner site. To that end, a dedicated VIP (unique IP address listening endpoint) is provided on the load balancer for each Partner site. The dedicated SSL certificate is associated with that VIP on the load balancer, and then these VIPs are directed from the LB to the CGW application on the IIS servers.","SecurePort ASP.NET HTTP Module","Because the load balancer hosts the SSL certificates, that also means that the LB terminates the secure SSL connections for each incoming client request. Relayed connections are therefore transmitted in the clear to the target IIS Web servers. This presents a problem to the CGW application because it detects whether incoming requests are secure or not, and if not forces a redirect to the corresponding secure connection. Because the client is directly interacting with the LB, and even when the client's connection is secured over SSL, the connection that CGW sees (coming from the LB) will be insecure, and thus CGW will always see an insecure connection and continuously redirect, causing an infinite redirection loop.","To address this problem, a custom ASP.NET HTTP Module is developed known as the SecurePort Module. This module is installed early on in the CGW request processing pipeline and it is configured to detect certain characteristics of an incoming request connection, for example a special port or local interface IP address. When the incoming request connection matches on these parameters, it alters the current state of the request context to indicate that the connection is secure.","In the production environment, the CGW application listens on ports  and  on the local interface, which services the public-facing Partner sites (only reachable by the LB due to networking topology). The SecurePort Module is configured to flag incoming requests on port  as secure.","DNS Issue for the Core Gateway (CGW)","The Core Gateway may be used as the primary website for the identity management system and may have a URL with a format of {[identity management system trademark or name].[top level domain (TLD)]}, for example, EZShield.org, but one of its major features is partner-specific skinning and branding. The identity management system dynamically brands and styles the site and its identity for many different partners including, for example, banks and institutions.","A part of that custom branding is the URL that takes a consumer to a particular partner-branded version of the site. The URL has to be unique to distinguish the target partner site. This both for technical reasons (the incoming URL requested directly determines what skin the CGW renders to the consumer), as well as to complete the custom-branded experience for the user.","For example, the default site may be EZShield.org, that is a brand specific to the identity management system, which may include a self-standing, distribution channel for the identity management system suite of products. The identity management system may also have branded versions of the site that are skinned to match the look of several other properties or partners. The partner-branded version of CGW for such sites may have a URL in the format of [partner].[identity management system trademark or name].[TLD], for example, [partner].ershield.org, or [identity management system trademark or name].[partner].[TLD], for example, ershield.[partner].org. In this case the partner sites are just sub-domains of the default site.","Some larger partners, such as, for example, banks, often desire an even more specialized URL to create an even more completely branded impression of the site. One example might have a URL in the format of [partner's security site].[TLD]. As can be readily appreciated, this at the other end of the spectrum from sub-domains and such URLs may have different TLDs. The CGW site has to support any variation of DNS names distinguished from the primary website (for example, EZShield.org).","Now, CGW in and of itself has no problems supporting multiple distinct DNS aliases, but the problem comes in with SSL. Since CGW is a commerce site, sensitive user purchasing information is captured and in a secure manner, i.e., using an HTTPS session over SSL.","The first problem is that CGW is an ASP.NET application and is hosted on Microsoft's IIS Web server and IIS has a strict limitation that each unique incoming end-point (that is, a combination of IP Address and Port Number where the IIS server is listening for incoming requests) can only support at most one SSL certificate.","The second problem is that a channel partner may move over most or all of the Web properties that require secure connections to use Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates. These provide an extra level of assurance to consumers, and are so indicated by special decorations in today's most popular Web browsers (e.g., special coloring in the address bar). This very common practice today, especially for any site that is affiliated with the financial or security industries. They also cost quite a bit more because of the extra level of validation that the Certificate Authorities (CA) have to process and the extra level of assurance that they claim the guarantee.","So, the first problem can actually be partially solved by something called a wild-card SSL certificate. This a cert that identifies a unique primary domain name such as ershield.org but also applies to any and all sub-domains *.ershield.org. This was the original and first solution. The problem is that it does not help with the banks that want a completely distinguished domain name.","Instead still another type of SSL certificate called a Unified Communications Certificate (UCC) is utilized. This certificate makes use of an SSL extension known as the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) which can list one or more completely unique domain names in addition to the primary name identified by the certificate. So this certificate specifically addresses the issue.","However, today, neither wild-card certificates, nor UCC certificates are supported by any issuing Certificate Authority with Extended Validation. So to use either one, the EV moniker would otherwise need to be abandoned for the CGW sites.","So the next thing to consider is how can the CGW support multiple certificates, not just multiple names? Since IIS does not support more than a single cert, one alternative is to push the certificates one level up onto something that sits in front of IIS. A dedicated appliance known as an SSL Accelerator does just that.","An SSL Accelerator is typically an appliance with specialized hardware for doing the SSL \u201cstuff\u201d very fast (channel negotiation, encryption, decryption, key exchange, and the like), so it's primarily used by sites with very heavy SSL traffic. But it can also solve the problem because most (perhaps all) accelerators can support the installation of multiple SSL certificates.","It is found that it is quite possible existing load balancer(s) at the Savvis hosting provider may already in fact support the SSL Accelerator functionality. While not strictly concerned with the SSL acceleration features (a concern as traffic grows), it is determined that there is a need to know the following:\n\n","Some things to keep in mind:\n\n","An example of Basic Web Interaction  is shown in  (please note,  is a symbol key or legend for ). In one example of a Web site, two hosts representing the client  and server  communicate directly. On the Client Host , some process such as a Web Browser  initiates connections to the Server Host . On the Server Host , a process such as a Web Application Server  will receive these connections and establish a two-way dialog with the client.","The client and server processes bind to network End Points ,  on their respective hosts, which are defined by an address and a port. The address uniquely identifies the host, and the port is tied to a specific process on that host.","The client and server processes communicate using the HTTP protocol  which is normally an unsecure protocol (i.e., content and data are transmitted in the clear over the network). However a secure variation that is used over an encrypted connection is implemented with the SSL\/TLS protocols to encapsulate and secure HTTP communication (known as HTTP Secure or HTTPS) . Ports  and  represent the standard listening End Points  and  on a Server Host  that accept HTTP communications  and HTTPS communications , respectively.","The SSL\/TLS protocols represent a mechanism to secure any communication over an insecure channel such as the public Internet. They are implemented using public key encryption, which includes a digital certificate\u2014a document that represents the trusted identity of the party that possesses the certificate. This certificate is signed by a trusted third-party, and includes the symbolic name of the party being identified.","In a standard HTTP over SSL\/TLS, the Web Server will possess an SSL Certificate that will identify the server host using its symbolic DNS name. A Web client will typically initiate contact using the symbolic DNS name\u2014a user-friendly, alpha-numeric name such as www.ershield.com. When the client interacts with the Web server over the clear HTTP protocol, the DNS name is simply a convenient naming convention, but when it interacts with the server over the secure HTTPS protocol, then the DNS name is integrally tied to the overall identity verification process associated with SSL\/TLS communication.","The Web Application Server process is typically a container that hosts different Web Applications. This container manages various infrastructure services such as network connectivity, request decoding and negotiation, resource utilization and delegation of specific Web requests to individual Web Applications. The Web Application Server exposes an environment and execution context to its hosted applications that reflects the attributes of the request, such as the target URL, the request origin, referral information and various runtime characteristics.","The Web Application Server's responsibilities also typically include the low-level implementation of the HTTP protocol as well as the secure HTTPS variation. This implies the Web Application Server software in turn translates low-level protocol operations and data exchanges into higher-level constructs and concepts upon which Web Applications are built.","Virtual Hosting and HTTPS Complications are demonstrated in . While a DNS name can be used as a friendly alias for a Web Host address, a DNS name does not have to represent a unique Web server host and indeed typically several related or distinct DNS names will map to a single server host.","The HTTP protocol includes a provision for the target DNS name to be specified by the client when initiating a connection for an HTTP request. This name can then be used by the Web Application Server to dynamically resolve how to handle the request and to which Web Application the request should be delegated. This technique is known as \u201cVirtual Hosting\u201d and it allows a single physical Server Host, and more specifically a single Web Application Server process on that host, to service multiple requests that span different logical hosts. This technique is often used to adjust the branding or styles that are delivered as part of an HTTP response, or to execute an entirely different set of application logic (i.e. different hostnames resolve to different applications).","However there is a limitation to this technique, in that it can only be used effectively with the unsecured variation of HTTP. This is due to the fact that with the secure form of HTTP, the SSL\/TLS protocols are used to secure the HTTP communication by first establishing an SSL session and then encapsulating the HTTP protocol communication within that session. Because the Virtual Hosting mechanism is an HTTP-specific feature, it is not applicable or accessible by the SSL\/TLS protocols when the SSL session is established. (NOTE: Server Name Indication (SNI) is an extension to the SSL\/TLS protocols that allows a client to indicate the target hostname being contacted at the start of the SSL\/TLS session negotiation. Unfortunately, it is not widely adopted or supported by client or server implementations of HTTP over SSL\/TLS, and as such, its usefulness on the public Internet is very limited.)","When an HTTP SSL session is first established, the server is required to send the SSL digital certificate to the client. Because it has no indication via which DNS name it was contacted (as with the Virtual Hosting technique), it must send the same single SSL certificate to the client for every request. This is why a single SSL certificate is effectively tied exclusively to a single End Point on a server host.","A variation of Virtual Hosting that also works well with SSL\/TLS involves assigning multiple addresses to a single Server Host and having the Web Application Server process bind to all of them. The Web Application Server process then manages all incoming requests across all the different End Points, across all the different addresses, and uses the End Point as a request attribute to distinguish the Virtual Host being targeted akin to the DNS name in the Virtual Hosting technique above. However, some Web Application Servers (e.g. IIS up to version 6.0) suffer from a limitation that allows only a single SSL certificate to be associated with any one Web Application. So regardless of via which End Point a request comes in, only a single SSL identity can be presented to the client.","In such situations, the typical approach  is to inject an intermediate network node  between an HTTP client host  and an HTTP server host , which is shown, for example, in , such as another Host or a network relay device that can support SSL termination on behalf of the real Server Host (e.g., a network load balancer or SSL accelerator). In this scenario, the intermediate node  hosts one or more SSL Certificates  and is assigned one or more End Point addresses . The SSL Certificates  are assigned to the different End Points . As unsecure HTTP communication  and secure HTTPS communication  are received by the intermediate node , secure HTTPS communication  is decrypted and then both the decrypted HTTPS traffic and any clear HTTP traffic  is relayed to the real Server Host  via its own End Point , using the clear HTTP protocol . The HTTP client host  may comprise a web browser , and the HTTP server host  may comprise a web application server .","Request Filtering and the SecurePort Module  are shown, for example, in . The final technique described in  is adequate in many situations; however, there are still scenarios that will ultimately fail with this configuration. Specifically, a Web Application that hosts and collects sensitive data will often require a user to connect to it via a secure connection. A Web Application will detect the method used for incoming connections by inspecting various attributes of the context and environment that the Web Application Server process exposes to it.","For most Web Application Server platforms (e.g. Java Web Servlets, .NET Framework ASP.NET, the CGI interface) a simple Boolean attribute is made available to indicate if the connection is secure and an encrypted communication channel is established with the client. If the channel is not secure, any interaction that exchanges sensitive data will usually force the Web Application to first send a redirect directive back to the client, specifying that the same request should be repeated over a secure channel.","For example, let's assume a client requests a simple URL that wants to display a user's bank account summary which would include sensitive information such as account numbers and current balances. They may initiate such a request with this sample URL: http:\/\/www.samplebank.com\/BankAccounts\/AccountsSummary","As you can see this URL indicates a clear HTTP request as indicated by its leading scheme value of \u201chttp:\u201d. When the target Web Application that this URL request is relayed to receives this request, it will detect from the hosting container that the request is insecure and send a directive back to the client to retrieve the same request over a secure channel. The Web Application will send back this URL:","https:\/\/www.samplebank.com\/BankAccounts\/AccountsSummary","This is the same URL except that the leading scheme value of \u201chttps:\u201d now indicates a secure channel. However, in the configuration outlined in , when the client repeats the request using this new URL, it will go through the same chain of events, from client, to intermediate network node, to the server, and ultimately resolve to the same insecure request at the server end as before. Once again the Web Application will detect the insecure request and send the client a redirect to the secure variation. At this point we have configured an endless loop which will prevent the server from ever completing the request.","In this case, the solution is to alter the context information that is exposed to the Web Application by the Web Application Server process. As an example, one specific technique involves injecting a filter component  into the request processing pipeline of the Web Application Server , a mechanism supported by many platforms (e.g. Java Web Servlets, .NET Framework ASP.NET). This filter  can be configured such that it can detect some characteristic of the incoming connection being relayed by the intermediate node  as an indicator of a connection that originated as secure.","For example, as is typical of such devices, the intermediate node  can be configured to relay connections that were originally secure on an alternate port to the server (for example port ). Another approach simply involves tagging the HTTP request itself with additional information to indicate the security aspect of the connection. For example, the leading portion of an HTTP request allows for the inclusion of various name-value pairs, known as headers. In most cases, the client and server restrict themselves to the set of standard, well-known headers specified in the HTTP protocol specifications, but a properly configured relay device could add a custom header, for example, with the name X-IsSecure: that supports a simple set of values true and false. The relay device would inject this header and an appropriate value into the relayed communication stream back to the server. (The relay device would also need to filter out any such headers that may be transmitted from the client that may be an attempt to spoof the server into misinterpreting connections that were originally insecure.)","To go along with this configuration on the relay device, a filter, let's call it the \u201cSecurePort Module\u201d  would need to be installed and configured on the server host . It would need to be configured in a complementary fashion to the relay device to pick up on the characteristics that indicate an original secure connection, and upon detection of such characteristics alter the context that is exposed to the Web Application. The HTTP client host  may communicate with the HTTP intermediate node  via HTTP (clear)  and\/or HTTPS (SSL\/TLS)  communications protocols. The HTTP intermediate node  may communicate with the HTTP server host  via HTTP (clear)  and\/or alt HTTP (clear)  communications protocols, which are connected to the HTTP server host  via end points . The end points  may be located on ports  and , ports  and  may bound to the SecurePort Module , and the SecurePort Module  may be functionally connected with or integrated into the Web Application Server  of the HTTP server host .","Overview","UrlMatcher is a component that can be added to an ASP.NET site to allow an operator of the identity management system to more easily define and manage URL matching and manipulation rules.","Vanity URLs","The initial justification for developing this component came out of a need to better support vanity URLs on the CGW platform. Because CGW is built atop DotNetNuke and because DotNetNuke has some limitations with the way URLs can be defined and the way it manages them, an independent approach is developed to support vanity URLs.","Initially vanity URLs were supported through IIS's own Virtual Directory feature, where one would define a VDir and map it to a URL redirect (instead of a file path) to the target page within the CGW site. While this approach mostly works, the proliferation of VDirs in the IIS manager is cumbersome and hard to maintain, and it pollutes the administration window when managing the IIS site.","Also, it means that each vanity URL defined is global across all Partner sites, and you cannot remap a particular vanity URL to mean different things for different Partners. For example, a common vanity URL defined\/starthere may be provided that maps to the PSS landing page of the identity management system. It currently always maps to the original PSS landing page, but it might be useful for newer partners to always default to the alternate PSS landing page (which does user lookup by Personally Identifiable Information (\u201cPII\u201d) instead of Activation Code). With VDir, this is not an option.","The need to support vanity URLs more easily was compounded with release 2.2.0 when the alternate PSS activation was first introduced. With this new enrollment method, it is important to be able to quickly support Retailer-specific vanity URLs and there can be quite a number of Retailers per Partner site.","Partner Site Aliases\/Redirects","A second use for the UrlMatcher is supporting redirects for alternative domains (host aliases) for the identity management system's Partner sites. For example, it may be the case that the Partners have a primary host alias, which is used to determine the skinning and branding that the CGW platform delivers, where the URL is in the format of [partner].[identity management system trademark or name].[TLD]. Examples are:\n\n","But in addition to these primary host aliases, alternate host aliases may be defined that redirect back to the primary. For example, \u201cwww\u201d may be added in the format of www.[partner].[identity management system trademark or name].[TLD], for example, www.[partner].ershield.com. Other possibilities include a simplified URL in the format of [identity management system trademark or name].[TLD] such as, for example, ershield.com, or alternate TLDs such as, for example, ershield.org or www.ershield.org.","Using the identity management system, these maps are managed and redirected through a combination of DNS entries (which cannot be avoided) and unique IIS sites are set up on each PROD server for each primary host alias (which can and should be avoided). The use of IIS features is cumbersome, and a pain to manage. Additionally, there are some patterns of aliases that exist for every Partner site (and often are the only alternate aliases), and it would be advantageous to avoid the need to define them for each one, but simply support a single pattern definition to cover them all.","In order to solve the problems noted above, UrlMatcher was developed, which the identity management system to support vanity URLs more easily and readily and with better specificity and flexibility.","The UrlMatcher is implemented as an ASP.NET HttpModule\/HttpHandler, and it is initially targeted for the CGW app site, but can be reused as needed elsewhere. The component adds support for inspecting incoming requests, matching different elements of the request (usually the URL, but also cookies, params, client IP, and the like) against pre-defined patterns (static values or regex patterns), and then taking some action, such as executing a URL rewrite, a client redirect or transfer to another page within the current site. The patterns or \u201crules\u201d may be defined in a file on disk, but may also be moved to the database so they are centrally managed and can benefit from an appropriate admin tool.","A further problem with this approach was encountered. The whole point of vanity URLs is to define a short, user-friendly symbolic name that can be appended to one of the domains owned by the operator of the identity management system, for example, www.ershield.com\/starthere or deluxe.ershield.com\/[partner], that will take the user to some predefined location or landing page that is normally more cryptic to address directly or that may change over time. One of the problems with using the UrlMatcher is getting IIS to send these URLs to the UrlMatcher in the first place. UrlMatcher is an ASP.NET component, and in order for IIS to send an incoming request to the ASP.NET subsystem, one has to define a rule in IIS6 which tells it which ISAPI Plugin (more accurately, which ISAPI Extension) should handle the request.","IIS6 supports only two different kinds of such rules\u2014file-extension matching rules or send everything rules. (II7 changes this model completely\u2014it has a much tighter and more native integration with ASP.NET to begin with and these rules are actually defined in the ASP.NET configuration for a given site.) So ASP.NET integration under IIS6 is normally implemented with the file-extension matching rule, and when ASP.NET is installed it adds many of these rules (.aspx, ashx, .asmx, .svc, and the like) to IIS6 for a given site. The problem here is that the vanity URLs do not work with these rules because there is no file extension. The other rule type \u201csend everything\u201d can be used instead\u2014it means that IIS6 will send every request it gets for the target site to ASP.NET, then the UrlMatcher will get a chance to inspect every request. However, this has a negative impact on performance since it means that requests for assets (such as images, Flash files, videos, static on-disk files, and the like) will also have to go through ASP.NET instead of being served directly by IIS.","So, the only other option that IIS6 provides is ISAPI Filters. Filters are another IIS-native component (written in C or C++)\u2014they also inspect every incoming request, but are much more lightweight (i.e., do not invoke the whole ASP.NET processing pipeline). A Filter can be written to match some pattern (such as 1-segment paths with no extension like the vanity URL format described above) and given that pattern, do something that will make IIS pass that request to ASP.NET and thus the UrlMatcher system.","Ionic's Isapi Rewrite Filter (IIRF) is an ISAPI filter. The primary purpose of IIRF is to do request URL matching and then redirect or rewrite the request. So with IIRF, vanity requests are matched, and rewritten with some extension. Then, that extension can be mapped and handled by ASP.NET, and UrlMatcher can process them.","For example, the extension \u201c.vanity\u201d is to be processed by ASP.NET:\n\n","The code and redistributable binaries for UrlMatcher may be provided in a common repository as a part of a core library.","The UrlMatcher module is preferably integrated into CGW as part of the library dependencies and configuration for the site.","IIRF needs to be installed and configured with IIS. According to the identity management system, a site-specific configuration file for CGW may be defined and included in the CGW codebase. It references an external config file that is found in the target deployment environment (e.g., DEV, QA, STAGE, PROD, and the like) that defines the environment-specific configuration.","UrlMatcher is implemented as a collection of components, that include an ASP.NET HTTP Module and HTTP Handler. The Module is a required element that must be included and configured in any site that will use UrlMatcher. The Handler is an optional component that allows usage of UrlMatcher in an alternate mode of operation, which can improve its performance and reduce its intrusion into an ASP.NET application under certain circumstances.","UrlMatcher may be made available as a set of redistributable binaries (and\/or source code) as part of a core library, which may be provided in a common repository. UrlMatcher has some dependencies on other core libraries and components for basic services like logging and templating support. A redistribution folder for UrlMatcher may be adapted to contain the necessary components including its own dependencies.","Configuring an ASP.NET Web Site\/Web App","Note, in this example, UrlMatcher has already been integrated into the identity management system CGW application.","After obtaining the necessary components described above, the components may be added to a site's \/bin folder.

If the rule test evaluation is true, then the associated \u201caction\u201d is applied, and it can be any number of things like a redirect or rewrite, or an instruction to continue evaluating the next rule, or to evaluate a sub-group of child rules.","For this particular request, there is a section of rules for PSS2- and SSS-specific vanity URLs.","After the rule file is updated, if the CGW site is already running, one needs to add an instruction to the UrlMatcher to reload the rule file. The rule file will always be reloaded from disk when the site is first started up or restarted, but if the site is already up and it is not desirable to restart it, one or more special URLs can be used to access administrative functions of the UrlMatcher, for example, as follows:\n\n","The <hostname> can be any host that resolves to that target CGW IIS instance, so, for example, www.qa.dev.ershield.local is a URL that resolves to the QA server instance\u2014the function of UrlMatcher is not affected by the choice of hostname being used as long as it resolves to the desired site.","The last URL is used to reload the matching rules if they are changed on disk, and the first URL can be used to verify that it is loaded. The second URL is helpful when authoring rules.","In one embodiment, the URL Matcher defines a rule-based mechanism to evaluate actions based on incoming Web requests and Web application context attributes.","URL Matcher Request Processing  is shown, for example, in . The URL Matcher may be implemented in any Web application platform that supports an extension mechanism to intercept or delegate Web requests. The key component of the URL Matcher is the request processor which is the integration point of the URL Matcher to its hosting Runtime (such as a Java Servlet container or the .NET Framework's ASP.NET Runtime).","The URL Matcher will accept each Web request that the hosting Runtime will resolve as destined for the Matcher component. For each request, the Matcher will resolve a Match Context (MCTX) which captures all the attributes and elements of the request and application that can be accessed by the URL Matcher.","The Matcher will iterate through its set of preconfigured Rules, testing the request against each rule in turn. Every Rule is defined by two features:\n\n","Match Tests may be defined by any of the following elements:\n\n","Match Action may be defined by any of the following elements:\n\n","The URL Matcher is configured with a collection of one or more Rule Sets, which is an ordered sequence of Rules. An initial, Top-level Rule Set represents the starting collection of Rules that all evaluations will begin with. Every Rule in a Set may optionally define its own nested Rule Set, known as a Child Rule Set. Depending on the kind of Action configured on a Rule, a successful test may invoke further evaluation of Child Rules.","When a Rule Match Test evaluates successfully (i.e. a Match is found), the Matcher will evaluate the Rule's Match Action. Depending on the action kind, the Action may allow for altering one or more attributes of the Match Context. The Match Context represents state of the request being processed and so any alterations to the Match Context by any one Rule will persist for subsequent Rule evaluations. In this way Rules may build upon Rules to produce a cumulative effect of a final transformed Match Context.","A Match Action may also support the notion of Child Rules (see Step ), which allow grouping of Rules for further, conditional evaluation. In this way, Rules and Rule Sets can define a complex hierarchy of Rules.","Lastly, a Match Action's specific operation will be invoked (see Step ). It may take an attribute of the Match Context as an argument, such as a path segment or request scheme. Additionally it may take a static or computed value as an additional argument to resolve the final operation. Finally, if the Match Action kind supports the notion of Continuation (see Step ), then after the Action is invoked, the Matcher will advance to the next Rule (see Step ) following the successfully matched Rule and continue to process the request as before. If the matched Rule is the final Rule in a Child Rule Set, then a Continuation will advance the Matcher to the parent Rule Set at the next Rule that follows the parent Rule that defined the current Child Rule Set.","However, if the matched Rule specifies an Action that does not support Continuation (see ), or the Matcher has reached the end of Rule Set, then the Matcher's processing of the current request is complete, and it will return control to the hosting Runtime from which it was invoked (see Step ).","The URL Matcher Request Processing  may comprise a series of steps as follows: Begin Request Processing ; Capture Request and Application Context; Resolve the Match Context (MCTX) ; Resolve Set of all Top-Level Rules ; Evaluate MCTX against a First Rule; Evaluate current Rule's Test against MCTX ; If the Rule Does Not Match, then Advance to the next Rule  and evaluate MCTX against the next Rule; If the Rule Does Match, then evaluate whether Action supports Context Updates ; If Action supports Context Updates, then Update MCTX against Action Attribute and Value  and go to Step ; If Action does not support Context Updates, then evaluate whether Action supports Child Rules ; If Action supports Child Rules, then Advance to first Rule in Child Set Rule , evaluate MCTX against the next Rule and go to Step ; If Action does not support Child Rules, then Invoke Action ; If Action supports Continuation , then Advance to next Rule in current Set or next Rule in parent Set , evaluate MCTX against the next Rule and go to Step ; and If Action does not support Continuation , then End Request Processing; return control to hosting Runtime .","Sample Implementation in ASP.NET and Modes of Operation is shown, for example, in . While the concept and design of the URL Matcher  is truly platform agnostic, we present a sample implementation targeting the ASP.NET Runtime of the .NET Framework.","The .NET Framework is itself hosted in a containing Web Server , such as IIS. IIS receives an incoming request from a Web client, such as a Web browser, and appropriately handed off to the ASP.NET Runtime , when the request is detected as targeting an ASP.NET resource.","Within the ASP.NET Runtime, the URL Matcher would be registered as an HTTP Module  or an HTTP Handler . In the former case, every request  will be passed to the URL Matcher to be inspected. In the latter case, only certain requests that match some pre-configured set of file extensions  will be passed to the URL Matcher. These are two modes of operation for URL Matcher on the ASP.NET Runtime:\n\n","The following table lists a set of attributes of a Match Context that are accessible when evaluating a Match Test and\/or

For example, nearly three quarters of U.S. small businesses experienced a breach attack in 2010 (source: Symantec 2010 SMB Information Protection Survey\u2014Global: June 2010). Small businesses tend to be under-resourced and overwhelmed by countless regulations. Most solution providers are focused on consultative enterprise breach solutions that are much too expensive for smaller businesses to consider. This leaves a large underserved market increasingly vulnerable and progressively more targeted by security threats.","The identity management system is adapted to include a suite of tailored, customizable security and breach solutions designed to meet a small business's evolving security requirements both before and after a breach incident. One example of such suite is EZSHIELD's SYCURITYMAX Solution, which may include one or more elements of SYCURITY Assist and\/or SYCURITY Prepare. The identity management system's breach preparation service offers assistance in creating catered breach response plans that addresses both regulation compliance and security best practices relative to an individual business's profile, enabling a business to act quickly and completely when confronted with a breach threat. With Safe Harbor, PCI, Red Flag, and HIPAA compliance in mind, the identity management system offering produces value and keeps ahead of the most critical regulatory requirements across individual small business industries.","Description of Service","Access to Assist Portal","The Assist Module may be provided as part of a customer's annual subscription. The customer's registered representative may access a secure web-based Assist Portal (\u201cPortal\u201d) 24\/7 to self-assess Customer's potential risk of exposure, create a security and privacy protection plan, and access employee training materials.","Security Score Self-assessment","This assessment will serve as a best practice evaluation in the area of Personally Identifiable Information (\u201cPII\u201d). The assessment will walk Customer through a series of questions pertaining to the policies and procedures it has in place based on Customer's industry and the PII it collects. The results of the assessment will provide Customer with a guideline to determine areas of improvement in its PII protection practices. This assessment will touch on Red Flag, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Security Standards (PCI) and EU-US Safe Harbor compliance (allowing data transfer between the United States and the European Union) needs in addition to general best practices in information security.","Security and Privacy Planning","Customer will receive access to a portfolio of various policy, procedure and process templates. These templates help the Customer ensure that appropriate levels of security are in place. Together, these various documents then serve as the Customer's working security and privacy plan.\n\n","The Security and Privacy Training portion of the Assist Module allows the Customer to educate its employees on the importance of protecting their customers and their fellow employees' personal information. \u201cSmall Business Employee Privacy Training\u201d may be provided to the Customer, for example, in the form of a PowerPoint presentation focused on Privacy and Security imperatives that employees need to know and do.

Tiers are currently evenly designated in 20% ranges (e.g., 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100). The term weight is used because certain assessment areas are deemed to have more or less impact than other areas. A higher weight indicates more impact and a lower weight indicates less impact. Using a tiered score based on a percentage allows for the number of questions and their weights to vary as necessary.","Each possible answer to a question in the assessment is given a weight. The sum of all weights is the total possible weight. The sum of weights for each answer given in the affirmative is divided by the total possible weight. The resulting percentage then is evaluated to determine into which tier the assessment results belong.","The diagram below shows how a score is calculated. This assessment has two questions. Question 1 has 4 sub questions. Question 2 has 6 sub questions. The weights for each question are shown in parenthesis. An x indicates the user responded affirmatively for that question. The Score system uses weights for sub-questions when the parent question is answered affirmatively. The weight of the parent should equal the sum of the weights of its children. The Score system uses the weight for the parent question when it is answered negatively. This latter indicates a section does not apply; therefore, it should not impact the score.\n\n","FIG. .D\u2014Data Diagram\u2014Score Calculation","Security Assist\u2014Action Plan Technical Description","An action plan is based on any assessment parent questions responded to affirmatively, and that its sub-questions responded to in the negative.

The computer implemented method may support vanity URLs. A core gateway of an identity management system may comprise the one or more programs. The one or more programs may further include instructions for: iterating through a set of preconfigured rules and testing the HTTP request against each rule in turn, wherein each rule is defined by a match test and a match action. The match test may be a description of an attribute of the match context that should be tested against. The match action may be an operation to be invoked upon a successful match test. The match test may be defined by one of an evaluation kind that determines how the test should be evaluated, an attribute of the match context to test against, and an argument value to resolve the test against. The evaluation kind may be an equality test, wherein the attribute is a URL path and wherein the argument value is a comparison value.","Although some of various drawings illustrate a number of logical stages in a particular order, stages which are not order dependent can be reordered and other stages can be combined or broken out.
