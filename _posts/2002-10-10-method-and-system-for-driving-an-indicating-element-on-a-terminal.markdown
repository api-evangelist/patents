title: Method and system for driving an indicating element on a terminal
abstract: A terminal operated at a switching facility has at least one indicating element which indicates operating modes of another terminal allocated to the indicating element. The other terminal is operated at another switching facility. Calls to the other terminal may be picked up by operating a function element, e.g., pressing a key, associated with the indicating element that indicates the operating modes of the other terminal, when an incoming call to the other terminal is indicated.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application is based on and hereby claims priority to German Application No. 101 49 983.3 filed on Oct. 10, 2001, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.","The invention relates to, among other things, a method in which a terminal is operated on a switching facility. The terminal carries at least one indicating element which indicates operating modes of a terminal associated with the indicating element. The indicating element is driven by the switching facility with the aid of signaling messages in dependence on the operating modes of the terminal associated with the indicating element.","The indicating element is, for example, a lamp or a light-emitting diode (LED). However, the indicating element can also be a particular area on a screen or on a liquid crystal display (LCD).","The switching facility may be, for example, a telecommunication system or a so-called communication server. A communication server is a switching facility on a personal computer which is connected to a gateway via a local data transmission network, e.g. via a LAN, and forms a telecommunication system in this constellation. Apart from the voice transmission functions, this platform provides the possibility of multimedia communication. A personal computer is understood to be a data processing system which is originally provided for a single user.","The terminal may be, for example, a telephone which is connected to the switching facility via a line. However, the functions of the terminal can also be produced by a computer, e.g. by a personal computer.","A method as described above may be executed, for example, during the operation of the telecommunication system of the HICOM type which is produced by SIEMENS AG. However, this method is also executed by using a communication server, i.e. by using a telecommunication system based on a personal computer. It is possible to associate the indicating element either with a terminal which is connected to the same switching facility as the terminal carrying the indicating element. As an alternative, however, the indicating element can also be associated with a so-called external terminal, i.e. a terminal which is not connected to the same switching facility. However, the indicating element is only driven when the terminal associated with the indicating element is connected to the same switching facility, i.e. the same telecommunication system.","In the immediate vicinity of the indicating element, for example next to the indicating element, there is a function key via which the terminal associated with the indicating element can be reached. It is thus possible to perform so-called abbreviated dialing via the function key to external terminals or to terminals which are connected to the same switching facility.","In addition, there is a \u201cpick-up\u201d feature for terminals which are connected to the same switching system. With this feature, the two terminals are located, for example, in the same room or in immediate hearing range with respect to the ringing tone generated by the terminals. If the terminal associated with the indicating element is called, the incoming call can be picked up at the terminal which carries the function key and the indicating element by operating the function key associated with the indicating element.","The features \u201cassociating indicating elements and function keys with terminals\u201d and \u201ccall pick-up\u201d are intensively used by many subscribers and thus have high acceptance.","Nevertheless, an object of the invention is to specify an improved method for driving an indicating element at a terminal. In addition, an associated switching facility, an associated system link-up and an associated program are to be specified.","In a method according to the invention, the terminal associated with the indicating element is operated at another switching unit. At least one operating mode message which signals the operating mode of the terminal associated with the indicating element is sent to the switching facility for operating the terminal with the indicating element. The switching facility for operating the terminal with the indicating element drives the indicating element in dependence on the operating mode message.","Using an operating mode message for signaling the operating mode of a terminal in an overlapping manner over various switching facilities is a simple option for eliminating a restriction which has hitherto been accepted, and thus for considerably improving the operating convenience.","In a development of the method according to the invention, a function element is arranged in a close spatial relationship with the indicating element, and this function element can be operated so that the terminal associated with the indicating element can be reached. The function element is, for example, a key or a button shown on a screen. In the development, an operating mode in which the terminal associated with the indicating element is called from a third terminal is indicated on the indicating element. For example, the indicating element flashes to indicate the operating mode \u201ccalled\u201d. When the function key is operated in conjunction with this operating mode being displayed, i.e. either simultaneously with the display or immediately thereafter, operations for picking up the call are performed. Picking up the call means that the calling terminal is connected to the terminal which carries the indicating element.","The development also considerably extends the range of application of the \u201ccall pick-up\u201d feature because it is now also possible to pick up a call in an overlapping manner over various switching facilities.","In a next development, the operation of picking up the call includes a call diversion of the incoming call from the terminal originally called to the terminal with the indicating element. This development makes it possible to pick up the call by utilizing a function which, in any case, is frequently already available. If necessary, only comparatively small changes need to be made to the method for call diversion previously used.","In another development of the method according to the invention, the operating mode message signals the operating mode of the terminal associated with the indicating element directly. As an alternative, however, the operating mode of the terminal associated with the indicating element is signaled indirectly by specifying an operating mode for the indicating element. This measure makes it possible to use the information about the operating mode directly for driving the indicating element.","In a next development of the method according to the invention, the operating mode message is a message according to the CSTA protocol or, respectively, according to a protocol based on the CSTA protocol. The CSTA protocol was specified by the European Computer Manufacturers' Association (ECMA) in Standard 269, \u201cServices for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA) Phase III\u201d, see, for example, the third edition of December 1998 or the fourth edition of June 2000, respectively. The CSTA standard makes it possible to link switching systems of different manufacturers in one system link-up.","In an alternative development of the method according to the invention, the operating mode message signals a number of operating modes for different terminals. This measure makes it possible to considerably reduce the number of operating mode messages to be transmitted.","In another development of the method according to the invention, a number of switching systems are connected via a data packet transmission network. The data packet transmission network is, for example, the Internet or a network operating in accordance with the Internet protocol. However, Ethernet networks are also used. Whereas data packets are transmitted connectionlessly in lower protocol layers in a data packet transmission network, connections are also set up on lower protocol layers in a circuit-switch data transmission network, for example time slots are interconnected. However, tunneling protocols make it possible to connect the two types of transmission to one another.","In a development of the method according to the invention, a central control unit is used to which, on the one hand, the operation of function keys at the terminals is signaled and which, on the other hand, generates the operating mode messages. Due to the central control unit, the individual switching systems can be configured in a simple manner, for example with comparatively little memory required and with comparatively little processor power.","The central control units generates the operating mode messages by using a call model, for example by using the call models provided in the CSTA standard. Using a call model is a simple way of noting changes in operating modes and responding to such changes.","The invention also relates to a switching facility, particularly a telecommunication system or a communication server which produces the function of a telecommunication system, the switching facility being configured in such a manner that, when it is operated, the method according to the invention or a development thereof is executed. Furthermore, the invention relates to a system link-up which contains at least two switching facilities during the operation of which the method according to the invention or a development thereof is executed. In addition, a program is invented which contains an instruction sequence during the execution of which by a processor the method according to the invention or a development thereof is executed. Accordingly, the abovementioned technical effects also apply to the switching facility, to the system link-up and to the program.","Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","12","14","16","12","14","16","667","668","670"]},"The telecommunication systems  to  are connected to a computer  via a local data transmission network , for example via an Ethernet or a data transmission network transmitting in accordance with the Internet protocol. The telecommunication systems  to  are, for example, telecommunication systems of the HICOM 150E type by SIEMENS AG. In comparison with known telecommunication systems, however, the telecommunication systems  to  have been extended by functions which make it possible to signal call modes of telephones within the link-up  without restrictions and, as a result, in particular provide for the unrestricted utilization of the \u201ccall transfer\u201d feature.","The computer  is, for example, a personal computer which contains a memory unit and a processor. In the memory unit, an application program  is stored which produces functions for the unrestricted signaling of call modes within the link-up . The functions of the application program  will become clear below by the explanations for .","In addition, the memory unit of the computer  contains a Telecommunication Application Programming Interface (TAPI)  which was programmed by MICROSOFT GmbH. Furthermore, the memory unit of the computer  contains a TSP (TAPI service provider) program  which is offered, for example, with the telecommunication systems  to , e.g. under the product name 3rd-party TSP in the case of HICOM systems. The TSP program  provides for CSTA connections between the telecommunication systems ,  and , on the one hand, and the computer , on the other hand. The TSP program  also converts CSTA commands into TAPI commands for the TAPI interface . On the other hand, TAPI commands coming from the TAPI interface  are also converted into CSTA commands. Other functions of the TSP program  will become clear in the explanation of .","The data transmission network  is also connected to a database computer , the memory of which contains a database . The database contains, among other things, information on the allocation of function keys at the telephones of the link-up  to short code destinations at which other telephones of the link-up can be reached. The application program  and the TSP program  access the database  by using a so-called DCOM interface  which has also been developed by MICROSOFT GmbH. In another exemplary embodiment, however, the database  is located in the memory unit of the computer , see dashed line , so that the DCOM interface is not required in this case.","In data transmission network , telecommunication systems ,  and  can be reached at addresses LA, LB and LC, respectively, in this order. The computer  and data-base computer  can be reached at addresses LY and LZ, respectively. In addition to the addresses LA to LZ, there are also so-called port numbers which identify a particular connection.","The telecommunication system  is connected via a subscriber line  and a line unit  to a switching center (VST)  of a public telephone network , e.g. to the circuit-switched telephone network of Deutsche Telekom AG. The switching center  is, for example, a switching center of the digital electronic switching system (EWSD) type by SIEMENS AG.","The telecommunication system  also contains a control unit  which produces the switching function. In addition, the control unit  also handles functions for signaling call modes which will become clear below by the explanations for .","The telecommunication system  is connected to a multiplicity of telephones, one telephone  of which is shown in . The telephone  can be reached by the internal call number \u201c100\u201d. The telephone  has a multiplicity of function keys, of which three function keys ,  and  are shown in . Function key  is allocated to the internal call number \u201c100\u201d, i.e. the telephone  itself. Function key  is allocated to a call number \u201c200\u201d within the link-up, by which a telephone  connected to the telecommunication system  can be reached. Function key  is associated with the call number \u201c300\u201d within the link-up, by which a telephone  connected to the telecommunication system  can be reached.","The function keys ,  and  in each case contain an LED (Light-Emitting Diode) which is used for signaling the call mode of the relevant function key ,  and , respectively. Four call modes are signaled:\n\n","For the application program  to be able to produce its functions, the telephones ,  and  and the interfaces at the telecommunication systems ,  and  are associated with model identifiers according to the CSTA Standard (\u201cServices for Computer Supported Telecommunication Applications Phase III). This standard was issued as third edition in December 1998 by the ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers' Association).
