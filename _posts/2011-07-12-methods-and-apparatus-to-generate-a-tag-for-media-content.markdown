title: Methods and apparatus to generate a tag for media content
abstract: Example methods and apparatus to generate identifying tags for media content as described herein. An example method includes obtaining an identifier value associated with at least one of audio or video of received media content by at least one of: extracting the identifier value from at least one of the audio or the video or determining the identifier value based on inherent information of at least one of the audio or the video, generating a tag including the identifier value, and storing the tag with the media content to cause the tag to be distributed to a presentation location along with the media content.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE","BACKGROUND","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["The present disclosure relates generally to identifying media content and, more particularly, to methods and apparatus to generate a tag for media content.","Media content is distributed over many different distribution channels. For example, the same media content may be distributed over a broadcast system (e.g., cable, satellite, terrestrial, etc.) and may be distributed over the internet. Media content distributed over broadcast systems is often transmitted with identifying information embedded in or otherwise associated with the media content (e.g., watermarks) so that monitoring of the exposure to the media content at presentation locations (e.g., households) can be performed. Additionally or alternatively, identifying information comprising one or more characteristics of the media content (e.g., signatures) can be collected, labeled with known identifying information, and stored prior to distribution of the media content so that the media content can be later identified by extracting the signatures at a reception site and accessing the identifying information by matching the signatures extracted at the reception site to the stored signatures.","Advances in technology result in changes to the specifications defining the use of identifying information (e.g., watermarks, signatures, codes, etc.) for media content. In other words, the particular identifying information embedded in, associated with, extracted from, and so forth from media content changes over time. Example methods, apparatus, and articles of manufacture disclosed herein generate one or more identifying tags for media content (e.g., programs or advertising).","As used herein, \u201cidentifying information\u201d includes information that is inserted in media content for the purpose of identifying the media content (e.g., watermarks, codes, etc.) and\/or includes information inherent to one or more aspects of the media content (e.g., the audio, the video, etc.) or to one or more aspects of the signal representing the media content, which inherent information identifies the media content (e.g., signatures, fingerprints, etc.). Such inherent information is not inserted for the purpose of identifying the media content.","As used herein \u201cattribute data\u201d is information that identifies media content such as, for example, a source identifier (SID), a media asset identifier (MAID), a signature value for media content, a title of the media content, an identification of a creator of the media content, a timestamp indicating when the media content was broadcast, etc. Identifying information may include attribute data. For example, a SID (attribute data) may be included in a watermark (identifying information) inserted in media content. In another example, a signature value (identifying information) generated for media content may be associated with a MAID (attribute data) in a reference database.","As used herein a \u201ctag\u201d is a string of letters and\/or numbers that are associated with media content so that the media content can be identified. In some examples, the tag includes attribute data and\/or identifying information that has been extracted from the media content. By associating a tag with media content, the processing needed to determine identifying information (e.g., extracting watermarks, generating signatures, etc.) can be performed once (e.g., prior to distribution) and the media content can be identified (e.g., after distribution) by reading the tag for the distributed media content without, for example, re-extracting the watermark, regenerating the signature, etc. Furthermore, when the tag includes identifying information or attribute data included in the identifying information, records of presentation of the media content collected using the tag can be combined with records from distribution systems that include identifying information in the media content (but do not necessarily use the tags to identify the media content).","In some examples, identifying information (e.g., watermarks embedded in the media content, signatures collected and labeled for the media content, etc.) for the media content has been previously associated with the media content. In some such examples, the identifying information can be obtained and used to generate the tag(s). The example tag(s) can be associated with media content prior to distribution (e.g., before internet media content is streamed to presentation locations (e.g., households)). For example, the tag(s) may be associated with the media content in a webpage distributing the media content, inserted in metadata of the media content (e.g., in a file containing the media content or a file associated with the file containing the media content), inserted in metadata of a stream, etc. The example tag(s) can later be extracted at presentation location(s) and analyzed to identify the media content and increment records for exposure to the media content. Where the tag(s) are generated based on identifying information used to identify the media content in other monitoring systems (e.g., watermarks or signatures used to identify the media content in a television broadcast system), media content presentation records collected using the tags may be combined with or compared to the records from the other distribution systems. In some examples, the identifying information and the tag(s) may be collected at a presentation location. The tag(s) may be compared with the identifying information to validate that the tag(s) are correct (e.g., to confirm that the tag(s) correctly identify the media content). If the format of the previously associated identifying information changes (e.g., technology developments may change the details of the watermarks, signatures, etc.), new tag(s) can be generated using the adaptable tag structure described herein.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","114","120"]},"In the example system , media content is added to a content data store . In the illustrated example, some media content is identified in a reference library of the central facility  by identifying information embedded in or otherwise broadcast with the media content (e.g., watermarks), some media content is identified in a reference library stored by the central facility  based on identifying information inherent in the program (e.g., using media content signatures), some media content is associated with identifying information to enable embedding of the identifying information (e.g., adding watermarks), and some media content is unknown. In other examples, any combination of methods for identifying media content may be used. In the illustrated example identifying information and\/or other attribute data is stored with the media content in the content data store . Alternatively, the metadata may be stored in another device linked to the content data store  and\/or linked to devices that require access to the metadata.","The content data store  may be any combination of one or more data storage devices. For example, the content data store  may be one or more databases, one or more network storage locations, one or more hard drives, one or more files, one or more extensible markup language (XML) files, any combination of the foregoing, etc. In the illustrated example, the content data store  provides media content to the media identifier tool  for tagging the media content. The example content data store  receives media content that has been associated with identifying information (e.g., watermarks, signatures, etc.) from the media identifier tool  and\/or receives tags that identify the media content from the media identifier tool . The content data store  provides media content to the content server  for distribution to presentation locations (e.g., the presentation location ).","The example media identifier tool  of  receives media content from the content data store  and analyzes the media content to generate a tag for the media content and, in some instances, to embed or otherwise associate identifying information with the media content. The media identifier tool  of the illustrated example retrieves identifying information from the central facility . In the illustrated example, the media identifier tool  includes an identity analyzer , a tag generator , and a central facility transceiver .","The example identity analyzer  of  determines that media content is available for analysis at the content data store . For example, the media content may be transmitted from the content data store  to the identity analyzer  when new content is received, at periodic or aperiodic intervals, etc. Alternatively, the identity analyzer  may periodically or aperiodically query the content data store  to determine if there is content to be analyzed (e.g., content that has not yet been tagged, content that has been tagged in error, etc.). For example, the identity analyzer  may query the content data store  for content that is not yet associated with a tag, for content identified on a list of invalid tags, etc.","The example identity analyzer  of  attempts to identify the content to be analyzed. The example identity analyzer  of  uses one or more of the following techniques to identify the media content: extracting identifying information embedded in the media content (e.g., watermarks, codes, etc.) and querying a reference database with the embedded information, determining identifying information which is inherent in the media content or portion(s) of the signal representing the media content (e.g., signatures) and querying a reference database with the characteristic data, and\/or reading identifying information and\/or attribute information input to the identity analyzer  or otherwise provided to the identity analyzer  (e.g., an XML file storing identifying information input by a user).","As used herein, the term \u201cembedded\u201d includes modifying any portion (e.g., the audio, the video, etc.) of the media content to store identifying information (e.g., by amplifying or attenuating portions of the audio portion, by shifting portions of the audio portion, by modifying a video and\/or an image portion of the media content to store identifying information (e.g., by amplifying or attenuating portions of the video portion, changing colors of portions of the video portion, etc.)).","In the illustrated example, the identity analyzer  accesses the reference database at the central facility  via the central facility transceiver  to obtain identifying information based on characteristic data representative of the media content (or part thereof) and\/or a signal (or portion thereof) representing the media content. After the identity analyzer  obtains inherent identifying information (e.g., a signature) from the media content, the identity analyzer  queries reference data using the inherent identifying information to obtain attribute data associated with (e.g., mapped to) the inherent identifying information. For example, the reference database can be generated by obtaining inherent identifying information for known media content and storing the inherent identifying information in the reference database in association with known attribute data. Alternatively, a reference database may be stored at the identity analyzer  or any other location accessible by the identity analyzer. In some examples, the identity analyzer  will not need to access the reference database when the media content has been watermarked.","In some examples, the identity analyzer  may embed (or otherwise associate) identifying information that has been input to the identity analyzer  in (or with) the media content. For example, the identity analyzer  may embed a watermark in the media content using information in a received XML file. When a watermark is embedded or associated with the media content, the media content with the watermark is transmitted to the content data store  for distribution. In addition, information about the watermark is communicated to the central facility  via the central facility transceiver . If the media content cannot be identified by any available techniques, the example identity analyzer  provides an error message to an operator of the media identifier tool  to enable or prompt manual identification.","The identity analyzer  of the illustrated example transmits the information identifying the media content to the tag generator  (e.g., information obtained from the media content, information retrieved from the central facility , information received from an operator, etc.). The information may be any combination of identifying information and\/or attribute data associated with the identifying information.","In the illustrated example, attribute data extracted from identifying information includes a 4-digit source identifier (SID), a time and date stamp, and an identifier for the type of code (e.g., an indication of whether the media content is from a network television broadcast or a cable television broadcast). Alternatively, any other identifying information and\/or attribute data may be transmitted to the tag generator  from the identity analyzer . Attribute data may include one or more of a station identifier, a channel identifier, a title, a producer, a broadcast time, a serial number, a code identifier, a signature value, website identifier, etc.","The example tag generator  of  receives identifying information and\/or attribute data for media content and generates a tag for the media content. In the illustrated example, the generated tag is a numeric string having six attribute type identifiers prefixing six attribute data elements. The example tag includes an attribute type identifier and attribute data element for each of a tag version, a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) key, a SID, a media asset ID (MAID) identifying the media content in a reference database, a code type, a time and date stamp, and a tick (duration from the start of the media content). According to the illustrated example, the attribute type identifier is a two digit number indicating what type of data follows the attribute type identifier (e.g., attribute type identifier 99 precedes 6 digits indicating the tag version).","An example generated tag and data used for generating the tag are shown in Table 1. Table 2 illustrates example attribute data from a watermark that may be extracted from the first 9 seconds of a media content file. The example watermark in Table 1 is generated from the last row of the watermark data (i.e., timestamp 788939798 that is 9 seconds into the media content file.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example tag generation"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Example Value","Attribute Type","Attribute Data"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"3","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"4"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"56pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"49pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"56pt","align":"left"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Tag Version","0.0.1","99","000001"]},{"entry":["CRC key","123456789","98","09123456789"]},{"entry":["SID","9004","02","049004"]},{"entry":["CODE type","FD","06","01"]},{"entry":["Time\/Date Stamp","788939798","03","788939798"]},{"entry":["Tick (Duration)","9","04","019"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"4","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Tag = \u201c9900000102049004060103788939798040199809123456789\u201d"}]}}]}}},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00002","num":"00002"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","pgwide":"1"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"259pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE 2"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"Example attribute data from a watermark"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"8"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"21pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"28pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"7","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"8","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["ENCODE","FILE",{},{},{},{},{},{}]},{"entry":["TS (UTC)","TIME","SID","LEVEL","TYPE","BLOCK","STRENGTH","CHANNEL"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["788939791","1","9004","FD","U","177","16","1"]},{"entry":["788939792","3","9004","FD","U","364","11","1"]},{"entry":["788939794","5","9004","FD","U","551","17","1"]},{"entry":["788939796","7","9004","FD","U","738","20","1"]},{"entry":["788939798","9","9004","FD","U","925","21","1"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"8","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"Table 3 is a description of the attribute types and structure of the example tag generation.

The API may be made available at the media identifier tool (e.g., as part of the tag generator ) or may be provided by the central facility  via the central facility transceiver .","The tag generator  of the illustrated example transmits the generated tag to the content data store  for storage of the tag in association with the media content. In some examples, the example tag generator  also transmits the tag to the central facility  via the central facility transceiver  for later comparison with tags detected at the presentation location . In some examples, the tag generator  does not transmit the tag to the central facility . For example, the central facility may not need to receive the tag because the central facility  may obtain and\/or decode the identifying information from the tag itself.","The central facility transceiver  of the illustrated example communicatively couples the media identifier tool  with the central facility . The example central facility transceiver  of  is a network communication device that is linked to the central facility by one or more networks (e.g., the internet, a local area network, a wide area network, etc.). Alternatively, the central facility transceiver  may be any other device to communicatively couple the media identifier tool  with the central facility. An example network linking the media identifier tool  with the central facility  may also link the media identifier tool  with the content data store .","The content server  of the illustrated example is communicatively coupled with the content data store  and the presentation location  to provide media content from the content data store  to the presentation location . For example, the content server  may be a web server that provides media content to the presentation location  in response to a request for the media content from the presentation location . Alternatively, the content server  may by any device for media content distribution.","For media content that has previously been associated with a tag in the content data store , the example content server  distributes the tag with the media content. In the illustrated example, the tag is inserted in a metadata field of an Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video file so that the tag is sent to the presentation location  when the Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video file is sent to the presentation location. When the presentation location  requests media content from the content server , the content server  transmits an Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video player to the presentation location . The Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video player executes at the presentation location  and requests the particular media content Adobe video file corresponding to the request from the presentation location . The content server  transmits the Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video file with the tag in the metadata to the video player. Alternatively, any other arrangement may be used. For example, the tag may be associated with the media content in a markup language file (e.g., a hypertext markup language (HTML).","The presentation location  of the illustrated example requests, receives, and presents media content. For example, the presentation location may be a household, a business, a public location, etc. Typically, the presentation location  requests media content that has been requested by a user residing at the presentation location.","The example presentation location  of  includes a media presentation device . The media presentation device  of the illustrated example is the device that requests media content from the content server  and receives and presents that media content. In the illustrated example, the media presentation device  is a personal computer executing a web browser that can make requests for media content and execute an Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video player provided by the content server . Alternatively, the media presentation device  may be any type of device such as, for example, a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile device, a cellular device, a wireless device, a television, a billboard, a projector, etc. While a single media presentation device  is shown in the illustrated example, any number or type of media presentation device(s) may be located at the presentation location .","The example presentation location  includes monitoring instructions  and a meter  to extract identifying information from presented media content and to transmit the identifying information to the central facility  for analysis.","In the illustrated example, the monitoring instructions  are computer instructions (e.g., JavaScript, JAVA, etc.) that are transmitted from the content server  to the presentation location  along with the Adobe\u00ae Flash\u00ae video player and\/or in association with the video content. The computer instructions  extract tags from media content presented at the presentation location  and transmit the tags to the central facility . In addition, the computer instructions  transmit information identifying the presentation location  to the central facility . For example, the computer instructions  may transmit an internet protocol (IP) address, a serial number, an identification stored in a cookie, or any other identifier.","In some examples, the monitoring instructions  may be transmitted to the presentation location at a time other than when the media content and\/or video player is transmitted from the content server  to the presentation location . The monitoring instructions may be implemented in any manner such as, for example, computer instructions in any instruction language, a browser toolbar or plugin, any other type of plugin for a computer, a device installed at the presentation location, etc. The monitoring instructions may transmit tags to the content server  for any media content available at the presentation location  such as, for example, media content that is received at the presentation location , media content that is presented at the presentation location , media content that is presented at the presentation location  but is not viewed or heard, media content that is stored at the presentation location , media content that is transmitted from the presentation location  to another presentation location, etc. While the example monitoring instructions  of the illustrated example transmit the tag and information identifying the presentation location  to the central facility , the monitoring instructions  may transmit any additional or alternative information such as, for example, information about trick play of the media content, information about user input, etc.","The meter  of the illustrated example analyzes media content presented at the media presentation location  to obtain identifying information and transmit the identifying information to the central facility . The example meter  obtains watermarks embedded in or otherwise associated with the media content. At least when analyzed media content does not include a watermark, the example meter  extracts signature information from the media content. The example meter  also transmits tags associated with the media content to the central facility . Because the identifying information (e.g., signatures, watermarks, etc.) are transmitted to the central facility  with the tags, the central facility can compare the information to confirm that the tags have been accurately associated with the media content (e.g., to confirm that the wrong tag has not been associated with the media content).","In the illustrated example, the meter  is implemented in software that is installed on the media presentation device  when a user of the media presentation device  joins a panel. Alternatively, the meter  may be a device that is communicatively coupled to the media presentation device , may be software that is distributed to the general public, may be software that is automatically installed on the media presentation device  without user interaction, may be software that is installed by a user of the media presentation device , etc.","While, for simplicity of illustration, a single media presentation location  is illustrated in , multiple media presentation locations will typically be present. Furthermore, while the presentation location  includes the monitoring instructions  and the meter , presentation locations may include either the monitoring instructions  or the meter . For example, a first set of media presentation  locations may include only the monitoring instructions  and a second set of media presentation locations  different from the first set may include the meter . In other examples, media presentation locations  of a panel may include the meter  and all media presentation locations  (including the media presentation locations  in the panel) may include the monitoring instructions .","The example central facility  of  communicates with the media identifier tool  to receive tags and identifying information for media content and to provide identifying information for media content to the media identifier tool . In addition the example central facility  receives identifying information for presented media content from the presentation location . The central facility  may store the identifying records in any type of data storage (e.g., a database, a log file, etc.). The example central facility  of  includes a reference database  that stores identifying information for known media content (e.g., media associated with a code or signature that has been previously associated with identifying information), a tag access database  that stores records of tags received from the presentation location , and an identifying information database  that stores records of identifying information (e.g., signatures, watermarks, etc.) received from the presentation location .","In the illustrated example, the central facility  credits presentation records based on the tags received from the media presentation location . For example, if the central facility  receives a tag identifying a particular media content by a combination of SID, timestamp, and code type, the central facility  will credit the identified media content as having been presented. The central facility  may also validate the tags when identifying information and\/or attribute data for media content is received with the tags. In other words, the central facility  compares the tags (i.e., the information represented by the tags) to other identifying information (e.g., watermarks, signatures) and\/or attribute data to identify invalid tags. For example, the central facility  may compare an SID retrieved from a tag to an SID extracted from a watermark or code embedded in or otherwise associated with the media content. In another example, the central facility  may compare a MAID retrieved from a tag to a MAID determined by querying the reference database  with a signature extracted from the media content. The example central facility stores a listing of invalid tags (e.g., in the tag access database ) to prevent those tags from being used to credit presentation records. The central facility  may also notify the content data store  that an invalid tag is being used.

For example, the order of execution of the blocks may be changed, and\/or some of the blocks described may be changed, eliminated, sub-divided, or combined. Additionally, one or more of the example processes of  may be performed sequentially and\/or in parallel by, for example, separate processing threads, processors, devices, discrete logic, circuits, etc.","Turning in detail to , initially, the identity analyzer  detects media content for tagging (block ). For example, the identity analyzer  may receive a notification or request from the content data store  or may query the content data store  for available media content. The identity analyzer  then determines if a watermark or other identifying information or attribute data is included in the media content (block ). If the identity analyzer  determines that a watermark or other identifying information or attribute data is included in the media content, control proceeds to block  and a tag is generated based on the existing watermark and\/or other identifying information and\/or attribute data, which is described below in conjunction with .","If the identity analyzer  determines that a watermark and\/or other identifying information and\/or attribute data is not included in the media content (block ), the identity analyzer  determines if identifying information has been provided for watermarking the media content (block ). For example, an XML file including an identification of the media content (e.g., by file name) and identifying information (e.g., watermark information) may be input to the identity analyzer  or similar data may be input by an operator of the identity analyzer . If the identity analyzer  determines that identifying information has been provided, control proceeds to block  to generate and associate a watermark and\/or other identifying information and\/or attribute data with the media content and to generate a tag for the watermark and\/or other identifying information and\/or attribute data, which is described in conjunction with .","If the identity analyzer  determines that identifying information has not been provided (block ), the identity analyzer determines if the media content is found in a reference library (block ). The identity analyzer  of the illustrated example generates a signature for the media content and determines if a matching signature can be found in the reference database  at the central facility  (block ). If the identity analyzer  determines that the media content is found in the reference library, control proceeds to block  to generate a tag using the identifying information from the reference library, which is described in conjunction with .","If the media content is not found in a reference library (block ), the example identity analyzer  provides an error indicating that a tag could not be generated (block ). Alternatively, the identity analyzer  could prompt an operator of the identity analyzer  to input identifying information and\/or attribute data so that a tag could be generated in a similar manner to the process described in  in which identifying information is retrieved based on a watermark associated with the media content. After providing the error (block ), the process of  terminates until additional media content for tagging is detected.","Turning to block , after block , block , or block  complete, the tag generator  transmits the generated tag to the content data store  (block ). Metadata associated with inherent information (e.g., a signature) generated in block  may also be transmitted to the content data store . Then, the process of  terminates until additional media content for tagging is detected.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0058","num":"0057"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["206","106","302","108","304","108","218"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["210","106","104","402","106","106","404","106","104","406","106","408","106","104","410","104","108","412","108","218"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0060","num":"0059"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 2","FIG. 2"],"b":["214","106","502","106","104","504","106","104","104","108","506","108","218"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0061","num":"0060"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["105","120","114","602","120","118","114","120","604","118","116","120","608","120","120"]},"When the tag substantially matches the watermark or signature information (block ), the tag may be marked as valid and\/or reporting of exposure data using that tag will continue (block ). For example, presentation of the media content may be credited based on the received tag data.","When the information in the tag does not match the watermark or signature information (block ), the tag is added to an invalid tag list (e.g., in the tag access database ) to remove the tag from exposure log data (block ). Control then returns to block  to await reception of the next tag.","In some examples, the meter  is included at a subset of all presentation locations  (e.g., a set of presentation locations  selected for a panel) and other presentation locations  do not include a meter (i.e., are not panelists) but nonetheless receive the monitoring instructions . Accordingly, the presentation locations  that include the meter  will send both identifying information (e.g., watermark, signature, etc.) and tag information to the central facility . Upon receiving the first combination of tag information and identifying information from the meter , the central facility  performs the validation described in . If a tag is identified as valid, the example central facility  records that the tag has been validated and, in the illustrated example, the validation is not performed again for that tag. If a tag is identified as invalid, the example central facility  records that the tag is invalid and, in the illustrated example, the validation is not performed again for that tag. Alternatively, validation may be performed every time a tag\/identifying information combination is received or may be performed at some interval (e.g., a random interval, a periodic interval, etc.). Accordingly, because the central facility  has recorded whether a tag is valid or invalid, when a tag is later received (e.g., a tag is received without identifying information), the central facility can determine whether the tag data should be trusted for use in reporting or should be ignored. In other words, when a tag has been marked as invalid, the media content identified (incorrectly) by the tag will not be credited as an exposure.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0065","num":"0064"},"figref":["FIG. 7","FIGS. 2-6","FIG. 7","FIG. 7"],"b":["710","710","712","714","712","710","712","714"]},"The processor  of  is coupled to a chipset , which includes a memory controller  and an input\/output (I\/O) controller .
