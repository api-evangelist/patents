In addition to the illustrative aspects, embodiments, and features described above, further aspects, embodiments, and features will become apparent by reference to the drawings and the following detailed description.","In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.","Advances in computing technologies and related technologies (e.g., visual display technology, battery technology, etc.) in recent years have greatly facilitated in the development of computing devices having increasingly smaller form factors while still maintaining exceptional processing capabilities. Examples of such mobile computing devices include, for example, laptops, Netbooks, tablet computers (i.e., \u201cslate\u201d computers), e-readers, Smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and so forth. Because of their compactness, such mobile computing devices (herein \u201ccomputing devices\u201d) are becoming much easier to share among a plurality of users. That is, due to their small form factors, such devices allow users of such devices to physically share such devices with friends, family, co-workers, clients, and so forth.","These portable computing devices, similar to their larger brethrens, are able to visually and\/or audibly present a wide variety electronic items including, for example, applications, application interfaces, content, textual documents, audio and\/or image files, electronic messages including textual, email, or audio messages, user credentials including passwords, Internet web pages, hyperlinks, and so forth (all of which will be referred to herein as \u201citems\u201d) in a wide range of formats depending on, for example, the needs of users and the types of items to be presented. There are a number of ways to format items that may be visually and\/or audibly presented through such devices.","One way to format such items (e.g., applications such as gaming, productivity, or communication applications, audio or image files, textual documents, web pages, communication messages, and so forth) is to directly format the items themselves. For example, items such as textual documents including word processing documents and email messages may be formatted to be presented in a wide variety of font styles and font sizes depending on, for example, the particular needs of users (e.g. elderly users with poor vision and\/or hearing, or have unsteady fingers and have difficulty using, for example, a touchscreen). Another way to format such items is to configure a user interface (e.g., a display monitor and\/or speakers) that is used to visually and\/or audibly present the items (e.g., applications and content) in particular ways so that items that are presented through the user interface are presented in appropriate form. For example, a display monitor may be configured in a particular way so that one or more items (e.g., video files) that are to be displayed through the display monitor may be displayed through a screen having certain brightness and color background that may be, for example, desired by the end user.","By properly formatting the items that may be presented through a portable computing device, the needs of an end user who is consuming (e.g., viewing and\/or listening) the formatted items may be best satisfied (note that \u201cthe needs of the end user\u201d may be the actual needs or preferences of the end user or the needs of a third party as to how the items should be formatted when presented to the end user). Unfortunately when such portable computing device are shared amongst a plurality of users having varying formatting requirements or needs, it may be difficult to correctly or properly format items which may be presented through such a device. For example, suppose a primary user (e.g., an owner) of a mobile computing device wants to show a particular electronic document being displayed through her computing device to a group of friends by handing-off the computing device to the group of friends. Prior to being passed-off to the group of friends, the electronic document may have been presented to the primary user in a particular format (e.g., particular font style or size, brightness, color, audio volume, etc.) that met the needs of the primary user. Unfortunately the original format of the electronic document (the format of the electronic document as the electronic document was being presented to the primary user) may not be the most appropriate or may not meet the needs of the group of friends who are being handed the portable computing device. There are also countless other situations, some of which will be described herein, where a mobile computing device (e.g., a tablet computer, an e-reader, a Smartphone, a laptop, and so forth) may be shared between a plurality of users having differing formatting needs and requirements","In accordance with various embodiments, computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture are provided that can automatically determine which of a plurality of users detected in proximate vicinity of a computing device that is designed for presenting one or more electronic items has primary control of the computing device; ascertaining one or more formats for formatting the one or more items based, at least in part, on determining which of the plurality of users has primary control of the computing device; and presenting through the computing device the one or more electronic items in the one or more particular formats. In various embodiments, such computationally implemented methods, systems, and articles of manufacture may be implemented at the computing device. Note that although the \u201ccomputing device\u201d to be described herein will be described\/illustrated as being a tablet computer, in alternative embodiments, a computing device may take on other form factors including a variety of other types of portable\/mobile computing devices including, for example, a Smartphone, a laptop computer, a Netbook, an e-reader, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and so forth.","Referring now to  illustrating a computing device * in the form of a tablet computer in accordance with various embodiments.

In particular, and as will be further described herein, illustrates a computing device \u2032 that is the \u201chardwired\u201d or \u201chard\u201d implementation of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules including a primary control determining module \u2032, a format ascertaining module \u2032, and a particular formatted item presenting module \u2032 are implemented using purely hardware or circuitry components (e.g., application specific integrated circuit or ASIC). In contrast, illustrates a computing device \u2033 that is the \u201csoft\u201d implementation of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules including a primary control determining module \u2033, a format ascertaining module \u2033, and a particular formatted item presenting module \u2033 are implemented using electronic circuitry such as one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors, controllers, etc.) executing one or more programming instructions (e.g., software).","Note that the embodiments of the computing device * illustrated in and are two extreme or opposite versions\/implementations of the computing device * of  in which certain logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the format ascertaining module *, and the particular formatted item presenting module *) are implemented using purely \u201chardware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using circuitry such as ASIC) as illustrated in , or using purely \u201csoftware solutions\u201d (e.g., implemented using software executed by hardware such as one or more processors) as illustrated in . That is, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the computing device * or at least the logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the format ascertaining module *, and the particular formatted item presenting module *) illustrated in and , , , and may be implemented using essentially any combination of hardware and software solutions. Since, there are many ways of combining hardware, software, and\/or firmware in order to implement the various logic modules (e.g., the primary control determining module *, the format ascertaining module *, and the particular formatted item presenting module *), only the two extreme implementations illustrated in and (e.g., the purely hardware solution as illustrated in and the software solution of ) are illustrated here. It should be noted here that with respect to the \u201csoft\u201d implementation illustrated in , hardware such as one or more processors  are still needed in order to execute the software. Further details related to the two implementations of computing device * illustrated in and will be provided in greater detail below.","Various techniques may be employed in order to detect presence of users * in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. For example, in some cases, a facial recognition system or software (e.g., facial recognition application  of and ) in combination with visual data provided by one or more image capturing devices  (e.g., webcams and\/or digital cameras) may be employed in order to detect whether the faces of one or more users * are in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. Alternatively or additionally, a voice recognition system or software (e.g., voice recognition application  of and ) in combination with audio data provided by one or more audio capturing devices  (e.g., microphones) may be employed in order to detect whether the voices of one or more users * are originating from the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. In still other cases, movement data provided by one or more movement sensors  may additionally or alternatively be used in order to detect whether the computing device * is exhibiting one or more movements (e.g., a heart or pulse rate, or particular gestural movements that have been transferred to the computing device * by being in contact with a particular user * and that is only known to the particular user *) that is determined to be associated with one or more users *(e.g., detection of such signature movements may at least infer that the computing device * is in physical contact with the one or more users *). As alluded to above, in some cases, data from a variety of sensors  (e.g., movement sensors , image capturing devices  and\/or audio capturing devices ) may be employed in order to determine whether one or more users * are in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *.","If the computing device *, or the logic endowed with the computing device *, determines that a plurality of users * are in the proximate vicinity (e.g., the immediate users around the computing device such as within ten feet, six feet, three feet, two feet, and so forth) of the computing device *, then that computing device * may be designed to determine which of the plurality of users * determined to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device *. In some embodiments, such a determination may be automatically executed whenever the computing device *(or its endowed logic) detects that there are a plurality of users * in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *. In some alternative embodiments, and as will be described below, the determination as to which of a plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * may be automatically done whenever a user *(e.g., who may be a primary user or a secondary user having inferior access rights than the primary user) is detected relinquishing primary control of the computing device *. In various embodiments, the \u201cproximate vicinity\u201d of the computing device * may be the immediate area surrounding the computing device * from which a user * may access (e.g., hear, see, use, manipulate, modify, and so forth) one or more items (e.g., electronic files or documents, software applications, audio or image files, passwords, and so forth) through the computing device *.","As will be further described herein, the determination as to which users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has \u201cprimary control\u201d of the computing device * may be accomplished in a number of different ways in various alternative embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the determination as to which users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * may involve at least initially detecting or determining the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users * with respect to the computing device *. In some cases, this may mean detecting the specific spatial locations of certain features such as the faces or eyes of each of the plurality of the users * with respect to the computing device * or with respect to the specific orientation of the computing device *. That is, typically those users * detected as being on the backside (see ) of the computing device * can be discounted as having primary control when determining which users * has primary control of the computing device * since users * who are determined to be on the backside of the computing device * will have limited access at least to the display device . Thus, a strong inference may be made that those users * detected as being on the back-side of the computing device * will not have primary control of the computing device *.","In various embodiments, the determination of the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users *(e.g., specific spatial locations of the faces or eyes of the plurality of users *) may be based on visual data provided by one or more image capturing devices  and\/or based on audio data provided by one or more audio capturing devices . By employing, for example, parallax techniques, and based on data provided by, for example, one or more image capturing devices  (providing image data from different angles) the specific spatial locations of each of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * may be determined at least with respect to the computing device *(e.g., determined relative to the specific spatial location of the computing device *). In some embodiments, the computing device * may employ multiple image capturing devices  and\/or multiple audio capturing devices  in order to more accurately determine the specific spatial locations of each of the detected users *(e.g., parallax techniques for determining distances typically require a minimum of two different lines of sight) relative to the location of the computing device *. Thus, more accurate results may be obtained by using data provided by multiple sensors  (e.g., multiple image capturing devices ).","After the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) determines the specific spatial locations of each of the plurality of users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device *, a determination may be made by the computing device * as to which of the detected users * detected in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * has primary control of the computing device * based on the specific spatial locations of the plurality of users *. In order to make such a determination (e.g., which detected user * has \u201cprimary control\u201d of the computing device *), in some embodiments, the computing device * may be designed to determine which user * detected to be in the proximate vicinity of the computing device * is actually nearest or closest to the computing device *. More particularly, in some cases, the computing device *(or the endowed logic) may be designed to determine which of the plurality of users * is nearest to the front-side (or the display device ) of the computing device *. In various embodiments, those users * determined to be nearest to the computing device * or at least to the front-side of the computing device * may be determined to have primary control of the computing device *. Of course, in many cases, particularly in situations where a plurality of users * are in close quarters with the computing device *, it may be difficult to determine which of the users * is actually closest or nearest to the computing device *. For these situations, the determination as to which user * is nearest to the computing device * may be based on a determination as which user's particular physical features (e.g., a face or eyes) is nearest to, for example, the front-side of the computing device * or is located closest to the center  or center axis of the front-side of the computing device *.","In some embodiments, in order to determine which user * has primary control of the computing device *, the computing device *(or at least the logic endowed with the computing device *) may be additionally or alternatively designed to determine which of the plurality of users * is or are spatially located principally on the front-side of the computing device *. For these embodiments, the computing device * may be designed to determine which of the plurality of users *(e.g., determine which of the eyes or faces of the plurality of users *) is or are located centered on the front-side or spatially centered closest to the center  (or center axis ) of the front-side of the computing device *.

Hence, there are several possible vehicles by which the processes and\/or devices and\/or other technologies described herein may be effected, none of which is inherently superior to the other in that any vehicle to be utilized is a choice dependent upon the context in which the vehicle will be deployed and the specific concerns (e.g., speed, flexibility, or predictability) of the implementer, any of which may vary. Those skilled in the art will recognize that optical aspects of implementations will typically employ optically-oriented hardware, software, and or firmware in one or more machines or articles of manufacture.","The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and\/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and\/or examples contain one or more functions and\/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and\/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, can be equivalently implemented in integrated circuitry, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (e.g., as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and\/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Video Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and\/or an analog communication medium (e.g., a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.).","In a general sense, those skilled in the art will recognize that the various aspects described herein which can be implemented, individually and\/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or any combination thereof can be viewed as being composed of various types of \u201celectrical circuitry.\u201d Consequently, as used herein \u201celectrical circuitry\u201d includes, but is not limited to, electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, electrical circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes and\/or devices described herein), electrical circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), and\/or electrical circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment). Those having skill in the art will recognize that the subject matter described herein may be implemented in an analog or digital fashion or some combination thereof.","Those having skill in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and\/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and\/or processes into data processing systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and\/or processes described herein can be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and\/or control systems including feedback loops and control motors (e.g., feedback for sensing position and\/or velocity; control motors for moving and\/or adjusting components and\/or quantities). A typical data processing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those typically found in data computing\/communication and\/or network computing\/communication systems.","The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures can be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively \u201cassociated\u201d such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as \u201cassociated with\u201d each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably connected\u201d, or \u201coperably coupled\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated can also be viewed as being \u201coperably couplable\u201d, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and\/or physically interacting components and\/or wirelessly interactable and\/or wirelessly interacting components and\/or logically interacting and\/or logically interactable components.","While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true spirit and scope of the subject matter described herein. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the invention is defined by the appended claims.","It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as \u201copen\u201d terms (e.g., the term \u201cincluding\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d the term \u201chaving\u201d should be interpreted as \u201chaving at least,\u201d the term \u201cincludes\u201d should be interpreted as \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases \u201cat least one\u201d and \u201cone or more\u201d to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to inventions containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases \u201cone or more\u201d or \u201cat least one\u201d and indefinite articles such as \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d (e.g., \u201ca\u201d and\/or \u201can\u201d should typically be interpreted to mean \u201cat least one\u201d or \u201cone or more\u201d); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations.","In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of \u201ctwo recitations,\u201d without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, and C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, and C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.).","In those instances where a convention analogous to \u201cat least one of A, B, or C, etc.\u201d is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., \u201ca system having at least one of A, B, or C\u201d would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and\/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and\/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase \u201cA or B\u201d will be understood to include the possibilities of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d or \u201cA and B.\u201d"],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":"10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0023"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["a ","a","b","c "],"b":["200","20","20","20","10"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0024"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"i":["b ","d ","e ","f.
