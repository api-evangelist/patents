A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client-server relationship to each other.","One or more features or steps of the disclosed embodiments can be implemented using an Application Programming Interface (API). An API can define on or more parameters that are passed between a calling application and other software code (e.g., an operating system, library routine, function) that provides a service, that provides data, or that performs an operation or a computation.","The API can be implemented as one or more calls in program code that send or receive one or more parameters through a parameter list or other structure based on a call convention defined in an API specification document. A parameter can be a constant, a key, a data structure, an object, an object class, a variable, a data type, a pointer, an array, a list, or another call. API calls and parameters can be implemented in any programming language. The programming language can define the vocabulary and calling convention that a programmer will employ to access functions supporting the API.","In some implementations, an API call can report to an application the capabilities of a device running the application, such as input capability, output capability, processing capability, power capability, communications capability, etc.","A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made. For example, many of the examples presented in this document were presented in the context of an ebook. The systems and techniques presented herein are also applicable to other electronic text such as electronic newspaper, electronic magazine, electronic documents etc. Elements of one or more implementations may be combined, deleted, modified, or supplemented to form further implementations. As yet another example, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results. In addition, other steps may be provided, or steps may be eliminated, from the described flows, and other components may be added to, or removed from, the described systems. Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the following claims."],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":"FIG. 1A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 1B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0014","num":"0013"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":"FIGS. 3B and 3C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 3D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0018","num":"0017"},"figref":"FIG. 4A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 4B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 4C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIGS. 4D and 4E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 5"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 6"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIGS. 7A and 7B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0025","num":"0024"},"figref":"FIG. 7C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 7D"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":"FIG. 7E"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":"FIG. 7F"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 8A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 8B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 8C"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 9A"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0033","num":"0032"},"figref":"FIG. 9B"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 10"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 11"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0036","num":"0035"},"figref":"FIG. 12"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 13"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
