{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND","SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["People traveling away from their home often desire to utilize computer-related services while away from home (e.g., using a laptop computer or other computer-related device). For example, travelers may utilize an accompanying laptop computer that can provide access to applications and typically allows them to connect to a network or the Internet. It is not unusual to see a coffee shop with several patrons accessing the shop's wireless access point (WAP) to connect to a network or the Internet. Further, some locations provide computers for use by travelers or patrons, such as an airport computer kiosks or Internet cafes, where a user can utilize a computer to access a network or the Internet. Inherently, when one utilizes a foreign (e.g., not at home or a trusted site) WAP or terminal to access the Internet they are connecting through an untrusted network (e.g., not a trusted network set up and controlled by the user).","This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.","Data that is sent and received over an untrusted network, such as a public access point in a hotel or airport, can be sniffed (e.g., detected and intercepted) by malicious users (e.g., hackers, identity thieves). Further, malicious techniques, such as wardriving (e.g., driving around searching for wireless access points (WAPs) using a computing device) can be used to sniff and steal data over an insecure network.","Typically, individuals that access the Internet or send information from their home computers (or some other trusted device) use secure networks that they trust (e.g., have set up a prior trusted relationship with). However, users often travel away from their trusted computers (e.g., or set of trusted computers, such as home, work, etc.) and wish to access online services while away. For example, while at an airport a business traveler may wish to access their email from the company's enterprise network email server. However, in this example, using a public kiosk computer (e.g., or public wireless access point (WAP) to access their email presents a situation where potentially sensitive data may be sent over an untrusted network.","Current and prior solutions to creating a secure online network connection using an untrusted network connection include virtual privacy networks (VPNs). However, VPNs typically require one to install a VPN client on the machine that will be used to connect to the VPN, such as a laptop used to connect to a corporate VPN. Further, VPNs typically comprise one or more remote computers connecting (through the VPN) to a single network point for accessing data or online activities.","Techniques and systems are disclosed herein that allow an individual to create an ad hoc VPN, for example, using a portable storage device. For example, a user may be able to set up a secure connection between a computing device (e.g., laptop, computer terminal, smart phone\/device, etc.) that they take with them (e.g., remotely) and a trusted computing device (e.g., a home or work PC) that utilizes a trusted connection to a network. In this way, for example, a VPN client does not need to be installed on the remote machine, and the user may connect to one of a plurality of trusted computers set up by the user.","In one embodiment, a secure online environment can be created for a computing device connected to an untrusted network, by connecting to a trusted computing device connected to a trusted network. A proxy server can be installed on a first computing device (e.g., a home PC), from a set of trusted computing devices that use one or more trusted networks (e.g., secure connections with trusted ISPs) for online access. Further, one or more encryption keys, such as asymmetric or symmetric keys, can be generated for the first computing device and a portable storage device. When a user is away from their trusted computing devices, for example, contact with the first computing device can be initiated from a second computing device (e.g., laptop connected to a wireless access point (WAP)) that accesses an untrusted network (WAP), where a proxy server protocol is initiated from the portable storage device, using the second computing device, over the untrusted network. Additionally, a secure connection can be created between the second computing device and the first computing device using the shared encryption keys, such as by using symmetric keys to exchange data.","To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects, advantages, and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.","The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.","A method may be devised that provides data security to a user who may be attempting to send or receive data over an untrusted network. Where a user has one or more trusted computers connected to one or more trusted networks, in locations remote from the user's current location (e.g., the user is in a first location and the trusted computers are in a second location), a trusted computer can be utilized to provide data security, for example, when the user is attempting access the Internet over the untrusted network.","As an example, in  illustrates an exemplary environment  where a remote device , such as a user's laptop at a coffee shop, a smart phone at a hotel, and a computer terminal at an airport kiosk, may be connected to the Internet  over an untrusted network . In this example, an untrusted network may be one that has not been set up by the user of the device . Untrusted networks, such as a wireless access point in a public location, may be subject to malicious users  sniffing and retrieving data  sent over the network , either to or from the device  connected to the untrusted network .","In one embodiment, the device itself may also be an untrusted device, such as a public terminal accessing a public network (e.g., at an airport kiosk, public library, hotel business lounge, or Internet caf\u00e9), for example. In this embodiment, a malicious user  may be able to monitor activities of a user of the device , and\/or attempt to retrieve data  sent over the untrusted network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","200","202","204"]},"In one embodiment, setting up the proxy server on a trusted device may allow the trusted device to act as a go between for data requests sent from a connected client, such as requests for information from the Internet. For example, in , a user may employ a set of trusted devices  that are connected to the Internet  over trusted network connections . In this example, a proxy server can be set up on one or more of the trusted devices , such that they can act as go betweens for a client (e.g., a device ) wishing to connect to the Internet .","At , shared encryption keys can be generated for the first computing device and a portable storage device. Where encryption keys allow connected computing devices to communicate using encrypted data, for example, these shared keys can be generated and stored in a trusted computer connected to a trusted network (e.g., the first computing device) and a portable storage device (e.g., a USB flash drive, SIM card, or SD flash memory card) by connecting the storage device to the trusted computer.","In one embodiment, the shared encryption keys may comprise public keys from an asymmetric encryption key pair, where a public-private key pair is generated for the first computing device, for example, or from the portable storage device. In this embodiment, the private key can be stored on the first computing device, and the public key can be written to (stored on) the portable storage device (shared). In another embodiment, the encryption keys may comprise symmetric encryption keys, where the keys (e.g., encryption and decryption keys) may represent a shared secret between the first computing device and the portable storage device used to encrypt and decrypt data. In one embodiment, using shared encryption keys may allow a shared one-time password (e.g., a nonce) to be created, where the shared one-time password can be a shared secret between connected devices to create a secure environment.","At , in the exemplary method , a second computing device, which accesses an untrusted network, contacts the first computing device. Contacting the first computing device comprises initiating a proxy server protocol from the portable storage device using the second computing device, over the untrusted network, at . For example, a user may take their wireless enabled laptop to a wireless hotspot (e.g., location that provides access to a public wireless network for online access), wishing to connect to the Internet over using a wireless access point (WAP) at the hotspot.","In one embodiment, the user may connect the portable storage device to their laptop, for example. In this embodiment, the portable storage device can initiate the proxy server protocol, allowing the laptop to connect the first computing device, such as their home PC, which can act as a proxy server for the laptop to communicate online. In one embodiment, initiating the proxy server protocol may allow the laptop, for example, to connect to their home PC using secure hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTPS). In another embodiment, the proxy server protocol may utilize IPSec, such as for a secure enterprise connection, or IPV6, such as where the second computing device may be a smart phone.","I will be appreciated that proxying between devices is not limited to any particular protocol, thereby allowing different networks to be utilized. For example, while HTTPS may not be ideal for efficiency reasons, most firewalls allow use of this protocol for proxying data. Therefore, it can be used effectively for secure connectivity. However, the techniques and systems, described herein, are not limited any particular protocol for proxying, and those skilled in the art may devise alternate protocols for this purpose.","It will be further appreciated that, while the embodiments described above describe using the second computing device to contact the first computing device in a client-server relationship, the techniques described herein are not limited to these embodiments. It is anticipated that those skilled in the art may devise alternate techniques for the proxying relationship. For example, a plurality of devices (e.g., home PC, work PC, personal laptop, etc.) may be utilized as trusted proxy machines to create a kind of trusted group of machines. In one embodiment, any device in the group may use any other device in the group as a proxy, for example, allowing many devices to connect through any one or more of many other devices.","At , a secure connection (e.g., a secure tunnel) can be created between the second computing device and the first computing device using the shared encryption keys. In one embodiment, an encryption key exchange can take place between the first computing device and the portable storage device. For example, because the portable storage device and the first computing device have already setup a trust relationship, such as in described  above, exchanging the keys can result in creation of a secure tunnel between the first and second computing devices. In this embodiment, exchanging keys can allow data transferred between the devices to be encrypted, thereby mitigating a potential malicious user from utilizing data they may have stolen from the untrusted network, for example. In another embodiment, exchanging the keys may allow for a onetime password (e.g., a nonce) to be created that can be used as a shared secret between the trusted devices, thereby creating a secure connection.","Having created a secure connection between the second computing device and the first computing device, the exemplary method ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0032","num":"0031"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","302","304"]},"At , a proxy server can be installed on the trusted machine from the portable storage device. In this embodiment, the portable storage device may be a USB flash drive, for example, that comprises the applications and data needed to set up trusted devices for use as secure proxies. The trusted device can be set up as a proxy server to act as a go between for a second device (e.g., laptop, mobile phone, etc.) using an untrusted network and the Internet, for example.","At , encryption keys can be generated for the trusted device and the portable storage device. Typically, in order to provide for encryption of data transferred between devices one or more shared encryption keys are generated and installed on the respective devices. In this embodiment, public and private asymmetric encryption keys can be generated, where respective devices store a private key, at , and a corresponding (paired) public key is stored (shared) on the other device, at .","For example, an encryption key pair is generated for the trusted device; the private key is stored in the trusted device and the public key is written to the portable storage device. Further, in this example, an encryption key pair is generated for the portable storage device; the private key is stored on the portable storage device, and the public key is written to the trusted device. This allows respective devices to send encrypted data to each other using the public key, and have the data decrypted by the receiving device using the corresponding private key. In this way, merely those that have the private key can decrypt data sent over the untrusted network, thereby mitigating malicious users from using stolen data.","At , in this embodiment , after the proxy server has been installed and encryption keys generated, the trusted machine is set up to act as a secure proxy, so the portable storage device can be uncoupled from the trusted machine. Often, an individual may have more than one computer that they trust, such as a work and home computer, and computers located in other trusted locations. In this embodiment, at , if a user has another trusted device the portable storage device can be coupled with that trusted machine, at , to set it up as a secure proxy machine, for example. Otherwise, if the user has no more trusted computing devices available, the exemplary embodiment  of the method ends at .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0037","num":"0036"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["400","400","402"]},"For example, as illustrated in , the user may wish to use a computing device  to remotely (e.g., while away from a trusted computer or trusted network) connect to the Internet  over an untrusted network , such as using a wirelessly enabled laptop or smart phone\/device at a public WAP, or a public computer. In this embodiment, for example, the user may plug a USB flash memory drive into the laptop or public computer, or a SIM card or SD card into the smart phone\/device.","At , if the user has set up more than one trusted machine to act as a proxy server, such as in , , they may choose to connect to a centralized redirecting site, at . In one embodiment, the centralized redirecting site may be an Internet-based web-site that users can associate a group of \u201ctrusted\u201d machines with, for example, by registering the machine locations and other specifications, such as IP addresses. In another embodiment, the centralized redirecting site may be an application running on a network that a user can connect to online, which comprises information about a user's group of trusted machines. As an example, in , , a user may have set up a plurality of trusted computers  that utilize trusted networks  to connect to the Internet.","At , the centralized redirecting site can locate a desired trusted machine, for example, from a set of trusted computing devices that were previously setup by the user to be proxy servers. In one embodiment, a \u201cdesired\u201d machine may comprise one that has a desired (e.g., fastest) connection speed to the remote machine that the user is using to connect to the centralized redirecting site. Further, a \u201cdesired\u201d machine may comprise one that is \u201cclosest\u201d in proximity (e.g., geographically, or by number of hops between nodes in a connection network) to the remote machine. Additionally, the \u201cdesired\u201d machine may comprise one that has particular programs, files, security protocols, or some combination of these elements, connection speed and proximity. In one embodiment, the user may be able to preselect preferences for locating \u201cdesired\u201d machines, and\/or may select them on-the-fly upon connection to the centralized redirecting site.","At , contact with the trusted computing device, which is connected to a trusted network, is initiated. In one embodiment, if the user has merely one trusted machine set up as a proxy server, at , or they choose a particular machine, for example, the contact may be initiated with that machine, over the untrusted network. In another embodiment, a connection from the remote machine to the desired trusted machine is redirected from the centralized redirecting site to the trusted machine, over the untrusted network.","The proxy server protocol is initiated from the portable storage device, which is connected to the remote machine of the user, at . In this way, in one embodiment, traffic between the remote machine connected to the trusted machine over the untrusted network can be filtered according to the proxy server protocol. In this embodiment , at , a secure connection is established between the remote machine and the trusted machine over the untrusted network, using a three-way secure socket layer (SSL) (e.g., often called transport layer security (TLS) handshake.","For example, the portable storage device and the trusted machine already have a trust relationship established when the trusted machine was set up to be a proxy server, such as in , . The portable device attached to the remote machine can initiate the proxy server protocol, which corresponds to the proxy server set up on the trusted machine, using the remote machine. In this way, a handshake can occur between the portable device, remote machine, and trusted machine using the proxy server protocol to establish a connection.","In one embodiment, when a request is made by the remote machine over the untrusted network, such as sending data to a website, the request can be encrypted using the shared encryption key on the portable device and sent to the trusted machine over the untrusted network. Because the trusted machine shares the encryption key, it can decrypt the request, thereby creating a secure connection between the remote and trusted machine over an untrusted network.","In one aspect, a first computing device that is set up as a proxy server for a second computing device can be used to proxy data traffic to and from online services and sites (e.g., the Internet), for example. In this way, data traffic for the second computing device that is connected to an untrusted network can be proxied through the first computing device that is connected to a trusted network.","In one embodiment, in this aspect, outbound data traffic from the second computing device can be encrypted and sent over the untrusted network, where is it is proxied through the first computing device, decrypted, and sent to the trusted network. Further, inbound data traffic for the second computing device from the trusted network can be proxied through the first computing device, encrypted, and sent to the second computing device over the untrusted network. In this way, for example, data that may be sent to and from the Internet (e.g., such as a transaction on a merchant website) is encrypted when sent over the untrusted network.","In one embodiment, proxying data traffic can comprise routing data traffic by proxying an application layer protocol from an Internet protocol suite (TCP\/IP). In TCP\/IP, an application layer comprises methods and protocols for process-to-process communications using an internet protocol (IP) network to establish connections between machines. In one example, the proxy server can route traffic, as appropriate, by proxying at a hyper-text transfer protocol (HTTP) layer for the application layer.","In another embodiment, proxying data traffic can comprise routing data traffic by proxying a transport layer protocol from the Internet protocol suite (TCP\/IP). The transport layer is responsible for encapsulating application data, such as from the application layer, into data packets for transport to a network structure that may then transmit them to a destination host machine. In one example, the proxy server can route traffic, as appropriate, by proxying at a transmission control protocol (TCP) layer for the transport layer.","In another embodiment, the portable storage device (e.g., a USB flash-drive) may be set up to make itself appear as a network connection to the second computing device (e.g., laptop used at a wireless hotspot). In this embodiment, the second computing device, for example, may not need a client device to connect to the network, it can use the network connection from the portable storage device. As another example, one or more applications, which have been setup to recognize the proxying relationship between the devices, may communicate directly with the portable storage device, knowing that is a proxied network.","A system may be devised that allows a user to securely interact with an online environment, such as the Internet or an enterprise network, while connected to an untrusted network, such as a public wireless access point (WAP), or a public computer terminal (e.g., at an airport kiosk).  is a component block diagram of an exemplary system  for creating a secure online environment for a computing device connected to an untrusted network using a trusted computing device connected to a trusted network.","The exemplary system  comprises a proxy server installer  that is configured to install a proxy server on a first computing device . The first computing device  is from a set of trusted computing devices that use one or more trusted networks for network access. In one embodiment, the set of trusted computing devices can comprise one or more computers that are trusted by the user, for example, being set up and\/or maintain by a trusted source so that malicious attacks are mitigated. Further, the set of trusted computers connect to a network that is also trusted by the user, where security for mitigating malicious attacks is maintained, for example.","The exemplary system  further comprises an encryption key generator  that is configured to generate one or more shared encryption keys for the first computing device  and a portable storage device . For example, the encryption key generator  can generate a shared encryption key that may be stored on a user's trusted computer and a USB flash drive, so that data traffic between the trusted computer and the flash drive can be encrypted and decrypted by the respective devices.","One embodiment of a shared encryption key may include a public and private asymmetric key pair, where a public-private key pair is generated for respective devices, such as the trusted computer and the flash drive, and a public key is shared with the respective other device (e.g., the flash drive gets the trusted computer's public key and vice-versa). Another embodiment of a shared encryption key may include a symmetric key. A symmetric key is written to both devices, for example, such as to the trusted computer and flash drive. Data traffic is encrypted and decrypted using the symmetric key, for example, where a onetime password (e.g., nonce) is generated as a shared secret, to allow for a secure trust relationship to be established between devices.","The exemplary system  further comprises a secure connection generator  disposed on the portable storage device . The secure connection generator  is configured to initiate contact with the first computing device  from a second computing device  over an untrusted network  using a proxy server protocol. The secure connection generator  comprises a proxy server initiator  that is configured to initiate a proxy server protocol from the portable storage device  using the connected second computing device , where the second computing device accesses the untrusted network .","In this way, in one embodiment, the portable storage device  can be attached to the second computing device , and the proxy server initiator  can initiate the proxy server protocol after the secure connection generator  has contacted the first computing device  over the untrusted network . As an example, the untrusted network  may comprise a public wireless access point (WAP) that connects to the Internet . In this example, the secure connection generator  can use the second computing device  to connect to the first computing device  over the Internet , using the untrusted network .","The secure connection generator  is further configured to create a secure connection between the second computing device  and the first computing device  using the encryption keys over the untrusted network . In one embodiment, the secure connection generator  can initiate an SSL three-way handshake with between the second computing device  and the first computing device  (and the storage device ) using the proxy server protocol initiated by the proxy server initiator .","As an example, because the portable storage device  and first computing device  have shared encryption keys, comprising a pre-existing trust relationship, a secure connection can be established by encrypting data traffic between the connected computers  and  over the untrusted network . In this way, in one embodiment, the new created secure connection between the second computing device  and the first computing device  can be used to proxy data traffic, such as Internet requests, for the second computing device that is using the untrusted network  through the first computing device  that is using the trusted network . In this embodiment, for example, Internet data requests can be transported to and from the Internet  over the trusted network , to the trusted machine , and be transported to and from the second computer  in an encrypted form.","In another embodiment, the storage device  may comprise a wireless communications component (e.g., a wireless antenna), for example, for communicating over a wireless network. In this embodiment, the second computing device  can utilize the storage device  as a network adaptor. In this way, for example, the storage device  can proxy data traffic for the secure connection through the trusted network .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0059","num":"0058"},"figref":"FIG. 6","b":["600","600","514","504","506","516"]},"In this way, for example, the portable storage device can be attached to respective computers , , and  (e.g., the first computing device) in a set of computing devices trusted by the user, and using trusted connections to connect to a network, such as the Internet , and used to install a proxy server on the computers , , and .
