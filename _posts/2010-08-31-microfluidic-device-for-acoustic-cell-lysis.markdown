title: Microfluidic device for acoustic cell lysis
abstract: A microfluidic acoustic-based cell lysing device that can be integrated with on-chip nucleic acid extraction. Using a bulk acoustic wave (BAW) transducer array, acoustic waves can be coupled into microfluidic cartridges resulting in the lysis of cells contained therein by localized acoustic pressure. Cellular materials can then be extracted from the lysed cells. For example, nucleic acids can be extracted from the lysate using silica-based sol-gel filled microchannels, nucleic acid binding magnetic beads, or Nafion-coated electrodes. Integration of cell lysis and nucleic acid extraction on-chip enables a small, portable system that allows for rapid analysis in the field.

DE-AC04-94AL85000 awarded by the U. S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates to the lysis of biological cells and, in particular, to a microfluidic device and method for cell lysis by localized acoustic pressure.","The need to rapidly extract and process genomic material for identification of biological agents and disease is an ever increasing requirement. Methods that allow the complete unbiased isolation of nucleic acids from microorganisms and cellular samples are necessary to aid in molecular analysis methods and detection schemes. The biases implicit in samples makes it essential to develop preparation methods that directly access the nucleic acid content for field portable systems. This requires overcoming a variety of interferences that diminish quality, yield, and diversity of extracted nucleic acids. Routine laboratory methods for cell lysis include freeze\/thaw, proteinase K, lysozyme, and guanidium salt treatments followed by ethanol or 2-propanol precipitation of liberated DNA; ballistic disintegration; and sonication at low frequencies (e.g., kilohertz) after pretreatment with other chemicals. See D. P. Chandler et al., 73, 3784 (2001).","For field portable systems, the tendency has been to simply downscale laboratory-scale equipment in genetic engineering to microscale on-chip processing. Therefore, a key aspect is that the extraction format must be highly scalable to benefit from many types of biodetection systems that are already in place. Many of the current nucleic acid extraction techniques, however, require significant manual intervention and consumables leading to limitations that are especially relevant for the unattended, timely detection of biological warfare agents or other microorganisms in a complex milieu. The continued reliance on large laboratory equipment (e.g., centrifuges, gel electrophoresis units, ultracentrifuges), requirements for chemical or enzymes that are labile or need special handling, and storage and disposal, further impede progress toward miniaturized autonomous detection.","Microsystems have been developed that use mechanical, chemical, thermal, and chemical methods for cell lysis. Ultrasonic waves are known to induce significant pressure variation and induce cavitation within fluids. See G. Zhang et al., 35, 3248 (1996). Thus, acoustic waves can provide a non-invasive lysing mechanism which is compatible with sealed microsystems. Acoustic methods avoid the use of harsh chemicals which often interfere with subsequent detection methods (e.g., PCR). Often the altered pH and chemical background adds additional steps that can otherwise be avoided. Recently, large-scale acoustic transducers have proven powerful for disrupting cell membranes and spores and releasing the contents of the cytoplasm for subsequent DNA analysis. See D. P. Chandler et al.; and P. Belgrader et al., 71, 4232 (1999). Thin-film based ultrasonic actuators have also been used to lyse cellular samples and have proven effective for microsystem applications. See T. C. Marentis et al., & 31, 1265 (2005); and H. Jagannathan et al., 859 (2001). However, small-scale actuators suffer from limitations in attainable film thickness and meeting the thermal requirements for long-term use. The deposition thicknesses that can be reasonably attained are between 1 to 10 which translates to range of 316 MHz to 3.165 GHz for ZnO. However, a frequency of less than 300 MHz is far more optimal for coupling into the fluid. Moreover, these devices must be strictly operated in a pulsed mode to prevent device damage.","A second major problem is that nearly all microsonicator approaches lack on-chip nucleic acid extraction processing capability. Thus, the lysate must be processed and purified off-chip, reducing the effectiveness of a microsystem solution. Nucleic acid purification methods that are suitable for on-chip applications require the use of silicon based microstructures, commercial nucleic acid binding media, silica beads in the presence of chaotropic salts, and silica matrices. See N. C. Cady et al., 19, 59 (2003); M. Mor\u00e9 et al., 60, 1572 (1994); R. Boom et al., 28, 495 (1990); and K. Wolfe et al., 23, 727 (2002). Though packed silica beads bind and elute nucleic acids, their inherent instability due to compression causes widely varying results. This limitation has been overcome by using a gelled sol-gel solution of silica beads to stabilize the matrix, improving reproducibility. Recently another powerful nucleic acid extraction method has been demonstrated which uses NAFION coated gold films to reversibly capture nucleic acids. See M. Lee et al., 380, 335 (2008). This method is particularly easy to implement in microfluidic format and only needs low DC voltages for operation.","Therefore, a need remains for an acoustic-based microfluidic lysing device that can be integrated with an on-chip nucleic acid extraction processing capability and can be used in a field portable system.","The present invention is directed to an acoustic-based microfluidic device for cell lysis comprising a channel formed in a microfluidic substrate, adapted to flow a fluid comprising biological cells therein; and at least one acoustic transducer disposed on a lysis portion of the channel, adapted to generate localized acoustic pressure in the lysis portion and thereby lyse the biological cells in the fluid by acoustic pressure. The transducer array can use 36\u00b0 Y cut lithium niobate, which efficiently couples bulk acoustic waves (BAW) into the channels. The height of the channel can be than ten acoustic wavelengths and preferably less than 100 microns. The operating frequency of the acoustic transducers can be less than 100 MHz. A heat sink can be provided for removal of heat generated by the acoustic transducers from the device to avoid thermal lysis or protein denaturization. The microfluidic substrate preferably comprises a rigid material, such as plastic, glass, ceramic, or a silicon-based material. The channel can be a straight channel or can be a circuitous or serpentine channel to increase the exposure time to the acoustic pressure field. Preferably, the acoustic transducer array is disposed on a separate array substrate that is reversibly coupled to a microfluidic cartridge comprising the channel formed in the microfluidic substrate to enable reuse of the transducer assembly while permitting disposal of the contaminated fluidic cartridges. The acoustic transducer array can efficiently and rapidly lyse samples for either subsequent use or further processing on the cartridge.","The device can further comprise a nucleic acid extraction portion formed in the microfluidic substrate downstream from the lysis portion, adapted to extract nucleic acid from the lysate. The nucleic acid extraction portion can comprise means for extracting the nucleic acid from the lysate using a sol-gel\/silica bead matrix, nucleic acid binding magnetic beads, or electric field extraction with NAFION-coated electrodes. Successful lysing and DNA extraction from samples in plastic and glass based microfluidic cartridges has been demonstrated at levels sufficient for molecular beacon and PCR detection applications.","The present invention is directed to a microfluidic acoustic-based cell lysing device that can be integrated with on-chip nucleic acid extraction.

For example, the substrate  can comprise plastic, glass, ceramic, or a silicon-based material. The channel  can be a straight channel, or can have a circuitous pattern (e.g., serpentine) to increase the exposure time to the acoustic pressure field. The channel  can be formed in the substrate by microfabrication methods that are known in the art. For example, a channel can be formed in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) by a standard molding process. Alternatively, a channel  can be formed in a glass, ceramic, or silicon-based substrate by bulk or surface micromachining. Preferably, the acoustic wavelength in the fluid is comparable to comparable to the size of the cells to be lysed. The height of the channel is preferably comparable to the acoustic attenuation length in the fluid and depends on the excited wavelength for optimal propagation distance. For example, the height can preferably be less than ten acoustic wavelengths in the fluid and, more preferably a few acoustic wavelengths. The width of the channel is preferably smaller than the acoustic transducer to maintain lysing uniformity.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0034","num":"0033"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["20","21","22","21","22","23","25","24","21","22","25","27","25","26","23","21","22","14"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["30","21","31","32","30","32","32","33","34","21"]},"A scattering parameter S can be used to characterize the electrical performance of the BAW transducer array prior to assembly with the microfluidic cartridge. S is a complex-valued quantity that is equivalent to the measured reflection coefficient, and from which the power delivered to the device can be calculated. For example, S can be recorded across a 10 MHz-100 MHz band using a network analyzer. The power delivered to the device can be chosen to maximize lysing efficiency without causing cavitation or excessive heating of the transducer and heat sink. Thermal effects can dramatically limit the success of any acoustic-based lysing system, specifically where the protein content may be of interest.","A 1D transmission line model and a finite element method (FEM) can be used to calculate the acoustic pressure and velocity fields in the fluid-filled channel. Using these computed fields, the kinetic and potential energies can be calculated. This enables determination of the force profile within the channel. The acoustic transducers can be designed to create large pressure fields (\u02dc10 MPa) in a microfluidic channel to achieve efficient lysing. It is preferable that the lysing mechanism occur due to the acoustic pressure field alone, rather than from localized heating during acoustic excitation. Therefore, additional layers and thermal management can be used for impedance matching while mitigating any heat generated by the acoustic transducers.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 4","FIG. 4"],"i":["a ","b "],"b":["40","20"],"sub":"o "},"Acoustic waves must satisfy both Newton's and Maxwell's equations.

First, the propagation constant (\u03b3) for each layer can be computed followed by computing Eq. (34) for each layer. Using Eq. (33), the impedance loading the transducer can be computed by successive substitution and combined with Eq. (30) to compute the total electrical impedance of the loaded transducer. The advantage of one-dimensional transmission line models is that they permit rapid design and optimization of transducers that have a large number of layers. Moreover, optimization algorithms can be used to enhance power output, impedance matching, and frequency response.","For cell lysis, the BAW transducer must couple sufficient acoustic energy into a fluid-filled region to disrupt the cellular membrane. Preferably, the BAW transducer array also reversibly couples to a microfluidic cartridge to enable reuse of the transducer assembly while permitting disposal of the contaminated fluidic cartridges. Therefore, the design of the interface boundary between the acoustic transducers and the microfluidic channel is important to obtain the best possible acoustic coupling and permit reusability of the transducer array. Modeling can be used to investigate the physical parameters to reduce acoustic loss through the boundaries while permitting fluid movement through the microchannels. The modeled geometries of the unloaded and loaded transducer are shown in and ","The impedance response is shown in  for the unloaded and loaded 36\u00b0 Y lithium niobate transducer based on the 1D transmission line and 2D FEM model. Though the unloaded transducer exhibits excellent resonance near 55 MHz, the impedance was a not optimal Z (55 MHz)=1.10\u2212j7.15\u03a9. For the composite transducer, Z (55 MHz)=44.67\u2212j16.9\u03a9), which a much better match to a 50 ohm system. Perfect matching requires exquisite tracking of the maximal drive frequency. Therefore, broadband behavior is preferable.","Transmission line models are significantly faster computationally, providing rapid insight into the impact of various layers on the transducer. One disadvantage of this method is the cross-sectional area is assumed to be a constant from layer to layer. Despite the limitations of a 1D analysis, several key parameters can be extracted from this model: the return loss (S), the acoustic velocities at the transducer faces, and the radiated acoustic power.  shows the return loss (S) for the unloaded and composite transducers based on a 1D transmission line model. After proper layer-to-layer matching the return loss at the resonance frequency provides an excellent match to a 50 ohm source. The return loss for the composite transducer shown in was \u221214.5 dB with a tunable range of 8 MHz based on maintaining 90% input power coupling to the transducers.","The 1D model can be used to compute the acoustic velocities at the faces of the composite transducer. For a peak-to-peak (P-P) input voltage of 2.78 V the acoustic velocities at both faces was computed with Eq. (35) to be 3.4 cm\/sec at 54 MHz. The radiated acoustic power from the transducer was computed by applying Eq. (36) and using the loaded impedances and velocities at the transducer faces. At 54 MHz the total radiated acoustic power was 81.5 mW.","A more realistic model can be developed using a 2D FEM and 2D axially symmetric analysis which correctly accounts for changes in area from layer to layer. To compute the impedance of the transducer, a known voltage was applied to the driven electrode and then the induced surface charge was computed. By sweeping the frequency, the impedance was calculated using Eq. (12). The calculation was based on 2D FEM of the transducer with infinitesimally thin Au electrodes in air.  shows extracted impedance response of 36\u00b0 Y lithium niobate transducer from a 2D FEM. The resonance and anti-resonance frequencies, assuming lossless conditions, can be used to compute the piezoelectric coupling constant K. The piezoelectric coupling coefficient was computed from the known material parameters as defined in Table I and compared with the extracted K from the FEM impedance data. The materials parameters gave K=54% which agreed well with K)=56.1% from the FEM model. This indicates that the 2D FEM model parameters are suitable for building more complex models of the acoustic transducer.","A 2D FEM model was used to compute the acoustic pressure distribution within the fluid region suitable for cell lysing. This fluid region was modeled as a cross-section of the channel. Since the acoustic fields are nearly instantaneous compared to the mass transport through the microchannel, a 2D simulation was sufficient to capture the pressure field.  shows the localized acoustic pressure within the channel cross-section. shows the acoustic pressure at 54 MHz for an applied voltage of 3 Vacross the transducer. The resulting peak acoustic field was \u02dc1 MPa with portions of the microchannel around 0.2 MPa. The acoustic pressure was computed at several drive frequencies across both the width and the height of the channel along cross-sectional lines through the center of the channel, as shown in and . shows the acoustic pressure at several drive frequencies across the width of the channel. shows the acoustic pressure at several drive frequencies across the height of the channel. The acoustic pressure was maximized and the optimal coupling to the frequency source was matched at 54 MHz. The BAW transducer had 90% electrical power coupling efficiency across a bandwidth of 8 MHz, which provided excellent operating range. The acoustic pressure profiles within the microchannel demonstrate the scale at which the pressure undergoes rapid changes was on the order of 20 \u03bcm.","The energy of the acoustic fields can be calculated as a function of the drive frequency. This can be used to determine if other possible acoustic modes are leaking energy from the primary excitation frequency. Using Eq. (16), the kinetic and potential energy due to the pressure and velocity of the acoustic waves were computed versus the drive frequency.  shows the kinetic and potential energy of the acoustic fields in the center of channel. This computation indicates that the primary BAW mode is being excited and converted to acoustic energy at 54 MHz.","The thermal variation from the inlet to the outlet of the microchannel can be calculated from heat flux entering the boundary between the transducer and epoxy layers. This heat flux is the result of electrical and mechanical losses with the transducer. By using heat flux discontinuities at these boundaries, the computation can be simplified from a time-dependent to steady state model. This is a valid assumption when the lysing time is sufficiently long (e.g., 20 seconds) and, therefore, nearly reaches the steady state. First, the P-P voltage delivered to each BAW transducer at 50\u03a9) was computed as 2.78 V-3.47 V which corresponded to the known input power (i.e., 21.9-23.8 dBm). Then the 1D transmission line model was used to compute the radiated power of the emitted acoustic waves. By knowing the applied power input, conservation of energy can be applied (Eq. 37) to determine the mechanical and electrical loss. Since the transducer is most efficient at 52-54 MHz, the radiated acoustic power was taken at this frequency. These values were used in the 1D model to determine the radiated acoustic power, mechanical and electrical losses. Using Eqs. (36) and (37), the combined loss from the mechanical and electrical processes was 11.1 mW with a radiated acoustic power of 81.5 mW. The electrical loss (P) was only 0.7 mW.

The cartridges were manufactured in a fashion similar to the devices described previously, with the addition of a NAFION-coated gold electrode with an available surface area of 141 mmfor DNA binding. For each experiment, 50 \u03bcL of genomic DNA in 10 mM TE buffer (10 mM Tris-CI pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) was injected into the microfluidic channel at a 50 \u03bcL\/min flow rate. Once the solution entered the channel, a positive voltage was applied to the NAFION-coated electrode to bind DNA. The voltage was applied until all of the solution has run through the channel, at which time the power supply was turned off. 50 \u03bcL of 10 mM TE buffer was then loaded into the channel at a 50 \u03bcL\/min flow rate, and a positive voltage was once again applied to the electrode to keep the DNA bound until the entire volume of buffer had exited the channel. For the elution step, 50 \u03bcL of 10 mM TE buffer was loaded into the channel at a 50 \u03bcL\/min flow rate and a negative voltage was applied to release bound DNA from the electrode. The eluent from each step was collected and analyzed for DNA content using an assay. The voltages for binding and elution of DNA were chosen based on electric field calculations and ranged from +\/\u22122.5 V to +\/\u22127.92 V. As shown in , the amount of DNA was determined during the bound, wash and elution steps for two applied voltages. The total injected DNA was 90 ng, in which 54.77 ng bound at a voltage of 5.92 V. The extraction efficiency increased to 66.3% when based on the DNA that actually bound and eluted from the NAFION-coated electrodes.","The present invention has been described as a method and device for cell lysis by localized acoustic pressure.
