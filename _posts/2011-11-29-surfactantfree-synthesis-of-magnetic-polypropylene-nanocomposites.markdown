The government has certain rights in the invention.","The present invention relates facile method to synthesize magnetic PNCs with highly dispersed and narrow size distributed NPs. The PNCs have highly thermal stability and unique electrical and dielectric properties.","Over the past few decades, magnetic materials with various shapes and sizes have demonstrated wide potential applications, for examples, in data storage [Wang 2008, Terris 2005], magnetic sensors [Li 2003, Guo 2007, Guo 2008], biomedical [Lee 2007, Lu 2005] (i.e., drug delivery) and pharmaceutical areas [Ban 2005, Gupta 2004], and even the environmental remediation [Zang 2010]. Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) have been well developed in the last two decades due to the combined advantages of polymers, such as lightweight, easy processability and flexibility, and excellent physiochemical characteristics of the inorganic nanomaterials such as high mechanical strength and excellent electrical, magnetic and optical properties. Therefore, magnetic PNCs have attracted wide interest for their diverse potential applications such as energy storage devices [Kim, P. 2009], electrochromic devices [Zhu 2010], electronics [Zhu 2010 II, Zhu 2010 III], microwave absorbers [Guo 2007 II, Guo 2009], and sensors [Shimada 2007].","The major challenge lying ahead to obtain high performance PNCs comes from the serious agglomeration of the nanomaterials owing to their high surface energy and large specific surface area. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made to tailor their surface property through physical and chemical approaches [Tseng 2006, Tasis 2006, Yang 2007, Guo 2006] to improve the interfacial compatibility between the inorganic fillers and the polymermatrix. To overcome the challenges in dispersing the magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) limited by the magnetically induced agglomeration, techniques including encapsulating the magnetic core with surfactant [Kataby 1997], polymer [Boyer 2009], silica [Lu 2002], and carbon [Zhang 2010] have been reported. However, these well-dispersed NPs can only be limitedly applied in specific polymers with versatile surface functionalities. Right now, most of the current research work on fabricating PNCs starts from the as-prepared NPs and polymers (or monomer) with a direct blending [Zhu 2010 III] or surface initiated polymerization method [Gun 2007 III]. A general method is of great interest to simplify the procedures while maintaining the well dispersed magnetic NPs.","The critical concentration of the fillers within the polymer matrix, where the performance of the PNCs experiences a sharp change, is often called \u201cpercolation threshold.\u201d Almost all the physical properties, including viscoelastic, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties are related to the percolation phenomenon. Thus, various methods have been developed to determine the percolation value. Most of the current research efforts concentrate on the carbon based nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [Potschke 2002], carbon nanofibers [Zhu 2010 II, Zhu 2010 IV], carbon NPs [Kotsilkova 2005], and graphene [Kim, H. 2009] to enhance the thermal, electrical and mechanical properties of the polymers. Nanoclays [Sun 2009, Hyun 2001] are often used to improve the fire retardant performance. Potschke et al. [Potschke 2004] studied the rheological and dielectric percolation of the multiwalled CNTs\/polycarbonate PNCs and found that the rheological percolation (0.5-5 wt %) is strongly dependent on the temperature and the electrical percolation is at about 1 wt %. Sandler et al. [Sandler 2003] reported a ultra low electrical percolation in the CNTs\/epoxy PNCs at a loading of 0.0025 wt %. It is well-known that the percolation threshold is also dependent on the filler morphology, spherical particles are relatively difficult to reach percolation as compared to those with larger aspect ratio (like fibers and tubes). Therefore, a relatively higher loading of around 16 vol % from geometrical model [Kirkpatrick 1973, Zallen 1983] was required to reach percolation. Recently, Zhu et al. reported a low electrical percolation at 1.5 vol % with spherical Fe(core)-FeO(shell) structured NPs in epoxy resin using a surface wetting method. [Zhu 2010 111].","The present invention relates to an in-situ method to fabricate magnetic PNCs with highly dispersed and narrow size distributed NPs. No surfactant need be used in the whole process. The thermal stability of the PNCs increased surprisingly by \u02dc120\u00b0 C. with various particle loadings (3-12 wt %). In embodiments of the present invention, the composites showed conductive behavior when the NPs loading was higher than 5 wt %. And the dielectric constant was found to reach 100-1000 depending on the frequency, which would be of great interest in super-capacitor applications.","A facile surfactant-free process has been utilized to prepare multifunctional polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites filled with highly dispersed Fe@FeOcore@shell nanoparticles (NPs). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations confirmed the formation of uniform NPs in the PP matrix and the particle size increased with increasing the particle loading. The melt rheology measurements showed an apparent change in the frequency dependent storage modulus (G\u2032), loss modulus (G\u2033), and complex viscosity (\u03b7*) particularly at low frequencies. These changes were often related to the filler \u201cpercolation threshold,\u201d which has also been verified in the sharp change of electrical resistance and dielectric permittivity of these nanocomposites in higher particle loadings. The continuous decrease in the resistivity with increasing filler loading from 5 wt % to 20 wt % demonstrated the structural transition of the nanocomposites. The monotonic increase in the dielectric permittivity with increasing particle loadings combined with the direct evidence from the TEM observations indicated that the NPs are well separated and uniformly dispersed in the polymer matrix. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) results revealed a surprisingly high enhancement of the thermal stability by \u02dc120\u00b0 C. in air due to the oxygen trapping effect of the NPs and the polymer-particle interfacial interaction. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results showed that the crystalline temperature (T) of the nanocomposites was reduced by 16-18\u00b0 C. as compared to that of PP, while the melting temperature (T) almost maintained the same. The nanocomposites were found to be soft ferromagnetic at room temperature.","In general, in one aspect, the invention features a method that includes forming a solution that includes a nanoparticle precursor, a polypropylene, and a solvent. The solution is surfactant-free. The method further includes synthesizing the solution to form a magnetic polypropylene nanocomposite. The synthesis is a surfactant-free synthesis.","In general, in another aspect, the invention features a composition that includes polypropylene and nanoparticles. In the composition, the nanoparticles are wrapped by the polypropylene. The composition is a magnetic polypropylene nanocomposite.","There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter.","In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of the description and should not be regarded as limiting.","A facile in situ surfactant free method to synthesize magnetic polyolefin polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites has been discovered. In an embodiment of the present invention, magnetic NPs can be produced using Fe(CO)as a precursor during the refluxing process in the Fe(CO)\/PP\/xylene solution. The as-synthesized NPs are physically wrapped by PP. The composition has unique rheological, electrical, and dielectric percolation behaviors.","In the examples illustrated herein, the following materials were utilized:","Isotactic PP (Total Petrochemicals Inc. USA), (0.9 g\/cm3 in density, Mn\u224840500, Mw\u2248155000, melt index\u224835 g\/min).","Iron(0) pentacarbonyl (iron carbonyl, Fe(CO)5, 99%) (Sigma-Aldrich).","Solvent xylene (laboratory grade, F=0.87 g\/cm3) with a boiling temperature ranging from 137 to 145\u00b0 C. (Fisher Scientific).","All the chemicals were used as received without any treatment.","Fabrication of Polymer Nanocomposites.","In an embodiment of the present invention, PP was initially dissolved in xylene with a weight ratio of 1:10 (20 g: 207 mL) and refluxed at the boiling point (\u02dc140\u00b0 C.) of xylene for around 2 hour until the PP was completely dissolved. Then different weight (2.17, 3.67, 6.08, 9.54, and 17.48 g) of liquid Fe(CO)was injected into the dissolved PP solution to obtain the final PNCs containing 3, 5, 8, 12, and 20 wt % of the NPs (based on pure iron element). The mixture solution turned from transparent to yellow immediately after the addition of Fe(CO)and then gradually changed to black during the additional 3 hour refluxing process under the nitrogen protecting conditions, indicating the formation of the NPs. The PNC solution was then cooled down to around 90\u00b0 C. and then poured onto a large glass plate to allow solvent evaporation overnight. The powder-like products were collected and kept in a vacuum oven at room temperature overnight.","Pure PP powders are also prepared following the above procedures without adding Fe(CO)and are termed as p-PP to differentiate from the as-received PP (o-PP). Upon heating, Fe(CO)was decomposed to Fe(CO)and Fe-(CO)with a rapid formation of CO, reaching an equilibrium mixture of all the three carbonyls. The Fe(CO)was then decomposed and finally formed the metallic NPs [Smith 1980, Van Wonterghem 1985]. Oxidization took place on the surface and then a core-shell structure was formed after exposure to air.","The desired samples were prepared from PP both the as-received original PP (o-PP) and processed PP (p-PP) and its PNC powders using hot press (Carver 3853-0, USA). Briefly, the dried powders were compressed under a pressure of 10 MPa at 180\u00b0 C. in a mold at a heating rate of 20\u00b0 C.\/min. The compressed composites were held at 180\u00b0 C. for 20 min and then cooled down to room temperature in the mold while maintaining the applied pressure. Finally, a disk-shaped nanocomposite sample was prepared with a diameter of 25 mm and thickness of 2-3 mm.  shows the prepared PNCs magnetically attracted by a magnet.  is PNCs with an NPs loading of 8 wt %.","Characterization","Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Bruker Inc. Tensor 27) with hyperion 1000 ATR microscopy accessory was used to characterize PP and its PNCs over the range of 2500 to 400 cmat a resolution of 4 cm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis with Cu radiation source was carried out with a STA Jupiter 449C (Netzsch) on disk samples with a diameter of 25 mm.","The particle distribution in the PP matrix was examined by a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The samples were stained in RuO4 vapor to harden the surface and then microtomed into a film with a thickness of \u02dc100 nm, which were observed in a JEOL 2010 TEM at a working voltage of 200 kV. Images were recorded with a Gatan Orius SC 1000 CCD camera. In order to obtain more accurate particle size, magnifications were calibrated using commercial cross-line grating replica and SiC lattice images.[Luo 2006].","The rheological behavior of the PNCs was studied using TA Instruments AR 2000ex Rheometer. An environmental test chamber (ETC) steel parallel-plate geometry (25 mm in diameter) was used to perform the measurement at 200\u00b0 C., with dynamic oscillation frequency sweeping from 100 to 0.1 Hz in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) range (strain 1%) under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the oxidation of PP.","The thermal degradation\/stability of the PNCs was studied with a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA Instruments TGA Q-500) from 25 to 600\u00b0 C. in air and nitrogen atmosphere, respectively, with a flow rate of 60 mL\/min and a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, TA Instruments Q2000) measurements were carried out from 0 to 250\u00b0 C. under a nitrogen flow rate of approximately 100 mL\/min at a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min.","The volume resistivity was determined by measuring the DC resistance on a disk-shaped sample (diameter, \u02dc50 mm; thickness, 0.5-1.0 mm). An Agilent 4339B high resistance meter equipped with a resistivity cell (Agilent, 16008B) was used to measure the volume resistivity of each sample after inputting the thickness. This equipment allowed the resistivity measurement up to 1016\u03a9. The source voltage was set at 0.1 V for all the samples. The reported values represent the mean value of eight measurements with a deviation less than 10%.","The dielectric properties were measured by a LCR meter (Agilent, E4980A) equipped with a dielectric test fixture (Agilent, 16451B) at the frequency of 20 HZ-2 MHz. The PP and PNCs were hot pressed in the form of disk pellets with a diameter of 60 mm and an average thickness of about 0.7 mm.","The magnetic property measurements of the PNCs with various particle loadings were carried out in a 9 T physical properties measurement system (PPMS) by Quantum Design at room temperature.","FT-IR Analysis",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["201","202","205"],"sup":["\u22121 ","\u22121 ","\u22121 "],"sub":["2","3 "]},"Microstructure of PNCs and Electron Diffraction of NPs",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0047","num":"0046"},"figref":"FIGS. 3A-3H"},"The measured particle size (, D, and F) increased gradually with increasing particle loading. The average particle diameter is 8.2\u00b11.2, 11.0\u00b10.9, and 15.9\u00b12.2 nm for PNCs reinforced with a particle loading of 5, 8, and 20 wt %, respectively. In most cases, the particle size is governed by the rates of nucleation and growth. [Sidorov 1999]. Since the same precursor and synthesis procedures were used during the preparation of different PNCs in these embodiments, the nucleation rate should be the same. The larger particle size obtained at higher loading was due to the growth of more concentrated nucleates in the unit volume.","To obtain the phase structure of the formed NPs, the NPs were characterized by high resolution TEM (HRTEM), as shown in . The fringe spacing is about 2.60 and 2.20 \u212b, corresponding to the (104) and (113) crystal planes of FeO. The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern is presented in . The rings with plane distances of 2.60, 2.20, 1.70, and 1.39 \u212b were observed, which fit well with the (104), (113), (116), and (214) diffraction planes for the trigonal phase of FeO.[Gu 2009, Oprea 2009].","The percolation (or called threshold), which is essentially important for the prediction and interpretation of the switching physical phenomena, can be observed from the particle-particle interaction within the polymer matrix. Once a network structure of the filler was formed in the composites, the electrical [Zhu 2010 II, Barrau 2003], rheological [Zhu 2010 IV] and mechanical properties [Meincke 2004] experienced a sharp change. The PNCs with the particle loading increasing from 5 to 20 wt % illustrate the structural transition of the NPs within the polymer matrix. For 5 wt % loading, the NPs were loosely embedded in the matrix, though continuous network structure could not be observed, the string-like particle chain began to form, . When the loading increased to 8 wt %, the NPs were distributed more densely and the particle-particle distance was significantly reduced. The network structure of the NPs was completely formed as the loading reached 20 wt %, meanwhile some agglomerates were observed due to the high particle packaging density in the unit volume.","X-ray Diffraction and Mossbauer Analysis","Despite the simplicity of its chemical component, PP showed a remarkable complexity of crystal structures (phases), which include \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 phases. Each of the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 crystalline form had its own distinctive peaks in the XRD patterns.  shows the XRD profiles of PP () and its PNCs (3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % at -, respectively). It is evident that the peak intensity decreased gradually with increasing particle loading, which was attributed to the decreased crystalline size of PP after introducing the NPs (the crystallinity was almost maintained from the DSC analysis, see Table 1 below).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":[{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"1"},"colspec":{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"217pt","align":"center"}},"thead":{"row":{"entry":"TABLE1"}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"1","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":"DSC Characteristics of p-PP and Its PNCs"}]}},{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"6"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"49pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"3","colwidth":"42pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"4","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"5","colwidth":"35pt","align":"center"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"6","colwidth":"28pt","align":"center"}}],"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":["Material","T(\u00b0 C.)","\u0394H(J\/g)","T(\u00b0 C.)","\u0394H(J\/g)","F(%)"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}},{"entry":["p-PP","149.2","90.4","119.8","86.6","43.3"]},{"entry":["\u20023 wt% NPs","148.6","80.8","103.4","83.0","39.9"]},{"entry":["\u20025 wt% NPs","149.1","86.7","101.6","89.1","43.6"]},{"entry":["\u20028 wt% NPs","148.1","63.8","101.3","66.4","42.9"]},{"entry":["12 wt% NPs","149.3","67.5 ","101.3","66.8","36.7"]},{"entry":{"@attributes":{"namest":"1","nameend":"6","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}}]}}]}}},"In a typical XRD pattern of the R phase PP, the intensity of the first peak (110) was always stronger than that of the second peak (040).[Auriemma 2002]. However, it was not true for the samples containing \u03b3 phase. All the samples were characterized by a stronger second peak than that of the first one, which was not surprising considering the same location of the strong peak in \u03b3 phase. Because of the high diffraction similarity between R and \u03b3 phases in the region of 13-17\u00b0, the \u03b3 phase was usually determined from the peak at 2\u03b8=20.07\u00b0 (117), and R phase is identified from the peak 2\u03b8=18.50\u00b0 (120). [Forester 2001] The other peaks at 2\u03b8=14.06, 16.90, 21.20, and 21.86\u00b0 corresponded to the 110, 040, 131, and 041 crystalline planes of R-PP, respectively. It was interesting to observe that the peak intensity at 2\u03b8=20.07\u00b0 decreased with the addition of the NPs. However, the amount of \u03b3-PP showed a surprisingly filler loading independent behavior and a comparable peak intensity at 2\u03b8=20.07\u00b0 was observed as compared to that of the peak at 2\u03b8=18.50\u00b0. In a previous study [Mezghani 1995], the ratio of \u03b3 to \u03b1 was simply calculated from the relative intensity of the unique peaks of \u03b3 phase at 2\u03b8=20.07\u00b0 and a phase at 2\u03b8=18.50\u00b0. The relatively low intensity of the peak at 20.07\u00b0 as compared to that of the peak at 18.50\u00b0 after the incorporation of the NPs suggested a reduced amount of \u03b3 phase during the crystallization process. Earlier studies showed that more PP was observed to be crystallized in the \u03b3 phase at a lower cooling rate.[Mezghani 1998]. In this embodiment of the present invention, the conductive fillers within the polymer matrix created a pathway for heat transfer and the cooling rate was much faster for the PNCs as compared to that of pure PP, which was observed in the CNTs suspended in surfactant micelles in water.[Huxtable 2003]. Therefore, a decreased amount of PP in \u03b3 phase was observed.","However, no additional peak regarding the NPs was detected in the PNCs as compared with those of pure PP, which is due to the limitation of the XRD whose signals only come from the sample surface. The crystalline structure of the NPs was further identified from the comparison between the experimental and simulated TEM-SAED patterns. Mossbauer analysis was also used to justify the valence of iron in the NPs.","The particle composition is examined by the consistence between the experimental and simulation results based on the SAED data. [Fang 2010]. To be specific, the intensity profile of the SAED pattern was measured using ELD program [Zou 1993] and the background of the intensity profile was subtracted using Reflex module in MS Modeling program.[Fang 2010]. Then the simulated SAED powder patterns were calculated using the standard structures of FeO, FeO, FeO and Fe. As shown in , In comparison with the peak position and intensities, FeOfit the experimental observation the best.  is a graph of the experimental () and simulation results of the NPs from TEM-SAED patterns (- for FeO, FeO, FeO and Fe, respectively).","However, there was still a difference between the experimental curve and the standard simulated FeOpattern. To further confirm the particle composition, room temperature Mossbauer spectrum analysis was conducted on the PNCs with a particle loading of 20 wt %, as shown in . The paramagnetic doublet observed in the center of the Mossbauer spectra I (), confirmed the existence of Fe, which corresponds to the superparamagnetic behavior of FeO. [Mikutta 2008]. The fitting results showed a main component at isomer shift (IS)=0.35 mm\/s and quadrupole splitting (QS)=0.80 mm\/s, which is Fe in a paramagnetic state in the distorted oxygen octahedral site. II () and III () of  depicts the secondary component with IS=0 and correspondent H=335 kOe, which represents a spectral contribution of 5% \u03b1-Fe metallic magnetically ordered state. The aforementioned analysis justified that the formed NPs have a chemical structure of Fe core and FeOshell.","Melt Rheology","The rheological behaviors of the composite melts are essentially important for industrial nanocomposite processing. Also, the formation of a percolated system can be detected by characterizing the complex viscosity (\u03b7*), storage modulus (G\u2032), and loss modulus (G\u2033) as a function of frequency. [Zhu 2010 II, Zhu 2010 IV, Potschke 2004, Mitchell 2002].  shows the variation of \u03b7* with frequency for pure PP () and its PNCs (3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % at -, respectively) measured at 200\u00b0 C. \u03b7* increased with increasing the particle loading, especially at low frequency such as 0.1 Hz. Pure PP was observed to have frequency independent fluid properties, i.e., Newtonian-type flow only within the range of 0.1-0.4 Hz and shear thinning (viscosity decreased with an increase of shear rate\/frequency) dominated the melt thereafter until 100 Hz. [Poslinski 1988, Ugaz 1997]. The PNCs with a particle loading of 3 wt % were much more viscous than that of pure PP at low frequencies and exhibited strong shear thinning behavior. The","similar value of \u03b7* at high frequency (10-100 Hz) indicated a polymer melt rather than filler dominated fluid dynamics. However, as the particle loading increased to 5, 8, and 12 wt %, the viscosity curve became linear within the whole frequency range. This phenomenon indicated a filler dominated fluid in the PNCs with a relatively high particle loading. The transition in \u03b7* indicated that the PNCs had reached a rheological percolation, at which the NPs form a network structure and greatly impede the motion of the polymer chains. The increase of \u03b7* with an increase of particle loadings was primarily due to the significant increase in G\u2032 and G\u2033 (\u03b7*=\u03b70\u2032\u2212i\u03b7\u2033, where \u03b7\u2032=G\u2033\/\u03c9, \u03b7\u2033=G\u2032\/\u03c9, and \u03c9 is angular frequency, rad\/s). [Shenoy 1999].","At 200\u00b0 C., the PP chains were fully relaxed and exhibited a typical homopolymer-like terminal behavior, which disappeared with the addition of the NPs. As shown in , G\u2032 increased monotonically with increasing the particle loading at all frequencies (pure PP () and its PNCs (3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % at -, respectively). Larger enhancement of G\u2032 with orders of magnitude was observed at lower frequencies for the PNCs, which indicated that the large-scale polymer chain relaxations in the PNCs were significantly restrained by the presence of the NPs. The G\u2032 versus frequency curve for the PNCs with relatively higher particle loadings (\u22675 wt %) approached a plateau at low frequencies. This \u201cplateau\u201d with a nonterminal low-frequency behavior [Du 2004] suggested either an interconnected structure of the fillers or a strong particle-polymer interaction. [Potschke 2004]. Similar low frequency response was also observed in the conventional composites. [Krishnamoorti 1997, McNally 2005]. At high frequencies, the effect of the particle loading on the rheological behavior was relatively weak. This phenomenon indicated that the NPs were not effective to affect the short-range dynamics of the PP chains. [Du 2004]. As shown in , a similar curve of the G\u2033 (pure PP () and its PNCs (3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % at -, respectively) with increasing frequency was observed. The plateau was observed in the PNCs with higher particle loading (\u22678 wt %).","The tan 8 is the ratio of G00 to G0, which was used to characterize the damping property of the PNCs. As shown in  G\u2033 (pure PP () and its PNCs (3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % at -, respectively), it is evident that tan \u03b4 decreased and the corresponding curves became flatter with increasing particle loading. The mechanical loss, which was arising from the discordance between strain and stress in the polymer exposed to an external force [Wu 2008], was strongly related to the applied frequency. The tan \u03b4 of pure PP decreased monotonously, while a peak is observed in all the PNC samples (with the peak position marked with arrow for each of -). The higher tan \u03b4 of pure PP than that of the PNCs was due to the fully relaxation of the PP chains, which made the interpolymer-chain motion more difficult and more interchain friction heat was generated during the oscillation. After incorporating the NPs, the polymer chain relaxation and relative motion have been greatly restrained by the presence of the NPs and the PNCs are \u201cstiffer\u201d. Therefore, less internal chain-chain friction heat was produced upon applying the same oscillation frequency. In addition, the higher the particle loading, the lower tan \u03b4 was observed. This observation suggested a strong interaction between the NPs and the polymer matrix, both energy dissipation and relaxation of the PP chains were increasingly hindered as the particle loading increased. For the PNCs, a broad peak appeared on each tan \u03b4 curve and the peak position shifts to higher frequency with increasing nanoparticle loading due to the greater restrictions. At low frequency, the polymer chain motion kept in step with the oscillation and the internal friction among the polymer chains would be neglected. Once the frequency went to extremely high, the movement of the polymer chains was not able to catch up the variation of the frequency. Therefore, the PNCs behaved like glass state and generated small amount of energy loss. Large amount of energy loss appeared between these two extreme conditions when the polymer showed viscoelastic properties. [Bower 2002]. Similar phenomena have been observed in the PP\/carbon nanofiber nanocomposites.

Generally, G\u2032 increased with the increase of G\u2033. The structural difference of each composite could be monitored from the slope change of the curves. The gradually decreased slope evidenced the structural change as the particle loading increased, which was also observed in the MWCNT reinforced polycarbonate [Potschke 2004] and polyethylene [McNally 2005] PNCs.","Electrical Conductivity",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0062","num":"0061"},"figref":["FIG. 9","FIGS. 3A-3H"],"b":"901"},"Inset  of  depicts the G\u2032 () and G\u2033 () against filler loading at the low oscillation frequency of 0.1 Hz, in which the crossing point was used to determine the rheological percolation of the PNCs.

The observed rheological percolation was about 3.4 wt % (0.65 vol %), which was much lower than the electrical percolation of 5-12 wt % (0.96-2.3 vol %).  show the schematic model of the gradually formed particle percolation. The NPs () are physically wrapped with polymer chains () due to their large specific surface area and their strong affinity with the surrounding media, which form a particle complex (the thickness of the polymer wrapping layer plus the radius of the NPs). The formed nanoparticle complex was actually larger than the radius of the bare NPs. This \u201creal radius\u201d () was particularly effective in the rheological properties. Once the distance between the NPs got close to double of the \u201creal radius,\u201d the wrapped NPs formed an interconnected network, which was called \u201crheological percolation\u201d. However, the resistivity analysis indicated that this distance was not close enough to form a network structure for the electrons to pass through the neighboring NPs as a \u201ctunneling effect\u201d (the resistivity did not change with 3 wt % NPs). Therefore, a higher particle loading was needed to reach the electrical percolation. While increasing the filler loading from 5 to 8 wt %, the reduced interparticle distance led to the \u201ctunneling effect\u201d and meanwhile the network structure began to form, thus a gradually decreased resistivity was observed. The resistivity reached a saturation value at the loading\u2032 of 12 wt % and it did not change as the filler loading further increased to 20 wt %. This indicated that a network of NPs had been formed completely at the loading of 12 wt % and the significantly reduced resistivity was due to the electron pathway created by the direct contact of the NPs.","Dielectric Properties",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0064","num":"0063"},"figref":["FIGS. 11A-11B","FIG. 11A","FIG. 11B"],"b":["1101","1102","1105","1106","1107","1110"]},"As shown in FIG. HA, Pure PP and PNCs with a nanoparticle loading of 3 wt % were observed to exhibit constant \u2208\u2032 value. However, the PNCs with particle loadings larger than 3 wt % show a dielectric relaxation behavior (\u2208\u2032 decreases with increasing frequency). This result was in good agreement with the variation of electrical resistance of the PNCs, where a transition starts from the concentration of 5 wt % (often called \u201cpercolation\u201d). It is worth noting that both \u2208\u2032 and \u2208\u2033 of the PNCs were enhanced significantly by orders of magnitude near the percolation, as shown in , respectively. The obtained \u2208\u2032 value is 770 for the PNCs with 12 wt % filler loading, which was about 700 times larger than that of pure PP. The significantly enhanced real dielectric permittivity indicated that the thin insulating PP layer physically wrapped on the nanoparticle surface was still dielectrically strong to hold the charge carriers in the NPs at low frequency. The dielectric permittivity of the PNCs with filler content higher than 3 wt % decreased toward high frequency, suggesting that the insulating layer was not stable and easily affected by the external frequency disturbance.

(Compare with ). The tremendous thermal stability improvement of around 120\u00b0 C. as compared to p-PP was due to the presence of the NPs, especially with a metal core, as evidenced by Mossbauer spectra of . Operated in the air condition, iron acted as oxygen trap and thus reduced the oxidation effect of oxygen on the PP molecular chains to give a higher decomposition temperature. The actual residue was 3.6, 6.1, 9.9, and 13.9% for the PNCs reinforced with 3, 5, 8, and 12 wt % NPs, respectively. The theoretically calculated residue based on the NPs was 3.8, 7.0, 11.0, and 16.6%. These slightly higher values than the corresponding actual residues were primarily due to the evaporation of small amount of Fe(CO)during the reflux process.","To remove the effect of heat history on the obtained heat data, all the samples were first heated to 250\u00b0 C. with a heating rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min under nitrogen, allow the samples to maintain at 250\u00b0 C. for 2 min and then cool down to room temperature with a cooling rate of 10\u00b0 C.\/min.

The melting temperature (T) of PP was not affected by the addition of the NPs. However, the crystalline temperature (T) of PP decreased by 16-18\u00b0 C., where PP was crystallized at 119.8\u00b0 C. and the PNCs were crystallized at 101-103\u00b0 C. The lowered Twas attributed to the strong particlepolymer interaction, which greatly restricted the segmental motion of the polymer chains and inhibited the content of the crystalline structures in the polymer chains. The lowered peak intensity in XRD curves with increasing particle loading together with the crystalline fraction calculated from DSC further confirmed this observation. The broad peak from 125 to 145\u00b0 C. in pure PP curve was due to the melting of the \u03b3-crystals, while this peak was not observed in the PNCs. This observation was quite consistent with the XRD results that the decreased peak intensity at 20=20.07\u00b0 (117) corresponded to a lower content of \u03b3-phase PP in the PNCs.","Table 1 above lists the DSC characteristics of PP and its PNCs.

The PNCs exhibited lower Fas compared to pure PP, except for 5 wt % NPs. The lower Fof the PNCs was attributed to the fact that the NPs are able to disturb the continuity of the polymer matrix and thus introduce more grain boundaries as well as defects, which were also reported previously in high-density polyethylene\/MWCNT composites [Yang 2009, Kodjie 2006] and clay reinforced nylon-6 composites [Fornes 2003].","Magnetic Properties",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0074","num":"0073"},"figref":"FIG. 14","b":"1401","sub":["s","s ","r","c"]},"Accordingly, a surfactant-free in situ method has been found to synthesize multifunctional PNCs with high quality dispersion of NPs. The particle size grows up with the increase of particle loading. Results show that the \u201crheological percolation\u201d was much lower as compared to the \u201celectrical conductivity percolation\u201d owing to the larger effective radius stemmed from the wrapping polymer chains on the particle surface, which also accounts for the uniform dispersion of the NPs. The sharp change in electrical resistivity and dielectric permittivity of the PNCs show high consistency with each other and both confirm the structural transition starting from 5 wt % particle loading, which was due to the formation of the interparticle network structure (percolation threshold). As a result of the polymer-particle interaction and the oxygen trap of the presence of the metal iron, a significant enhancement in thermal stability of around 120\u00b0 C. was observed in the PNCs as compared to the p-PP. The magnetic measurement indicated a soft ferromagnetic behavior of these PNCs.","Polypropylene is a low cost polymer which has been widely used in many applications.
