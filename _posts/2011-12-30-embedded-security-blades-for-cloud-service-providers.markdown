The cloud services may include computation, software, data access, storage services, etc. that physically reside elsewhere (e.g., another computer or the organizations data center) which users can access from their own computer or device over a network. Since sensitive information may be sent to or received from these cloud services, corporate policy may limit access to cloud services depending on the user, device, network, etc. Conventionally, information security and protection is integrated deep within the cloud service applications. Configuration and maintenance of the security policies may be burdensome and possibly inconsistent with cloud service access policies (e.g., governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) policies) set for other cloud services. Thus, cloud service providers are not able to control and validate governance and compliance in a consistent and uniform fashion.","A method and apparatus for embedded security blades for cloud service providers are described. In one embodiment, a policy manager generates a uniform cloud service access policy based on a plurality of access contexts. The policy manager distributes the uniform cloud service access policy to a plurality of security blades, the security blades located within a plurality of cloud services and configured to provide access for a user device to the cloud services based on the uniform cloud services access policy. The access may include overall access to the service itself or granular access to information sent to or from the service.","In one embodiment, the plurality of cloud services may include at least one of public cloud services and private cloud services. The policy manager distribute the uniform cloud service access policy to the public cloud services and private cloud services by providing a common application programming interface (API) to the plurality of security blades. In one embodiment, the plurality of access contexts on which the uniform cloud service access policy is based includes at least one of an identity of a user making the request, a type of the user device, a type of network over which the request was received, and a type of information requested. These contexts or thresholds for these contexts as used in the policy descriptors, may be received from a system administrator. Upon receiving the cloud service access policy, the security blade may receive, from a user device, a request to access a cloud service. The security blade compares a feature of the request to an access policy for the cloud service. If the feature satisfies a condition of the access policy, the security blade grants the user device access to the cloud service.","In addition, a system for embedded security blades for cloud service providers is described. An exemplary system may include a memory and a processor coupled with the memory. In one embodiment, the processor is to generate a uniform cloud service access policy based on a plurality of access contexts. The processor may distribute the uniform cloud service access policy to a plurality of security blades, the security blades located within a plurality of cloud services and configured to provide access for a user device to the cloud services based on the uniform cloud services access policy.","Further, a computer-readable storage medium network for embedded security blades for cloud service providers is described. An exemplary computer readable storage medium provides instructions, which when executed by a processor causes the processor to perform a method such as the exemplary methods discussed above.","The following description sets forth numerous specific details such as examples of specific systems, components, methods, and so forth, in order to provide a good understanding of several embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, however, that at least some embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known components or methods are not described in detail or are presented in simple block diagram format in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present invention. Thus, the specific details set forth are merely exemplary. Particular implementations may vary from these exemplary details and still be contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.","Embodiments of a method and apparatus are described for embedded security blades for cloud service providers. In one embodiment, a policy manager generates a uniform cloud service access policy based on a plurality of access contexts. The policy manager distributes the uniform cloud service access policy to a plurality of security blades, the security blades located within a plurality of cloud services and configured to provide access for a user device to the cloud services based on the uniform cloud services access policy.","In one embodiment, security blades may be software components embedded within a cloud service or may be included in a cloud service as a plug-in. As a plug-in, the security blades may add particular security and policy enforcement functions to the cloud service. The security blades may be created by the service provider that developed or manages the cloud service or by some other developer. The security blades may implement security features that are not part of the underlying cloud service where they are located. The security blades may receive uniform cloud service and information access policies from the policy manager which distributes the same policies to all security blades in the system. This allows for uniform access decisions while at the same time, distributing the decision making and enforcement process so as to alleviate bottlenecking at other points in the network. Cloud service providers can control and drive their access policies from a central cloud service policy manager, while getting the benefit of provider-side security and protection enforcement for improved security, performance and scale.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","100","130","140","130","102","104","130","140","106","106"]},"The user devices ,  may be portable computing devices such as laptop or tablet computers. Other examples of portable computing devices include cellular telephones (e.g., smartphones), personal digital assistants (PDAs), portable media players, netbooks, and the like. The user devices ,  may also be non-portable computing devices such as desktop computers, set-top boxes associated with a television, gaming consoles, and so on. The user devices ,  may be variously configured with different features to enable access to the various cloud services ,  made available by corporate network  and public cloud .","In one embodiment, the user devices are categorized as managed user devices  and unmanaged user devices . Managed user devices  may include devices provided by the organization or corporation that manages corporate network . For example, if a user is an employee of a corporation, the corporation may issue the employee a laptop computer and a smartphone. These devices may or may not be owned by the corporation, but as long as the corporation maintains an element of control over the devices, they may qualify as managed user devices . In some embodiments, the corporation may have control over what applications or programs are installed and run on managed user devices . For example, managed user devices  may have a security agent  installed thereon to monitor data sent to and from the managed user device , to encrypt or decrypt data transmissions, identify threats or suspicious behavior, etc. In other embodiments, the corporation may exert other forms of control over managed user devices .","Unmanaged user devices  include all other user devices that do not qualify as managed user devices . Unmanaged user devices  may include personal devices owned by the user or employee. For example, unmanaged user devices  may include a user's home computer or personal cell phone. Generally, the corporation has no control over what applications and programs are installed and run on unmanaged user devices , and unmanaged user devices  would not typically include security or data loss prevention software, such as security agent . In some embodiments, both managed user devices  and unmanaged user devices  may be used to access various available cloud services.","Cloud computing may refer to the access of computing resources over a computer network. A common shorthand for a cloud computing service (or an aggregation of all existing cloud services) is \u201cthe cloud.\u201d Cloud computing allows for a functional separation between the computing resources used and the physical machine where the user is working. The computing resources may reside in a local network or outside the local network, for example, in an internet connected datacenter. A user may access the resources in the cloud (e.g., corporate network  or public cloud ) using a personal computer (PC), workstation, laptop computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), tablet computer, or the like, including managed user device  and unmanaged user device . The principle behind the cloud is that any computer connected to the Internet, or other network, is connected to the same pool of computing power, applications, and files. For example, users can store and access personal files, such as music, pictures, videos, and bookmarks, play games, or use productivity applications and cloud services on a remote server rather than physically carrying around a storage medium such as a DVD or hard drive.","Since the cloud is the underlying delivery mechanism, cloud based applications and services may support any type of software application or service in use today. All of the development and maintenance tasks involved in provisioning the applications are performed by a service provider (e.g., the corporation). The user's computer may contain very little software or data (perhaps a minimal operating system and web browser only), serving as little more than a display terminal for processes occurring on a network of computers, potentially located far away. Cloud computing frees users from certain hardware and software installation and maintenance tasks through the use of simpler hardware that accesses a vast network of computing resources (processors, servers, data storage devices, etc.). The sharing of resources reduces the cost to individuals and users may routinely use data intensive applications and services driven by cloud technology which were previously unavailable due to cost and deployment complexity.","Corporate network  and public cloud  may each include a group of networked computing resources accessible to the user devices ,  over network . The resources available in corporate network  and public cloud  may include, for example, processing devices, storage devices, applications, or other resources. In one embodiment corporate network  may be a private cloud that is operated solely for a single organization, such as a corporation. Corporate network  may be managed internally by the corporation or by a third-party, and may be hosted internally or externally. Public cloud  may represent cloud computing in the more traditional sense, where resources are dynamically provisioned to the general public on a fine-grained, self service basis. Public cloud  may provide services and resources from a variety of service providers and may be jointly managed by the providers or managed by a third-party.","In one embodiment, corporate network  may include one or more private cloud services . Private cloud services  may include applications or programs made available to users of user devices , . Private cloud services  may include services created by the organization that manages corporate network  (e.g., the corporation) and\/or services created by a third party, but provided and managed by the corporation for its users (e.g., employees). Private cloud services  may include, for example, an email service, a document management service, a customer relationship management (CRM) service, a video communication service, or some other cloud service. Select users may be afforded access to private cloud services  in corporate network  using managed user devices  or unmanaged user devices  over network .","In one embodiment, public cloud  may include one or more public cloud services . Public cloud services  may include applications or programs made available to users of user devices , . Public cloud services  may include services created, provided and managed by a variety of different organizations or service providers. Each public cloud service  may be used by a user for either personal or business purposes, and some public cloud services  may be used for both purposes. Public cloud services  may include similar and\/or different services as private cloud services , such as for example, an email service, a document management service, a social networking service, a customer relationship management (CRM) service, or some other cloud service. When compared to corporate network , a larger portion of users (or in one embodiment, all users of the Internet) may be afforded access to public cloud services  in public cloud  using managed user devices  or unmanaged user devices .","Network architecture  may also be designed with certain features to protect access to private services and sensitive information maintained by an organization. Sensitive information may be stored in a structured form such as a database, a spreadsheet, etc., and may include, for example, customer, employee, patient or pricing data. In addition, sensitive information may include unstructured data such as design plans, source code, financial reports, human resources reports, customer or patient reports, pricing documentation, corporate mergers and acquisitions documentation, government (e.g. Securities and Exchange Commission) filings, and any other sensitive information that requires restricted user access. In one embodiment, network security may be implemented by intelligence center , and a series of one or more security gateways , ,  and one or more security blades , , , .","The security features may protect confidential information using policies, which may be controlled by policy manager  in intelligence center . In one embodiment, intelligence center  may be a computing system or a series of computing systems managed, for example, by the organization which manages corporate network . In one embodiment, intelligence center  may be separate from corporate network  as shown, however, in other embodiments, intelligence center  may be implemented using computing resources inside corporate network . Additional details of policy manager  are provided below with respect to .","The design of the security features may allow a user or system administrator to define, aggregate and enforce identity, device, information and service centric policies in a uniform, consistent fashion irrespective of whether a user accesses a cloud service with their personal or corporate credentials, from a managed or unmanaged device, from a known or unknown network, or for personal or corporate related purposes. The system combines a cloud federated single sign-on (SSO) solution with the information gateways , ,  and security blades , , ,  and the capability to grant or decline cloud service access and\/or information access\/transfer\/transformation based on an individual's validated identity, device and network context (e.g. managed device through an unknown network), information classification policy context and the cloud service context (e.g. web portal vs. financial management application).","The information gateways , ,  and security blades , , ,  may serve as policy enforcement points to enforce the policies set by policy manager . For example, a request to access a cloud service, such as private cloud service  or public cloud service , may be passed through one of the information gateways. The information gateway may compare the request to the conditions of the applicable policy, and enforce an action based on the result of the comparison. The action may include, for example, allowing the request, denying the request, modifying the request, or some other action. In one embodiment, network architecture  may include one or more information gateways located at various different locations. For example, information gateway  may be connected to or be a part of network . Communication between the user devices ,  and corporate network  and public cloud  may be enabled via any communication infrastructure. One example of such an infrastructure includes a combination of a wide area network (WAN) and wireless infrastructure, which allows a user to access the could services. The wireless infrastructure may be provided by one or multiple wireless communications systems. In one embodiment, the wireless communication system may be a wireless fidelity (WiFi) hotspot connected with the network . The wireless communication system may also be a wireless carrier system that can be implemented using various data processing equipment, communication towers, etc. Alternatively, or in addition, the wireless carrier system may rely on satellite technology to exchange information with the user devices , . Information gateway  may implemented as part of this infrastructure, such that all communications are able to be intercepted by the gateway .","In another embodiment, information gateways may be alternatively or additionally located within corporate network , such as gateway , and within public cloud , such as gateway . In addition, cloud services, including private cloud services  and public cloud services , may include security blades, , , , , as shown. Security blades , , ,  may be embedded with the associated cloud service and provide enforcement for the access policies provided by policy manager  and\/or cloud service specific policies defined by the cloud service provider (and provided by policy manager ). Since all network traffic passes through one of the gateways or security blades, during peak times of high traffic, a bottleneck may form reducing response times. Placing the gateways ,  within corporate network  and public cloud  respectively, and security blades within the cloud services can alleviate this bottleneck, because the amount of traffic passing through each gateway or security blade is reduced. For example, gateway  need only handle traffic intended for private cloud services  and gateway  need only handle traffic intended for public cloud services . Similarly, security blade  need only handle traffic intended for its private cloud service  and security blade  need only handle traffic intended for its public cloud service . In addition, the security blades , , ,  located within the cloud services allow for uniform enforcement of access policies defined by policy manager , despite separate management and\/or creation of the cloud services. Also, the uniform enforcement prevents a user or system administrator from having to individually set cloud and information security controls at each cloud service, which may be difficult and time consuming in a large system. Additional details of information gateways , ,  and security blades , , ,  are provided below with respect to , respectively.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0035","num":"0034"},"figref":"FIG. 2A","b":["122","120","122","202","204","206","208","122","240"]},"Policy manager may be responsible for defining and managing a set of policies defining access to the various cloud services in a network, such as private could services  and public could services . The resulting policies may be stored in data store , for example, as cloud services access policies . The policies  may be specifically defined for certain access requests or indirectly defined based on a number of factors or contexts. For example, a request that has a certain combination of factors may be treated according to a certain policy. The policies  may be created or defined, for example, by a user, system administrator, or other person or entity.","Identity context module  is concerned with the identity of the user making a request to access a cloud service and\/or cloud information. Regardless of the device used to make the request (e.g., managed user device  or unmanaged user device ), a user may identify himself using login credentials. The login credentials may include, for example, a user name and password. In one embodiment, the login credentials are part of a single sign-on (SSO) system. SSO is a property of access control of multiple related, but independent software systems (e.g., private cloud services  and public cloud services ). With SSO, the user logs in once and gains access to all (or a certain subset) of the services without being prompted to log in again at each of them. As different services may support different authentication mechanisms, using SSO, the security gateway may internally translate and store different credentials compared to what is used for the initial SSO login.","In one embodiment, the login credentials provided by the user may vary depending on his status. For example, the user may have a certain user name or login if he is a member of a first group, such as being an employee of the corporation that manages corporate network . If the user is not a member of the first group, he may have a different set of login credentials, identifying him as such. In addition, the login credentials may provide other information about the user, such as rank, title, position, or other information. Identity context module  may interpret different forms of login information to determine the associated identity of a user with those login credentials, and define a corresponding policy. For example, in one embodiment, only users who are employees of the corporation may be allowed to access private cloud services , while non-employees are denied access.","Device and network context module  is concerned with the type and status of device and network from which a request to access a cloud service is made. As discussed above, user devices are generally categorized as managed user devices  or unmanaged user devices , including publicly shared user devices. The corporation, or other organization, may have some element of control over managed user device , such as requiring that some security software be installed on the managed user device , such as security agent . Security agent  may ensure that the information transferred to and from managed user device  is safe and secure. Thus, in one embodiment, device and network context module  may define a policy that allows any communication from a managed user device  to private or corporate cloud services . Requests to access cloud services from an unmanaged user device  may be denied, according to the policy. In another embodiment, the policy may dictate that such requests from unmanaged user devices  be additionally encrypted or otherwise secured.","The network  through which the request to access a cloud service is made may also be considered by device and network context module . Network , may be for example, a secured or unsecured LAN, a WAN, a mobile telecommunications network, or some other network. Device and network context module  may define certain access policies  based on the type of network as well. For example, only requests from secure networks may be granted access to private cloud services . In another embodiment, the location of the network may also be considered when defining the policy. For example, a request made over a wireless network in the United States may be allowed access to certain cloud services, while a request made over a wireless network in Europe may only be granted for a different set of cloud services.","Information context module  is concerned with the type of information which is requested to or sent from a cloud service. The information may be classified in any number of different ways, such as corporate or personal, confidential or public, critical or non-critical, etc. Information context module  may define certain access policies  based on the type of information being communicated. Each of the different contexts, including the information context, may be combined with one or more other contexts when defining the policies . In one embodiment, with respect to the information context, a policy may allow corporate data only to be received by a managed user device  or sent only to an employee of the corporation.","Cloud service context module  is concerned with the type of cloud service for which access is requested. As discussed above, cloud services are generally categorized as private cloud services  or public cloud services . Private cloud services  may include services created by the organization that manages corporate network  (e.g., the corporation) and\/or services created by a third party, but provided and managed by the corporation for its users (e.g., employees). Public cloud services  may include services created, provided and managed by a variety of different organizations or service providers. The cloud service context may also be affected by the type of service requests (e.g., read, write, delete) as well as a service subdomain (e.g., the scope of the requested information) as determined by a more granular URL or URI. The policies  may allow access to the different cloud services based on any combination of one or more of the other contexts. For example, a policy may only allow access to private cloud services  from a managed user device  or over a secured network. One of skill in the art would recognize that there are many other possible combinations that could form the policies beyond those described herein.","In one embodiment, policy manager  creates and manages the policies, such as cloud services access policies  and distributes them to the policy enforcement points (e.g., gateways , ,  and security blades , , , ). The policies may be sent to the enforcement points periodically, according to a predefined schedule, each time a change or update is made to one of the policies , or in response to a request from a user or system administrator. This may ensure that the gateways , ,  and security blades , , ,  are able to make access decisions based on the most recent up-to-date policies.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0044","num":"0043"},"figref":["FIG. 2B","FIG. 2A"],"b":["250","250","122"]},"Referring to , at block , method  receives context information from a system user or administrator.
