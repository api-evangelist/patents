title: Configuring a computer system for a software package installation
abstract: A request from an installer of a software application to configure the computer system for installation of the software application is received at a configuration client. Upon receiving the request, a message is sent to a local agent of the computer system to request a configuration for the installation of the software application. The message includes an identifier of the software application used by a configuration management server to identify the configuration corresponding to the software application. A configuration element is received from the local agent in response to the message. The configuration element includes a variable for holding a value that represents a characteristic of the computer system. The value of the variable is configured as a function of the computer system. The configuration element, including the configured variable value, is provided to the installer of the software application and is used for the installation of the software application.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["RELATED APPLICATIONS","BACKGROUND","BRIEF SUMMARY","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["This application claims priority to and claims the benefit of European Patent Application Serial No. EP10168326.6 titled \u201cSYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONFIGURING A COMPUTER SYSTEM FOR A SOFTWARE PACKAGE INSTALLATION,\u201d which was filed in the European Patent Office on Jul. 2, 2010, and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.","The present invention relates to a method and system for configuring a computer system for the installation of a software application package.","Administrators of information technology (IT) environments must manage an ever-increasing number of computing devices. They must often install software applications on the computing devices they manage to apply the latest security patches or to deploy a mandatory application. The great numbers and the diversity of the computing devices to manage make it very difficult to deploy the installation of all the computing devices in a consistent manner. Furthermore, different installation methods must be supported by automated installation processes as users are more and more reluctant to perform such installations themselves.","A method for configuring a computer system includes receiving, at a configuration client, a request from an installer of a software application to configure the computer system for installation of the software application; in response to receiving the request, sending a message to a local agent of the computer system to request a configuration for the installation of the software application, the message comprising an identifier of the software application used by a configuration management server to identify the configuration corresponding to the software application; receiving a configuration element from the local agent in response to the message, the configuration element comprising a variable for holding a value that represents a characteristic of the computer system; configuring the value of the variable as a function of the computer system; and providing the configuration element comprising the configured variable value to the installer of the software application, where the configuration element is used for the installation of the software application.","An apparatus for configuring a computer system includes a communication interface and a processor programmed to receive, at a configuration client via the communication interface, a request from an installer of a software application to configure the computer system for installation of the software application; in response to receiving the request, send a message via the communication interface to a local agent of the computer system to request a configuration for the installation of the software application, the message comprising an identifier of the software application used by a configuration management server to identify the configuration corresponding to the software application; receive a configuration element from the local agent in response to the message, the configuration element comprising a variable for holding a value that represents a characteristic of the computer system; configure the value of the variable as a function of the computer system; and provide the configuration element comprising the configured variable value to the installer of the software application, where the configuration element is used for the installation of the software application.","A computer program product includes a computer readable storage medium including computer readable program code, where the computer readable program code when executed on a computer causes the computer to receive, at a configuration client, a request from an installer of a software application to configure the computer system for installation of the software application; in response to receiving the request, send a message to a local agent of the computer system to request a configuration for the installation of the software application, the message comprising an identifier of the software application used by a configuration management server to identify the configuration corresponding to the software application; receive a configuration element from the local agent in response to the message, the configuration element comprising a variable for holding a value that represents a characteristic of the computer system; configure the value of the variable as a function of the computer system; and provide the configuration element comprising the configured variable value to the installer of the software application, where the configuration element is used for the installation of the software application.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0012","num":"0011"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"],"b":["100","110","120","130","140","150","160","150","170","165","180","185"]},"The local agent () retrieves the configuration () from the management server (). The management server () may be accessed either locally or through the network (). The software application to be installed is grouped so as to form a software application package () or archive. The software application may be compressed in this archive or package or may be left uncompressed. The software application may also be encrypted to increase the security of the installation process.","The software application package () includes all or most of the binaries, libraries and\/or components that are required for the software application, and may be installed on the client device (). The installation of the software application includes copying the required components or libraries to a particular location so that they may be later accessed by the computer system and executed. The installation of the software application very often also includes configuring some components of the software application that depend on the technical or business environment in which the client device () operates, the particular configuration of the client device () itself, the account that is used to install the software application, the user that would use the software application, or other information provided by the user which corresponds to user preferences. The user preferences may be defined during the installation or may be preconfigured by the user and stored in the configuration repository (). The configuration of the software application on the client device () thus involves modifying some files included in the software application package () and\/or creating new files that may then be copied onto the client device () and used by an installer of the software application package () or by the software application itself during execution. The file is modified or created by the configuration, and may be in text or binary format. The files may have any structure, such as XML, as long as the files may be recognized by the software component using them.","The configuration () may hold various data, such as an Internet protocol (IP) address or host name of the client device () or of another computer system that may be used during the execution or the installation of the software application, a location (e.g., in the form of a uniform resource locator (URL)) where the software application package may be temporary stored for the installation, and\/or a location where the software application may be stored for execution. The location(s) corresponding to the storage space may be either local or remote.","The configuration () may also include a set of preconfigured data, for example stored centrally in the configuration repository () in the form of configuration metadata (). Such preconfigured data may include a policy for using the software application, a counter of the number of instances of software application that are installed on the same network (), technical requirements that the client device () must match so that the software application may execute successfully on the client device (), minimum rights that a user must have to be able to use the software application, etc.","The configuration () may also hold data such as a location from which the software application package () may be retrieved, installation specific information such as the number of retries authorized for an installation, maximum duration for the installation, and lists of software components that are prerequisites for the installation and\/or for the execution of the software application.","The configuration may further include scripts or other software complements to automatically discover characteristics of the client device () or computer system on which the installation will be performed. The characteristics to be discovered may be a pre-existing configuration of a preinstalled version of the software application. The configuration metadata () may take various forms such as extensible markup language (XML), or a table in a database, flat files, etc., and may be imported into the system during the registration of the software application to the management server ().","The installation of the software application may be performed by a local installer or by an infrastructure deployment component (), a specialized component enabled to retrieve the software application package () from a remote location automatically in response to messages sent from a remote server, such as the management server () in . The software application may also be installed by a remote push installation performed by a system administrator using a management interface, or on demand where the local agent () downloads the software application and installs it at runtime. The local agent () may have a very small footprint and may provide a small set of basic functionality. The local agent () may not provide any specialized system management function, but may instead operate as a bootstrap component with the behavior of a hosting environment for the other components of the architecture.","This large variety of possible installation methods provides an ability to configure the software application in an easy and consistent way. Such configuration may take into account the fact that a user may not always be available to answer specific details of the configuration during installation. This is particularly the case for an installation on demand or during a silent installation. This is important to isolate the configuration of the software application from the actual deployment of the software application.","The configuration client () may be accessible from the infrastructure deployment component () as well as the software application local installer () using the same application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform the configuration. The configuration of installation of the software application may be managed by the configuration client (). The infrastructure deployment component () as well as the software application local installer () are able to pass messages to further customize the configuration.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["200","210","220","230","240","250","201","230","255","200","262","295","244","265","264","246","266"]},"Main memory  in accordance with the certain implementations includes data , and an operating system . Computer system  may utilize virtual addressing mechanisms that allow the programs of computer system  to behave as if they only have access to a large, single storage entity instead of access to multiple, smaller storage entities such as main memory  and HDD . Therefore, while data  and operating system  are shown stored in the main memory , they may or may not be stored in main memory  at the same time. It should also be noted that the term \u201cmemory\u201d is used herein to generically refer to the entire virtual memory of computer system .","Data  represents any data that serves as input to and\/or output from any program in computer system . Operating system  may include a multitasking operating system, such as OS\/400\u00ae. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the spirit and scope of the present invention is not limited to any one operating system.","Processor  may be constructed from one or more microprocessors and\/or integrated circuits. Processor  executes program instructions stored in main memory . Main memory  stores programs and data that processor  may access. When computer system  starts up, processor  initially executes the program instructions that make up operating system . Operating system  is a sophisticated program that manages the resources of computer system . Some of these resources are processor , main memory , mass storage interface , display interface , network interface , and system bus .","Although computer system  is shown to contain only a single processor and a single system bus, multiple processors and\/or multiple buses may be used. In addition, the interfaces used in certain embodiments each include separate, fully programmed microprocessors that are used to off-load compute-intensive processing from processor . However, the present subject matter applies equally to computer systems that use I\/O adapters to perform similar functions.","Display interface  is used to directly connect one or more displays  to computer system . These displays , which may be non-intelligent (e.g., dumb) terminals or fully programmable workstations, are used to allow system administrators and users to communicate with computer system . Note, however, that while display interface  is provided to support communication with one or more displays , computer system  does not necessarily require a display , because all needed interaction with users and other processes may occur via network interface .","Network interface  is used to connect other computer systems and\/or workstations (e.g.,  in ) to computer system  across a network . The present subject matter applies equally no matter how computer system  may be connected to other computer systems and\/or workstations, regardless of whether the network connection  is made using present-day analogue and\/or digital techniques or via some networking mechanism of the future. In addition, many different network protocols may be used to implement a network. These protocols may include specialized computer programs that allow computers to communicate across network . Transmission control protocol\/Internet protocol (TCP\/IP) is an example of a suitable network protocol, for example over an Ethernet network. As shown, the network  connects the computer system  to two further devices  and , which may be other computer systems similar to that described above, or other network capable devices such as printers, routers etc. In the present example, network device  is a local server, which is connected via a modem  to a public network  such as the word wide web. By means of this public network  a connection to a remote device or system  may be established.","At this point, it should be noted that, while the present subject matter has been and will continue to be described in the context of a fully functional computer system, the present subject matter is capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that the present subject matter applies equally regardless of the particular type of interconnection used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of suitable interconnection include: recordable type media such as floppy disks and CD ROM (e.g.,  of ), and transmission type media such as digital and analog communications links.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","310","320","330","340","350","360","370"]},"Referring again to , the configuration client () receives the request to obtain the configuration () of a software application package () by the software application local installer () or the infrastructure deployment component (). The configuration client () then sends a message to the local agent () to request the configuration () for the installation of said software application. The message includes an identifier of the software application to be installed. The local agent () forwards the request to the management server (). It may augment the message with information specific to the client device () such as its host name, its number of central processing units (CPUs), etc. The management server () processes the request and retrieves from the configuration repository () the corresponding configuration metadata () including information required to configure the installation of the software application. The configuration client () receives () the configuration () from the management server () through the local agent (). The configuration () may take the form of one or several files, in text or binary form. The configuration () may also be an extensible markup language (XML) file, optionally associated to other files for validating its structure (such as an extensible stylesheet language (XSL) or a document type definition or declaration (DTD) file), or any text file structure or unstructured.","The configuration client () analyzes the configuration () to identify at least one variable that needs to be set using local data on the target computer system. The local agent () analyzes () the client device () and completes () the configuration () file with the local data either discovered on the target system using scripts for example or received from the user during installation of the software application. User inputs may be provided through a user interface during installation or, prior to the installation, as user preferences in the configuration repository (). Once the configuration is completed, the configuration client () provides () the configuration () for installation of the software application to the software application local installer () or to the infrastructure deployment component (). To that end it may write a configuration () file to a predefined location, or send a message to the installing program (e.g., the application local installer  or the infrastructure deployment component ).","For discovering the characteristic of the computer system to complete the configuration file, the local agent () may look for a predefined set of characteristics such as the client device () hostname or Internet protocol (IP) address, the remaining storage left on the hard disc, etc., or it may execute a script providing information received from the management server (). The script may also be included in the configuration metadata () and then in the configuration file () so that it may be used by the configuration client ().","Another example may include a method and system for configuring a computer system for the installation of a software application by a local or remote installer and performing full configuration by integrating data from the local system and from any remote configuration repository.","An advantage of the present subject matter is that a large number of software application installations may be managed centrally and deployed on remote devices taking into account the local configuration of the device. A further advantage is that the configuration method may leverage configuration data that may only be resolved locally at installation time, and may not be pre-configured and stored in a central server.","A variable may be used to hold a uniform resource locator (URL) of a folder for storing temporarily data required for the installation of the software application. An advantage is that a temporary location for storing the installation package may be determined at installation time and it is not necessary to pre-configure this information at the central server level for all the possible variations of such value.","Additionally, a step of discovering a characteristic of the computer system by the local agent, and, at the step of configuring, the value of the variable may be set to the value of the characteristic by the local agent after the discovery step. An advantage is that the configuration data may take into account specific computer environments that may not be anticipated when the software application is prepared for deployment.","Further, the characteristic discovered by the local agent may include the host name or the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer system. An advantage is that such information may be used for statistics or compliance reasons, such as to count the number of active instances of a particular software application and to identify the systems on which they are installed.","As a further example, the configuration element may include data retrieved from a remote configuration repository. An advantage is that a part of the configuration data may be set centrally thus minimizing the need for user input at the installation time.","Additionally, the configuration element may further include a second variable for holding a value dependent on the software application. An advantage is that parameters specific to the software application being installed may be taken into account.","As yet another example, the value of the second variable may depend on the computer system and the software application. An advantage is that the configuration data may be further refined to take into account specific cases in a system managed centrally.","Further, the second variable may hold a uniform resource locator (URL) of a folder where the software application is to be installed. An advantage is that user preferences, perhaps defined centrally, may be taken into account.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, aspects of the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer readable program code embodied thereon.","Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein, for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.","Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or any suitable combination of the foregoing.","Computer program code for carrying out operations for aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java\u00ae, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","Aspects of the present invention have been described with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable storage medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable storage medium produce an article of manufacture including instructions which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures.

It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and\/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.","A data processing system suitable for storing and\/or executing program code will include at least one processor coupled directly or indirectly to memory elements through a system bus. The memory elements can include local memory employed during actual execution of the program code, bulk storage, and cache memories which provide temporary storage of at least some program code in order to reduce the number of times code must be retrieved from bulk storage during execution.","Input\/output or I\/O devices (including but not limited to keyboards, displays, pointing devices, etc.) can be coupled to the system either directly or through intervening I\/O controllers.","Network adapters may also be coupled to the system to enable the data processing system to become coupled to other data processing systems or remote printers or storage devices through intervening private or public networks.
