Cups were covered with a reusable screened lid. Test plants were maintained in a growth room at about 25\u00b0 C. and about 20-40% relative humidity for 3 days, avoiding direct exposure to fluorescent light (24 hour photoperiod) to prevent trapping of heat inside the cup.

Potted rice seedlings were sprayed with 5 ml test solution, air dried, placed in cages and inoculated with 10 adults. Treated rice plants were kept at about 28-29\u00b0 C. and relative humidity of about 50-60%. Percent mortality was recorded after 72 hours.","In this test, compounds E1.2, E1.8, E1.15, E1.18, E1.19, E1.27, E1.32, E1.36, E1.37, E1.39, E1.40, E1.45, E1.48, E2.2, E2.3 and E2.16 at 500 ppm showed at least 75% mortality in comparison with untreated controls.","B.9 Rice Brown Plant Hopper ()","Rice seedlings were cleaned and washed 24 hours before spraying.

Different concentrations of formulated compounds were sprayed onto the insect diet at 5 \u03bcl, using a custom built micro atomizer, at two replications.","After application, microtiter plates were incubated at about 28\u00b11\u00b0 C. and about 80\u00b15% relative humidity for 5 days. Egg and larval mortality was then visually assessed.","In this test, compounds E1.19, E2.3 and E2.6 at 800 ppm showed over 75% mortality in comparison with untreated controls."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"DETDESC":[{},{}],"heading":["EXAMPLES","S.
