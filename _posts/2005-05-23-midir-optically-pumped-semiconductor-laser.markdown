In order to accomplish this, diodes must include layers, which are doped either positive or negative. These doped cladding layers are low index materials that act as a waveguide to confine the laser's optical mode from spreading much beyond the active region and they are very good absorbers of the laser light. These characteristics keep the optical mode from touching the epitaxial bonding surface.","In contrast, the optically pumped semiconductor laser (OPSEL) is fundamentally different in that it does not require the presence of doped layers for operation. Furthermore, the substrate materials must be transparent to the pump laser wavelengths. This leads to a simplified layered structure in which the active layer has very weak index guiding. The broadened waveguide allows for the formation of a very wide optical mode whose transverse dimension extends far beyond the active and waveguide region. Since this wide mode can reach the physical limit of the semiconductor structure, it can touch the bonding metallization and incur significant optical loss and reduced power output. It is this problem, unique to the structure of an OPSEL, with a broadened waveguide design that is addressed herein.","High powered, optically pumped semiconductor lasers operating in the mid-IR range (2-10 microns) generate a large amount of heat that must be dissipated.  shows a typical GaSb-based OPSEL structure in cross-section with an added waveguide mode isolation layer. The laser is optically pumped by another laser from the top (not shown). The structure is comprised of a substrate , an active region  where the mid-IR laser light is generated, an upper clad layer , a waveguide mode isolation layer , and a protective cap . The different layers of a typical OPSEL structure may be grown in a molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) chamber on a GaSb substrate . The laser active region  (light emitting region) may then be deposited on the substrate followed by a thicker layer of GaSb , a thin mode-blocking layer  (0.02-0.2 \u03bcm), and then a thin cap layer . The mode-blocker layer  may be comprised of any material that is lattice matched or nearly lattice matched to the upper clad layer  and has an approximate 0.5 lower index of refraction (0.3 to 0.7) than the upper clad layer. In the example given, the waveguide mode isolation layer may be comprised of a Al(x)Ga(1\u2212x)As(y)Sb(1\u2212y) compound where x is approximately 0.90. The index of refraction of this layer may be between 3.2 and 3.3.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0013","num":"0012"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["7","6","7"]},"Two methods have been used in the past to isolate the laser's optical mode from the bonding material or metal in optically pumped mid-IR lasers. The first uses a combination of bonding metals with the correct refractive properties such that if the laser's optical mode touches these metals, no increase in loss will occur. The drawback of this method is that the correct metallization must be determined and used or the waveguide loss will increase and the laser power will be decreased. The second method is to mount the laser epitaxial side up and pressure bond a diamond block\/heat sink on the epitaxial side. The disadvantages of this method are that the optical pump beam is reflected at the diamond surface and the contact quality must be very good. Additional mounting hardware is also necessary to achieve the final heat-sinked semiconductor package. Epitaxial up mounting also cannot be used when the laser is run under thermally stressing conditions such as high duty cycle or quasi-CW operation",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0015","num":"0014"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","11"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 2","FIG. 3"],"sup":["\u22121 ","\u22121 "]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"maths":{"@attributes":{"id":"MATH-US-00001","num":"00001"},"math":{"@attributes":{"overflow":"scroll"},"mtable":{"mtr":{"mtd":[{"mfrac":{"mrow":[{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"l"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"r"}}}},{"mrow":{"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"l"},"mo":"\u2062","mrow":{"mi":"log","mo":"\u2061","mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mfrac":{"mn":"1","mi":"r"}}}},"mo":"+","mi":"a"}]}},{"mrow":{"mo":["(",")"],"mn":"1"}}]}}}},"br":{}},"To experimentally test the effectiveness of the waveguide mode isolation layer two similar devices were grown and compared.
