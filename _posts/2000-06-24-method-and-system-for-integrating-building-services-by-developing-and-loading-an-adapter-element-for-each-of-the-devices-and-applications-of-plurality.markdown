{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/142,321, filed on Jul. 2, 1999.","This invention relates to computers and communication systems. More particularly, the present invention relates to system adaptation, embedded systems, device and service interconnection, computers, software systems, and communication networks for a method and system of integrated building services.","Many computer systems have been integrated into the modern business office with the goal if increasing efficiency. However, in many instances, the goal of increased efficiency was not met because the mundane tasks subject to office automation were simply transferred from paper to the computer systems, and in many cases, the cognitive load placed on the office worker actually increased. There is a need in the art to better integrate office automation with the office environment itself to realize the increased efficiency desired.","It is an aspect of the present invention to provide personalized elimination of mundane office processes and services for office users across geographically distributed Building Elements.","Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a single integrated building containing office support services such as secure building, office suite, and other building resource access.","Still another aspect of the invention is to provide an inter-networked integrated building facility, device and service interconnection network interface, architecture of integrated office service facilities, and device adapter modules.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0016","num":"0015"},"figref":["FIG. 1","FIG. 1"]},"Because of the need to increase efficiency, computer systems experienced rapid uptake in the business office. However, looking at the creative efficiency picture today, the expected gains in terms of real additional time available for creative work are realized only to a small degree. This plateau was quickly reached because the office support automation revolution simply transferred the mundane activities from paper to the computer. In many cases, efficiency is decreased due to the increased cognitive load placed on the office worker by arcane, poorly integrated technology. For large organizations, with several buildings in a cluster, or multiple building locations throughout a city or across several states, this is even more the case.","The next level of creative efficiency is achieved by the present invention which integrates and merges office automation technology with the office environment itself in such a transparent way that the machinery is no longer even visible to the office worker. The mundane tasks are accomplished by the building itself. The novel approach taken looks at the problem from the point of view of the user inward, and not from the traditional approach of a back-end view of the system outward. The architecture utilized works from the outside in, from a user prospective, and then performs integration on the back end versus the other way around.","Accordingly, the present invention is a system and method that provides personalized elimination of mundane office processes and services for office users across geographically distributed Building Elements . Building Elements  may be located adjacent to each other, across town from each other, in different cities, in different states, or in different countries. Utilizing the Public Internet , or any other suitable communications network, and Communications Channels , each Building Element  is interconnected to each other Building Elements . Communications Channels  may be wire, fiber optic, wireless, or any other suitable communications channel. Examples include DSL, T1, T2, T3, etc.","Server  is accessed by each Building Element  and may be located in a physical location separate from any Building Element , or may be located within a Building Element . There may also be multiple Servers  located in separate physical locations or within several Building Elements . An individual Building Element  with a Server  may also utilize the present invention.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 2"]},"Within Building Element , External Communications Interface  connects Building Element  to Public Internet  via Communications Channel . The various elements within Building  are connected to External Communications Interface , as well as to each other, via Interconnection Channel . Interconnection Channel  may be telephone wire, coaxial cable, fiber optic, wireless, Ethernet, or any other suitable communication channel, or combinations of any of the above.","Elements of the invention contained within the office building embody the invention's service process execution machinery. These elements and their relationships are organized in such a way as to allow unprecedented levels of automated office facility integration.","Typical facilities include Client Devices , MIS (Management Information System) Application , and Service Devices . For each Client Device , Service Device , and MIS Application , there is a corresponding Adapter Element , which is an interface between the particular object and a standardized system that ties them all together. Adapter Elements  are software components that reside on Server , and are not physically located adjacent to Client Devices , Service Devices , and MIS Application  but are shown this way in  to illustrate the interconnectedness of each component to the standardized system.","Client Applications  are applications written from the outset that automatically tie into the integrated building services system, and may reside within Building Element , or be accessible from an external location through Public Internet . Such client applications include custom travel arrangement services, meeting and resource scheduling, copy center, computer based training, health monitoring services, member Intranet, view account, and automatic personal adaptable environment controls. Personal climate controlled settings are transferable with the user from one Building Element  to another via the access security devices.","For example, a media center application allows a user to copy documents and publish documents remotely. Automated media center services include: remote access, copy services, worldwide distribution, and on-site custom work orders. A user who has a document on his personal computer can access the media center application and provide instructions to print a certain number of copies, request an ink color, request that a copy be sent to a list of specified locations, and specify the database that has the address information for the list of recipients.","Examples of Client Devices  are personal computers, personal digital assistants, office telephones, and cellular telephones. The personal computers are connected to Interconnection Channel , which may be a LAN or Ethernet. The telephone signals are also integrated into the system so that local telephone calls and long-distance charges are managed by the system. Office suite telephony, shared teleconferencing service, Internet access, and standard Internet services are all integrated into the system. Standard office software functionality, including integrated word processing, presentation development, spreadsheet, database management, file system facilities and automated file backup and restore processes are also integrated into the system.","Examples of Service Devices  include vending machines, access security devices, printers, copiers, fax machines, health and exercise equipment, bio-metric monitors, and point of sale devices. For instance, a soft drink vending machine sitting in a hallway within Building Element  is plugged into the wall for its power but it also has a card reader instead of a change receiver and dispenser. A phone line connects the card reader of the soft drink machine to Interconnection Channel  to Server . When a user swipes an authorized magnetic card through the card reader, a signal carrying a unique access ID travels over the phone line to Interconnection Channel  to Server . The Adapter Element  associated with the soft drink machine interprets the access ID from the signal, searches a database of access ID's for a match, and if a match is found, debits the user's account associated with the access ID, and sends an authorization signal to the soft drink machine to allow the release mechanism to release the soft drink from the vending machine. If no match is found, then a deny signal is sent to the soft drink machine to not allow the release mechanism to function. A similar scenario takes place when the magnetic card is swiped through a card reader for a security door. If a match is found for the access ID, an authorization signal is sent to allow the door mechanism to let the door open, though an account may not be debited when a match is found in this case.","Another example of a Service Device  is a point of sale device. A magnetic swipe card or smart card or Java ring is utilized by a user or a customer to purchase goods or services, which are debited to the user or customer's account. A hotel or a golf course could issue a card to a customer, and have a card reader at each point of sale location on the premises. For example, each golf cart could be equipped with a reader and a wireless transmitter. To rent the cart the customer just swipes his card through the reader, and his account is debited for the cart rental. Likewise, purchases at a gift shop or restaurant in a hotel could be made with the card and reader. Each purchase is debited to the guest's account.","Examples of MIS Application  include integrated enterprise resource planning and management information systems. These systems comprise support for standard business functions such as accounting, general ledger, receivables, payables, asset management, budget, purchasing, billing, payroll, inventory, human resources, economic monitoring, decision support, order management, and inventory, etc. Remote secure access by integrated office support staff is enabled via Public Internet  to building automated management facilities. Intelligent Agent scheduling, tracking, confirmation, contacts, etc. is also enabled.","This new organization is possible because of recent advances in the international standardization of software component interfaces and integration technology. An exemplary reference is Sun Microsystems Java programming language incorporating the following: Java Virtual Machine; standard Java application programming interface libraries; Java component specifications such as Enterprise Java Beans and associated component server technology such as Java applets and Java servlets; and impromptu networking interface standards such as Jini and JavaSpaces. The present invention extends these standards and available compliant commercial technologies by defining classes of office services as universal polymorphic interface Adapter Elements  to ad hoc machinery and software. Adapter Elements  are used to encapsulate arbitrary office support equipment and software services into a uniform distributed device space. Adapted and newly developed services and devices may be plugged into Interconnection Channel  and automatically begin participating in the community of office functionality.","The present invention provides a single integrated building containing office support services such as secure building, office suite, and other building resource access. Personal identification for access to secured building resources is accomplished through a combination of mechanisms collocated with the secured resource. These mechanisms consist of either physical or digital identity sensors.","A magnetic stripe card may be utilized. Or, to avoid the wear over time associated with a magnetic stripe card, smart cards or other proximity devices, such as a Java ring, may be used. The smart card and Java ring have some of the computing built into the device and they do not come into direct contact with the device that reads them due to the wireless or infrared technology employed.","In the case of digital identity sensors, the office user requesting access must possess a digital identification device. The sensor mechanisms communicate with the integrated office security service via Interconnection Channel  interface using identical protocols. This is accomplished by encapsulating the sensors with a corresponding Adapter Element .","Various types of physical identity sensors may be utilized, including hand geometry, retinal scan, and voice signature sensors. Commercially available wearable embedded Java computing technology such as smart cards and Java rings may be used. The wearable technology is extended by the development of software programs that run on the embedded devices, which interact with the digital identity sensors.","All office services may be tailored to user preferences. Tailoring is conveniently accomplished through interaction between the user and software preference wizard agents. Services are encapsulated with standard interconnection behaviors using the Interconnection Channel  and Adapter Elements , allowing the underlying implementation of any service or device to be changed without affecting the behavior of the whole system. The encapsulation feature also provides for the seamless integration of many additional service facilities.","As shown in , a plurality of Building Elements  may be connected together over wide area networks. Office user preferences are continuously maintained in all integrated Building Elements .","Many additional services may also be integrated into the system including personalized fitness center programs and automated, voice progress monitoring. Personal health monitoring systems that capture and transmit biological data to control hardware and software may be placed in convenient locations within the building, such as rest rooms, break rooms, and office suites. This data could be securely transmitted by the user to his doctor at the user's discretion.","Other services include adaptive intelligent personal software agents that perform routine system functions for office users. These agents adapt dynamically to the preferences of the office user. Each office user's personalized agents will be available at all integrated Building Elements . Categories of agent function include: electronic commerce, knowledge domain expertise, newsgathering, general and specialized web searching, stock market monitoring, and updated material monitoring.","Interactive voice capabilities may also be incorporated into Client Devices  and Service Devices  via Adapter Elements . This approach ensures that the vocal interfaces are consistent across all devices. Personal digital identification devices may also be extended by software programs to directly interact with the office users' personal software agents.","All the different Client Devices , Service Devices , Client Applications , and MIS Application  are tied into Server  via Interconnection Channel . Server  is where all of the communication signals are interpreted and processed by Adapter Elements . Server  also contains standard software service elements, such as databases, software programs, Web service programs, application programs, etc.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0042","num":"0041"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 3","FIG. 2","FIG. 4"],"b":["302","214","202","204","106","304"]},"After returning from , step  calls the process of  where all client devices are connected to the integrated building services system.
