The Government has certain rights in this invention.","This application claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 13\/364,263, filed Feb. 1, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.","Ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase (RR) is a highly regulated enzyme in the deoxyribonucleotide synthesis pathway that is ubiquitously present in human, bacteria, yeast, and other organisms (Jordan 1998). RR is responsible for the de novo conversion of ribonucleotide diphosphate to 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleotide diphosphate, a process that is essential for DNA synthesis and repair (Thelander 1986; Jordan 1998; Liu 2006). RR is directly involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance (Yen 1994; Zhou 1995; Nocentini 1996; Fan 1998; Zhou 1998).","The proliferation of metastatic cancer cells requires excess dNTPs for DNA synthesis. Therefore, an increase in RR activity is necessary as it helps provide extra dNTPs for DNA replication in primary and metastatic cancer cells. Because of this critical role in DNA synthesis, RR represents an important target for cancer therapy. However, there has been little progress in the development of RR inhibitors for use in cancer treatment. The three RR inhibitors currently in clinical use (hydroxyurea, 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP), and GTI2040) each have significant drawbacks. Therefore, there is a need in the art for more effective compositions and methods for targeting and treating RR-based cancers.","In certain embodiments, a novel set of compounds including COH4, COH20, and COH29, as well as various chemical derivatives thereof, are provided. Also provided are compositions and pharmaceutical formulations comprising these compounds.","In certain embodiments, methods are provided for inhibiting RR activity in a cell by contacting the cell with one or more of the compounds provided herein, including COH4, COH20, and\/or COH29.","In certain embodiments, methods are provided for inhibiting the growth or proliferation of a cell expressing RRM2 by contacting the cell with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds provided herein, including COH4, COH20, and\/or COH29.","In certain embodiments, methods are provided for treating cancer in a subject in need thereof by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds provided herein, including COH4, COH20, and\/or COH29.

Where \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term \u201cheteroalkyl\u201d should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 or the like.","The terms \u201ccycloalkyl\u201d and \u201cheterocycloalkyl,\u201d by themselves or in combination with other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \u201calkyl\u201d and \u201cheteroalkyl,\u201d respectively.

A fused ring aryl refers to multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is an aryl ring. The term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d refers to aryl groups (or rings) that contain at least one heteroatom such as N, O, or S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. Thus, the term \u201cheteroaryl\u201d includes fused ring heteroaryl groups (i.e., multiple rings fused together wherein at least one of the fused rings is a heteroaromatic ring). A 5,6-fused ring heteroarylene refers to two rings fused together, wherein one ring has 5 members and the other ring has 6 members, and wherein at least one ring is a heteroaryl ring.

When R\u2032 and R\u2033 are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033 includes, but is not limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term \u201calkyl\u201d is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., \u2014CFand \u2014CHCF) and acyl (e.g., \u2014C(O)CH, \u2014C(O)CF, \u2014C(O)CHOCH, and the like). Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are selected from, for example: \u2014OR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014SR\u2032, -halogen, \u2014SiR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014OC(O)R\u2032, \u2014C(O)R\u2032, \u2014COR\u2032, \u2014CONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014OC(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032\u2014C(O)NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014NR\u2033C(O)R\u2032, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033R\u2032\u2033)\u2550NR\u2033\u2033, \u2014NR\u2014C(NR\u2032R\u2033)\u2550NR\u2032\u2033, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)R\u2032, \u2014S(O)NR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NRSOR\u2032, \u2014NR\u2032NR\u2033R\u2032\u2033, \u2014ONR\u2032R\u2033, \u2014NR\u2032C\u2550(O)NR\u2033NR\u2032\u2033R\u2033\u2033, \u2014CN, \u2014NO, \u2014R\u2032, \u2014N, \u2014CH(Ph), fluoro(C-C)alkoxy, and fluoro(C-C)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R\u2032, R\u2033, R\u2032\u2033, and R\u2033\u2033 groups when more than one of these groups is present.","Two or more substituents may optionally be joined to form aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl groups. Such so-called ring-forming substituents are typically, though not necessarily, found attached to a cyclic base structure. In one embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to adjacent members of the base structure. For example, two ring-forming substituents attached to adjacent members of a cyclic base structure create a fused ring structure. In another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to a single member of the base structure. For example, two ring-forming substituents attached to a single member of a cyclic base structure create a spirocyclic structure. In yet another embodiment, the ring-forming substituents are attached to non-adjacent members of the base structure.","Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)\u2014(CRR\u2032)\u2014U\u2014, wherein T and U are independently \u2014NR\u2014, \u2014O\u2014, \u2014CRR\u2032\u2014, or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3.

For example, a heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring heteroatom in compliance with principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art thereby avoiding inherently unstable compounds.","dNTP production in eukaryotes is tightly regulated by RR, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in deoxyribonucleotide synthesis (Jordan 1998). RR consists of a large subunit and a small subunit. In humans, one large subunit (RRM1, also referred to as M1) and two small subunits (RRM2, also referred to as M2, and p53R2) have been identified (Tanaka 2000; Liu 2006). The small RR subunits form two equivalent dinuclear iron centers that stabilize the tyrosyl free radical required for initiation of electron transformation during catalysis (Ochiai 1990; Cooperman 2003; Liu 2006).","RRM1 is a 170 Kd dimer containing substrate and allosteric effector sites that control RR holoenzyme activity and substrate specificity (Cory 1983; Wright 1990; Cooperman 2003; Liu 2006).","RRM2 is an 88 Kd dimer containing a tyrosine free radical and a non-heme iron for enzyme activity (Chang 1979). p53R2 contains a p53-binding site in intron 1 and encodes a 351-amino-acid peptide with striking similarity to RRM2 (Tanaka 2000). RRM2 and p53R2 have an 80% similarity in amino acid sequence (Tanaka 2000).","p53R2 has been identified as a transcriptional target of p53 (Nakano 2000; Tanaka 2000; Yamaguchi 2001), while RRM2 is transcriptionally regulated by cell cycle-associated factors such as NF-Y and E2F (Filatov 1995; Currie 1998; Chabes 2004; Liu 2004). Therefore, expression of p53R2, but not RRM2, is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma-irradiation, or Doxorubicin (Dox) treatment in a p53-dependent manner (Lozano 2000; Tanaka 2000; Guittet 2001). In p53 mutant or deleted cells, RRM2 can replace p53R2 in the DNA repair process for cells exposed to UV irradiation (Zhou 2003; Liu 2005). P53R2 has been found to have a stronger reducing capacity than RRM2, which may provide a chaperone effect in stabilizing p21 (Xue 2007).","It has been observed that the RB tumor suppressor suppresses RR subunits as a mechanism for regulating cell cycle progression (Elledge 1990). RB inactivation, often observed in tumors, leads to increased dNTP levels and a concomitant resistance of tumor cells to drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and HU (Angus 2002). While overexpression of the RRM2 subunit promotes transformation and tumorigenic potential via its cooperation with several activated oncogenes (Fan 1998), overexpression of the RRM1 subunit suppresses malignant potential in vivo (Fan 1997). Increased expression of RRM2 has been found to increase the drug-resistant properties of cancer cells and to increase invasive potential, whereas RRM2 suppression leads to the reversal of drug resistance and results in decrease proliferation of tumor cells (Zhou 1995; Huang 1997; Zhou 1998; Goan 1999; Chen 2000; Nakano 2000; Kuschak 2002). Normal cells express very low levels of RR in non-proliferative status, whereas most neoplastic cells overexpress RR, thereby supplying dNTP pools for DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Thus, specific inhibition of RRM2 is likely to provide antineoplastic benefits.","Although RR represents an important target for cancer therapy, there are only three RR inhibitors in clinical use: hydroxyurea (HU), 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (3-AP, Triapine\u00ae), and GTI2040. HU, which blocks DNA synthesis by reducing the tyrosyl free radical, has been marketed as a cancer therapeutic for over 30 years and is the only RR inhibitor that is commercially available (Nocentini 1996). However, resistance to HU treatment is a common problem (Lassmann 1992; Nyholm 1993; Le 2002). 3-AP, a small molecule iron chelator inactivates RR, has been found to cause hypoxia, respiratory distress, and methemoglobulin of red blood cells. In addition, 3-AP selectively targets p53R2 instead of RRM2. GTI2040, an antisense molecule, has thus far been ineffective in human trials. Other issues relating to these three RR inhibitors are incomplete RR blocking, short half-life, and regeneration of RR. In addition, mutation of p53R2 results in hereditary mitochondria depletion syndrome, but not cancer, and p53R2 knockout mice demonstrate kidney tubule disorder but no obvious cancer growth (Kimura 2003). These observations suggest that RRM2 is responsible for tumor proliferation and metastatic potential, whereas p53R2 induced by DNA damage signals for DNA repair. Therefore, an ideal RR inhibitor for use in cancer therapy would have greater potency than HU, less iron chelating ability than 3-AP, and specific targeting of RRM2.","As disclosed herein, RRM2 has been validated as an anti-cancer target. Suppression of RRM2 via siRNA was found to decrease tumor growth in mice implanted with human HepG2 liver cancer cells. Expression of RRM2 was determined to be significantly higher in cancer cells than in corresponding normal cells. In addition, human KB and PC3 cells transfected with RRM2 exhibited increased invasive potential versus their non-transfected counterparts, suggesting that RRM2 enhances the invasive potential of cancer cells.","A diverse compound library from NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) was screened to identify compounds that inhibit RR.

Accordingly, in certain embodiments the present application discloses novel RR inhibitors, compositions, formulations, and kits comprising one or more of these inhibitors, and methods of using these inhibitors to inhibit RR, inhibit cell growth or proliferation, treat cancer, and\/or inhibit stem cell proliferation.","COH20 consists of three basic structural units: a pharmacophore (for inhibition of RR activity), a binding group (for selectivity), and a linking group (to connect the pharmacophore and the binding group. As disclosed herein, COH20 exhibited low micromolar range inhibition of both recombinant and intracellular RR in vitro, and caused a decrease in dNTP pools. Biochemical analysis revealed that COH20 targets RRM2. Upon binding the RRM1\/RRM2 complex, COH20 appears to reside at the V-shaped pocket at the interface between RRM1 and RRM2 and block the free radical transfer pathway though a novel catechol radical stabilization mechanism. Considering the size and chemical composition of COH20 and the distance to the dinuclear iron center, the bound ligand (in this pocket) does not appear to be susceptible to iron chelation as with 3-AP or involved in the direct quenching of the initially formed tyrosyl free radical as with HU. COH20 was found to inhibit growth of the human leukemia cell lines REH and MOLT-4, the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, and the human oropharyngeal cancer cell line KB in vitro at a concentration of less than 10 \u03bcM, while exhibiting less cytotoxicity towards normal fibroblast cells than HU. COH20 also exhibited greater cytotoxicity towards the HU-resistant cell line KBHURs than 3-AP, indicating that it is capable of overcoming HU drug resistance. COH20 exhibited cytotoxicity towards KBMDR cells at lower concentration than 3-AP or HU (80 \u03bcM versus 200 \u03bcM and >1000 \u03bcM, respectively), indicating that COH20 circumvents MDR more effectively than 3-AP. In addition, COH20 had very low toxicity when administered to mice, with no evidence or iron chelation or methemoglobulin.","As disclosed herein, COH29 showed promising growth inhibitory effects on a wide range of human cancer cell lines, including:\n\n","In certain embodiments, COH29 showed a GI50 of less than about 10 \u03bcM for the NCI 60 human cancer cell lines, except colon cancer cell line HT29, melanoma cancer cell line UACC-257, ovarian cancer cell line NCI\/ADR-RES, and renal cancer cell line CAKI-1.

Therefore, these inhibitors may be used to certain cancers, including cancers associated with the overexpression of RRM2 or for which there exists a suitable therapeutic index. As disclosed herein, RRM2 may be overexpressed in breast cancer cells versus normal cells, and expression of exogenous RRM2 increases cancer cell invasive potential. The inhibitors disclosed herein have been shown to inhibit growth of multiple cancer cell types in vitro, supporting the use of these inhibitors to treat a wide range of cancers.","Previous studies have shown that RRM2 is highly expressed in stem cells in the colon (Liu 2006). At the early stages of colon cancer, RRM2 expression decreases slightly. However, RRM2 expression increases significantly once the tumor becomes aggressive.

This ligand binding pocket, which consists of 32 amino acid residues conserved among human and mouse RRM2 protein families, is in close proximity to the RRM1\/RRM2 interface. The structure of the ligand binding pocket is set forth in . The pocket consists of helices \u03b17, \u03b18, and \u03b110 at the C-terminal domain. The narrow interior end of the V-shaped pocket is lined up with hydrophobic residues near the back of dityrosyl diiron cluster center. Polar residues such as D271, R330, and E334 that are located near the open-end of the pocket may potentially interact with the flexible C-terminus. The pocket is lined mostly with interior hydrophobic residues with charged residues exposed to the surface.","Compounds that docked into the ligand binding pocket were identified using the TRIPOS FlexX docking tool and ranked using an embedded consensus docking score.
