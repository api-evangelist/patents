{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["The present invention pertains to system for providing automatic download to an associated terminal. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a system and method for automatically downloading software to a remote adaptable terminal, supported by enhanced Service Location Protocol and enhanced Wide Area Service Location Protocol architecture.","Multi-mode and Software Defined Radio (SDR) terminals are adaptable terminals capable of acquiring radio personalities, modes and applications by software download. Examples of where such radios may be useful include cellular\/PCS telephony and mobile computing. The ability to remotely download, plug and play new communication protocols, mode components and services using existing hardware, enables the terminal to perform a variety of different functions when located in different locations.","Static and dynamic downloading are two common approaches for downloading applications to a SDR terminal. Static download generally occurs when the SDR terminal is not actively running any service or application. Alternatively, dynamic download generally occurs through a logical channel over a protocol while the terminal is in use. Dynamic download is ideally invoked when the mobile terminal approaches the \u201cedge\u201d of a service area, where the terminal's required services and other technologies are not available. Dynamic download can also be triggered by the terminal's Quality of Service requirements.","None of the current static or dynamic download systems provide mechanisms that enable Over-The-Air automatic download to a mobile terminal. Accordingly, there exists a need for a system and method for automatically downloading software to a terminal Over-The-Air.","The present invention provides a system supported by location or context awareness mechanism and further supported by signaling and download mechanisms that function over any wireless link protocol. It is desirable that the system enables a terminal or user to query for services available in a selected location supported by an extended Service Location Protocol (SLP) and Wide Area Service Location Protocol (WASLP) framework. It is further desirable that the system includes a geographic location service and spatial location protocol supported in a wireless network. Additionally, it is further desirable that the system enables the discovery, automatic selection and download of network download services and subsequent registration of wireless access services.","It is further desirable that an adaptable terminal is provided for locating and receiving automatic downloadable software.","A system for automatically downloading radio or protocol personalities over defined channels to a mobile terminal is provided. The system includes an adaptable terminal, a location server, for providing geographic location information to the associated terminal, at least one component repository, and a server directory.","The component repository includes at least one downloadable component. The system adheres to an enhanced service location protocol and wide area location protocol. A service template that defines the needed service attributes for the terminal.","The terminal includes a location module in communication with the spatial location service to define the geographic location of the mobile terminal. A User Agent locates downloadable components in the defined geographic location using a service request enumerates the service needs of the terminal.","While the present invention is susceptible of embodiment in various forms, there is shown in the drawings and will hereinafter be described a presently preferred embodiment with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiment illustrated. It should be further understood that the title of this section of this specification, namely, \u201cDetailed Description Of The Invention\u201d, relates to a requirement of the United States Patent Office, and does not imply, nor should be inferred to limit the subject matter disclosed herein.","In the present disclosure, the words \u201ca\u201d or \u201can\u201d are to be taken to include both the singular and the plural. Conversely, any reference to plural items shall, where appropriate, include the singular.","Referring now to the drawings, more particularly , there is shown a system  for automatically downloading applications to an adaptive terminal . The system  includes an adaptive terminal , a location server , a component repository , a download server , a Service Agent , a Directory Agent  a registration server , and an access router . The terminal  of the system  includes a location module , a download module , a mode cache , a SLP module , a reconfiguration module , an air interface module  and a user interface .","The system  provides for automatic downloading of modes and applications available in a wide area network or domain, to the terminal . Downloadable modes and applications can vary from end-user applications to a physical layer algorithms including device driver software for mobile terminals, software components, software patches or upgrades.","The system  is supported by an extended Service Location Protocol (SLP), as illustrated in , and an extended Wide Area Service Location Protocol, illustrated in . Preferably, the Wide Area Service Location Protocol is in accordance with standards set forth by the International Engineering Task Force (IETF).","System  is supported by an extended Service Location Protocol to automatically resolve a terminal's service needs in the enterprise and mobile environment. The extended SLP is a flexible and scalable framework for service discovery in the IP network. The system uses the SLP protocol in combination with supported location servers and location queries from the terminal to provide automatic software download to the terminal. Extensions to the Service Location Protocol provide geographic location information necessary for download to the terminal across the Wide Area Network and Internet. This location information is used in combination with the user's mobility itinerary to select a location. Download queries that meet the terminal's service needs are based on the selected geographic information.","The framework enables a user to conveniently find available service types, locations (URLs) where a specific service is provided, and service descriptions. In SLP terminology, Service locations can be described by URLs such as http:\/\/www.srvloc.org. or or identified by the \u201cservice:\u201d URL scheme such as service:lpr.\/\/mandolin.cs.columbia.edu.","Each service has a \u201cservice type,\u201d e.g., the service type of http:\/\/www.srvloc.org and service:lpr:\/\/mandolin.cs.columbia.edu is http (web service) and service:download (Mode Download service), respectively. \u201cService descriptions\u201d are expressed as attribute\/value pairs such as \u201cresolution=1200 dpi\u201d for a printing service. SLP uses \u201cservice scopes\u201d to arrange services into groups. A scope could indicate a geographic location such as \u201cLondon\u201d, an administrative group such as \u201cLaw School\u201d, or other category such as \u201cEmergency\u201d.","As shown in , the multi-mode terminal , in connection with location server  enables the system  to identify and monitor the terminal's  location. The terminal  has a location module  and a download module , which identifies and selects downloadable services and modes available to the terminal , in a selected location. The terminal  further includes a mode cache  for storing modes and applications.","The terminal  is adaptable for running downloaded applications or modes. Notably, it is contemplated that terminal  can be a type of adaptable terminal , such as a cellular\/PCS telephone, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), mobile computer, or the like, without departing from the scope of the present invention.","The Wide Area Service Location Protocol and Service Location Protocol framework are enhanced to support mode availability queries based on geographic location provided by the terminal  or location server , or both. The system  determines the current location and\/or the projected location of the terminal . Prior to entering the location, the download module  initiates the download process through interaction with the location module . The location server , in connection with the terminal's location module , identifies and monitors the geographic location of the terminal . The location module  queries the location server  for adjacent regions. This can be accomplished using symbolic or geometric locator functions and\/or other various functions supported by the location server .","The location  server can support a variety of location queries including, but not limited to: basic queries by the mobile terminal  to determine the terminal's location, sub-location queries, super-location queries, queries requesting all of mobile terminal's locations, and sighting queries.","Sub-locations are defined as location areas that fall within another location area. For example, \u201cSan Francisco\u201d is a sub-location of the super-location area \u201cCalifornia\u201d. The location server  can maintain sub-location and Super-location maps and designated symbols.","Sighting queries request and list a \u201cfew\u201d location areas that the mobile terminal  has recently traversed in the recent past. Collocation queries are requests to the location server  for all locations that are in the neighborhood of the specified location. One example of a collocation query is a request for modes and services located in the city of a Bangalore. The location server  responds to this request with mode and service information for Bangalore as well as neighboring cities of Bangalore, such as \u201cMysore\u201d","In one example of the present invention, it is contemplated that the location server  uses symbolic location data and functions to define the terminal's  location in the system . The location server  maintains a database containing a map of locations in the area represented by symbolic data.","The terminal  or another location server  orders mode information from the location server  using symbols. The hierarchy of locations can be maintained according to spatial containment relations. For example, the geographic location \u201cNew York City\u201d is contained within the geographic location of the \u201cUnited States of America\u201d.","For example, when the location server  provides a database (not shown) assigned to an area or location. The database assigns a name or symbol to every possible location. The terminal  queries the location server  specifying a \u201cSymbolicLocator\u201d or a particular location that the terminal  desires to know of the available and downloadable modes or services supported in that location.","The location server  and the mobile terminal  support the symbolic location model. The model designates locations using abstract symbols, for example \\Room 429\u201d, \\India\\Karnataka state\u201d, \\Huxley Building\u201d, or \\Canterbury cathedral\u201d. These symbols are used in a scope field of a Service Location Protocol message to indicate to the location server  the relevance of the protocol mode or a service located in that location area. For example, the mobile terminal  specifies to the server  a \u201cSymbolicLocator\u201d such as \u201c\\KARNATATAKA\\BANGALORE\u201d. The server  retrieves mode information regarding the input \u201cSymbolLocator\u201d, or in this case \u201cKarnataka\\Banglore\u201d","The mobile terminal  also can query for specific locations and co-locations to a selected location specified by the \u201cSymbolicLocator\u201d. The mobile terminal  can indicate a specific location in which it desires to download modes from. Using symbols, the terminal requests the mode information from the location server  in that area. For example, the mobile terminal  can indicate a location \u201cFRANCE\u201d. In this case, modes are downloaded to the terminal  and the terminal  is reconfigured enabling the terminal  to \u201crun\u201d modes and services located in France.","In another example, the system  uses a geometric location model supported by the location server  and the mobile terminal . The location server  uses a database that assigns locations according to longitudinal and latitudinal locations such as a \u201cGeometricLocator\u201d. This enables the terminal  to query the server  for modes and applications located in locations and co-locations  using coordinates. In addition, the location server  provide collocation or adjacency queries on a location granularity negotiated by the terminal  and the location server .","In another example of the invention, the location module  uses a Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the location of the mobile terminal . Typical Global Positioning Systems define locations using latitude and longitude information to define locations. If desired, the coordinate information can be converted into an alternative form, such as symbolic or geometric information, to be processed by the terminal location module . This location information can be used to further query the location server  for collocation information.","In another example, the mobile terminal's  location can be determined by tracking the location of the terminal  using the location server . The location server  maintains a list of the terminal's  locations over a time period and provides the location module  with a defined regular mobility area.","It is also contemplated that the location module  can determine the terminal location. In this manner, the location module  keeps track or monitors locations that the terminal is and has been most regularly located to form a regular location area to be used to generate a mode query.","In another example, the user can proactively fill in his mobile itinerary. The mobile itinerary can include projected locations that the user plans to travel as well as the approximate time that the user plans to be in those locations. As such, this information can be used to prompt a mode search in the locations area provided by the user.","When the user is located near a transportation center, such as an airport or Bus terminal or in a moving car, the terminal  or location server  can use location information to prompt a mode query for a selected location area.","The user can also proactively input his projected mobile itinerary. As such, the location server  notifies the mobile terminal  of any \u201cmajor transit points\u201d like airports, bus-terminals, entry regions to inter city or state highways, which are located in the geographic locations. Once the location of the terminal  has been determined, the location module  prompts. The user provides information to the terminal  and location server  of any major mobility plans such that the location server  can search surrounding areas to identify modes, and applications in those areas.","Once the projected or selected location of the terminal  is determined, the download module  queries the system  for available appropriate modes and services in the terminal's current location, co-locations, and other locations that may be traveled.","The selected or specified location information is sent from the location module  to the download module . The download module  receives this information and queries the mode cache  for available modes to verify that all modes or a subset of modes for continued operation in that location are available in the mode cache . The download module  selects from a group of available modes the best mode or application for the terminal . The download module  determines if the terminal  is located or will be moving to a location where the terminal's  existing modes and services are not supported by the area network. The system  automatically downloads services, modes and software available in those locations stored in a component repository , or like server, to the terminal . The terminal  stores or caches this information in the mode cache .","The location server  monitors services and modes available in co-locations and queries other location servers  associated within other mode service domains and stores this information. In general, co-locations are defined as location areas that fall outside the coverage range of the present mode in use by the terminal . However co-locations can also include locations and areas that are located within the coverage area of the present mode in use but where alternate mode services are available.","Illustrated in  are examples of extended Service Location Protocol (SLP) and extended Wide Area Service Location Protocol (WASLP) framework. As illustrated, the supporting Service Location Protocol and Wide Area Service Location Protocol framework include, a User Agent (UA) , a Service Agent (SA) , a Directory Agent (DA) , a Broker Agent (BA)  and an Advertising Agent (AA) .","A User Agent  initiates service and mode discovery on behalf of the terminals download module . The User Agent  acquires applications, modes or services needed by the terminal  to operate in a selected location's mode network service.","The Service Agent  represents a particular service offered in a particular area or domain. The Service Agent  responds directly to the User Agent's  queries. The User Agent  sends queries to Service Agent  via multicast and\/or, to an available Directory Agent  via unicast.","The User Agent  can use several different types of SLP messages to discover the download services, such as: a service type request (SrvTypeRqst) message to get a list of all available service types in a service type reply (SrvTypeRply) message, an attribute request (AttrRqst) message to get a list of all attributes for a given service type or a specific service instance in an attribute reply (AttrRply) message, and a service request (SrvRqst) message with an attribute predicate specifying the characteristics of the desired service to get a list of URLs giving the locations of matched services in a service reply (SrvRply) message. Examples of messages supported by the Service Location Protocol and Wide area Service Location Protocol architecture are illustrated in .","The SrvTypeRqst, Srv-TypeRply, AttrRqst and AttrRply messages enable the User Agent  to select an available service type and their attribute. This information can be used to construct service queries in SrvRqst messages. Using the desired service type i.e. download service, and a set of attributes describing the service, (which can be the geographic location area where modes are being sought), SLP provides the service addresses (URLs) to the user.","In one example, the terminal  requests the attributes of a specific mode supported in a specified service area. The \u201cAttribute Request\u201d message of the SLP format can be used for obtaining the mode attributes (type attributes). For component download the User Agent  (SDR terminal) may also form \u201cService Requests\u201d using pre-configured knowledge of a Service Type's attributes. It may also issue \u201cAttribute Requests\u201d to obtain the attribute values for a \u201cService Type\u201d before issuing Service Requests. Having obtained the attributes, which describe a particular kind of service through an \u201cAttribute Request\u201d message, the SDR terminal  can build a predicate that describes the service needs of the user.","Directory Agents  can serve as centralized information repositories  in an enhanced SLP system . If Directory Agents  are present, the Service Agent  can register with the Directory Agent  using service registration (SrvReg) messages. The Directory Agents  receive registrations from Service Agents  and respond to User Agent  queries. Directory Agents  can be discovered either actively or passively by the User Agent . In passive Directory Agent  discovery, User and Service Agents ,  scopes an administratively multicast address for unsolicited Directory Agent  advertisement messages (DAAdvert) sent periodically to the address.","The system  supports incremental service registration, in which a Service Agent  can add or change attributes of a previously registered service. Thus, a SrvReg message can be used to fresh service registration or an update to a previous registration. A Service Agent  can also remove service listings from the Directory Agent  before they expire by sending service deregistration (SrvDeReg) messages.","The system  uses the geographic location information as provided by the mobile terminal  or the location server  as the \u201cscope parameter.\u201d A scope in this invention indicates a geographic location such as \u201cLondon.\u201d The scope field can indicate the geographic location information and the service type field can indicate a \u201cdownload service.\u201d Service queries by the mobile terminal , service registrations by the Service Agent  and download service advertisements by the Directory Agent  can be scoped by the \u201cgeographic location.\u201d In such case, a mode being offered through the download service is relevant.","The system  uses an enhanced Wide Area Service Location Protocol to facilitate inter-domain or geographic location based automatic download to the associated terminal. The system  supported by an enhanced Wide area Service Location Protocol includes, a Broker Agent , a Directory Agent , a Service Agent , and an Advertising Agent . The broadcast or multicast of the download services for modes relevant in specific location areas can be done to surrounding collocations. Advertised services can be grouped in scopes where the administrators can configure which services to advertise and aggregate.","Within each SLP domain  and WASLP domain  of the system  the Directory Agent  and\/or Service Agents  aggregate and advertise available services in the domain across the wide area to other domains. The User Agent  queries for downloadable services for modes relevant in location area can be handled by the Directory Agents  or Broker Agents  by referring to the Symbolic Locator and matching the Service Agents  that serve modes relevant to the specified or selected locations. The Broker Agents  and the Directory Agent  use the location server  to locate services designated service messages to provide the required services to the Service Agent . Such advertisements carry the location information where downloadable modes are relevant.","Mobile terminals  not located in the collocation scope of the Directory or Broker Agent ,  advertisements can explicitly query the system for modes relevant in a location area. The Directory Agent  specializes in storing advertisements about some subnet of service type. Brokers  also advertise their expertise about some service type into their local SLP domain. The Broker Agent  receives information transmitted across the wide area network, such as advertisements and request for downloadable services and applications. The Broker Agent  also uses the geographic location information in the scope field of service queries or service registrations to bias their advertisements.","The Broker and Directory Agent ,  use the location tag and query the location server  to redirect the mode search or query. The Directory and Broker Agent ,  can also cache some location information locally to help them deal with location queries. The Broker, Directory Agent and Service Agent use the functions provided by the location server  for queries and location clarity.","In automatic download operation, the terminal  transmits a request for services available in a defined geographic location (L). The terminal  sends the request to the Directory Agent , in the local area domain. The Directory Agent  queries the location server  for the collocation information to bias the advertisements for the download mechanism. If the Directory Agent  cannot find the requested download service or Service Agents  that offer download services for modes relevant to the location query local, the Directory Agent  contacts a Broker Agent  for the service in the service location area. The Broker Agent  then locates a server in its database and access network in its coverage area and transmits this information back to the Directory Agent . The Directory Agent  then returns the download server information and the access network address to the terminal .","Referring now to  there is shown a diagram illustrating one example sequence of message flow for the downloading of software using a \u201cgeographic location\u201d scoped Service Location Protocol. The User Agent  transmits a \u201cservice request message\u201d to the Service Agents  serving mode and service downloads for the selected location.","The service request message is transmitted between the Directory Agent , Service Agent , location servers  and terminal  to enumerate geographic location and service needs. The Directory Agent  and Service Agents  use this location information to locate services and modes supported in the specified location. The service request message satisfies the scope, i.e. location information where supported modes are being queried and the requested service type (the download service type) and matches the predicate.","If the terminal  does not have any information about the modes and services supported or the \u201cService Type\u201d supported in a location area or a region of interest, it can issue a \u201cService Type Request\u201d message. The SDR terminal  uses the \u201cService Type Request\u201d message with the location scope to identify the modes supported in the given geographic location. The \u201cService Type Request\u201d message can be used with the geographic location information as the scope. The location information can also be embedded in the predicate string. Geographic location information can also be used as a query scope in the example \u201cService Request\u201d message of the IETF SLP protocol. In this manner, the service type message would be a for a specified \u201cSDR component download service\u201d located in the geographic location.","The system having an enhanced Service Location Protocol (SLP) can use service templates to provide a formal procedure for defining and using a new downloaded service type. Service templates are formal descriptions of service types and attributes and are human and machine understandable. Service templates are used for several purposes including, standardization of messages sent across the network. Once a template is serviced, all versions of the template are archived by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. In addition, servers that use conventional Service Location Protocol are registered using templates that specify values for their service attributes.","In the extended SLP, service templates capture the semantics and rules for service advertisement attributes and URLs. In addition, terminal applications can display service information. The template provides information and explanatory text, which may be helpful in informing the user through the terminal user interface . An example of a template used in the SLP architecture is illustrated in .","The Service templates can include a service type, which characterizes the general kind of service, the version number for the template, the language in which the attribute names and values are given, a description of the service type and a list of attributes. Geographic location information can also be included as a search or a service attribute in the service template. Service templates are used by Directory Agents  to organize and identify service registration information. Terminal applications use service templates to provide localized translations of service attribute strings. The User Agent  uses in the service message a service template to create a service request that enumerates appropriate service attributes for the terminal.","Headers can be used to provide information about the messages.  illustrates an example of a Service Location Protocol header diagram is shown. The function ID is an example of one of the SLP message types, which have been listed in the table above.","In the Service Location Protocol \u201cservice:\u201d a URL scheme name can be used to define the URLs (called \u201cservice: URLs\u201d) which are intended to be used by the Service Location Protocol to distribute service access information. These schemes provide an extensible framework for client-based software to obtain software download and configuration information. When registering a service: URL, the URL can be accompanied by a set of well-defined attributes, which define the service. These attributes convey configuration information to terminal software, or service characteristics meaningful to end-users. One example of dynamically locating and loading a protocol device driver to an SDR terminal is illustrated below. In this case, the SDR terminal  uses the following three pieces of information before it can successfully load and initiate the driver:\n\n","Using Service Location Protocol, a search for the service type \u201cSDR-download-GPRS-drivers\u201d may return all of the three URLs listed above. At this point, the terminal  selects the most appropriate access protocol, mode or service and downloads this mode to the terminal .","As previously stated, the Service Agent  sends the User Agent  a service reply. The Directory Agents  maintains a directory of servers in the selected location. When the Directory Agent  or Service Agent  returns a list of modes or applications supported in a selected geographic location, the terminal  uses the information to initiate a software download with request for a specific mode.","Several examples of the service type strings, which might be found in the \u201cService Type Reply\u201d are:\n\n","The Directory Agent  can consult other Directory Agents  or Broker Agents  to fill and comply with the requested service types. The best mode or service is selected by the terminal . This can be based the user input at the user interface  or the terminal  automatically selects a mode or service from the server to be downloaded and the mode components are then downloaded to the terminal .","Automatic download enables registration of the downloaded software with one or more service providers in a given location area. The Service Agent  or registration server  and Directory Agent  can be used to facilitate service service registration within the extended WASLP and SLP. The Service Agent  or download server registers with the Directory Agent  by advertising its services one at a time. Registration is done using a \u201cService Registration\u201d message specifying attributes for the particular service or protocol. Example modes or services are Bluetooth, GPRS and the like. One example of a Service Registration information is shown below.\n\n","One example of a service registration having attributes for the GPRS mode is:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0081","num":"0095"},"tables":{"@attributes":{"id":"TABLE-US-00001","num":"00001"},"table":{"@attributes":{"frame":"none","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0"},"tgroup":{"@attributes":{"align":"left","colsep":"0","rowsep":"0","cols":"3"},"colspec":[{"@attributes":{"colname":"offset","colwidth":"14pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"1","colwidth":"42pt","align":"left"}},{"@attributes":{"colname":"2","colwidth":"161pt","align":"left"}}],"thead":{"row":{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}},"tbody":{"@attributes":{"valign":"top"},"row":[{"entry":[{},"Lifetime:","10800"]},{"entry":[{},"URL:","service:GPRS:\/\/igore.wco.ftp.com:515\/draft"]},{"entry":[{},"Attributes:","(SCOPE=SDR_Component_Download),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(QoS CLASS=CLASS A),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(COST =$xxx),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(AVERAGE BW=123KB),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"UNRESTRICTED_ACCESS,"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(LANGUAGE=:exe),"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(LOCATION=<IP address, DNS etc >)"]},{"entry":[{},{},"(GEO_LOCATION=<Loc_Tag (Ex: \u201cFrance\u201d)>)"]},{"entry":[{},{"@attributes":{"namest":"offset","nameend":"2","align":"center","rowsep":"1"}}]}]}}}}},"In the above example the geographic location information is embedded in the attribute list of the service registration message.","The Service Location Protocol module  communicates with the Server Agent  or service registration server . Once the modes or applications are downloaded to the terminal , the services and associated services are registered with a registration server  or Service Agent .","Referring now to  there is shown a schematic diagram of an adaptable Software Defined Radio terminal  for receiving automatic downloadable applications, in accordance with the present invention. The terminal  includes a user interface , a download module , a mode cache , a terminal location module , a Service Location Protocol module , a reconfiguration module  and an air interface module .","The multi-mode terminal  automatically receives, downloads and stores remotely transmitted software, modes and applications. Additionally, the terminal  activates or \u201cruns\u201d the downloaded applications or modes, enabling the terminal  to perform a variety of functions in different locations. Notably, it is contemplated that the terminal  can be modified to receive and run virtually any type of program, software, or mode generally known to those skilled in the art.","The user interface  provides information to the user, enabling the user to control the terminal  through commands or selected functions. It is contemplated that the user interface  can be any type of apparatus used for communicating generally known to those skilled in the art, such as a visual text display, video screen, a speaker, microphone, or the like.","The location and the download module ,  provide the terminal reconfiguration module  with location information and the modes supported in the selected location to initiate reconfiguration of the SDR terminal .","Prior to entering a location, the download module  is in communication with the location module . The location module  calculates a projected time that the mobile terminal moves out of the present location to a collocation. The location server  in communication with the location module , calculates the speed and direction of the terminal to project an anticipated location. This information is then transmitted back to the mobile terminal . The location module  in connection with the location server  queries for current mobility and location information. The terminal location module  communicates within the server  in the system  to generate terminal location information. The location module  can also query for applications and advertisements for network services.","The location module  keeps track of the current location and collocations. The location module  transmits current location and collocation information to the download module . Collocation information is generated from present terminal location information supplied by the location server  and location module  and querying the location server  for neighbor locations, specifying the granularity of the location area.","The download module  of the terminal queries the system  for available appropriate modes and services available in terminal's current location, surrounding location (co-locations), and other selected locations using the Service Location Protocol module . The download module  determines whether such modes are currently supported in the terminal (either currently running mode or availability in the download cache). If such modes are not supported in the download cache, a download is initiated based on the mobility itinerary information provided by the user or provided by the location module . The location can also be determined by querying current direction and velocity of the terminal . Upon locating the necessary mode, the download module  selects the best mode.","Once the download module  receives a collocation information from the location module  or user, the download module  verifies that all modes (or a subset of modes for continued operation) in that region are available in the mode cache  assisted by the Service Location Protocol module . The download module  also queries the terminal's mode cache for available modes. After completion of the query the download module  then selects from a group of available modes the best mode or application for the terminal.","The download cache  is used to store the mode executables or code. The download cache  also stores scripts, configuration files, upgrade software patches, or the like. The terminal reconfiguration module  uses code or executables available in the download cache  and reconfigures the hardware and the software state of the mobile terminal  to support a new mode.
