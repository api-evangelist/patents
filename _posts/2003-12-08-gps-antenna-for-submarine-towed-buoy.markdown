The antenna includes a feed stem at the closed end extending as an internal rod into the hollowed frustum. The opposite end of the rod connects to a receiver section extending from an edge of the open end beyond a longitudinal axis of the antenna. The antenna is supported by the gimbal attachable to a container suitable for towing. A pivot at the open end in relation to the center-of-gravity of the frustum allows a swinging arc in relation to the attached gimbal in that the frustum moves by gravity toward the axes of the gimbal such that the receiver section maintains a facing position to the force of gravity.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","(1) Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to antennas and more particularly to a global positioning system (GPS) antenna.","(2) Description of the Prior Art","In the field of GPS technology, GPS receivers are used to determine the geographic location of the receiver by receiving microwave radio signals from a group of earth-orbiting GPS satellites. The geographic location of the receiver may be computed by calculating its distance from each satellite as the result of determining how long the signals take to travel from the satellite to the receiver. Typically, a flat GPS antenna element is utilized by GPS receivers to receive the signals transmitted. In order for the GPS receiver to compute its geographic location, the antenna element of the receiver must be oriented to receive an acceptable level of the signals. Optimally, the flattened surface of the GPS antenna element is righted against the force of gravity such that a maximum surface area of the antenna faces the satellites.","Present submarine communications with battlegroups or satellites utilize surface antennas for a variety of requirements including global positioning and communications. The use of surface antennas typically interferes with the covert operation of the submarine. For example, submarines obtaining position fixes using GPS must raise a mast containing an antenna which is oriented to receive the signals from the GPS satellites. The problem is that raising a mast renders the submarine vulnerable to either visual or radar detection, especially if the mast is raised in coastal or littoral areas.","Additionally, antennas used on the ocean surface are subjected to dynamic forces that act to cause the antenna to pitch, yaw and sometimes roll with the vessel under varying sea states. These antenna movements can easily re-orientate the receiving element of the antenna resulting in reception interruption. Varying sea states also cause a detuning effect that result in degradation of the patch elements of conventional GPS antennas. To minimize the effects of varying sea states, the submarine must operate in a station keeping status or must constantly adjust course headings.","One method of mitigating reception interruption of the antenna is to orient the flattened surface of the antenna to right itself or face \u201cup\u201d toward the sky irrespective of the movement of its supporting structure. In Ham (U.S. Pat. No. 6,292,147), an apparatus for maintaining a GPS antenna element at a predetermined orientation is disclosed. The apparatus includes a holder configured to support a GPS antenna element in which the holder includes a rectangular frame as a receiving portion of the dielectric substrate of antenna. The rectangular holder pivots on an axis in relation to gravity to the predetermined orientation even when the base structure to which the holder is coupled changes its orientation. While the disclosed reference allows a righting motion to the antenna element, the movement of the righting motion is limited to rotation around the axis of the pivot in which the rotation provides only one degree of freedom.","It is well known in the use of gyroscopes and in the use of compasses on ships, that a gimbal provides at least two degrees of freedom for either attached device by allowing a pivoting action on the axes of the gimbal in which the axes are rotatable at angles to each other. For example, the pivoting and rotating action of a gimbal used on a ship compensates for the roll and the yaw of the ship as well as the pitch of the ship thereby maintaining an accurate heading of a compass set in the gimbal.","As such, an improvement to the technology of GPS antennas would be to incorporate the degrees of freedom of a gimbal with a conformable GPS antenna in a manner that is suitable for use on a vessel or towed array as well as for use in any other situation that can require more than one degree of freedom in which the degree of freedom is needed to maintain the righting or facing up element of the antenna receiver. Such an improvement along with any other suitable improvements to the structure of the GPS antenna could act to minimize the reception interruptions and the detuning effects caused by varying sea states.","Accordingly, it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus with a Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna that can obtain geographic positioning data with minimal interruption when operating in varying sea states.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus with an antenna that can transmit and receive signal communications with minimal interruption when operating in varying sea states.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus with antenna that can be towed by a submarine.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus with antenna in which the construction is simple and economical.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an antenna capable of transmission at high frequencies with minimal degradation.","It is a still further object of the present invention to provide an antenna in which the construction is simple and economical.","To attain the objects described, there is provided an apparatus with a GPS antenna in which the antenna maintains a receiving area that faces toward the sky or ocean surface. The antenna is a hollowed frustum having a closed end at its decreased diameter and an integral base ring surrounding an open end at an increased diameter of the frustum. The antenna includes a feed stem at the closed end extending as an internal rod in the interior of the frustum. The opposite end of the internal rod connects to a receiver plate in which the receiver plate extends from the base ring toward and beyond a longitudinal axis of the frustum.","For use in vessel operations or other applications that require the receiver plate to face the sky or the ocean surface, the antenna is supported by a gimbal. The gimbal is attachable to the interior of a watertight container suitable for towing horizontally on the ocean surface.","During operations, the pivoting of the antenna at the open end in relation to the lower center-of-gravity of the frustum shape of the antenna allows an enhanced swinging arc in relation to the attached gimbal in that the body of the frustum moves by gravity toward the axes of the gimbal. As such, the antenna provides the righting or facing up of the open end of the frustum and a facing up of the flattened surface of the attached receiver plate thereby permitting enhanced reception by the antenna. Furthermore, the antenna itself and not a holder of the antenna provides the righting or facing up motion thereby allowing a reduction in the amount of parts and a simplicity in design.","During actuation of the antenna, the feed stem is conductive to an energized feed source. Radio-frequency energy from the feed stem continues to the frustum with the energy disbursing as a current distribution along the interior surface of the frustum. The radio-frequency energy from the feed stem also continues onto the receiver plate with the result of a current distribution across the receiver plate. The differences in phase and amplitude from the radiating surface of the frustum, and the receiver plate contributes to a hemispherical radiation pattern in the far field.","The hemispherical radiation pattern is advantageous because when the antenna is placed on the ocean surface, the radiation pattern in the air space above the ocean surface does not contain nulls. As such, the radiation pattern in the air space permits full directionalized reception from GPS satellites or other signal emitting sources.","Furthermore, the antenna of the present invention reduces the degradation and associated problems with detuning occurring during various sea states. Specifically, the impedance matching of the frustum shape and the components of the antenna control the impedance influence of the detuning. Also, the structure of the curved frustum shape removes the edges of a typical patch antenna in which the edges of the typical patch antenna are subject to degradation from detuning.","The above and other features of the invention, including various and novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular devices embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as the limitations of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.","Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views, one sees that  depicts the antenna  of the present invention. The antenna  is preferably cast with a rigid thickness from phosphor bronze or beryllium copper with electrically conductive components attached or also cast as part of the antenna. Other commonly acquired materials resistant to corrosion in a sea environment or materials known to those skilled in the art may be used in forming the antenna .","The simplified structure of the antenna  comprises a hollowed frustum  having an open end  and a closed end  with a distance between the closed end and the open end being approximately \u03bb\/9, wherein \u03bb is the free-space wavelength measured in meters. For GPS use, the free-space wavelength equals the center frequency of operation, [the square root of the multiplication of the GPS frequencies (1227 MHz, 1575 MHz)] divided by the speed of light. The sizing of the diameter of the frustum  as well as the sizing of the other components of the antenna  is based on the free-space wavelength thereby allowing the antenna to be sized at a substantial bandwidth for alternate functions such as receiving and transmitting signals from IRIDIUM satellites (1625 MHz).","For the open end  of the frustum  shown in , the open end has a diameter \u201cA\u201d of 2\u03bb\/5. An integral base ring  projects from the open end  parallel to a longitudinal axis  of the antenna  in which the longitudinal axis is preferably perpendicular to the open end  and the closed end . The base ring  includes a notch  to position a receiver plate  flush with the projection of the open end . The receiver plate  extends from the notch  to and beyond the longitudinal axis . The receiver plate  is generally rectangular in shape from the flush with the notch  with the rectangular shape having a nominal length \u201cB\u201d of \u03bb\/3 and a width \u201cC\u201d that is approximately ten percent less than the length \u201cB\u201d.","For the closed end  of the frustum shown in , the closed end  has a diameter of \u03bb\/. The closed end  includes a feed stem  shielded by an extension  of the frustum . The feed stem  extends as an internal rod  in the cavity of the antenna . See . For an optimum impedance match and bandwidth to the antenna structure described above, the diameter of the rod  is \u03bb\/30 with a length of \u03bb\/ and a contact point for the receiver plate  at \u03bb\/ from the plate edge . The depth of the cavity (noted above as the distance between the open end  and the closed end ), the size (the length \u201cB\u201d and the width \u201cC\u201d) of the receiver plate  and the size of the rod  determine the impedance at the feed stem , the radiation pattern  of the antenna  and the bandwidth of the antenna .","Referring again to , the base ring  includes attachment points ,  in which the points allow the insertion of a swivel axis or any other mechanical attachment to a gimbal , described below. As shown in  for the use of the antenna  in submarine operations, the antenna  is supported by the gimbal  attached to the interior of the watertight container . The watertight container  is electrically transparent polyethylene and is attachable to a tow body  (shown in ) which can be towed by a submarine or other vessel.","The pivoting at the attachment points ,  of the antenna  in relation to the lower center-of-gravity of the frustum shape of the antenna allows an enhanced swinging arc by gravity () on the axis of the attachment points ,  in relation to the attached gimbal . The gimbal  in turn has a swinging arc () on its own attachment points , ; thereby providing a righting movement for the antenna  on at least two axes. As such, the antenna  provides the righting or facing up of the open end  of the frustum and a facing up of a flattened surface of the receiver plate  toward overhead satellites thereby permitting enhanced reception by the antenna. The antenna  is further unique in that the antenna itself and not a holder of the antenna provides the righting or facing up motion thereby allowing a reduction in moving parts and a simplicity in design.","During actuation of the antenna , the feed stem  is conductive to an energized feed source (not shown). Radio-frequency energy from the feed stem  continues onto the frustum  with the energy disbursing as a current distribution along the interior surface of the frustum. The energy from the feed stem  also continues to the receiver plate  by way of the rod  with the result of a current distribution across the receiver plate. The distribution of current amplitude and phase from the surface of the frustum  and the receiver plate  contributes to a hemispherical radiation or beam pattern , shown in . The hemispherical radiation pattern  is advantageous because when the antenna  is placed on the ocean surface, the radiation pattern in the air space above the ocean surface (shown by the area  above the \u201cx\u201d and \u201cy\u201d axis) does not contain nulls. As such, the radiation pattern in the air space permits full directionalized reception from satellites.","Furthermore, the antenna  reduces the degradation and associated problems with detuning occurring during with vary sea states. Specifically, the impedance matching of the frustum , the feed stem  and the rod  control the impedance influence of the detuning. Also, the structure of the curved frustum  removes the edges of a typical patch antenna in which the edges of the typical patch antenna are subject to detuning and quicker degradation.","An additional feature of the present invention is that the structural ratio (identified by the wavelength dimensioning above) of the various components of the antenna  allows the hemispherical radiation pattern  while maintaining the compactness of the antenna . The compactness of the antenna  is advantageous for many reasons including detection minimalization and reduced drag of the enclosing towing body. In relation to conventional GPS antennas, the compactness of the antenna  with its frustum  and receiver plate  does not require a large ground plane in order to generate the hemispherical radiation pattern .","In defining the compactness feature, the outer physical boundary of the antenna  is based on the size and placement of the open end  and the closed end  of the frustum . For example, the diameters of the open end  and the closed end  are 2\u03bb\/5 and \u03bb\/5 respectively with a distance of \u03bb\/ between the open end and the closed end. Any remaining structure of the antenna  would be within a circumferential boundary created by the above dimensions.","Furthermore, the all-metallic structure of the antenna  does not require a ceramic dielectric substrate yet allows transmission and reception at a large instantaneous operating bandwidth as exemplified by the antenna use with IRIDIUM and global positioning signals described above.","Thus by the present invention its objects and advantages are realized and although preferred embodiments have been disclosed and described in detail herein, its scope should be determined by that of the appended claims."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":["A more complete understanding of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereto will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0026","num":"0025"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0027","num":"0026"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"],"b":["2","2"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0028","num":"0027"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0030","num":"0029"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 4"],"b":["5","5"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0031","num":"0030"},"figref":"FIG. 6"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
