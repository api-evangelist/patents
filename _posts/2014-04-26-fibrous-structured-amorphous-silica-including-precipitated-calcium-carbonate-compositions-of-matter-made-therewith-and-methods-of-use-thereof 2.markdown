No. 61\/816,649, filed Apr. 26, 2013, entitled FIBROUS STRUCTURED AMORPHOUS SILICA INCLUDING PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE, COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER MADE THEREWITH, AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety, including the specification, drawing, and claims, by this reference.","Not Applicable.","A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The patent owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.","This application relates to novel fillers and pigments, to compositions of matter including such compositions, and to methods of use of such compositions.","Fillers and pigments are key components in many industrial markets, such as paper, paints, plastics, concrete, and pharmaceuticals. Fillers and pigments are utilized to reduce cost, improve functionality, and to improve the end use performance. One widely used pigment is titanium dioxide (TiO), which is used to provide brightness and light scattering properties. Another widely used pigment is fumed silica, which may be added to some compositions to provide thixotropic attributes, for example, in paint products. A different product, but with a similar sounding name, is silica fume, which will also be further discussed below.","In paper products, commodity filler or pigment products such as synthetic precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), or ground calcium carbonate (GCC) are often used. Various forms of PCC used include calcite crystalline structures, aragonite crystalline structures, and rhombohedral crystalline structures. Such crystalline structures are generally characterized by low aspect ratios, moderate brightness, and moderate light scattering power. Some of such materials provide improved optical properties. And, some of such materials enhance desired finished product attributes such as paper strength, when used in paper furnish, or print qualities, when used in paper coatings. However, there remains a significant need in various paper products for fillers and\/or pigments which might improve light scattering power. Similarly, in certain paint products, and uses thereof, there remains a need for improved light scattering power in fillers and\/or pigments.","Titanium dioxide is one of the most widely used pigments in many industries, such as paints, paper, coatings, and in some composites. Such use may often be to improve brightness, and\/or to improve opacity. The property of improved opacity means that light scattering properties are improved, which provides a product that is harder to see-through. For example, thin papers may be made more opaque (i.e., made with see-through properties that make it look as if it were actually thicker) by the use of fillers with opacifying properties. The provision of such properties in products using titanium dioxide is primarily due to a combination of characteristics of titanium dioxide, such as a high refractive index (in the range of from about 2.49 to about 2.61), a small particle size (often in the 0.2 micron to 0.4 micron size), and in the manner in which adjacent particles of titanium dioxide pack together when used in various products. However, despite having a unique shape, size, and crystal structure, titanium dioxide has certain limitations. First, it has a very high density of about 4.2 grams per cubic centimeter. Further, in order to keep small titanium dioxide particles from agglomerating in various compositions, dispersants must often be used. Such dispersants usually have deleterious effects on strength properties, especially in the case of coated paper. Also, titanium dioxide particles are highly abrasive. Finally, due to the complexity of some widely used titanium dioxide manufacturing processes, which may include complex separation and purification processes, titanium dioxide is one of the most expensive fillers and\/or coating pigments currently available.","Another filler and\/or pigment that may be utilized in some applications is fumed silica. Fumed silica (also called pyrogenic silica) is generally manufactured from flame pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride, or by the vaporization of quartz in a 3000\u00b0 C. arc furnace. The primary particle surface area of most fumed silica is broadly in the range of from about 50 to about 600 square meters per gram. Furthermore, amorphous fumed silica particles may be fused into chainlike secondary particles which, in turn, agglomerate into tertiary 3-dimensional particles. One limitation of fumed silica material is that it is non-porous. Also, fumed silica is generally highly thixotropic, and consequently may cause high viscosity compositions, for example when added to paints and coatings. Also, the environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes for fumed silica, and the usually high cost of fumed silica, limit its use.","Silica fume (also called micro-silica, and not to be confused with the just discussed fumed silica) is an amorphous (i.e., non-crystalline) material. Silica fume is often collected as an ultra-fine powder as a by-product of silicon or ferro-silicon alloy production. Silica fume is generally in the form of spherical particles with an average particle size of about 150 nanometers. Silica fume has a surface area in the range of from about 15 to about 30 square meters per gram. Also, silica fume is a highly pozzolinic material, and thus may be used in cement and concrete to enhance compressive strength, bond strength, and abrasion resistance. However, at this time, silica fume, being a byproduct of production of other materials, is in relatively short supply.","With respect to the manufacture of amorphous silica compounds, U.S. Pat. No. 4,230,765, issued Oct. 28, 1980 to Takahashi et al., for NOVEL AMORPHOUS SILICA, and PRODUCTS THEREOF, describes methods for manufacture of various types of amorphous silica compounds from calcium silicate hydrates. However, he did not develop products of size and of certain characteristics to provide suitable performance for use in high performance paper coatings of that are described herein. Further, he did not recognize that by carefully controlling the reaction conditions, fixation of calcium carbonate phases to an amorphous silica substrate could be selectively determined, and in so doing, enhance properties provided by such products, especially for high performance paper coating compositions.","In summary, the just discussed fillers and\/or pigments are generally of limited purpose. In many applications, each may have a single or limited number of product enhancing properties. Thus, there remains an as yet unmet need for a multi-functional filler and\/or pigment that may, in many applications, replace expensive fillers and pigments such as titanium dioxide, fumed silica, or silica fume. It would be advantageous if such a new filler and\/or pigment provided a combination of at least some ideal properties, such as (1) high surface ratio, (2) high aspect ratio, (3) high brightness, and (4) high light scattering coefficient. And, it would be even more advantageous if such a multi-functional filler and\/or pigment were environmentally safe, and available at prices competitive with expensive fillers such as titanium dioxide, fumed silica, or silica fume. Consequently, it is believed that provision of a unique multi-functional filler and\/or pigment would be an interesting and significant contribution to the art and science of fillers and pigments.","In the various figures of the drawing, like features may be illustrated with the same reference numerals, without further mention thereof. Further, the foregoing figures are merely exemplary, and may contain various elements that might be present or omitted from actual implementations of various embodiments depending upon the circumstances. An attempt has been made to provide the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the various embodiments and aspects of the developments described herein. However, various other elements for a multi-functional filler and\/or pigment, especially as applied for various compositions using the same, may be utilized in order to provide useful, reliable, and highly functional fillers and\/or pigments.","I have now developed a novel, multi-functional, nano-composite filler. The filler includes a synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica (\u201cSAS\u201d) component and a nano-fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate (\u201cFCA\u201d) component, which together may be abbreviated as a \u201cSAS & FCA\u201d nano-composite. In an embodiment, such a nano-composite filler maybe characterized as having high surface area (from about 40 to about 200 meters squared per gram). In an embodiment, when mixed with water, such a nano-composite filler and water mixture results in a pH in a relatively neutral range of from about 6.5 to about 7.5. In an embodiment, such unique nano-composites (SAS & FCA) may have a high water absorption rate, for example in the range of from about 100% to about 300%. In an embodiment, such unique nano-composites (SAS & FCA) may have a high oil absorption rate, for example in the range of from about 150% to about 300%.","In an embodiment, as shown in , a nano-composite SAS & FCA material may include at least two distinct components. As shown in , a first component having a globular, haystack, or pillow shaped structure may be provided. The globular, haystack, or pillow shaped structure may be provided in a configuration that presents a fibrous interstitial appearance, having inner layers and outer layers with irregular interlacing fibers or filaments which are fixed and disposed in relation to each other wherein the interlacing fibers or filaments of at least some of said inner layers are visible to a greater or less degree through the interstices of said outer layers, when said fibrous structure is viewed via microscope. In an embodiment, such globular or haystack or pillow shaped structure may be sized from about ten (10) microns to about forty (40) microns in size. In an embodiment, such globular \u201chay stack\u201d type structure may be composed of \u201chair\u201d like nano-fibers of amorphous silica, each having a selected diameter and a selected length. In an embodiment, the diameter of such amorphous silica fibers of may be in the ten (10) nanometer (nm) range. In an embodiment, the amorphous silica fibers may be in the range of from about three (3) to about four (4) microns in length. In an embodiment, the aspect ratio of such amorphous silica nano-fibers may be approximately 100:1.","In an embodiment, a second component may be provided in a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material. In an embodiment, a second component may be provided as an aragonite crystal. In an embodiment, such an aragonite crystal may have a \u201cneedle\u201d shaped fiber structure. In an embodiment, or in various embodiments, such aragonite crystals may have an estimated diameter of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm. In an embodiment, or in various embodiments, such aragonite crystals may have a length of from about 3 microns to about 10 microns.","In summary, a novel nano-composite material is described herein. Such nano-composite material includes a synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica component (the \u201cSAS\u201d component), and a nano-fibrous crystalline precipitated calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase component (the \u201cFCA\u201d component). As set forth in the drawing figures, an X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) analysis of the unique nano-composite material identified only a single crystalline constituent, which matched the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of an aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate (see ), with major peaks at 3.276, 3.398, and 1.977 D-spacing (angstroms). Thus the first structure is amorphous silica, rather than a crystalline calcium silicate hydrate. Further, as noted in , an EDAX analysis confirmed the first component to be silica. Thus, the unique nano-composite material described herein includes first component of amorphous silica, and a second component of crystalline aragonite.","Further, the nano-composite (SAS & FCA) is believed useful as filler, for example, in paints and coatings. And, initial tests have indicated that the nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material is useful as a component of coating compounds, especially in the manufacture of paper and paper products. A myriad of uses may be developed, based on the unique properties of such synthetic nano-composite (SAS & FCA) materials, as indicated in evaluations thus far conducted.","The foregoing briefly describes a novel, unique nano-composite that includes a first component of amorphous silica, and a second component of aragonite crystals. As described herein, such aragonite crystals may advantageously be synthesized by way of pressure carbonation technique. However, the various objectives, features and advantages of the novel nano-composite materials described herein will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with careful examination of the accompanying figures of the drawing.","A unique nano-composite material has been developed which includes both (a) nano-fibrous structured amorphous silica (SAS) and (b) nano-fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate (FCA). Thus, this novel nano-composite material may be referred to herein by the abbreviation \u201cSAS & FCA\u201d. In one aspect, the SAS & FCA nano-composite material may be characterized by having high surface area (approximately 40 to 200 m\/gram). The pH of the SAS & FCA nano-composite material, when mixed with water, is generally in the neutral range of from about 6.5 to about 7.5. In an embodiment, an SAS & FCA nano-composite material may have very high water absorption, and very high oil absorption ability, in the range of from about 100% to about 300% for water absorption, and from about 150% to about 300% for oil absorption. As seen in , a scanning electron microscope (SEM) picture clearly shows two distinct components for a SAS & FCA nano-composite material. The first components (an example is seen prominently at the upper right) are globular or haystack or pillow shaped structures, which may in an embodiment be from approximately 10 microns to approximately 40 microns in size. Such first components includes \u201chair like\u201d nano-fibers, which in an embodiment may be approximately 10 nanometers (nm) in diameter. In an embodiment, those hair like nano-fibers may be from about 3 microns to about 4 microns in length. An energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (\u201cEDAX\u201d) analysis confirmed the presence of SiOin such hair like nano-fibers. As also seen in , the second components are \u201cneedle\u201d shaped fiber like structures with an estimated diameter (but not limited thereto) of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm and with a length generally ranging in size (but not limited thereto) from about 3 microns to about 10 microns. As shown in , it is significant to note that the X-Ray Diffraction pattern (XRD) analysis identified only a single crystalline component, which matched the XRD pattern of a precipitated calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase (see ) with major peaks at 3.276, 3.398, and 1.977 D-spacing (in angstroms). Such analysis confirms that in an embodiment, the nano-composite material described herein may include structured amorphous silica (SiO) and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate. Consequently, it can be appreciated that the substances comprising the structures provided by selected precursor crystalline calcium silicate hydrates (\u201cCSH\u201d)\u2014such as xonotlite\u2014react and are converted substantially in place into amorphous silica. Thus, precursor crystalline calcium silicate hydrates may, under conditions described herein, be replaced by amorphous silica. Thus, the amorphous silica structures, and the associated fibrous crystalline calcium carbonate structures which is in an aragonite phase, are produced as a nano-composite material. In further detail, the structure of the nano-composite SAS & FCA material includes an amorphous silica portion having a haystack or pillow shaped configuration that presents a fibrous interstitial appearance, having inner layers and superimposed outer layers with irregular interlacing fibers or filaments which are fixed and disposed in relation to each other wherein the interlacing fibers or filaments of at least some of the inner layers of the structured amorphous silica are visible to a greater or less degree through the interstices of outer layers of the structured amorphous silica, when the nano-composite material is viewed via scanning electron microscope. Further, the crystalline calcium carbonate portion includes crystalline aragonite structures built within, or on, or within and on, or at least in part extending from, the amorphous silica portion of the nano-composite material. Thus, in an embodiment, the just described \u201cnano-composite\u201d material simultaneously provides certain characteristics that enable filler and\/or pigment performance both of amorphous silica and of a crystalline calcium carbonate in an aragonite phase, as will be further understood below in relation to examples provided.","Method for Manufacture\u2014Starting Materials and the Process","In an embodiment, one unique aspect of the developments described herein may involve the use of various phases of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) and the use of carbon dioxide (CO) under pressure, to manufacture a nano-composite material including both (a) amorphous silica and (b) fibrous crystalline calcium carbonate (which in an embodiment is provided in the aragonite phase).",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0084","num":"0083"},"figref":["FIG. 4","FIG. 5"]},"A novel development described herein is a process to convert a crystalline silicate hydrate such as xonotlite into amorphous silica. In an embodiment, such conversion may be achieved while concurrently producing a synthetic crystalline calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase. Such a process may involve the reaction of xonotlite with carbon dioxide (CO) under pressure, and thus may generally be referred to as a process for pressure carbonation of nano-fibrous calcium silicate hydrates. The SEM photograph and XRD patterns of the carbonated product resulting from reaction with xonotlite calcium silicate hydrate as a starting material are given in  respectively. Here again, the SEM photograph shows two distinct components in the nano-composite material, namely amorphous silica (within the solid circle) and fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate (within the dashed oval). In spite of the appearance of the structures, the XRD of the nano-composite material identifies only a single crystalline phase, namely aragonite phase calcium carbonate.","In one aspect, the process described herein includes the use of seed materials for enhancement of reactions, as such materials may promote conversion efficiency. The efficiency of a pressure carbonation process may be enhanced by using seed materials and\/or promoters or catalysts, such as pre-formed amorphous silica, which may be provided with, or without the use of an aragonite crystal. In an embodiment, reaction promoters and\/or catalysts may include calcium hydroxide, and\/or magnesium hydroxide.","Another aspect of the developments described herein is mineral fixation of carbon dioxide by the manufacture of synthetic calcium carbonate compositions as a component of a nano-composite SAS & FCA material. Thus, a novel process for producing precipitated calcium carbonate is described herein, which enables the efficient use of \u201cfree\u201d carbon dioxide found in flue gas, and more particularly, which may use carbon dioxide from flue gas containing relatively low concentrations of carbon dioxide. Prior work, involving simply the production of precipitated calcium carbonate under pressurized conditions, was described in prior U.S. Pat. No. 6,125,356, entitled \u201cHigh Speed Manufacturing Process for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate employing Pressure Carbonation\u201d was issued Jun. 26, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. That process was capable of providing a variety of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) morphologies. Various precipitated calcium carbonates that can be manufactured by that process include distinct crystal morphologies, such as calcite scalenohedral as well as calcite rhombohedral of various aspect ratios, and aragonite. SEM photographs of such crystals may be seen in . A PCC product manufactured under a pressure carbonation system may be referred to herein as a Super Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (\u201cS-PCC\u201d).","The basic chemistry for producing precipitated calcium carbonates includes the steps of calcination, slaking, and carbonation. The following chemical reactions describe such steps:\n\n","In order to produce the nano-composite product(s) described herein, an additional step is required, as follows:\n\n","The carbonation reaction (equation (3) above) is an equilibrium reaction. Therefore, as the soluble calcium ion is converted to calcium carbonate (CaCO) precipitate, more dissolution of the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)) takes place from the slurry to increase the concentration of the calcium ion up to the solvent solubility limits (inverse temperature dependent phenomenon), until all of the available calcium hydroxide is dissolved, and all available calcium ions have been converted into calcium carbonate. When the process is further conducted to form nano-composite SAS & FCA material, as set forth in equation (4), it is of interest that carbon dioxide fixation using synthetic silicates under pressure is a novel method of carbon capture, i.e., fixation by mineralization.","Another aspect the developments described herein is the application of such dual component nano-composites in paper (as in substitution for conventional pigments and fillers), and in paperboard coatings, and in other industrial applications such as fillers or pigments for paints and\/or coatings. As further described herein, the novel nano-structured materials described herein have some unique properties. In an embodiment, such properties may make it useful as filler in papermaking operations. In various embodiments, such use may provide some unusual and beneficial paper properties, or in unusual and beneficial paper coating properties, resulting in superior paper products when made with the nano-structured materials described herein.","In various embodiments, the nano-structured composite materials described herein may be used at various degrees of substitution for currently used high performance coating pigments such as titanium dioxide (TiO). In various embodiments, the nano-structured composite materials described herein may be used at various degrees of substitution for calcined and other naturally occurring clays. The unique nano-composites described herein may also be used to enhance the performance of various paper properties, such as to improve surface strength of coatings (pick strength), smoothness, appearance, shade, matte finish (lower sheet gloss), print quality, wet pick, and the like. In short, the nano-composite material described herein, including nano structured amorphous silica and nano- fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate, fits nearly all of the applicable criteria of an ideal pigment.","In an embodiment, a unique nano-composite including synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica (SAS) and a nano fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate (FCA) is provided. In an embodiment, such nano-composite may be characterized by having high surface area (approximately 40 to 200 meters squared per gram). In water suspension, an embodiment of such unique nano-composite material may have a pH in the neutral pH range of 6.5 to 7.5. In an embodiment, such nano-composite may have a very high water absorption, say in the range of from about 100% to about 300%. In an embodiment, such nano-composite may have a high oil absorption, say in the range of from about 150% to about 300%. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) photograph set forth in  clearly shows two distinct components. The first component shown in the photograph is a globular, haystack, or pillow shaped structure of approximately 10 microns to 40 microns in size. The first structure includes \u201chair like\u201d nano-fibers which in an embodiment may be approximately 10 nm in diameter. In an embodiment, such fibers may be about 3 microns to about 4 microns in length. Thus, in an embodiment, the aspect ratio of nano-fiber SAS & FCA may be approximately 100:1. The second and prominent components in the SEM photograph provided in  are the \u201cneedle\u201d shaped fiber structures. In an embodiment, those prominent components have an estimated diameter of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm, and length ranging from about 3 microns to about 10 microns. Note that the X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern analysis shown in  identified only a single crystalline component, which component matches the XRD pattern of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite, with major peaks at 3.276, 3.398, and 1.977 D-spacing (in angstroms). Thus, the other structure was amorphous, rather than crystalline. An energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (\u201cEDAX\u201d) analysis (see ) confirmed that the amorphous structure was silica. Thus, nano-composite SAS & FCA which has been developed is a composite of structured amorphous silica (SAS) and fibrous crystalline aragonite (FCA).","In an embodiment unique nano-composite materials may be produced by the pressure carbonation of one or more of selected synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrates (CSH). Suitable synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrates may include riversidite (see ), or foshagite (see ), or tobermorite (see ), or xonotlite (see ).","Several process steps may be utilized in the preparation of the unique nano-composite materials described herein. In a very basic view, there are two steps, as noted in the two blocks set forth in . In a first step, one or more selected synthetic silicate hydrates are prepared by using hydrothermal reaction of calcareous materials, such as lime, with siliceous materials, such as quartz or diatomaceous earth (\u201cDE\u201d). In a second step, the just prepared one or more selected calcium silicate hydrates are subjected to carbonation, under pressurized conditions, to produce a nano-composite structure that includes amorphous silica, generally shaped in the form of the prior crystalline calcium silicate hydrate, and additionally, crystalline calcium carbonate, which in an embodiment, appears in the aragonite phase. In an embodiment, the process(es) may be carried out in pressurized reactors.","The manufacturing process of suitable nano-composite materials involves reacting carbon dioxide reaction with synthetic calcium silicate hydrate under pressure. In an embodiment the reaction of carbon dioxide under pressurized conditions provides carbonic acid in liquid solution for reaction with the one or more selected calcium silicate hydrates. In an embodiment, such the second step of formation of nano-composites, i.e., pressurized carbonation may be carried out in the presence of one or more seed materials, such as a selected amount of a previously prepared nano-composite (e.g., a selected amount of aragonite). Further in an embodiment, reaction rates may be enhanced by utilization of a combination of selected amounts of calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. In an embodiment, the process of pressurized carbonation, may be carried out by controlling the starting pH to the range of from about 10 to about 11.","The chemical reaction that occurs when synthetic calcium silicate hydrates are exposed to COis given in equation (4) above. In an experimental nano-composite manufacturing process, the carbonation of selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrates was carried out in a pressurized reactor, using a pressure carbonation process. The experimental process variables included (a) initial reactor pressure, (b) initial reactor temperature, and (c) carbon dioxide flow rate to the reactor. In an embodiment, some process parameters and their ranges may be considered as follows:\n\n","Production of Synthetic Calcium Silicate Hydrates","Set out below is a written description of a process for the production of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates (CSH), used as precursor materials for the production of novel nano-composite materials including the SAS & FCA composite described herein, and the manner and process of making and using such calcium silicate hydrates, in full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same, including the best mode presently contemplated by the inventor for carrying out such process. However, for additional reference, various additional embodiments for manufacturing and preparation of various phases of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,726,807 B1, issued on Apr. 27, 2004, and entitled \u201cMulti-Phase Calcium Silicate Hydrates, Methods for Their Preparation, and Improved Paper and Pigment Products Produced Therewith\u201d, and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,048,900 B2, issued on May 23, 2006, and entitled \u201cMethod and Apparatus for Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate and Silicate Compounds in Common Process Equipment\u201d. The reader is referred thereto for additional information, and the disclosures of each of the just mentioned patents, including their specification, claims, and drawing figures, are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference in those states (countries) where such incorporation by reference is permitted under applicable treaty, statute, or regulation.","Lime Slurry Preparation","Lime slurry is prepared according to generally accepted slaking processes. However, for purposes of further preparation of novel nano-composite SAS & FCA materials, an exception to commonly used methods may be advantageously utilized. For preparation of nano-composite SAS & FCA compositions as described herein, the lime slurry need not be cooled. Instead, hot lime slurry (usually at approximately 93\u00b0 C.) may be screened and transferred directly to a pressurizable reactor vessel. It should be noted that the solubility of calcium hydroxide is very low in water and is inversely proportional to the temperature of that water. For example, the concentration of lime, as calcium oxide (CaO), in pure water at 0\u00b0 C. is reported to be 0.14%. When the temperature of the water rises to the atmospheric boiling point, 100\u00b0 C., the solubility of the lime, as calcium oxide (CaO), falls to 0.05%.","Siliceous Slurry Preparation","Various siliceous materials such as quartz, water glass, clay, pure silica, natural silica (sand), natural diatomaceous earth, fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth, or combinations thereof, may be used as source(s) of siliceous material. In an experimental preparation of calcium silicate hydrates, an ultra-fine grade of fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth (\u201cFCDE\u201d) was utilized, and was made into a water slurry at approximately 146.2 grams FCDE per liter of slurry. More generally, an aqueous slurry of siliceous material at a concentration of from about 120 grams to about 180 grams of silica per liter of slurry can be used. It should be noted that the solubility of silica\/quartz, (unlike that of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH))), is directly proportional to temperature. For example, quartz is only slightly soluble up to about 100\u00b0 C. From about 100\u00b0 C. to about 130\u00b0 C., quartz starts solubilizing, and around 270\u00b0 C., a maximum solubility is reached at about 0.07%. The dissolution of silica may be represented as per the reaction described in equation (5):\n\n(5) (SiO)+2HO - ->Si(OH)\n","The solubility of silica in water may be increased by raising pH, such as by using various additives (e.g., sodium hydroxide). The solubilization of silica is also at least to some extent a function of particle size, thus in an embodiment, a smaller particle size, such as may be provided by use of ultra-fine fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth (FCDE) may be advantageous.","Hydro-Thermally Reacting the Lime Slurry and the Siliceous Slurry","First, the amount of CaO in a lime slurry and the amount of SiOin a diatomaceous earth slurry may be adjusted to give a selected CaO\/SiOmole ratio. Second, the concentration of the two slurries (CaO and SiO) and the final concentration of the mixture may be adjusted by using water so as to provide a selected final concentration, e.g., in an autoclave in experimental apparatus, of between about 24 and about 120 grams\/liter.","In an embodiment, a reaction was carried out in a pressurized reactor vessel, with three major steps:\n\n","In an experimental embodiment, a pressurized reactor vessel was cooled down by passing quenching water through an internal cooling coil and external jacketed cooling system. The cool down process took from about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes, in order to reduce the temperature from 230\u00b0 C. to 80\u00b0 C. Generally, the inverse solubility of lime in water with respect to temperature has been recognized, and thus utilized in an effort to produce the desired composition and phases of calcium silicate hydrate material.","Without limiting the developments described herein to any particular mechanism or theory, in some respects, it is presently believed that certain reactions occur during the hydrothermal reaction between calcious material and siliceous material. More particularly, solid calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)particles may react with SiOin a gel phase to yield a calcium silicate hydroxide whose crystallochemical structure can be written as CaSiO(OH)(xonotlite). As the temperature is further raised from about 180\u00b0 C. to about 250\u00b0 C., calcium silicate hydrate condenses with the remaining Ca(OH)particles to give yet another calcium silicate hydrate, this time with a distinct X-ray diffraction pattern and a crystallochemical formula of Ca(SiO)(OH)(foshagite). Thus, the process(es) described herein may produce not only single phase calcium silicate hydrates, but may also produce calcium silicate hydrates having multiple phases therein. Different calcium silicate hydrates may be made by changing the lime\/silica ratio, slurry concentration, reaction temperature and reaction time. The use of different additives like sodium hydroxide, sugar, and chelating compounds may also be utilized and manipulated to create diverse products. More generally, a variety of calcium silicate hydrates\u2014including xonotlite, tobermorite, riversidite, and foshagite\u2014may be prepared by manipulating the following process parameters:\n\n","Various phases of calcium silicate hydrates were produced by changing the calcium to silica molar ratio (e.g., from 0.75 to 1.35), by changing the reactant concentrations (e.g., from 48 to 120 grams per liter, and by changing the reaction temperature (e.g., from 180\u00b0 C. to 260\u00b0 C.), and by changing the reaction time (e.g., in the range of from about 2 hours to about 4 hours). Generally, for further production of nano-composite SAS & FCA products, the CSH products from a selected set of reaction conditions may be cooled from a maximum of 260\u00b0 C. to a minimum of between about 180\u00b0 C. and 70\u00b0 C.","High Pressure Reactor & Equipment for Manufacturing Multiple Calcium Silicate Hydrates, Lab Scale","In an embodiment, the process described herein utilizes a hydrothermal reaction that may be carried out under super-atmospheric conditions, using pressurized reactor equipment. As an example, a reactor used in the lab was a specialized, high pressure, high temperature, two liter reactor vessel. It was fitted with an outside jacketed heater and internal cooling coil system. The reactor was also fitted with an impeller to provide mixing in the reactor (e.g., Rustin 200 impeller). In a laboratory reactor embodiment, the agitator\/impeller was connected to a variable speed magnetic drive motor. Additionally, the reactor was fitted with a sample\/dip tube, and with a vent system, which was used to maintain pressure at a desired level. The completely assembled reactor was capable of pressures of up to 68.95 bar. All heating and cooling processes of the reactor were controlled via an external controller.","In an embodiment, the process included reacting lime at approximately 240 grams\/liter with a silica source (e.g., diatomaceous earth and\/or quartz) at about 180 grams\/liter. The reactions were made in a pressurized reactor over temperature range of 180\u00b0 C. to 250\u00b0 C. and the corresponding steam pressure, ranging from 13.8 bar to 41.37 bar. The total reaction time was approximately 4 to 6 hours. The resulting slurry concentration ranged from 36 grams per liter to 120 grams per liter.","The process conditions for the hydrothermal reaction such as calcium to silica ratio, slurry solids percentage, and temperature of reaction, were varied as shown in Table 1 below to prepare different crystal phases of calcium silicate hydrates, such as riversidite, tobermorite, xonotlite, and foshagite.

The manufacture of a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material involves pressure carbonation. In an embodiment, the manufacture of a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material may be done in a cogeneration fashion, that is, the reaction with the xonotlite substrate to replace the same with amorphous silica is carried out at the same time and under the same reaction conditions while fibrous crystalline aragonite is manufactured on, in, or protruding from the substrate CSH starting material, here the xonotlite substrate.","Seeding.","It has been found that efficiency of the carbonation of fibrous calcium silicate hydrate may be significantly improved by adding certain seed materials, and\/or reaction promoter materials, and\/or catalysts, and\/or pH modifiers, as further described below. In an embodiment, a suitable seed material may include previously generated nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material. In an embodiment, a suitable seed material may include one or more additional calcium silicate hydrate precursors. Additional seed materials may include commercially produced calcium carbonates (CaCO) in the aragonite phase. The total quantity of seed materials to be added may range from about 2% to about 20% of the total weight of reactants.","Catalysts\/Promoters","Catalysts may include a mixture of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)). The total quantity of catalytic material may range from about 2.0% to about 10.0% of the total weight of reactants. The ratio of calcium hydroxide to magnesium hydroxide may range from about 1:1 to about 2:1. Such catalysts also serve as pH buffers and promoters, and may also help to remove certain impurities from process water. In an embodiment, before the start of pressure carbonation, the described seed materials, and catalysis\/promoters were added to a xonotlite slurry produced as described above.","Pressure Carbonation of Synthetic Calcium Silicate Hydrates (CSH)","In an experimental embodiment, as seed material was added to a hot silicate slurry (<70\u00b0 C.), the slurry was cooled to a final temperature ranging from 50\u00b0 C. to 75\u00b0 C. The reactor vessel was then pressurized using a non-reactive gas to a pressure ranging from 2.0 to 6.9 bar. After that, a gas flow containing carbon dioxide (CO) was injected under pressure into the reactor vessel. The carbon dioxide composition of the gas stream varied between about 5% and to about 100% COby weight. The total gas flow was between 1.3 liters per minute to 7.2 liters per minute, and provided a theoretical reaction rate of between about 1.5 grams per liter per minute to about 8 grams per liter per minute. In laboratory experimental reactor apparatus, throughout the carbonation reaction the reactants were agitated with a built-in agitator. The paraxial tip speed of the agitator was 223.5 meters per minute (at a rotational speed of 700 RPM). In the laboratory, the reaction was carried out in a 5.7 liter volume pressurized stirred reactor manufactured by Parr Instrument Company, Moline, Ill., USA (see http:\/\/www.parrinst.com). Rotational speed (RPM) was measured by a tachometer attached to the motor of the agitator. The reaction temperature was measured by using a thermocouple temperature probe. Carbon dioxide flow rate was measured using a carbon dioxide specific flow meter with a totalizer to calculate the total carbon dioxide consumed. The pressure was recorded by a pressure probe and shown on a pressure gauge. The carbonation reaction between the silicate slurry and carbon dioxide is an exothermic reaction. Thus, as the reaction proceeded, the temperature of the slurry increased. The end of the carbonation reaction was indicated by the reactor temperature reaching a peak and then stabilizing to a plateau. Usually the increase in temperature (AT) was in the range of 5\u00b0 C. to 15\u00b0 C., depending on the reactivity of the silicate, and the composition of the starting calcium silicate hydrate. The end of the carbonation reaction was also indicated by plotting the temperature profile.","During reaction, the incoming carbon dioxide (CO) was continuously consumed by the calcium constituents of the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). Thus, while the COwas initially introduced at a pressure of approximately 70 psig, and, while the temperature increased due to the exothermic nature of the carbonation reaction, the pressure in the reactor remained fairly close to the initial pressure. However, at the end of the reaction, the calcium ions (Ca) and carbonate ions (CO) were fully consumed. In the experimental apparatus, the excess carbon dioxide at the end of the reaction started to increase the pressure of the reactor. Thus, while the end of the reaction was indicated by a plot of temperature versus time; another indicator was an increase in the rate of change in the pressure in the reaction vessel versus time.","Thus the completion of the carbonation of calcium silicate hydrates was indicated by the temperature reaching a plateau and by the pressure increasing significantly. The progress of the pressure carbonation reaction was also monitored by following the pH and conductivity of the slurry. The pH, as per equation 2 above decreased from an initial pH of approximately 11 to a final pH between about 6.5 and about 7.5. The conductivity also fell as the free calcium (Ca) ions were used up to produce non-ionic CaCO. The just noted pH was measured after the temperature reached a maximum and the rate of change of pressure started to increase.","One test utilized to establish the nature of products actually manufactured was the Mohr's Salt test. That test involved applying a solution of ammonium iron(II) sulfate (Mohr's Salt, namely (NH)Fe(SO).6HO)) to a sample of the nano-composite slurry. The development of a green color indicated the presence of aragonite crystal phase. This test was further confirmed by an X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Another test conducted was the surface area of the final product, using the BET method. In an embodiment, a range of surface areas was found, from about 50 square meters per gram to about 150 square meters per gram.","An example of cogeneration of a nano-composite (SAS & FCA), namely structured amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate, is now provided in further detail. A reaction was carried out according to the conditions necessary to produce a nano-composite of structured amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate.

Thus, the nano-composite (SAS & FCA) includes both fibrous amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite. In , the photographs taken with a scanning electron microscope show two distinct structures in the nano-composite SAS & FCA. A first structure resembles the shape of one of the raw materials, namely the xonotlite calcium silicate hydrate. The second structure resembles crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate. However, since crystalline silica was virtually absent in the X-Ray diffraction pattern, it may be inferred that the silica component was, after the carbonation reaction, essentially in a non-crystalline, i.e. amorphous form. The SEM photograph of the raw materials, namely synthetic xonotlite and its corresponding XRD are given in . The SEM photograph of the resulting nano-composite material (SAS & FCA) compound, after the pressure carbonation process, as well as its corresponding XRD, are shown in , respectively.","A comparison of a selected raw material, and of a sample of the finished product, namely a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) may be instructive. An SEM photograph of a selected raw material, namely xonotlite crystals, is shown in . The XRD for those xonotlite crystals is provided in . As illustrated in , after carbonation of the xonotlite raw materials, the SEM of the carbonated xonotlite showed two distinct structures, namely aragonite (dashed oval) and SiO(solid circle). However, as shown in , the X-Ray diffraction pattern of the novel nano-composite materials (SAS & FCA) showed the presence of a single predominant crystalline component, namely aragonite calcium carbonate. Thus, it can be inferred that the remaining SiOwas in an amorphous form. Thus, it has been determined that the carbonation of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates is technically feasible, and the work described herein has resulted in a novel, unique nano-composite (SAS & FCA) product.","In one aspect, the pressure carbonation of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates resulted in the unexpected formation of a nano-fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate (FCA). Such crystal structure was also confirmed by the chemical chromatic test using Mohr's Salt (green color). And, since the xonotlite, i.e., the silica portion of the XRD shown in  was not detected in the XRD pattern of the nano-composite illustrated in the XRD shown in , it is postulated that the final, carbonated nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material was mostly nano-fibrous structured amorphous silica (SAS), which was produced from the crystalline calcium silicate hydrate xonotlite.","Step 1: Preparation of Synthetic Calcium Silicate Hydrate\u2014Xonotlite","Initially, 117.4 grams of \u00bd\u2033 rotary pebble lime (from Graymont Lime Co.) was accurately weighed and slaked in 350 milliliters of high purity water prepared by reverse osmosis treatment. The slaking reaction is exothermic and caused the slurry temperature to rise to near boiling. When the slurry temperature was very near boiling, and before much of the water had evaporated, an additional 90 milliliters of water was added to both dilute and cool the slurry. The slurry was then agitated for 30 minutes to insure slaking completion. Then, the slurry was screened through a 100 mesh screen. The slurry was then transferred to a 5 liter autoclave, and tested for lime availability in accordance with ASTM method C25, entitled \u201cStandard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Limestone, Quicklime, and Hydrated Lime.\u201d Approximately 137.2 grams of fine fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth (FCDE), from Eagle Picher Minerals, Reno, Nev. (namely Celatom brand product designation MW-27) was weighed and added to 750 ml of hot water (concentration of approximately 182 grams\/liter). The silica slurry was added to the screened and tested lime slurry. The exact amount of silica slurry added to lime slurry was determined by the lime availability such that a CaO\/SiOmol ratio of approximately 1.05 would be maintained. The total slurry volume was also adjusted by adding water to a final concentration of 54 grams per liter. The autoclave was continuously agitated at a constant speed of 250 rpm. The starting temperature of the slurry was approximately 25\u00b0 C. The reactor was heated for approximately 100 minutes in order to reach the target temperature of 230\u00b0 C. The temperature was maintained at 230\u00b0 C. for 2 hours, after which, \u201cquenching\u201d water was flushed through the cooling coil built inside the reactor. The cooling process was maintained until the temperature in the reactor reached approximately 80\u00b0 C. (roughly 30 minutes), at which point the reactor was depressurized and opened. Then, the reaction products were transferred to a holding vessel for storage. One portion of the resultant slurry was tested for pH. Another portion of the resultant slurry was dried in an oven at 105\u00b0 C. for 12 hours. During the drying process, the slurry formed hard lumps, which had to be broken up through the use of a mortar and pestle.

The starting carbonation temperature was 60\u00b0 C. The reaction was carried out under a starting pressure of 70 psig. Carbon dioxide gas was bubbled through the reactor. The flow of carbon dioxide was at the rate of 3.6 liters per minute. As the reaction proceeded, the reaction temperature increased, with the temperature starting at 60\u00b0 C. and ending at approximately 70\u00b0 C. The end of the reaction was indicated when the temperature reached a maximum and then declined. The point of inflection in the temperature curve was taken as the completion point of the carbonation reaction. The pressure in the vessel spiked due to the incoming but unreacted CO. The reactor was first depressurized. Then, the reactor was opened and the reaction products were transferred to a holding vessel for storage. A portion of the resultant slurry was dried in an oven at 105\u00b0 C. for 12 hours. During the drying process, the slurry formed hard lumps, which had to be broken up through the use of a mortar and pestle.

As seen in , however, the SEM photographs for the nano-composite (SAS & FCA) shows two distinct structural features, namely SiO(in the solid circle) and aragonite (in the dashed oval). The first structural feature, SiO, resembles the original starting material, namely a haystack, pillow, or globular structure similar to the structure seen in the xonotlite (see the large circle illustrated in  above). The second structural feature resembles a crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate (see ). The presence of a silica product was confirmed by an EDAX analysis (see ).

The graph of the XRD pattern of this nano-composite (SAS & FCA) is provided in .","In summary, an exemplary embodiment of a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) may be manufactured in a straightforward manner. A synthetic calcium silicate hydrate is provided. The selected synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrate includes a base structure. Suitable synthetic calcium silicate hydrate may include one or more of (a) xonotlite, (b) foshagite, (c) tobermorite, (d) riversidite, or other synthetic calcium silicate hydrates. Currently, it is believed that the most cost effective results may be achieved by use of xonotlite; however, more work may reveal that products from other substrate starting synthetic calcium silicate hydrates may be provide advantageous properties as described herein. In various embodiments, the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate is mixed with water, sodium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide, to provide a slurry. The slurry is provided to a reactor. In an embodiment, selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate(s) may be provided in the slurry in the range of from about 36 grams per liter to about 120 grams per liter. In an embodiment, the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate(s) may be provided in the slurry in the range of from about 48 grams per liter to about 96 grams per liter. 3 In an embodiment, the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate(s) may be provided in the slurry in the range of from about 12 grams per liter to about 600 grams per liter. In an embodiment, the ratio of CaO to SiOin the slurry may be in the range of from about 0.75 to about 1.3. In various embodiments, the reactor is pressurized, and carbonation of the selected synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrate proceeds by addition of carbon dioxide or carbonic acid to the reactor while agitating the contents of the reactor. In an embodiment, the pressure of the reactor may be in the range of from about 0.69 bar to about 20.68 bar. In an embodiment, the pressure of the reactor may be in the range of from about 2.07 bar to about 6.89 bar. In an embodiment, the pressure of the reactor may be in the range of from about 3.45 bar to about 6.21 bar. In an embodiment, the pressure of the reactor may be maintained at about 4.83 bar. In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide may be provided to the reactor as a gas. In various embodiments, the carbon dioxide may be present in the gas at from about 5% carbon dioxide, to about 100% carbon dioxide. In an embodiment, the carbon dioxide may be present in the gas about from about 10% to about 20%.","During reaction, calcium is extracted from the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate that provides the base structure. Thus, the selected synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrate composition is transformed to silicon dioxide, thereby forming a fibrous amorphous silica component. In various embodiments, the fibrous amorphous silica component is provided in three-dimensional haystack configuration (may also be described as globular or pillow shaped) that presents a fibrous structure having interstitial spaces between amorphous silica fibers with inner layers and outer layers with irregular interlacing amorphous silica fibers or filaments that are fixed in relation to each other. Such reaction proceeds under reaction conditions known to be conducive to the formation of precipitated calcium carbonate in the form of crystalline aragonite. In an embodiment, the crystalline aragonite are attached to the fibrous amorphous silica component. Thus, a nano-composite product is produced, wherein the nano-composite product includes both fibrous structured amorphous silica and precipitated calcium carbonate in the form of fibrous crystalline aragonite. In various embodiments, the nano-composite product may have a major axis of length L in the range from about 10 microns to about 40 microns, and a surface area of from about 40 meters squared per gram to about 200 meters squared per gram. The reactor may be depressurized, preferably after reactants have been consumed to the extent feasible for the formation of the nano-composite material. Contents of the reactor may then been cooled. In most applications, it may be necessary or convenient to dry the nano-composite product produced in said reactor.","In various embodiments of a method for production of a nano-composite of the type set forth herein, the step of providing slurry may further include providing seed material. In an embodiment, such seed material may comprise aragonite. In various embodiments, such seed material may comprise a previously manufactured portion of the nano-composite product itself. In an embodiment, the seed material may include one or more selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrates. In various embodiments, the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrates for use as seed material may include one or more of (a) xonotlite, (b) foshagite, (c) tobermorite, and (d) riversidite. In an embodiment, the seed material may include calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)) in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight. In an embodiment, the seed material may include magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)) in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight. In an embodiment, the seed material may include calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)) in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight, and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)) in the range of from about 2% to about 10% by weight, and wherein the ratio of magnesium hydroxide to calcium hydroxide is in the range of from about 1:1 to about 2:1. In an embodiment, the seed material may include amorphous silica.","Applications for Nano-Composites (SAS & FCA) in Coatings","Process for Making Coatings","In an experimental apparatus, after a batch of nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material had been manufactured, validated, and approved by the tests described above, a slurry was then run through a 100 (152 micron) to 200 mesh (75 micron) screen to remove large particles, inert material, and reactor scale. After the oversized material was removed, the slurry was then run through a series of unit operations to remove the excess water. In industrial practice, such processes may include use of a drum filter, and\/or press filters, and\/or vacuum filtration, and\/or spray drying, and\/or oven drying, or the like. In an embodiment, a dry, final product may be obtained. Such dry material may be ground up, e.g using a ball mill or the like, so that the dried solid nano-composite material will pass through a screen of selected size, such as a 100 mesh screen.","High Solids Pigment Slurry","After a dry pigment sample was screened, it was then mixed with water to make a high solids slurry with solids ranging from about 40% to about 60%. That was accomplished with the use of a high shear mixer (such as a Cowlez mixer or Silverson Unit). Before the dry pigment was mixed with the water, a dispersing agent was added to the water (e.g., a sodium polyacrylamide). The amount of dispersing agent added per pound of dry pigment may vary widely depending upon the selected dispersant, but for the stated example, may range from about 0.5% to about 4%. The resulting slurry was passed through a 100 mesh screen to remove large agglomerated particles.","Coating Formulation\u2014Pigment Mixing","Several different coating pigments may be combined to make a coating formulation. Such coating pigments may include coating clays, calcined clays, various forms of calcium carbonates, titanium dioxide, and other materials. Different coating pigments may be dispersed individually, either at the manufacturer's plant or the consumer's plant. The order of mixing the various coating pigments is generally not too important, but care should be taken to insure that agglomeration with different pigments does not occur. With the different coating mixtures, the dispersed pigments described above were blended based on a parts method, by weight. Exemplary coating formulations are given in specific examples set forth below.","After the various coating pigments were added to together, various binding agents were added to the blend. Some synthetic binding agents may include, but are not limited to, styrene-butadiene latex (\u201cSB latex\u201d), styrene-acrylate latex, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl acrylic latex, and vinyl acetate-ethylene latex. Also, natural binding agents may be selected from various materials such as corn and\/or potato starches that have been modified, e.g., by enzyme conversion, or acid thinned, or cation protonated, or oxidized, or hydroxyethylated, or thermally modified, and\/or turned into a biopolymer. Also, various soy proteins, modified by adding carboxyl groups, may be utilized.","After the final material components were added, the coating formulation was screened through a selected screen, and in this embodiment, through a 100 mesh screen.","Thus, an exemplary coating composition for coating paper, paperboard products, or label stock may be provided by utilizing the nano-composite material described herein above. In various embodiments, exemplary coating compositions may be provided using a water slurry including (a) a nano-composite material having a fibrous amorphous silica component, and a crystalline aragonite component. In an embodiment, the fibrous amorphous silica component may be provided in three-dimensional haystack or globular configuration that presents a fibrous structure having interstitial spaces between amorphous silica fibers, with inner layers and outer layers with irregular interlacing amorphous silica fibers or filaments which are fixed in relation to each other. In an embodiment, the crystalline calcium carbonate component includes aragonite needle structures. The aragonite needle structures arise from the fibrous amorphous silica component. Overall, in exemplary embodiments, the nano-composite material may have a major axis of length L in the range from about 10 microns to about 40 microns, and a surface area of from about 40 meters squared per gram to about 200 meters squared per gram. A suitable coating composition may also include clay, such as natural or calcined clays, and one or more binders. In an embodiment, suitable binders may include one or more latex compounds as generally known in the art. In an embodiment, suitable binders may include one or more protein or protein derivative compounds as generally known in the art. Before use, a thoroughly mixed coating composition should be passed through a screen of selected size, to assure uniformity and absence of oversize materials. In an embodiment, a 100 mesh screen may be suitable. In an embodiment for a coating composition, the amorphous silica fibers in the amorphous silica component may have a length of from about 3 microns to about 4 microns. In an embodiment for a coating composition, the amorphous silica fibers in the amorphous silica component may have fibers with a diameter of about 10 nm. In an embodiment for a coating composition, the amorphous silica fibers in the amorphous silica component may have an aspect ratio of from about 50:1 to about 100:1. In an embodiment for a coating composition, the aragonite needle structures may include aragonite crystals having a length of from about 1 micron to about 10 microns. In an embodiment such aragonite crystals may have a length of from about 3 microns to about 5 microns. In an embodiment, such aragonite needle structures may include aragonite crystals having a diameter of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm. In an embodiment, the aragonite crystals may have an aspect ratio of from about 50:1 to about 100:1. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may have a water absorption characteristic in the range of from about 100% to about 300%. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may have a water absorption characteristic of at least 150%. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may have an oil absorption characteristic in the range of from about 150% to about 300%. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may have an oil absorption characteristic in the range of from about 200% to about 250%. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may have a surface area in the range of from about 50 meters squared per gram to about 150 meters squared per gram.","In various embodiments, a suitable coating composition may further include ground calcium carbonate. In various embodiments of a coating composition, such nano-composite products may further include at least some titanium dioxide. In various embodiments of exemplary coating compositions as set forth herein, an increase in the amount of said nano-composite material in the coating composition may allow decrease in the quantity of said titanium dioxide necessary to be used in said coating composition, in order to achieve desired properties such as brightness or opacity. For example, in a selected coating composition, wherein as a base case a specific target brightness may be achieved with selected amount of titanium dioxide in the absence of nano-composite material, it may be noted that such specific target brightness may also be achieved by replacement of up to 75% of the selected amount of titanium dioxide by addition of an effective amount of the nano-composite material in the coating composition. Similarly, in a selected coating composition, wherein as a base case a specific target brightness may be achieved with selected amount of titanium dioxide in the absence of said nano-composite material, it may be noted that such specific target brightness may also be achieved by replacement of 50% of the selected amount of titanium dioxide by addition of an effective amount of the nano-composite material. Similarly, in a selected coating composition, wherein as a base case a specific target brightness may be achieved with selected amount of titanium dioxide in the absence of said nano-composite material, it may be noted that such specific target brightness may also be achieved by replacement of 25% of the selected amount of titanium dioxide by addition of an effective amount of the nano-composite material. More generally, it can be said that in many cases where a coating composition further includes any one or more of (a) titanium dioxide, (b) calcined clay, (c) natural clay, and (d) ground calcium carbonate, and providing an effective amount of the nano-composite material in the coating composition may allow a decrease in the quantity of a selected one or more of (a) titanium dioxide, (b) calcined clay, (c) natural clay, and (d) ground calcium carbonate, in the coating composition, as necessary to meet selected performance or cost objectives.","In must further be noted that the nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material described herein may have, in many cases, beneficial attributes to coating formulations, generally.

These methods included air knife, rod, blade, and other coating methods. In the lab, a lab rod coater (RK Control Coater) was used. After the coating is applied based on the end-user's requirements, the coated sample was dried, generally using a heated drum (Regal-Arkay ST-22). After the coating was dried, the resulting coated sample was examined for defects or gaps in the coating.","Testing of Coated Material","When a sample coating passed initial examination as just noted above, it was then tested for the following properties:\n\n","Coating of Unbleached Board","A coating operation was conducted at a laboratory in Tacoma, Wash. The pigment slurries were dispersed using a Silverson disperser then screened through a 100 mesh screen. Coating binders were added to the pigment slurry, first a soybean based protein followed by a latex, and the coating formulation was blended with a Silverson low shear mixer. The coatings were applied to the paperboard using a RK rod coater and dried in a drum dryer having a Teflon coated, non-stick surface (Regal Arkey ST-22). Coatings were applied over a range of coat weights and then soft nip calendared. The test data for each coating condition, including the lab control, were plotted as a function of coat weight and normalized to a target coat weight for comparison.","For Example 5, an unbleached Kraft paperboard having a production base coating was as a substrate on which a top coating was applied in the laboratory. The TiOrange for the top coat control was in the 15 parts to 20 parts range per 100 parts of total dry pigment (by weight), which included calcined clay and #1 coating clay, with soybean based protein and SB Latex as binder. In this case study, 25%, 50%, and 75% of the TiOwas replaced with a nano-composite (SAS & FCA) material in the coating formulation.
