B. Hu and M. C. Nuss, \u201cImaging with Terahertz Waves,\u201d Opt. Lett. 20, 1716-1718 (1995) hereby incorporated by reference), semiconductor characterization (see, D. M. Mittleman, J. Cunningham, M. C. Nuss and M. Geva, \u201cNoncontact Semiconductor Wafer Characterization with the Terahertz Hall Effect,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett. 71, 16-18 (1997), hereby incorporated by reference), and chemical (see, R. H. Jacobsen, D. M. Mittleman and M. C. Nuss, Chemical Recognition of Gases and Gas Mixtures with Terahertz Waves, Opt. Lett. 21, 2011-2013 (1996), (hereby incorporated by reference) and biological sensing (see T. W. Crowe, T. Globus, D. L. Woolard and J. L. Hesler, Terahertz Sources and Detectors and Their Application to Biological Sensing, Philosophical Transactions,\u201d Royal Society A 362, 365-377 (2004) hereby incorporated by reference. However, the THz spectrum still suffers from the often cited \u201cTHz gap,\u201d which refers to the lack of basic components available in this frequency range. See, P. H. Siegel, THz Technology, , 50(3), 910-928, (2002), hereby incorporated by reference. This deficiency has been reduced, in part, through the use of scalable artificial electromagnetic composites such as metamaterials and frequency selective surfaces. Multifunctional electromagnetic composites derive their response primarily from the geometry of unit cells arrayed in a periodic fashion. Through ingenious design, these materials have been used to create a negative index of refraction (see, V. G. Veselago, The Electrodynamics of Substances with Simultaneously Negative Values of \u2208 and \u03bc,\u201d Sov. Phys. Usp. 10, 509-514 (1968) and D. R. Smith, W. J. Padilla, D. C. Vier, S. C.

Luukkonen, C. R. Simovski, and S. A. Tretyakov. Grounded uniaxial material slabs as magnetic conductors, , 15, 267-283 (2009), hereby incorporated by reference.","At THz frequencies, active electromagnetic composites have been developed including voltage controlled modulators and phase shifters, and reconfigurable materials as reported in H. T. Chen, et al., Active terahertz metamaterial devices, Nature, 444, 597 (2006), H. T. Chen, et al., Experimental demonstration of frequency-agile terahertz metamaterials, Nature Photonics, 2, 295 (2008), and H. Tao, et al., Reconfigurable Terahertz Metamaterials, Phys. Rev. Lett., 103, 147401 (2009). All of these devices were created through precise design of metallo-dielectric unit cells. The geometry of the metallic structure within the unit cell imbues the composite with macroscopic properties not found in its constituent components. As with atomic materials, the point group symmetry of the unit cell maps onto the macroscopic properties. A prime example are unit cells the lack fourfold rotational symmetry which manifests as birefringence in the material response. This lack of symmetry has been previously exploited to make transmissive waveplates as referenced in A. C. Strikwerda, Fan, Hu Tao, D. V. Pilon, X. Zhang, and R. D. Averitt, Comparison of birefringent electric split-ring resonator and meanderline structures as quarter-wave plates at terahertz frequencies, Opt. Express 17, 136-149 (2009), X. G. Peralta, E. I. Smirnova, A. K. Azad, H.-T. Chen, A. J. Taylor, I. Brener, and J. F. O'Hara, Metamaterials for THz polarimetric devices, Opt. Express 17, 773-783 (2009), and P. Weis, O. Paul, C. Imhof, R. Beigang, and M. Rahm, \u201cStrongly birefringent metamaterials as negative index terahertz wave plates,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett. 95, 171104 (2009). However these, and other typical THz components, suffer high insertion loss which arises from Fresnel losses which can be substantial as typical materials at THz frequencies have large refractive indices. This can be remedied through the use of anti-reflection (AR) coatings, but in foregoing references (A. C. Strikwerda, Fan, Hu Tao, D. V. Pilon, X. Zhang, and R. D. Averitt, \u201cComparison of birefringent electric split-ring resonator and meanderline structures as quarter-wave plates at terahertz frequencies,\u201d Opt. Express 17, 136-149 (2009), X. G.

Imhof, R. Beigang, and M. Rahm, \u201cStrongly birefringent metamaterials as negative index terahertz wave plates,\u201d Appl. Phys. Lett. 95, 171104 (2009)) the AR coatings would be thicker than the actual device, which may be disadvantageous in either fabrication or implementation.","In P. Weiss, et al., \u201cStrongly birefringent metamaterials as negative index terahertz wave plates,\u201d Applied Physics Letters 95, 171104 (2009) (hereby incorporated by reference), there is reported an alternative approach for the design and fabrication of thin wave plates with high transmission in the terahertz regime. The wave plates are based on strongly birefringent cut-wire-pair metamaterials that exhibit refractive indices of opposite signs for orthogonal polarization components of an incident wave.","Referring now to , a half waveplate rotates linearly polarized light by 90 degrees. A quarter waveplate converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light.","A preferred embodiment comprises a waveplate for operation in a reflection mode (at a 45\u00b0 angle of incidence), thereby eliminating an avenue of potential powerloss. The reflection-mode metamaterial waveplate can be static or dynamic. In the static case, the electromagnetic response of the metamaterial does not change. In the dynamic case, the electromagnetic response of the metamaterial can be altered by applying an external bias, such as an electrical voltage or optical excitation beam.","A preferred embodiment comprises a reflection-mode waveplate for operation in the terahertz region by shifting the phase between two perpendicular polarization components of the light wave, comprising a ground plane; an array of polygonal unit cells; the polygonal unit cells comprising a polymer positioned between the ground plane and the exterior of the array of polygonal patches.","Another preferred embodiment comprise a waveplate comprising an array of unit cells; each unit cell comprising a ground layer; a polymer material layer; a layer of GaAs; an n-type GaAs thin layer grown on the GaAs layer; and a split ring resonator fabricated on the n-type GaAs thin layer grown on GaAs; the split ring resonator having a gap such that when a reverse bias is applied between the ground layer and the split ring resonator, the carriers in the gap are depleted and the split ring resonator resonance turns on.","Another preferred embodiment comprises a waveplate comprising an array of unit cells; each unit cell comprising a ground layer; a sapphire layer; a silicon thin layer grown on the sapphire layer; and a split ring resonator fabricated on the silicon thin layer grown on sapphire; the split ring resonator having a gap such that when an optical pump beam is applied to the gap region, photoexcited carriers in the gap short the gap and the split ring resonator resonance turns off.","Referring now to , the unit cell pictured is of a static reflection-mode half waveplate  which is arrayed infinitely in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The rectangular patch  is 119 \u03bcm\u00d7194 \u03bcm and the periodicity may be, for example, 195 \u03bcm\u00d7234 \u03bcm.

All light colored (gold) structures may be approximately 200 nm thick.","Referring now to , the unit cell pictured of an electrically modulated reflection-mode quarter waveplate  comprising an electrical split ring resonator (SRR) metamaterial (ohmic contact)  fabricated on a 2 mm n-type GaAs thin layer grown on GaAs using molecular beam epitaxy. The material is etched such that n-type GaAs remains only in the gap  of the SRR. Reverse bias between the gold ground plane Schottky contact  and the SRR metamaterial ohmic contact  depletes the carriers in the gap and turns on the SRR resonance. A layer of polyimide separates the SRR and the gold ground plane.","Referring now to , the unit cell of an optically modulated reflection-mode quarter waveplate pictured is an optically modulated reflection-mode quarter waveplate. The electrical SRR  is fabricated on silicon on sapphire. The material is etched so Si remains only in the gap . Photoexcitation by an optical beam generates electron-hole pairs in the Si thereby shorting the gap and turning off the SRR resonance. The electrical split ring resonator (SRR) is fabricated on silicon on sapphire. The material is etched so Si remains only in the gap. Photoexcitation generates electron-hole pairs in the Si thereby shorting the gap and turning off the SRR resonance.","In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a preferred embodiment of the static reflection-mode THz half and quarter waveplate for operation at a center frequency of 350 GHz was simulated, fabricated, and measured. While the design frequency was arbitrary, the waveplate band of operation can be scaled over a wide frequency range by appropriate scaling the unit cell dimensions.

The spectrometer is continuously tunable between 0.09 and 1.2 THz with \u02dc1 MHz resolution.","The system emits a linearly polarized CW THz beam and has a polarization sensitive detector. In one testing setup, as shown in , the static reflection-mode half waveplate was placed on a rotating sample holder with an incident beam at a 45 degree angle. Two configurations were measured, one where the polarization sensitive detector was aligned parallel to the polarization of the emitter, and one where the detector was orthogonal to the polarization of the emitter. The half waveplate was then illuminated by a 350 GHz CW beam and rotated in place while the detected signal amplitude was recorded as a function of angle. The results, plotted against simulation, are shown in , and clearly demonstrate both the conversion, and extinction, of the incident polarization as a function of waveplate rotation. There are four maxima and minima as expected due to the rectangular nature of the unit cell and consistent with a diagonal Jones matrix for the half waveplate that is sandwiched between two rotation matrices to model waveplate rotation.","For the illustration of , the static reflection-mode half waveplate was rotated while being illuminated by 350 GHz CW radiation. As the fast\/slow axes of the waveplate align with the polarization, a maximum in the \u201cAligned\u201d configuration corresponds to a minimum in the \u201cOrthogonal\u201d configuration. Similarly, the \u201cOrthogonal\u201d configuration results in a maximum when the incident polarization is at 45 degrees relative to the fast\/slow axes of the electromagnetic composite.","In a second testing setup, as shown in , the static reflection-mode waveplate is fixed on a sample holder such that the fast\/slow axes of the electromagnetic composite is aligned at 45 degrees relative to the polarization of the incident THz beam. The waveplate is illuminated with a 350 GHz linearly polarized CW THz beam from a photomixer source at a 45 degree incidence angle. The reflected beam is sent through an analyzer into a polarization sensitive photomixer. The analyzer is mounted on a rotation stage. The reflected signal is detected as a function of the rotation angle of the analyzer. S-polarized refers to light polarized perpendicular to the plane of incidence.

The static reflection-mode half waveplate also simultaneously doubled the induced phase shift resulting in a functional half waveplate with a center frequency of 350 GHz. The static reflection-mode quarter waveplate exhibits an increased intensity throughput efficiency of 95% in comparison to 50% for the transmission-mode waveplate. The static reflection-mode quarter waveplate also simultaneously induces a \u02dc90 degree relative phase shift resulting in a functional quarter waveplate with a center frequency of 350 GHz.

The waveplates were simulated using CST Microwave Studios, and designed for operation at 0.350 THz with a 45 degree angle of incidence. Both of these structures achieved over 99% polarization conversion, with a reflected intensity of 81% and 95% for the half and quarter waveplate, respectively.

The experimental results are analyzed using Jones Matrix calculations to extract the induced phase shift and reflection coefficients of the waveplates. While these structures were designed for 0.350 THz, this frequency is easily adjustable by appropriate scaling of the waveplate dimensions.
