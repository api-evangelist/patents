{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This invention relates generally to a route guidance method and apparatus for a navigation system, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for displaying information regarding a scenic byway and scenic places on the scenic byway on a screen of a navigation system to allow a user to easily select and visit one or more scenic places on the selected scenic byway through a route guidance operation of the navigation system.","A navigation system performs travel guidance for enabling a user to easily and quickly reach the selected destination. A typical example is a vehicle navigation system where a vehicle is equipped with a navigation function to guide a driver to a destination through a calculated route. Such a navigation system detects the position of the user's vehicle, and reads out map data pertaining to an area at the current vehicle position from a data storage medium, for example, a CD-ROM (compact disc read-only memory), a DVD (digital versatile disc), or a hard disc. Typically, the navigation system displays a map image on a monitor screen while superimposing thereon a mark representing the current location of the user. At an intersection, the navigation system notifies the user which direction to turn at the intersection.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0004","num":"0003"},"figref":["FIGS. 1A-1H","FIG. 1A"]},"An example of process for specifying a destination in the navigation system through a Point of Interest (POI) search method is shown in . A \u201cFind Destination by\u201d screen shown in  for specifying an input method for selecting the destination. The \u201cFind Destination By\u201d screen lists various methods for selecting the destination including \u201cAddress\u201d for specifying the city and address of the destination, \u201cIntersection\u201d for specifying the names of two streets which intersect with one another, and \u201cPoint of Interest (POI)\u201d for selecting the programmed destination based on the name, category or telephone number.","When selecting, the \u201cPoint of Interest\u201d method in , the navigation system displays selection methods of point of interest (POI) either by \u201cPlace Name\u201d or \u201cPlace Type\u201d in . The \u201cPlace Name\u201d is to specify a name of the intended POI, and the \u201cPlace Type\u201d is to specify a category of the intended POI. If the \u201cPlace Type\u201d is selected in , the navigation system lists the categories of POIs as shown in .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0007","num":"0006"},"figref":["FIG. 1E","FIG. 1D","FIG. 1F"]},"In , the navigation system displays a progress scale during the calculation of the route to the destination. After determining the guidance route, the navigation system starts the route guidance operation as shown in . Typically, the navigation system shows the intersection that is highlighted to show the next turn and a direction of the turn. The search method in a conventional navigation system works in this manner when there is one fixed destination.","However, the conventional navigation system cannot sufficiently fulfill the needs of a user who wants to search multiple points of interest and obtain the most efficient route to accomplish the purpose of the trip. Although the above procedure works to guide a user to a particular destination, there is a demand that the route guidance function of the navigation system be extended for a new level of achievement in the driving. For example, the conventional navigation system is not suitably designed to obtain information on places of interest associated with a particular route, park, etc.","In many areas of the country, there are roads selected by the government or public organization based on scenic, recreational, natural, historic, cultural and archaeological qualities (hereafter referred to as \u201cscenic byways\u201d). A typical example of scenic byway is a road running through a national park, a coastline, etc., where a visitor can enjoy many beautiful sceneries, natural monuments, etc. along the road. Such an example of scenic byway is illustrated in the schematic map view of  that has a scenic byway name \u201cSan Luis Obispo North Coast Byway\u201d (part of \u201cCoast Highway 1\u201d in California).","As shown, there are many attractive places to visit on the scenic byway shown in . For example, on the schematic map image of , it is assumed that \u201cSan Simeon\u201d, \u201cCambria\u201d, \u201cHarmony\u201d, etc., are places of interest (byway points or scenic places) along the scenic byway that provide scenic attractions. Such places of interest may not necessarily be located on the scenic byway, but are close enough to the scenic byway such that a driver or a hiker can easily reach such places. For instance, \u201cRagged point vista\u201d, \u201cPoint Estero\u201d, etc., are not directly located on the scenic byway (Coast Highway 1) but are located close to the scenic byway.","Although a limited number of byway points are shown on the map in , many other byway points may exist. For example, \u201cEstero Properties\u201d, \u201cHearst Castle\u201d, \u201cMission de San Luis Obispo\u201d, \u201cMonterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary\u201d, \u201cMorro Bay National Estuary\u201d, etc. on the map image are also places of interest associated with the scenic byway of . Although there are many scenic byways in the country, in the conventional navigation system, it is not easy to find a scenic byway, let alone to obtain information on scenic places along and proximate to the scenic byway or to efficiently visit such scenic places.","Thus, it is desired that scenic byways can be searched in an efficient and organized manner through a navigation system. Moreover, there is a need of new navigation system that is capable of easily and quickly finding information regarding scenic byways and scenic places and creating an efficient route to visit such scenic places.","It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a navigation method and system which is capable of efficiently searching information regarding scenic byways and scenic places and selecting the scenic byway and scenic places to visit.","It is another object of the present invention to provide a navigation method and system which is capable of storing information on the scenic byways in the map database and retrieving the information on the scenic byways in response to the request by the user.","It is a further object of the present invention to provide a navigation method and system which is capable of performing a scenic byway mode in which operations and screen displays are specially designed for efficiently retrieving and selecting a desired scenic byway and scenic places to visit.","One aspect of the present invention is a navigation method for selecting and visiting scenic byway and scenic places. The method includes the steps of preparing data concerning scenic byways throughout a country in a map database of a navigation system or a map database of a remote data server, displaying a menu screen which includes a scenic byway menu, selecting the scenic byway menu thereby setting an operation of the navigation system to a scenic byway mode, checking the map database to retrieve the data concerning scenic byways within a predetermined distance range from a current position or other specified position, displaying a scenic byway list which lists scenic byways within the predetermined distance range, selecting a scenic byway from the scenic byway list, displaying a scenic place list which lists scenic places on the selected scenic byway, selecting one or more scenic places from the scenic place list, and calculating a route to the selected scenic places and guiding a user to the selected scenic places through the calculated route.","The navigation method further includes a step of retrieving information on a scenic byway selected from the scenic byway list and reproducing the retrieved information. In the navigation method, the step of reproducing the retrieved information is conducted by displaying the retrieved information on a screen of the navigation system as well as reproducing the retrieved information by speech sounds.","Further, in the navigation method, the step of displaying the scenic byway list is conducted by providing an information key to each entry in the scenic byway list to obtain information regarding the scenic byway. In the navigation method, the step of displaying the retrieved information on the screen of the navigation system is conducted by displaying a \u201cMore\u201d key on the screen so that the user is able to request further information on the selected scenic byway. In the navigation method, the step of displaying the retrieved information on the screen of the navigation system is conducted by displaying a \u201cRead\u201d key on the screen so that the user is able to request for reproducing the retrieved information by speech sounds.","In the navigation method, the step of displaying the scenic place list is conducted by providing a map image key to each entry in the scenic place list and displaying a map image of the scenic place when the map image key is activated. Further, the step of displaying the scenic place list is conducted by providing a check box to each entry in the scenic place list to select one or more scenic places. The navigation method further includes a step of disabling further selection of the scenic place when a number of scenic places already selected has reached to a predetermined maximum number.","In the navigation method, the step of displaying the map image of the scenic place is conducted by allowing the user to use a scroll key and a cursor on the map image thereby scrolling the map image and changing the size of the map image. In the navigation method, the step of allowing the user to use the scroll key on the map image includes a step of displaying a key on the screen so that the user is able to request further search for scenic byways within a predetermined distance range from a location specified by the cursor on the map image.","The navigation method further includes a step of displaying a scenic place list which lists the selected scenic places where each entry in the scenic place list is provided with a reference number or a last destination mark for indicating an order of visiting there. The navigation method further includes a step of displaying a map image of the selected scenic byway on a screen of the navigation system where each of the selected scenic places on the map image is accompanied by the reference number or the last destination mark that corresponds to that in the scenic place list.","In the navigation method, the step of calculating the route to the selected scenic places is conducted by using a combination of a conventional routing method for determining a quickest route to the scenic place and a scenic byway routing method for determine a route to stay on the scenic byway as long as possible or reasonably long enough. The conventional routing method is mainly used for determining a route between a starting point which is not on the selected scenic byway and any of the selected scenic place, and wherein said scenic byway routing method is mainly used for determining a route between one selected scenic place and another selected scenic place.","The navigation method, after turning on the navigation system, further includes a step of checking whether there exists the unfinished selected scenic place at which the user has not yet arrived, and a step of directly starting the scenic byway mode when there exists the unfinished selected scenic place.","Another aspect of the present invention is a navigation system which is designed to efficiently retrieve the information on the scenic byways and to visit such scenic byways through calculated routes by implementing the various steps of the navigation method described above. The navigation system of the present invention provides a scenic byway mode which is typically selected through a main menu of the navigation system to allows a user to easily and quickly search a desired scenic byway and selects scenic places on the scenic byway.","According to the present invention, the navigation method and system is designed to efficiently retrieve the information on the scenic byways and to visit such scenic byways through calculated routes. The navigation method and system allows the user to efficiently search the information regarding scenic byways and scenic places and to select the scenic byway and scenic places to visit. The navigation method and system stores the information on the scenic byways in the map database and facilitates retrieval of the information on the scenic byways in response to the request by the user. Alternatively, the navigation method and system searches and retrieves the information on the scenic byways and scenic places from the remote data server through wireless communication. The navigation method and system is designed to perform the scenic byway mode in which operations and screen displays are specially designed for efficiently retrieving and selecting a desired scenic byway and scenic places to visit.","The navigation method and system for retrieving information and selecting a scenic byway and scenic places (byway points) on the selected scenic byway for efficient route guidance operations in the present invention is explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the description of the present invention, such a scenic place on the scenic byway is also referred to as a \u201cbyway point\u201d or a \u201cpoint of interest\u201d. Further, the term \u201cscenic byway\u201d should not be limited to pre-registered scenic byways but should be broadly interpreted to any route that has a plurality of geographic, historical, cultural, etc. points and routes that are attractive to users.","It should be noted that the description will be made where the navigation method and system is applied mainly to a vehicle navigation system, but the navigation method and system incorporating the scenic byway mode under the present invention can be implemented to other devices having a navigation function such as hand-held devices, personal computers, cellular phone, etc. The navigation system of the present invention is designed to more easily and efficiently retrieve the information on the scenic byway and to select the scenic places to visit.","Namely, in the present invention, the navigation method and system provides a scenic byway mode which is typically selected through a main menu of the navigation system to allows a user to easily and quickly search a desired scenic byway and selects scenic places on the scenic byway. The map database of the navigation system stores the information concerning the scenic byways so that the desired information on the scenic byways can be retrieved through the process of the scenic byway mode. The information concerning the scenic byways can also be retrieved by the navigation system from a remote server directly through wireless communication or indirectly through wired communication.","The navigation system of the present invention displays the information on the specified scenic byways and scenic places so that the user can select desired scenic places based on such information. The navigation system calculates an efficient route to visit the selected scenic byway and guides the user to two or more selected scenic places of the selected scenic byway in an efficient order through an efficient route. Unlike the conventional routing method which usually calculates a route that is quickest or shortest to the destination, the routing method under the scenic byway mode of the present invention calculates a route that is balanced between the efficiency and the enjoyment of the sceneries, monuments, etc.","As noted above, a scenic byway includes archaeological, cultural, historic, natural, recreational, etc. points of interest. In the United States of America and Canada, there are about 200 scenic byways registered by a public organization such as U.S. Department of Transportation. In general, scenic byways are designated or selected roads that provide beautiful vista. Throughout the description of the present invention, the term \u201cscenic byway\u201d is used, however, as noted above, the term should be interpreted broadly and is inclusive of the routes described above that are characterized by having a plurality of geographic points and routes that are attractive to users.","The navigation method and system of the present invention enables to display specially designed screens for the scenic byway mode. Through the specially designed user friendly screens, the user can search desired scenic byways and obtain the information on the desired scenic byways and visit the byway points through the route guidance operation of the navigation system. The navigation system provides such screens in a manner that the user can easily understand the information at a glance on the monitor screen and easily specify the desired scenic places to visit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 3A","FIG. 3A"]},"A back (return) key  on the navigation screen is used to return to the previous screen, i.e., to cancel the most recent selection. In the example of , when the main menu screen is displayed, the \u201cDest\u201d key is highlighted as an initial (default) setting for selecting a destination. Such initial settings can be changed by the user through a system set-up process by selecting the \u201cSetup\u201d menu noted above on the main menu screen.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0054","num":"0053"},"figref":["FIG. 3B","FIG. 3A","FIG. 3C","FIG. 3C"],"b":["5","5"]},"In the example of , the scenic byway list  show three entries, namely, \u201cRoute 1, Big Sur Coast HWY\u201d, \u201cFeather River City Byway\u201d, and \u201cRamona Express Way\u201d. In this example, the scenic byways are listed in the order of distance from a current position of a user or from a specified location. As noted above, each of the listed scenic byways has a plurality of byway points (scenic places) having scenic, recreational, natural, historic, cultural, and archaeological qualities. In the screen of , at the right side of each scenic byway entry, an information key  is provided which is used to obtain general and detailed information regarding the scenic byway as will be explained in detail later.","Although only three entries are listed, additional entries can be seen by scrolling the scenic byway list  by operating a scroll keys . As noted above, at present, there are about 200 scenic byways registered by the government such as U.S. Department of Transportation in Canada and the United States of America. Such scenic byways are sorted in the order of distance by activating the distance key  by the user or by a default setting. The scenic byways can also be sorted in the order of alphabet as shown in  by activating an alphabet key .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0057","num":"0056"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4M","FIG. 4A"],"b":"7"},"When the user selects one of the entries from the scenic byway list  in , the navigation system will display a scenic places (byway points) list  for the selected scenic byway as shown in . As noted above, scenic places are places of scenic, historic, recreational, natural, cultural, etc. qualities that are located on or proximate to the selected scenic byway. In this example, the scenic place list  shows three scenic places \u201cNEAREST BYWAY ENTRANCE\u201d, \u201cBLOSSOM MUSIC CENTER\u201d and \u201cCANAL FULTON\u201d associated with the selected scenic byway \u201cFEATHER RIVER CITY BYWAY\u201d.","By operating the scroll key , the user is able to scroll the scenic place list  to see more entries of scenic places in the list for the selected scenic byway \u201cFEATHER RIVER CITY BYWAY\u201d. In this example, at the left of each entry in the scenic place list , a check box  is provided so that the user is able to select a particular byway point in the list. By selecting one or more scenic places, the user is able to enjoy a route guidance operation by the navigation method and system of the present invention to the selected scenic places.","In the example of , the entry at the top of the list; \u201cNEAREST BYWAY ENTRANCE\u201d is highlighted by default, i.e., as an initial setting.
