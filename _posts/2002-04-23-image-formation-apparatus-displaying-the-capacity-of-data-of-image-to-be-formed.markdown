No. 09\/133,871, filed Aug. 13, 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 6,449,056, which claimed priority from Application Nos. 9-220518, 9-220475, 9-221438 and 9-231103 filed in Japan, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.","1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to image formation apparatuses and in particular to an image formation apparatus which processes information on image formation depending on the image data within the apparatus.","2. Description of the Related Art","Conventionally, digital copiers have been used for printing images. In a digital copier, a read image can be stored in a memory and image printing can be provided independently of and simultaneously with image reading. A digital copier with such multi-job function that allows image printing and image reading to be provided independently of each other has a function allowing a plurality of users to input images to register jobs and print the images in the order in which the jobs are registered. A digital copier also allows image data to be internally digitalized. Thus it can readily be connected to a network and thus allows a job to be registered from an external equipment via the network.","Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 5-38865 discloses an image formation apparatus which prints out an image depending on the image data externally transmitted and stored in a memory. An application to facsimile has a hold-for-reception function referred to as a hold-for reception by memory which allows data to be stored in a memory of the receiving facsimile when the facsimile runs out of sheets.","Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 5-134511 discloses a technique which allows an interruption to a job currently executed in a copier with multi-job function only when there is small time difference between the execution time of the job and that of a set job.","However, a job which the external equipment requests to be registered may not be accepted depending on the utilization of the memory in the image formation apparatus.","An image formation apparatus such as a digital copier with a conventional memory, a printer device connected to e.g. a computer, a facsimile and the like the memory of which is full or the full capacity of the memory of which is used when a network requests registration of a job and the data of an image is input or is being input, signals to the external equipment requesting printing the image that the registration of the job cannot be accepted.","If the image formation apparatus is controlled by a computer, the user can respond to such a signal to operate the computer controlling the image formation apparatus so that one of a plurality of image formation apparatuses that is allowed to print an image is selected to change the image formation apparatus requested to print the image and re-registration of a job can be set when a certain period of time elapses. However, the user does not know which one of the plurality of image formation apparatuses is accepting job registration and when it can accept job registration. The user can select an image formation apparatus allowed to print images through repeated trial and error, which is a extremely troublesome procedure and the user cannot print images efficiently.","Furthermore, such a conventional image formation apparatus that is selected for a request to print an image while accepting jobs may require a significantly long time to complete all of the jobs that have been registered in the image formation apparatus. If a job is registered in the image formation apparatus, the user may have to wait for the significantly long time. Printing images with such an image formation apparatus is very inefficient if another image formation apparatus which is allowed to execute the job earlier is also connected.","Generally it is often the case for copiers with multi job function that the original transport unit automatically setting original sheets one by one at the reading station to read an image on an original sheet is installed in the image reader. However, when the image reader is being used, a new job cannot be registered.","Furthermore, if the memory in such copier with multi-job function is full, the copier cannot accept requested job registrations.","In order to cause the copier to print an image as soon as possible when the job for the image cannot be registered, the user has to wait until the use of the image reader completes or a free memory space is available for the original newly read. Thus, image-printing by the user depends on the state of the apparatus, which can be inconvenient for the user.","Therefore one object of the present invention is to provide an image formation apparatus allowing users to form images efficiently.","Another object of the present invention is to allow users to efficiently form images in an image formation apparatus connected to an external equipment.","Still another object of the present invention is to provide an image formation apparatus that allows users to form images more conveniently.","Still another object of the present invention is to allow users to efficiently form images in an image formation system in which a plurality of image formation apparatuses are connected.","The above objects of the present invention are achieved by an image formation apparatus which includes the following elements. That is, an image formation apparatus according to the present invention includes a display device, an image forming station which receives data for forming an image and forms the image depending on the received data, and a processor which calculates the capacity of data for forming an image and displays the calculated capacity of the data on the display device.","The capacity of read image data that is counted and displayed allows the user to know how much free capacity in the image formation apparatus is required to allow the image to be formed. Knowing the respective free capacities of image formation apparatuses allows the image to be formed by the image formation apparatus that can form the image earliest and the image can thus be formed efficiently.","In another aspect of the present invention, an image formation apparatus connected to an external equipment includes an image forming station which receives data for forming an image and forms the image depending on the received data, an interface for transmitting and receiving data to and from the external device, and a processor calculating the capacity of image data for forming an image, wherein the data indicative of the capacity of the image data calculated by the processor is transmitted to the external device via the interface.","The capacity of read image data that is counted and transmitted to the connected external device allows the user to know how much free capacity in the image formation apparatus is required to allow the image to be formed. Knowing the respective free capacities of image formation apparatuses allows the image to be formed by the image formation apparatus that can form the image earliest and the image is thus formed efficiently.","In still another aspect of the present invention, an image formation apparatus includes a display, a memory for storage of data for forming an image, an image forming station which forms an image depending on the data stored in the memory, and a processor which determines whether data for forming an image can be stored in the memory and displays on the display device an indication for urging a reservation to store the data in the memory when the processor determines that the data cannot be stored in the memory.","When image data cannot be stored in the memory, the order in which the image data is stored in the memory is reserved to secure the memory space for storage of the image data. It is thus unnecessary for the user to conventionally wait for completion of processes of the image formation apparatus until the storage in the memory is allowed, to allow the image formation apparatus to form the image as soon as possible, and the reservation of the order in which the image data is stored in the memory allows the user to form the image more conveniently.","In still another aspect of the present invention, a management system for management of first and second image formation apparatuses, the management system being connected to the first and second image formation apparatuses each forming an image depending on the image-forming data stored in a memory provided therein, includes an interface for data communication between the first and second image formation apparatuses, and a processor which determines which of the first and second image formation apparatuses can form images depending on the data received from said first and second image formation apparatuses via the interface and indicative of the respective states of the memories of the first and second image formation apparatuses.","The processor of the management system receives from each of a plurality of image formation apparatuses the information on the memory depending on which the processor controls image formation in the plurality of image formation apparatuses.","The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.","A digital copier  as one embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings.","(1) First Embodiment","Referring to , digital copier  is generally configured of an original transport unit , an image reader IR, a page printer PRT, a sheet refeeding unit , and an operation panel OP provided on an upper surface of digital copier  (in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the figure). They are controlled by a control unit  () that controls the entirety or various portions of the copier.","A copy operation thereof will now be schematically described. When a content of operation is input to digital copier  via operation panel OP, original transport unit  sets originals to be copied one by one at the reading position of image reader IR. Image reader IR reads the image of an original set at the reading position and generates image data, and page printer PRT receives the image data from image reader IR and prints an image on a sheet. The printed sheet is discharged via sheet refeeding unit .","Each portion will now be described more specifically. Original transport unit  also serves as an original cover and is mounted to an upper portion of digital copier  with one end of the cover serving as a supporting point such that the cover can be opened and closed. On a sheet feeding tray  a plurality of originals are stacked such that the image bearing sides to be copied face upwards. A sheet feeding roller  feeds the stacked originals one by one from the bottom original, and a separation roller  and a separation pad  separate them. Then an intermediate roller  and a register roller  reverse an original along a transport path and a transport belt  accurately sets the original at the reading position on a platen glass  of image reader IR.","Furthermore a register sensor SE and a width-size sensor SE detect the original and register roller  corrects obliqueness of the original, and original transport belt  is slightly reversed and then stops immediately after the rear edge of the original passes across the left end of an original scale . These operations allows the right edge of the original to contact an end of original scale  and the original is thus set at the accurate position on platen glass . Meanwhile the front edge of the next original has reached register roller  and original transport time is thus reduced.","For an original with an image provided only on one side thereof, image reader IR reads the image and the original then passes over a switching flap  and is discharged via a sheet discharging roller  onto an original discharging tray  such that the image-bearing side faces upwards. For an original with images provided on the both sides, image reader IR similarly reads the front side of the original and a reversing roller  changes the transport direction of the original and switching flap  allows the original to be returned to the reading position on platen glass . Thus the original has its backside read and is then discharged onto original discharging tray . Meanwhile a discharge sensor SE detects the presence\/absence of an original being discharged.","Image reader IR reads the image of an original set on platen glass  and generates the image data corresponding to each pixel of the image of the original. Image reader IR is configured of a scan system  which resolves an original into pixels and reads the pixels, an image processing unit  which quantizes a photoelectric conversion signal output from scan system  and effects signal processings according to various image formation modes, and memory unit  for storage of the image data transmitted from image processing unit .","Scan system  has a line-scanning, image reading mechanism. A first scanner  having an exposure lamp  and a first mirror , and a second scanner  having second and third mirrors and are driven by a scan motor M and thus move in the direction of an arrow b or a sub scanning direction.","An original set at the reading position of platen glass  is exposed by exposure lamp . The reflected light caused by the exposure passes through mirrors , and and a condenser lens  and illuminates a line sensor  which employs a CCD array. Line sensor  is provided by arranging a number of photoelectric conversion elements in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the figure or a main scanning direction and it reads an image at e.g. 400 dpi and generates the image data corresponding to each pixel. A sensor SE detects the positions of the scanners. An electrical signal obtained here is transmitted to image processing unit . Original scale  set adjacent to platen glass  indicates a reference to which the user sets an original manually.","In image processing unit , the image data converted by scan system  into an electrical signal is binarized and experiences image processes, such as image quality correction, magnification, image editing, and is then transmitted to memory unit , which compresses the image data received from image processing unit . The compressed data is temporarily stored in memory unit . Then the image data is decompressed and experiences a rotation editing process and the like as required and is then transmitted to page printer PRT.","Memory unit  also has an external equipment interface, as will be described hereinafter, and is connected to an external equipment by an external cable  via a connector  for connection to the external equipment.","Image processing unit  and memory unit  will be described hereinafter.","Page printer PRT prints an image to be copied through an electrophotography process depending on the image data transferred from image reader IR. Page printer PRT is configured of a print processing unit  which outputs an exposure control signal, an optical system  which radiates a laser beam in response to the exposure control signal from print processing unit , an image forming system  which provides a process of forming an image on a sheet for the laser beam radiated at optical system , and a sheet transport system  which transports a sheet to or from image forming system .","Depending on the printing data from memory unit  of image reader IR, print processing unit  controls modulation (ON\/OFF) of the laser beam radiated by optical system . The laser light emitted at optical system  is provided by a semiconductor laser  controlled by print processing unit . The laser beam is deflected in the main scanning direction by a polygon mirror  rotated by a motor and is guided to the exposure position within image forming system  via an of lens  and mirrors and arranged at their respective positions.","In image forming system , a photoreceptor drum  uniformly charged by a corona charger  is initially irradiated with the laser beam from semiconductor laser . The laser beam radiation allows a latent image to be formed on photoreceptor drum . Then a developer  places toner on the latent image to render the latent image a toner image which is then transferred at the transfer position by a transfer charger  from photoreceptor drum  to a sheet transported by sheet transport system . Then a separation charger  separates the sheet from photoreceptor drum . Then a cleaner  removes the unnecessary toner on photoreceptor drum  and an eraser lamp  removes the electrical charge on photoreceptor drum  so that photoreceptor drum  is prepared for the next sheet.","Sheet transport system  causes the sheets from sheet feeding cassettes and to be fed via sheet feeding rollers and , respectively. The sheets pass through a sheet transport path  and are sent to the transfer position in synchronization with photoreceptor drum  of image forming system . A sheet with a toner image transferred thereon is transported by a transport belt to fixer  which applies heat and pressure to fix the toner on the sheet. The various portions of sheet transport system , photoreceptor drum  and the like are driven by a main motor M.","Sheet refeeding unit  is provided on a side of page printer PRT as an additional device for automating a two-sided copy operation. Sheet refeeding unit  temporarily receives a sheet discharged from the main body of page printer PRT via a discharging roller  of sheet transport system  and then sends the sheet back to the body of page printer PRT through switched-back transportation.","For making a copy on one side of a sheet, the sheet simply passes through sheet refeeding unit  and is discharged onto a sheet discharge tray . In making a copy on the both sides of a sheet, a solenoid (not shown) moves the left end of switching flap  upwards so that the sheet discharged from discharging roller  reaches a reversible roller  via transport roller . When a sheet sensor SE detects the rear end of the sheet, reversible roller  is reversed and the sheet is thus returned to the body of page printer PRT. The returned sheet is sent to a timing roller  via horizontally transporting rollers , and to be again synchronized with photoreceptor drum  of image forming system  so that an image is formed on the back side of the sheet, which is then discharged onto sheet discharging tray .","If a plurality of sheets are fed successively, they are spaced by a predetermined interval so that they do not overlap and thus sent successively to sheet refeeding unit . Since the sheet transport path has a fixed length, the number N of sheets of one cycle provided by sheet refeeding unit  and horizontally transporting rollers , and or the maximum number of sheets cycled N depends on sheet size.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00100","num":"00100"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":"1"},"Operation panel OP includes a liquid crystal touch panel  for displaying the state within the device and setting various modes, numeric keys  for inputting a numerical condition for a copy, such as the number of sheets copied, magnification and the like, a clear key  for setting a numerical condition back to the default value, a panel reset key  for initializing a copy mode, a stop key  for providing an indication to stop a copy operation, a start key  for providing an indication to start a copy operation, an original designation key  for designating either one-sided original or two-sided original, a copy mode key  for switching between one-sided copy and two-sided copy, an original-reading start key  only for starting reading an original, an original-reading stop key  only for stopping reading an original, a registration key  for registering a read original in the memory, and a key  for providing an indication displaying the amount of remaining memory.",{"@attributes":{"id":"P-00102","num":"00102"},"figref":"FIGS. 3 and 4","b":["200","1"]},"Control unit  is configured mainly of seven CPUs  to  respectively connected to ROMs  to  for storage of program and RAMs  to  as a working area.

In response to the image control signal from timing control unit , line sensor  photoelectrically converts the information of an original to generate an electrical signal which is then amplified by an AMP  and converted by an AD converter  into an 8-bit digital signal. A shading correction unit  then removes any distortion caused at scan system  from the digital signal, and a density conversion unit  applies density conversion, \u03b3 correction and the like to the digital signal. Then the digital signal thus processed electrically experiences a variable scale magnification process depending on the information on the scale magnification set at an electrical variable scale magnification unit , and experiences an image editing process at an edition process unit  to obtain image data provided to memory unit .","An indication from CPU  causes one line of image data to be stored in an image monitor memory .
