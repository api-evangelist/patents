title: Method for displaying and formatting messages in web applications using JavaServer Faces
abstract: Methods, machine-accessible media, and systems for displaying and formatting messages in web applications using JavaServer Faces (JSF). A JSF FacesMessage is intercepted before the FacesMessage is sent to a JSP page for display. The FacesMessage may be intercepted by a phase listener monitoring the JSF phases to obtain information from the message. The method may also be extended to handle application-specific messages. A managed bean receives the message information and creates a JSP page segment that provides formatting to the information. The newly created JSP page segment is then displayed in the JSP page instead of the FacesMessage. Preferably, the formatting within the JSP page segment includes additional content selected from a message icon, a message identification code, an additional message segment, and combinations thereof. Furthermore, the JSP page segment may optionally provide advanced features, such as clickable image links for additional information or help.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates to displaying and formatting messages in a web application developed using JavaServer Faces (JSF).","2. Description of the Related Art","In the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), Web components like Java servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP) provide dynamic extension capabilities for a Web server. Servlets are Java programming language classes that dynamically process requests and construct responses. JSP pages are text-based documents that execute as servlets, but allow a more natural approach to creating static content. Although servlets and JSP pages can be used interchangeably, each has its own strengths. Servlets are best suited for service-oriented applications and the control functions of a presentation-oriented application, such as dispatching requests and handling non-textual data. JSP pages are more appropriate for generating text-based markup such as HTML, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Wireless Markup Language (WML), and XML.","Web components are supported by the services of a runtime platform called a web container. A container provides an interface between the component and low-level platform-specific functionality that supports the component. Before a web component, enterprise bean, or application client component can be executed, it must be assembled into a module and deployed into its container. A Web container manages the execution of JSP page and servlet components for J2EE applications. More specifically, a web container provides services, such as request dispatching, security, concurrency and life-cycle management, and provides web components with access to application programming interfaces (APIs), such as naming, transactions, and email. Both the web components and their container run on the web server. When the web server runs the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), it may be referred to as a J2EE server.","Since the introduction of Java Servlet and JSP technology, additional Java technologies and frameworks for building interactive web applications have been developed. JavaServer Faces (JSF), for example, is becoming the new standard for building server-side user interfaces for Web applications. JavaServer Faces technology includes a set of APIs for representing user interface (UI) components and managing their state, handling events and input validation, defining page navigation, and supporting internationalization and accessibility. A JavaServer Pages (JSP) custom tag library is also included for expressing a JavaServer Faces interface within a JSP page.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["10","12","14","16","18","10","20","22","24","26","28","30","32","10","18","12"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["40","42","44","46","44","46"]},"However, JSF tags provide very little flexibility for formatting the message for display. For example,  is an illustration of a graphical display  produced by a JSP page having received prior art FacesMessages ,  generated in accordance with . The FacesMessages ,  are displayed as text in messages , , respectively.","However, it is very difficult to satisfy the dynamic formatting requirements of advanced web applications using existing JSF methods. Therefore, there is a need for a method to display messages in an easy, formattable manner. It would be desirable to have a method that combines the simplicity of using FacesMessage with advanced display and formatting features.","The present invention provides a method of displaying and formatting messages in a web application developed using JSF and a machine-accessible medium containing instructions, which when executed by a machine cause the machine to perform operations in accordance with the method. The method comprises the steps of intercepting a JSF FacesMessage before the FacesMessage is sent to a JSP page for display, interpreting the message information in the FacesMessage, creating a JSF managed bean for storing the interpreted message information, creating a JSP page segment that provides formatting to the interpreted message information, and displaying the JSP page segment in the JSP page instead of the FacesMessage. Preferably, the formatting within the JSP page segment includes additional content selected from a message icon, a message identification code, and an additional message segment. Furthermore, the formatting within the JSP page segment may optionally include a clickable image link, such that the method may further comprise displaying an additional message segment related to the information upon activation of the clickable image link.","In a preferred embodiment, the step of intercepting a JSF FacesMessage includes monitoring JSF phases. In one embodiment, the method further comprises sending the JSF FacesMessage to the JSP page for display using the <h:message> or <h:messages> command in a separate segment from the JSP page segment that was created. Optionally, the JSF FacesMessage is used to point to a component related to the information in the JSP page segment.","The invention also provides a system for displaying messages. The system comprises a phase listener for intercepting a JSF FacesMessage before the FacesMessage is sent to a JSP page for display, a Managed Bean for creating a JSP page segment that formats information from the FacesMessage, and a JSP page configured to display the JSP page segment instead of the FacesMessage. Optionally, the Managed Bean may format the JSP page segment to include additional content selected from a message icon, a message identification code, and an additional message segment. Furthermore, the Managed Bean may format the JSP page segment to include a clickable image link, wherein an additional message segment related to the information is displayed upon activation of the clickable image link. Preferably, the PhaseListener monitors JSF phases.","In one embodiment of the system, the JSP page also displays the JSF FacesMessage in a separate segment outside the JSP page that was created. In another embodiment, the JSP page displays a pointer directed at a component related to the information in the JSP page segment, wherein the pointer is outside the JSP page segment that was created. The system will typically include a web application server running a Java servlet that displays content through JSP.","In yet another embodiment, the invention may process an application specific message to be displayed through one of the foregoing embodiments, such as a method including the steps of intercepting a JSF FacesMessage before the FacesMessage is sent to a JSP page for display, creating a JSP page segment that provides formatting to information from the Managed Bean, and displaying the JSP page segment in the JSP page instead of the FacesMessage. The JSP segment used for displaying the message information can also be further constructed into a custom tag library using the current implementation.","The present invention provides improved methods, machine-accessible media, and systems for displaying and formatting messages in web applications using JavaServer Faces (JSF). A JSF FacesMessage is intercepted before the FacesMessage is sent to a JSP page for display. The FacesMessage may be intercepted by a phase listener that monitors the JSF phases in order to obtain information from the message. A Managed Bean receives the message information and creates a JSP page segment that provides formatting to the information. The newly created JSP page segment is then displayed in the JSP page instead of the FacesMessage. Preferably, the formatting within the JSP page segment includes additional content selected from a message icon, a message identification code, and an additional message segment. Furthermore, the formatting within the JSP page segment may optionally include a clickable image link, such that the method may further comprise displaying an additional message segment related to the information upon activation of the clickable image link. Certainly, the formatting may include the use of borders, background colors, fonts, images, style classes and other well known formatting capabilities.","Optionally, the JSF FacesMessage may still be used in some instances or for other purposes. For example, the FacesMessage may be used for display in the same or different JSP page using the <h:message> or <h:messages> command in a segment other than the newly created JSP page segment. Optionally, the FacesMessage is used to point to a component related to the information in the JSP page segment.","In one embodiment, a message display flag is enabled when the phase listener detects a FacesMessage or by directly accessing an enableMsgs method in the message bean. The flag is detected by the message bean such that the flag controls the rendering of the message as a JSP page segment. Accordingly, the JSP page segment containing the message will only be displayed when this flag is enabled.","The method is preferably carried out in a web application server for providing a web client with access to a web application. The web application includes a Java servlet that is supported by Java (such as the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)), JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), and a JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), which are all deployed in a web container installed on the web application server. The Web application server preferably operates a conventional server software program, such as International Business Machines' WebSphere\u00ae, for administering the web application program. The web server may include or communication with a database. The methods and systems described can provide an advanced web application with dynamic content including enhanced message displays.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0029","num":"0028"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["60","62","64","44","66","68"]},"The detailed examples described herein show only the case for displaying a single message (i.e., the first FacesMessage object detected by a PhaseListener for each request). However, the present invention encompasses the interpreting and displaying of multiple messages in a JSP page if multiple FacesMessages are generated for each request.","The JSF phases  include Restore View , Apply Request Values , Process Validations , Update Model Value , Invoke Application , and Render Response . The PhaseListener  monitors the application level phases , , , , receives a copy of the information in the FacesMessage object , and provides this information to the MessageBean , which is a JSF managed bean. The MessageBean  may then include the information along with formatting instructions and other optional information into a JSP page segment (Message.jsp)  that is included in a JSP page . As shown by line , the FacesMessage  may also be used in a more conventional manner at another point in a JSP page.","Faces messages can be generated in any of the JSF phases , but validation and conversion messages are usually generated in the Process Validation phases. Application specific messages are added in the Invoke Application phases  and are generated in the form of FacesMessage objects . The PhaseListener  monitors all events and FacesMessages generated, and determines whether the message is a system message generated by system validation or whether the message is an application specific message generated by an application implementation. The PhaseListener then sets the proper information to the MessageBean . The MessageBean  parses the information in the FacesMessage and fetches information (such as message ID, message, message icon link, additional message, etc.) needed in formatting the display. For example, the MessageBean  may extract a message specific to the client language from a message catalog  and store the message for formatting and display. A JSP page segment  is constructed to display the information obtained from the MessageBean  in a more controllable format based on customer requirements. New display styles can be added to this JSP page segment. This JSP page segment  can be embedded to any JSF JSP page  to display any possible messages generated from the system and\/or the application.","An exemplary PhaseListener  may be implemented as
