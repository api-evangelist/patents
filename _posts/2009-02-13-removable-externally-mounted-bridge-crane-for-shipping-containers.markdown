{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.","This invention relates to a crane mounted on a shipping and stowage container. More particularly, this invention is for a self-erecting crane secured to the end of a shipping and stowage container using powered hoists for lifting\/lowering loads and manual force for extending\/retracting the lifted loads in the X-direction and transversally moving the loads in the Y-direction.","Containers are widely used in air, sea and land transport of goods since they keep many items together as a lot and protect them from damage during the haul. Large transport vehicles can carry rows and columns of the containers that can rest singly or in stacks on decks and\/or pallets.","The great majority of shipping and stowage containers in commercial air and maritime commerce have evolved into a standard design. The standard established by ISO 1161 requirements by the International Organization for Standardization defines containers of standardized dimensions and ruggedness to promote efficiency and safety for air and maritime use. The ISO 1161 containers are robustly constructed with rigid side walls mounted on strong frameworks that have a heavy-duty block-shaped corner fitting at each of the containers' eight corners. The corner fittings and other parts of an ISO 1161 container can be made of steel, aluminum or other tough material.","The block-shaped corner fittings have outward facing elongated openings sized to receive appropriately dimensioned heavy-duty rotatable bayonet portions of standard double-cone twist-lock fittings. When a cone-shaped bayonet portion of a double-cone twist lock fitting is inserted through an opening and into an ISO 1161 corner fitting, the inserted portion is manually rotated a partial turn via an attached small twist-lock lever. This rotation of the inserted bayonet portion securely engages the twist-lock fitting to the block-shaped corner fitting, and when the other cone-shaped bayonet portion of the double-cone twist lock fitting is inserted through an opening and into a piece that needs to be interconnected, the other inserted portion is manually rotated a partial turn via an attached small twist-lock lever to secure the piece to the container. A considerable number of ISO 1161 block-shaped corner fittings are well known and commercially available, and interfacing standard double-cone twist-lock fittings are well known and commercially available by a number of well known suppliers, such as the Model AE10000A-1GA Double Cone Two Position Twistloc with \u201cPreloc\u201d feature marketed by TANDEMLOC Inc., 824 Highway 101, Havelock, N.C. 28532, and the F476, F633, F656 series of twist locks by Peck and Hale Cargo Securing Systems, 189 Division Avenue, West Sayville, N.Y. 11796.","Frequently the need arises for strong lifting mechanisms at containers to help in the performance of work tasks adjacent the containers or to help load\/unload goods through one of their several closable openings. Currently, fixed mechanisms that are specifically designed for lifting\/relocating items at the containers are not known. Typically, external non-fixed lifting equipment must be brought to the work site at the ends of the containers and utilized to lift\/move things. When such non-fixed lifting equipments are available on ships at sea, ship motions may make the use of such forklifts or portable hoists impractical and\/or unsafe. In addition, some stowage compartments and holds on ships may have insufficient overhead clearance or capacity to mount an adequate lifting device at the container's ends. Cranes potentially can be mounted internally in the containers, but these might take up too much valuable storage space inside. Additionally, such a crane can have a fixed size and may not be removable or further erectable.","Thus, in accordance with this inventive concept, a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a crane externally mounted on a shipping and stowage container for lifting\/lowering loads, and extending\/retracting lifted loads in the X-direction and transversally moving lifted loads in the Y-direction.","The present invention provides a readily assembled and installed X-Y bridge crane for lifting and moving loads at the end of a shipping and stowage container having block-shaped corner fittings at top corners and bottom corners at its end. Rotatable top securing brackets engage the top block-shaped corner fittings, and rotatable bottom securing brackets engage the bottom block-shaped corner fittings. A pair of elongate brace members has inner and outer end portions, and the inner end portions are rotatably connected to the rotatable bottom securing brackets. A rectangular framework has inner extensions, outer projecting parts, and a laterally extending hoist-traveling beam. The inner extensions are connected to the top securing brackets and the outer projecting parts of the framework are connected to the outer end portions of the elongate brace members. A hoist is mounted on the hoist-traveling beam for lifting and moving loads on the framework and first and second displacement mechanisms are connected to the hoist to linearly displace it in orthogonal X and Y directions. The framework includes a pair of longitudinal members extending in the X-direction connected to a pair of lateral members extending in the Y-direction. A pair of cable braces are each connected at opposite ends to upward projecting parts at the ends of each of the longitudinal members at the four corners of the framework. The cable braces diagonally extend above and across the framework in a mutually crossing relationship to further strengthen it to bear and transfer loads reliably. Multi-wheeled roller assemblies mounted on opposite ends of the hoist traveling beam support and allow the hoist traveling beam to ride on the upper surfaces of the longitudinal members between the lateral members of the framework. Installation cables extending from a winch at the container are connected to one of the lateral members. Reeling-in the installation cables by the winch raises the brace members, framework, hoist-traveling beam, and hoist above the ground and draws them toward the end of the container during installation of the bridge crane on the container.","An object of the invention is to provide a crane secured to a shipping and stowage container's end to lift and move loads.","Another object of the invention is to provide a crane secured to a shipping and stowage container using standardized fittings and brackets to enable lifting and displacing loads.","Another object of the invention is to provide a crane that can be secured to the end of a shipping and stowage container without requiring ancillary heavy-lifting equipment.","Another object of the invention is to provide a bridge crane that can be quickly and securely coupled to a shipping and stowage container to raise and displace loads in X and Y directions over an area at the end of the container.","Another object of the invention is to provide a bridge crane readily connectable to the ends of single or stacked shipping containers for lifting and moving loads above peripheral areas.","Another object of the invention is to provide a bridge crane that can be quickly and securely coupled to a shipping container to lift and move loads by powered and\/or manual force.","Another object of the invention is to provide a bridge crane that can be quickly secured to a shipping container with standard interfacing hardware to suspend and move loads in the area adjacent the container.","Another object of the invention is to provide a bridge crane that can be quickly secured to a shipping container for lifting\/lowering loads, extending\/retracting lifted loads in the X-direction and transversely moving lifted loads in the Y-direction near the container.","These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.","Referring to , X-Y bridge crane  of the invention is mounted at one end of a commercial shipping and stowage container A such as an ISO 1161 shipping and stowage container, for example. Bridge crane  can be quickly assembled and securely attached to the end of container A by relatively unskilled workmen to provide a means to lift and move goods through doorways or openings at either end of the container. Bridge crane  can also be used to support goods and\/or other work-pieces at the right height and lateral\/longitudinal position adjacent the container's end. Only one closed door B is shown in , and it can be swung open and rotated 270\u00b0 to an open position behind the container prior to the erection and attachment of bridge crane  to allow free, unimpeded transfer of goods. It is within the scope of this invention to allow appropriate modification of structural members to be described to allow opening\/closing of door B while bridge crane  is in place.","The ISO 1161 shipping and stowage container A has a well known heavy-duty block-shaped corner fitting C at each of the containers' eight corners, only four of such corner fittings C being shown at one end. Each corner fitting C has upward, sideward and downward facing openings. In accordance with the invention, a separate rotatable top cam-lock or twist-lock securing bracket  is inserted into the top facing opening in each of upper ones of corner fittings C and is appropriately twisted\/rotated to engage each of the two upper corner fittings C. Each top securing bracket  has a heavy duty upward extension having a heavy-duty pad eye . A separate rotatable bottom cam-lock or twist-lock securing bracket  is inserted into the end facing opening in each of lower ones of corner fittings C and is appropriately rotated to engage each of the two lower corner fittings C. Each bottom securing bracket  has a heavy duty extension having a pad eye . Top and bottom securing brackets  and  provide quickly attached, heavy duty mounting\/anchoring points on the selected end of container A for X-Y bridge crane . Typically, the interfacing top cam-lock or twist lock securing brackets  could be proven, commercially available cam-lock container lifting lugs, model MK2A's and\/or multi-function semi-automatic twist-locks model F738's, and bottom securing brackets  could be well known cam-lock container lifting lugs model MK5A's and\/or multi-function semi-automatic twist-locks model F738's, all of which are manufactured by Peck and Hale Cargo Securing Systems. One skilled in the art could select\/modify these or other commercially available units for securing brackets  and  to appropriately mount bridge crane  on container A.","X-Y bridge crane  has a pair of elongate brace members  and  each connected at inner end portions  and  to a separate one of bottom securing brackets . Brace members  and  are made from aluminum or steel stock or other inherently strong, tough, weight-efficient material that can support the loads of bridge crane  and the goods of container A. The tough material is also selected to survive the abuse to which bridge crane  will be subject, yet be lightweight enough to be manually transported and assembled. Brace members  and  can be tubular with a square or rectangular shape and are rotatably connected to bottom securing brackets  via aluminum or steel retaining bolts or pins  extending through a lateral hole  in inner end portions  and  that are respectively aligned with pad eyes  of bottom securing brackets .","Referring also to , elongate brace members  and  have outer end portions  and  each provided with a lateral bore . Brace members  and  are rotatably connected to a rectangular or square overhead framework  to provide partial vertical support for hoisted loads, as explained below. Framework  includes lateral members  and  and longitudinal members  and  that can also be made from square or rectangular-shaped strong tubular aluminum or steel stock to support the loads of bridge crane  and the goods of the container. Lateral members  and  and longitudinal members  and  are welded or bolted together or coupled by other means of interconnection at their opposite ends to assure strength for framework  to support and transfer loads in the X and Y directions near the end of the container.","An upwardly projecting cable support  is mounted at each of the four corners of framework . In the preferred embodiment shown in the figures, cable supports  are cone-shaped or triangular-shaped steel structures; however, the selection of the shape and material for these parts shall not be considered a limitation of the invention. The outer ends of the four cable supports  are secured to cable braces  and  that diagonally extend above and across framework  in a mutually crossing relationship. Cable braces  and  optionally can be tensioned to further assure sufficient strength to bear and transfer loads reliably.","Longitudinal members  and  of framework  have inner longitudinal extensions  and  having lateral openings  and  to receive a bolt or pin . Pins  are inserted through lateral openings  and  and aligned pad eyes  of a separate one of top securing brackets . The inserted pins  rotatably engage and complete the securing of framework  to container A.","Longitudinal members  and  of framework  also each have an outer downward projecting part  or . A lateral bore  in each of outer downward projecting parts  and  is placed in an aligned position with respect to a separate lateral bore  in each of outer end portions  and  of brace members  and . Bolts or pins  are inserted through the aligned bores  and  to pivotally secure elongate brace members  and  at hinge points  to framework  of bridge crane  and provide strong supportive structure for bridge crane  and the expected loads, see also . Framework , brace members  and , and other components to be described are preferably designed and made from materials to keep weight within reasonable limits to permit manual assembly and erection of bridge crane  by workmen at a work site without powered lifts and other crane structures.","Bridge crane  has a hoist-traveling beam  reaching across framework . Hoist traveling beam  has multi-wheel roller assemblies  and  mounted on its opposite ends to support and allow it to ride on the upper surfaces of longitudinal members  and  between lateral members  and  of framework . By way of example, two Series 635, Model 3575 Low Headroom Multi-wheeled Roller Trolleys, manufactured by Columbus McKinnon Corporation, 140 John James Parkway, Amherst, N.J. 14228, could be as suitable roller assemblies  and . Many other roller assemblies for supporting and moving work pieces and other loads in machine shops and assembly-lines are well known, and one skilled in the art can pick and choose suitable units from many proven designs with the exercise of ordinary skill.","Roller assemblies  and  and beam  can be displaced longitudinally inwardly or outwardly in the X-direction (as illustrated by the \u201cx\u201d arrow in ) on longitudinal members  and  between lateral members  and  by a first linear displacement mechanism such as a first chainfall  connected to one end of beam . First chainfall  also is well known in the machine shop and assembly-line arts and can have a downwardly hanging closed-loop chain . Chain  is connected to interacting gears manually displaced in either rotational direction by a workman to move beam  in either linear direction and locate it on longitudinal members  and .","A hoist  is carried on hoist-traveling beam  to engage, raise, lower and move loads of goods on a hook . Hoist  is shaped to bidirectionally laterally ride on the length of hoist traveling beam  between longitudinal members  and  in the Y-direction (illustrated by the \u201cY\u201d arrow in ). Hoist  has appropriately interconnected and operator-controllable electric motor\/pneumatic\/hydraulic\/manual means (not shown) to effect raising and lowering of loads coupled to hook  via a cable . Cable  is selectively extended and reeled-in from hoist  under the control of a workman at the work site. A second linear displacement mechanism, a second chainfall , can be mounted at the other end of beam . Second chainfall  allows a workman to selectively displace hoist  in opposite lateral displacements in the Y-direction on beam . These displacements are orthogonal to the X-directional displacements of hoist  by first chainfall .","Chainfall  produces such displacements of hoist  by any of a number of well known mechanical linkages. An exemplary second chainfall  might have an elongate threaded structure (not shown) that extends the length of beam  and threadably or otherwise engages a mating part on hoist  as is well known in the art. Selectively bidirectionally rotating either the mating part or the threaded structure by an interconnected downward hanging closed-loop chain  of second chainfall  can selectively displace hoist  in either lateral direction along beam  and position it where it is needed. This exemplary structure associated with second chainfall  is only one of a number of well known means for effecting such linear displacements from rotational displacement of chainfall  by chain . It is in the purview of one of ordinary skill to select other effective mechanical arrangements that may include small controlled motor-driven mechanisms and other appropriately interconnected and operator-controllable electric motor\/pneumatic\/hydraulic\/manual mechanisms\/assemblies to produce bidirectional displacements of hoist  and traveling beam .","Hoist  can be a well known commercially available powered unit connectable to an electrical power source and operated by a relatively untrained workman. A typical hoist unit that could be used is a Model 3505 Lodestar Electric Two-Speed 1 ton hoist coupled with a Model 3677 Suspension and Model 3575 Low Headroom Trolley, all manufactured by Columbus McKinnon Corporation, 140 John James Parkway, Amherst, N.J. 14228, to raise, support and lower loads along the length of hoist traveling beam . Other readily available models could be selected depending on the expected loads, power availabilities, and other considerations of the work site. Furthermore, instead of first and second chainfall  and , the movers of beam  and hoist  in the X-direction and of hoist  in the Y-direction could be mechanically coupled and electrically powered motors with controls.","The expedient manual assembly and erection of X-Y bridge crane  of the invention at the end of container A are some of its most obvious advantageous features. The uncomplicated structure enables quick and efficient loading or unloading of goods at container A. Assembly of X-Y bridge crane  requires no other power machinery and it can be installed in sections to reduce the overall weight and size of hardware that needs to be moved at any given time. Additionally, X-Y bridge crane  can be erected without elaborate, powered heavy-lifting equipment.","Referring once again to , assembly and mounting of bridge crane  requires that container A has conventional upper and lower heavy duty corner fittings C at its end around door B. Top securing brackets  and lower securing brackets  are inserted and secured in appropriate ones of corner fittings C by workmen to present two outward exposed top pad eyes  and two bottom pad eyes .","Referring to  and , inner portions  and  of elongate brace members  and  are placed to align their holes  with openings of pad eyes  and bolts or pins  are inserted through them to rotatably secure brace members  and  to container A. Hinge points  at the outer end portions  and  of brace members  and  rotatably connect brace members  and  to framework . The other components of bridge crane  can be laid on top of brace members  and  at this stage of assembly and erection. Door B can be swung open and rotated 270\u00b0 to an open position behind container A prior to further erection of bridge crane  so that goods can be transferred. Optionally, brace members  and  could be differently shaped to allow opening of door B after bridge crane  has been more completely assembled and mounted on the end of container A. A further option is that brace members  and , framework  and the other components can be pre-assembled in other combinations, or they could be brought as separate pieces or smaller subassemblies for ease of transport to the work site for complete, final assembly.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0038","num":"0037"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["10","80","28","80","12","10"]},"The opposite ends of installation cables  are connected to a winch  schematically depicted as mounted on a suitable hard point on container A, or another solid mounting place at or near the container also can be used to mount winch , if desired. Winch  can be a manually powered unit like those used on small boat trailers to haul-in and secure a small boat, or winch  could be a motor-powered unit. In either case, winch  is operated by a workman to rotate and reel-in cables .","As the tightened installation cables  are being reeled in, brace members  and , framework , hoist  and the remaining components of bridge crane  are raised up and drawn up in the arrow direction D above the ground and toward the end of container A, see . Further reeling in of cables  on winch  brings openings  and  into alignment with pad eyes  of top securing brackets . Insertion of bolts or pins  (see aligned, non-inserted pins  in ) through the aligned parts completes the secure mounting\/installation of X-Y bridge crane  on corner fittings C of container A as shown in .","Chainfalls  and  are actuated to move the hoist-traveling beam  and hoist  in the X-direction (longitudinally) and hoist  in the Y-direction (laterally). The choice of acme screws, gear driven wheels, or other manually operated structure to move the beam  and hoist  are for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as a limitation of the present invention. One skilled in the art could use many well known motor-driven powered subassemblies for moving beam  and hoist  as well.","X-Y bridge crane  can advantageously access the contents of container A under work conditions where no overhead or portable crane capability exists, and bridge crane  can be readily erected under these conditions in minimum time by relatively unskilled workmen. The X-Y movement capability of bridge crane  provides users the ability to move and place payloads over a large area at the end of container A. The longitudinal members  and  and cables  and  of framework  increase strength and stability for greater lifting capacity as compared to a single-armed crane. Bridge crane  also advantageously utilizes the inherent structural integrity of the shipping and mobilization container A for transverse and longitudinal rigidity and strength, and bridge crane  further augments its strength by attaching directly to ISO corner fittings C on the container.","All components of X-Y bridge crane  can be made from a wide variety of tough non-corrosive or corrosion resistant materials to survive in harsh environments. Modifications and alternate embodiments of X-Y bridge crane  may be adapted for other containers and other applications.","The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein, all contribute to the novel features of this invention. X-Y bridge crane  of the invention gives relatively unskilled workmen the capability to effectively load and unload containers in confined storage areas. Therefore, X-Y bridge crane  of the invention, as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting, but rather, is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.","It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS","p":[{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0019","num":"0018"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0020","num":"0019"},"figref":"FIG. 2"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0021","num":"0020"},"figref":"FIG. 3"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0022","num":"0021"},"figref":"FIG. 4"}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
