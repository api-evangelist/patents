Technical Field","The present invention relates to a private wireless network interworking with a public land mobile network (PLMN), and more particularly to a server and method for providing a short message service to a mobile terminal subscribed in both public land mobile network (PLMN) and a private wireless network.","2. Related Art","It is believed to be impossible or very difficult for earlier private wireless networks to interwork with a public land mobile network (PLMN). Thus, respective network subscribers are believed to only able to receive a mobile communication service in their own registered network.","To solve this problem, it is believed that a service system interworking with the public land mobile network (PLMN) and the private wireless network must be developed so that mobile communication service can be provided through not only a public land mobile network (PLMN) but also a private wireless network using one mobile terminal. Even if that interworked system were developed however, the short message service (SMS) through the public land mobile network (PLMN) and the short message service (SMS) through the private wireless network would most likely be performed in a separate manner. Thus, even if the mobile communication terminal is not in a state that it can receive the short message service (SMS) message through the private wireless network, but is in a state that it can receive the short message service (SMS) message through the public land mobile network (PLMN) which the corresponding mobile communication terminal is subscribed, the mobile communication terminal would not be able to receive the corresponding short message service (SMS) message.","Exemplars of recent efforts pertaining to short message service (SMS) messages are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat.

The send daemon  which received the short message service (SMS) request from the web server  confirms whether the short message service (SMS) is possible, and transmits the short message service (SMS) to the short message service control (SMSC) module  if the short message service (SMS) is possible. At this time, the send daemon  confirms whether the short message service (SMS) is possible by checking the suitability of the short message service (SMS) message according to the corresponding short message service (SMS) request and referring to a terminal registration database (DB) of a database (DB) server  for the status of the mobile communication terminal  designated as a destination.","The suitability of the short message service (SMS) message is performed by checking whether the length of the message is within a certain range, and the status reference of the mobile communication terminal  designated as the destination is accomplished by checking whether the mobile communication terminal  is in a possible short message service (SMS) state. Here, the database (DB) server  provides a log database (DB) that manages a short message service (SMS) history of the short message service (SMS) server , and a terminal registration information database (DB) on the mobile communication terminals subscribing to the private wireless network.

The short message service control (SMSC) module  that received the short message service (SMS) message from the send daemon  holds the short message service (SMS) message in the short message service control (SMSC) message queue , and then transmits the short message service (SMS) message to the private mobile switching center (pMSC) . The short message service (SMS) message transmitted to the private mobile switching center (pMSC)  is received in the mobile communication terminal  through the private base station controller (pBSC)  and the private base transceiver station (pBTS) , and the private mobile switching center (pMSC)  transmits to the short message service control (SMSC) module  a response representing success or failure of the short message service (SMS) message transmission.

If the response that indicates the transmission failure is received from the private mobile switching center (pMSC) , the short message service control (SMSC) module  stores an error code that indicates the cause of the transmission failure and a request identification (ID) for the corresponding message in the short message service control (SMSC) message queue , and attempts retransmission of the short message service (SMS) message the transmission of which failed for a predetermined number of times until transmission succeeds. If the transmission failure still occurs even though the retransmission is made for the predetermined number of times, the short message service control (SMSC) module  stops the retransmission of the short message service (SMS) message to terminate the short message service (SMS) message transmission.

Thus, the short message service (SMS) through the public land mobile network (PLMN) is performed by the short message service (SMS) server  of the public land mobile network (PLMN) system . Accordingly, even if the mobile communication terminal  is outside the private wireless network or within a wave shade area in the private wireless network and thus the failure of the short message service (SMS) message transmission through the private wireless network occurs, the short message service (SMS) message transmission may succeed by re_transmitting the short message service (SMS) message through the public land mobile network (PLMN).","Meanwhile, it may frequently occur that the mobile communication terminal  temporarily gets out of the range of the private wireless network, or is in a state in which the short message service (SMS) message reception is possible just after it is located within the wave shade area in the private wireless network. Also, the short message service (SMS) through the private wireless network can be free of additional charges, but the short message service (SMS) through the public land mobile network (PLMN) can be subject to an additional charge by a public land mobile network (PLMN) provider.","Considering this, it is preferable to attempt the retransmission of the short message service (SMS) message to the private mobile switching center (pMSC)  for the predetermined number of times before requesting the short message service (SMS) to the short message service (SMS) server  of the public land mobile network (PLMN) system  if the failure of the short message service (SMS) message transmission through the private wireless network occurs.

At step , the short message service control (SMSC) module  transmits the short message service (SMS) message to the private mobile switching center (pMSC) . At step , the short message service control (SMSC) module  determines or detects or senses whether the transmission was successful. Then the short message service control (SMSC) module  performs step  or  according to the success\/failure of the short message service (SMS) message transmission, as detected at step .","At this time, the short message service (SMS) message transmitted to the private mobile switching center (pMSC)  is received in the mobile communication terminal  through the private base station controller (pBSC)  and the private base transceiver station (pBTS)  as described above, and the private mobile switching center (pMSC)  transmits to the short message service control (SMSC) module  a response that indicates the transmission success or transmission failure of the short message service (SMS) message.","At step , when the short message service (SMS) message transmission succeeds, the short message service control (SMSC) module  terminates its operation.

Accordingly, at step , if the response that indicates the transmission failure is received from the private mobile switching center (pMSC) , the short message service control (SMSC) module  stores the error code of the corresponding short message service (SMS) message and the request identification (ID) in the short message service control (SMSC) message queue , and confirms the number of retransmissions.","At step , if the number of retransmissions does not reach the predetermined number of times K, the short message service control (SMSC) module  increases the number of retransmission by 1.
