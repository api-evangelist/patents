title: Systems and methods for limiting input power and RMS input current drawn from a DC power source
abstract: Systems and methods to source a resistive load, such as a heating resistor, to control temperature while adhering to a specified power draw budget and/or a specified root mean square (RMS) current limit. For example, a sensor block assembly (SBA) heater controls temperature of a MEMS device in a sensor block assembly while adhering to the power draw budget and/or an average current limit. An exemplary embodiment generates a pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal, controls a switch in accordance with the control signal, sources the resistive load from a power source in accordance with the controlled switch, and modifies the duty factor of the switch to reduce the power drawn by the resistive load in response to the power drawn by the resistive load exceeding a power limit defined by a slope-intercept curve. The limiting of power into a resistor load limits the RMS current drawn by that load.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"GOVINT":[{},{}],"heading":["GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["The present invention was made with support from the United States Government under contract number C-3009, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company. The United States Government may have certain rights in the invention.","A Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device is typically enclosed in a sensor block assembly (SBA) to facilitate mounting of the MEMS device in its application device. For example, a MEMS gyroscope or accelerometer may be used to determine angular rotation or acceleration, respectively, of the installation vehicle in which it is installed.","The MEMS device may be subject to severe temperature excursions when the application device is operating in the field. For example, if the application device is a satellite or space craft, the satellite or space craft will be subjected to extreme temperature variations.","To prevent the MEMS device from exposure to cold temperatures, a heater may be physically coupled to, or implemented within, the sensor block assembly. As temperature of the application device decreases, the heater will operate to maintain temperature of the MEMS device within a predefined temperature threshold. The temperature control system of the heater relies on an external power source, such as a battery.","Various design considerations may, at times, impose limits on the amount of power and\/or current that may be drawn by the heater. For example, if the power source is a battery, the total deliverable power deliverable from the battery may be limited based upon some criteria, such as a designed operating period between battery charging. Accordingly, a power budget may be allocated to an individual heater so that at any given time, the power draw from that heater is limited to a specified power budget.","Further, design considerations may limit the amount of root mean square (RMS) current drawn by the heater. Since a heater is typically a resistive device, the generated heat will decrease as the power supply voltage decreases. To compensate, a pulse width modulation (PWM) controller may increase the duty factor, and thus increase input current, to maintain a constant delivered power. However, at some point, a specified RMS current limit may be reached and thus limit the power to the resistive load.","Accordingly, it is desirable to improve the ability of the heater control system to respond to changes in operating temperature by closely adhering to a specified power draw budget and\/or a specified current limit independent of the power source voltage and independent of any average current limit.","Systems and methods of sourcing a resistive load while adhering to a specified power draw budget and\/or a specified root mean square (RMS) current limit are disclosed. An exemplary embodiment generates a pulse width modulation (PWM) control signal, controls a switch in accordance with the control signal, sources the resistive load from a power source in accordance with the controlling of the switch, and modifies a duty factor of the switch to reduce the power drawn by the resistive load to the power limit in response to a power drawn by the resistive load exceeding a power limit defined by a slope-intercept curve.","In accordance with further aspects, an exemplary embodiment includes a resistive load, a switch coupled between a power source and the resistive load, and a power limiter coupled to the PWM controller. The switch sources the resistive load at an input voltage from the power source. Power is defined by the input voltage provided to the resistive load, the duty factor of the switch, as set by the PWM controller, and a current drawn by the resistive load. The PWM controller generates a control signal to control the duty factor of the switch. The power limiter adjusts the control signal in response to the power drawn by the resistive load exceeding a power limit defined by a slope-intercept curve, wherein the duty factor of the switch is modified by the PWM controller to limit the power drawn by the resistive load in response to the power limit.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0017","num":"0016"},"figref":"FIG. 1","b":["100","102","102"]},"An exemplary embodiment of the PWM controller , for a given demand level, controls the duty factor of power received from a power source . Power is delivered to a heater device  in the SBA heater  by using a control signal  to control a duty factor of a switch  coupled to the heater device . The control signal  operates the switch , thereby providing power to the heater device  at a duty factor of the switch  corresponding to the lower of system demand, demand of an average current limit and demand of a power limit. Accordingly, for a given power limit, embodiments of the PWM controller  controls the duty factor to limit the amount of power to the heater device  as the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  varies.","A temperature sensor  senses temperature of a sensor block assembly . When the sensed temperature is less than a predefined temperature threshold, the temperature sensor  provides a demand signal, via connection , such that the PWM controller  is enabled to control the switch . Accordingly, the PWM controller  controls temperature of a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) device  residing in the sensor block assembly .","During some operating condition, such as, but not limited to, at cold temperatures and\/or at start up, the temperature sensor can \u201crequest\u201d more power from the power source  than is desirable. Embodiments of the PWM controller , when under control of a power limiter , prevent this undesirable condition by limiting the input power. The specified power budget is enforced by the power limiter  which provides a power limit signal, on connection , to the PWM controller . The amount of power drawn by the heater device  is determined from the sensed voltage (V) and the sensed current (I). Vcorresponds to the input voltage (V) supplied from the power source  and is provided to the power limiter  via a connection . Icorresponds to the current supplied to the heater device  from the power source . In an exemplary embodiment, Imay be provided from a current sensing resistor , via connection . At relatively high source voltages, the allowed amount of drawn current is relatively small. However, at these relatively high source voltages, power drawn by an uncontrolled heater device  might increase above the power budget. Accordingly, the power limiter  becomes operable to limit the duty factor of the switch , thereby limiting the input power to the heater device .","The specified average current limit is enforced by a current limiter  which provides an average current limit signal, on connection , to the PWM controller . The amount of current drawn by the SBA heater  is determined from the sensed current (I). As the source voltage decreases, the current drawn by the heater device  will increase to maintain the power drawn by the heater device . The current is increased by increasing the duty factor of the switch . However, at some point, the requested current may become larger than the specified average current limit, independently of the power limit. Accordingly, the current limiter  becomes operable to limit the duty factor of the switch , thereby limiting average current to the heater device .","Any suitable current limiter circuitry may be used in the current limiter . Further, the exemplary current sensing resistor  was illustrated to conceptually indicate one possible means of sensing current drawn by the heater device . The current sensing resistor  may reside elsewhere in alternative embodiments. Other embodiments may use other devices or circuitry to sense the current.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0023","num":"0022"},"figref":"FIG. 2","b":["120","202","120","120","120"],"sub":["1","6","1","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0024","num":"0023"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","302","100","302","304","104","302","306","302","308"]},"The power limiter  enforces a power limit for various input voltages across the operating range  based upon the slope-intercept curve , as illustrated in the current-voltage plot . The slope-intercept curve  is defined by an intercept point  and a slope of the slope-intercept curve . The power limiter  operates to limit the duty factor of the switch , in accordance with the control signal , to prevent operation at points above the slope-intercept curve .","For example, when voltage provided by the power source  is at V, and an amount of current Iis otherwise available, the power delivered to the SBA heater  is at the operating point  (where the power is substantially equal to Itimes V). Since the SBA heater  is substantially a resistive heating element, the power drawn from a dc source can be approximated as the product of the average operating current times the average operating voltage. Here, the operating point  is above the slope-intercept curve .","Embodiments of the power limiter  transmit a power limiting signal to the PWM controller  to reduce the duty factor of the switch  in accordance with the control signal . The duty factor of the switch  would be set such that, at the exemplary operating voltage V, the average current would be limited to I. Accordingly, the delivered power corresponds to the operating point  (where the power is substantially equal to Itimes V).","If, on the other hand, the demand on the SBA heater  was such that power corresponding to the operating point  was required, the power limiter  would not operate to enforce the power limit. That is, the PWM controller  would be permitted to set the duty factor of the switch  to deliver the power corresponding to the operating point  (where the power is substantially equal to Itimes V) since this operating point  is below the slope-intercept curve . It is appreciated that at any operating point within the operating range , the PWM controller  would be permitted to set the duty factor of the switch  to deliver power since such operating points are below the slope-intercept curve .","When voltages provided by the power source  decrease, a corresponding increase in the duty factor of the switch  is required to increase current so as to maintain a demanded power. However, at some point, the current may reach an optional predefined threshold where the current limiter  operates to limit average current by controlling the duty factor of the switch . The current limiter  prevents operation at average currents above I.","For example, when voltage provided by the power source  is at V, and sufficient current Iis otherwise available, the SBA heater  could provide power defined by the operating point  (where the power is substantially equal to Itimes V). However, the operating point  corresponds to a current that is above the maximum average current I.","Embodiments of the current limiter  transmit a current limiting signal to the PWM controller  to reduce the duty factor of the switch , in accordance with the control signal , thereby reducing average current. The duty factor of the switch  would be set such that, at the exemplary operating voltage V, the average current would be limited to I. Accordingly, the delivered power is limited to the operating point  (where the power is substantially equal to Itimes V). Operating point  enforced by the average current limit limits the power to the resistor to be substantially less than what would be allowed by a constant power curve  or a slope-intercept curve .","When the power limiter  and the current limiter  cooperatively act to limit the power and the average current, respectively, an operating curve  is defined.","The power limiter , by defining the intercept point  and the slope of the slope-intercept curve , defines a portion  of the operating curve . The current limiter , by defining a maximum current I, defines a maximum average current portion , referred to as a constant-current voltage range, of the operating curve . Since the current along the maximum average current portion  of the operating curve  is less than currents of a portion  of the slope-intercept curve , it is appreciated that the portion  of the slope-intercept curve  is not part of the operating curve . Thus, the operating curve  can be conceptually viewed as a flat, maximum average current portion  and a sloped, constant power limit portion  that are joined at a break point . The break point , or the \u201cknee\u201d of the operating curve , corresponds to a transition between control under the power limit imposed by the power limiter  and control under the current limit imposed by the average current limiter . Accordingly, the sloped portion  approximates the portion of the ideal constant power limit curve  between the break point voltage Vand the maximum operating voltage V. The break point  defines a maximum average current portion  over a maximum average current voltage range  (from Vto the break point voltage), and defines a maximum current portion of  over a constant power voltage range  (from the break point voltage to V). At the maximum operating voltage (V), Icorresponds to an allowed current for a constant power range  at the operating point .","In alternative embodiments, additional break points may be added to extend the permitted power operating range  for higher values of V.","In operation of the exemplary embodiment of the power limiter  illustrated in , a ratio of the resistance of the resistors Rand Rdefine the slope of the slope-intercept curve  (). The resistor Rand the capacitor Cdefine a feedback loop to the amplifier .","The resistor Ris connected to a reference voltage (V). A ratio of the resistance of the resistors Rand Rdefine a reference voltage divider. The reference voltage divider, a second voltage divider defined by the ratio of Rand R, and the reference voltage (V) set the intercept point . The resistor Rand the capacitor Cdefine an optional noise filter and nulls out the input offset current from the resistors Rand R.","The resistor Rand the optional capacitor Ccooperatively act to filter out transients in the sensed current (I).","In some embodiments, in addition to the constant power, design considerations may specify a total average current that is drawn by the SBA heater  (and optionally, the MEMS device ). In such embodiments, the current load of the SBA heater circuitry (the PWM controller , the power limiter , the current limiter , and\/or other components) may be estimated based upon design and\/or may be determined by testing. Here, such average current load requirements could be offset from the sensed current (I) to more accurately control average input current than by controlling the resistance of the heater and the wiring resistance to the heater. This offset is implemented by adjusting the location of the break point  in the operating curve.","A root mean square (RMS) input current limit may be specified in an alternative embodiment. Since power into the resistive heater load is substantially constant when the power limiter is active, the RMS input current is substantially constant for a given resistive heater load value. The RMS input current is substantially constant because, at a high efficiency operating point, the the input power (P) is substantially equal to the output power (P\u2248P=I*R). Accordingly, in embodiments where the heater resistor is directly chopped, when the input power is constant into a constant load resistance, the RMS input current becomes substantially constant when operating in a power limit condition.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0040","num":"0039"},"figref":"FIG. 4","b":["402","332","404","332","404","402","100","324","332","404","402","402","324","332","404","402","100"]},"The break point  defines a maximum current portion  over a maximum average current voltage range  (from Vto a first break point voltage), and defines a first voltage dependent current limit portion  over a constant power voltage range  (from the first break point voltage to a second break point voltage).
