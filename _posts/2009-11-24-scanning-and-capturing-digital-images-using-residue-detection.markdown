{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"heading":["BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION"],"p":["1. Field of the Invention","The present invention relates generally to a document scanning system and in particular to scanning and capturing digital images using residue detection.","2. Description of the Related Art","Scanners are an important part of a word processing and\/or personal computer environment. A scanner is a device that optically scans printed or handwritten paper documents, objects, and photographs and creates digital images. One example of a scanner is a desktop or flatbed scanner that comprises a glass window on which a document is placed. A light positioned under the glass window is moved across the document to capture a digital image of the document and store the image in memory. With the digital image in memory, the image may be displayed, copied, transferred, printed, or altered as desired.","Scanning software, called a driver, is utilized to capture an image of a document. TWAIN is a common software language that scanner manufacturers use to communicate with scanners. The TWAIN driver acts as an interpreter between any application that supports the TWAIN standard and the scanner. The user configures the controls provided by the TWAIN driver to specify the scanning mode (e.g., color or black and white), the scanning resolution (e.g., 100 dpi or 200 dpi), the area on the flatbed glass window to be scanned, and other scanning characteristics, such as desired tonal quality and color balance of the scanned image. Once a document that has been placed on the glass window has been scanned, the TWAIN driver transfers the scanned image into memory.","After the images are stored in memory, a user may need to edit a scanned image because the image contains unwanted or irrelevant detail. A user may edit the scanned image using a graphics editing software product such as Adobe\u00ae Photoshop\u00ae. The graphics editing software enables a user to remove unwanted detail by cropping the image. Cropping refers to removing unnecessary or unwanted portions of the image, thereby improving the overall composition of the document.","The illustrative embodiments provide a mechanism for scanning and capturing digital images using residue detection. Upon detecting a document placed on a scanning surface of a scanning device, the illustrative embodiments detect a residue deposited on the document. The illustrative embodiments determine a portion of the document to be scanned based on a location of the residue on the document. The illustrative embodiments then scan the portion of the document.","As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a \u201ccircuit,\u201d \u201cmodule\u201d or \u201csystem.\u201d Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied in any tangible medium of expression having computer usable program code embodied in the medium.","Any combination of one or more computer usable or computer readable medium(s) may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device. Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The computer-usable medium may include a propagated data signal with the computer-usable program code embodied therewith, either in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. The computer usable program code may be transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc.","Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and conventional procedural programming languages, such as the \u201cC\u201d programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider).","The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and\/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions.","These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable medium that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable medium produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function\/act specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide processes for implementing the functions\/acts specified in the flowchart and\/or block diagram block or blocks.","The illustrative embodiments provide an intelligent scanner for capturing a digital image of a document based on residue detection. Residue is defined as any visible or invisible substance that comprises chemical, light-emitting, or light-absorbing properties that remain on a surface after the object that deposited the residue is removed from the surface. Ink from a pen is one example of residue. In one embodiment, ink may comprise ultraviolet (UV) invisible fluorescent ink which comprises UV compounds that may only be detected when illuminated by ultraviolet light. When a user uses a UV ink pen to write on a document, the UV properties of the ink deposited from the pen remain on the document for detection by applying UV light to the document. In another embodiment, the residue may comprise non-fluorescent properties, such as chemical elements from a fingerprint. Humans excrete various chemical substances in sweat, including sodium, potassium, and chlorine, which can be present in detectable quantities.","With the illustrative embodiments, a user may select a desired portion of a document to be scanned by first tracing a portion of the document with a residue-depositing object. In one embodiment, the trace may be performed by having the user outline a portion of the document with fluorescent ink. The contact of the ink with the document deposits detectable light-emitting residue onto the document surface. The trace may also be performed without requiring the object to come into contact with the document surface. For instance, the residue may be dispensed or dropped from the object at a distance from the document. The user then places the document onto the scanning surface of the scanning device. The scanning software in the intelligent scanner detects the presence of residue on the document to be scanned using residue detection technology.","Typically, scanners comprise cold cathode fluorescent lamps (\u2018CCFL\u2019), xenon lamps, standard fluorescent lamps, or diodes which are used to illuminate the document for scanning and a moving optical array or charged-coupled device (\u2018CCD\u2019) array comprising a collection of tiny light-sensitive diodes is used to collect the light reflected by the document. The illustrative embodiments modify these existing scanners to include residue detection technology. In one embodiment, a scanner may be modified to include a lamp comprising a UV light-emitting diode (LED). The UV light-emitting diode within the scanner housing emits light capable of inducing fluorescence in the ink residue. The embodiment relies upon the unique physical property of various materials to fluoresce when excited by certain wavelengths of light. Fluorescence is generally understood to be a property that enables some materials to absorb light energy and to radiate visible light at a longer wavelength than the absorbed light. According to generally accepted theory, electrons in fluorescent materials are excited upon being illuminated by light energy of a specific absorption band wavelength, and emit light energy in a longer wavelength response band as the electrons return to the unexcited or ground state. The specific excitation and response wavelengths are characteristics of the particular fluorescent materials. The deposited ink may fluoresce in the visible portion of the light spectrum upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In another embodiment, the scanner may be modified to include a micro-x-ray fluorescence machine. Micro-X-ray fluorescence, or MXRF, is currently used to detect chemical fingerprint elements where they have been deposited on a surface, thereby allowing patterns of a fingerprint to be seen and examined. The intelligent scanner may comprise an MXRF machine to detect the residue deposited from a user tracing a portion of the document.","Once the scanning software in the intelligent scanner detects the residue deposited on the document, the scanner scans a portion of the document based on the location of the detected residue. For instance, when photoreceptors in the scanner that are sensitive to the UV emission spectra of the ink detect the fluorescence in the ink deposited on the document, the scanning software in the scanner employs the traditional scanning lamps (e.g. CCFL) to illuminate the document and the CCD array to capture the portion of the document based on the residue trace detected by the photoreceptors. In this manner, the user may easily edit (i.e., crop) the document while the document is being scanned, rather than post-processing the digital image of the document by cropping the document that has already been scanned in its entirety. Thus, if the user selects the center portion of the document for scanning by depositing UV ink to trace a circle in the center portion of the document, the scanning software may scan and capture only the portion of the document within the circle. It should be noted that the user may define how the scanning software should interpret the traced areas. For instance, for a trace comprising closed areas (e.g., square, circle, hexagon, etc.), the user may configure the scanning software to either automatically scan the document area located within the trace or, alternatively, scan the document area located outside of the trace. For traces that do not comprise a closed area, the user may specify that the scanning software scan and capture an area of the document based on a proximity rule, wherein the proximity rule specifies that the scanning software either scans the area of the document located within a certain distance of the trace or omits scanning the area of the document located within a certain distance of the trace.","With reference now to the figures and in particular with reference to , a pictorial representation of an exemplary computer system for capturing a digital image of an object in accordance with the illustrative embodiments is shown. In this illustrative example, data processing system  comprises a computer  and a scanning or managed device . Computer  includes system unit , video display terminal , keyboard , storage unit , which may include floppy drives and other types of permanent and removable storage media, and mouse . Additional input devices may be included with personal computer , such as, for example, a joystick, touchpad, touch screen, trackball, microphone, and the like. Computer  may be implemented using any suitable computer, such as an IBM eServer computer or IntelliStation computer, which are products of International Business Machines Corporation, located in Armonk, N.Y. Although the depicted representation shows a computer, other embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in other types of data processing systems, such as a network computer. Computer  may also include a graphical user interface (GUI) that may be implemented by means of systems software residing in computer readable media in operation within computer .","Scanning device  may be connected to computer  via wire links, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables. In the depicted example, scanning device  is a flatbed scanner that comprises a glass window. When a document is placed on the glass window, a light positioned under the glass window is moved across the document to capture a digital image of the document and store the image in memory. The portions of the document that are actually captured by scanning device  in accordance with the illustrative embodiments are described in further detail in .","Turning now to , a block diagram of an exemplary data processing system with which the illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system  is an example of a computer, such as computer  shown in  or computer  in , in which computer usable program code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this illustrative example, data processing system  includes communications fabric , which provides communications between processor unit , memory , persistent storage , communications unit , input\/output (I\/O) unit , and display .","Processor unit  serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory . Processor unit  may be a set of one or more processors or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit  may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit  may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.","Memory  and persistent storage  are examples of storage devices. A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information either on a temporary basis and\/or a permanent basis. Memory , in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage  may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage  may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage  may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage  also may be removable. For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage .","Communications unit , in these examples, provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices. In these examples, communications unit  is a network interface card. Communications unit  may provide communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communications links.","Input\/output unit  allows for input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system . For example, input\/output unit  may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard and mouse. Further, input\/output unit  may send output to a printer. Display  provides a mechanism to display information to a user.","Instructions for the operating system and applications or programs are located on persistent storage . These instructions may be loaded into memory  for execution by processor unit . The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit  using computer implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory . These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit . The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory  or persistent storage . Within memory  or persistent storage , computer program instructions for an object display application for displaying an image of an object placed on the surface of scanning device  in  are provided. The object display application may operate generally for displaying an image on display  of an object placed on the scanning device by: detecting an object placed on the scanning surface, identifying a region of the surface upon which the object is placed, scanning, using the scanner, the identified region of the surface to create an object image of the object, and rendering the object image within the identified region. The object placed on the scanning surface may be implemented as a pictorial document such as a photograph or other printed graphic image, a text document, a hand, a portable computing device, or any other object as will occur to those of skill in the art.","In addition, a set of computer program instructions for a scanner device driver for operating scanner  in  is also provided within persistent storage  and is loaded into memory . The scanner device driver comprises scanning software that exposes an application programming interface (\u2018API\u2019) to the object display application that may be used to scan a region of the scanning surface to create an image of any objects placed in the region. The scanner device driver may be implemented in any number of ways and provide a variety of interfaces as will occur to those of skill in the art, including those according to the TWAIN specification promulgated by the TWAIN Working Group, the Image and Scanner Interface Specification (\u2018ISIS\u2019) developed by Pixel Translations, the Scanner Access Now Easy (\u2018SANE\u2019) specification, and so on.","Program code  is located in a functional form on computer readable media  that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system  for execution by processor unit . Program code  and computer readable media  form computer program product  in these examples. In one example, computer readable media  may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage  for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage . In a tangible form, computer readable media  also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system . The tangible form of computer readable media  is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances, computer recordable media  may not be removable.","Alternatively, program code  may be transferred to data processing system  from computer readable media  through a communications link to communications unit  and\/or through a connection to input\/output unit . The communications link and\/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non-tangible media, such as communications links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.","In some illustrative embodiments, program code  may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage  from another device or data processing system for use within data processing system . For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage medium in a server data processing system may be downloaded over a network  from the server  to data processing system . The data processing system providing program code  may be a server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code .","The different components illustrated for data processing system  are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system . Other components shown in  can be varied from the illustrative examples shown.","The different embodiments may be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of executing program code. As one example, the data processing system may include organic components integrated with organic components and\/or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor. As another example, a storage device in data processing system  is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory , persistent storage , and computer readable media  are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.","In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric  and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input\/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory  or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric .",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0039","num":"0038"},"figref":"FIG. 3","b":["300","300","300","306","300","302"]},"Scanner , which includes the mirrors, lens, filters, CCD array, lamps, and so on, moves across the underside of scanning surface  by a belt that is attached to a stepper motor. Scanner  is attached to stabilizer bars  to ensure that there is no wobble or deviation as the scanner passes beneath scanning surface . As scanner  passes beneath an object placed on scanning surface , the image of the object is reflected through a series of mirrors onto a lens. The lens splits the image into three smaller versions of the original. Each smaller version passes through a color filter, which is either red, green, or blue, onto a discrete section of the CCD array. Scanner  then combines the data from the three parts of the CCD array into a single full-color image.","Although scanner  is described above using CCD technology, other scanning technologies may also be useful in embodiments of the present invention. For example, a scanner in some embodiments may be implemented using contact image sensor (\u2018CIS\u2019) technology. CIS technology replaces the CCD array, mirrors, filters, lamp and lens with rows of red, green and blue light emitting diodes (\u2018LEDs\u2019). The image sensor mechanism, consisting of hundreds or thousands of individual sensors spanning the width of scanning surface , is placed very close to scanning surface  on which the object rests. When the object is scanned, the LEDs combine to provide white light. The illuminated image of the object is then captured by the row of sensors. Still further, readers will appreciate that other scanning technologies may be used. The CCD scanner and the CIS scanner described above are for explanation only and not for limitation.","Scanning computer  also comprises residue detection lamp . Residue detection lamp  is used to illuminate the residue deposited on the object. In one embodiment, residue detection lamp  may comprise a UV light-emitting diode. A UV light-emitting diode within scanner  emits light capable of inducing fluorescence in residue comprising UV fluorescent ink. In another embodiment, residue detection lamp  may comprise a micro-x-ray fluorescence lamp. A micro-x-ray fluorescence lamp within scanner  emits x-rays that are absorbed by chemical elements in the residue at specific frequencies in the light spectrum. Although particular implementations of residue detection lamp  are described above, it should be noted that any residue detection device capable of generating a light source that causes residue deposited on the object to illuminate and emit a response that is captured by photoreceptors  in the scanner may be used.","Scanning computer  comprises residue detection module . In one embodiment, scanning computer  is an example of data processing system  in . When the residue traced on the object is illuminated by residue detection lamp  and captured by photoreceptors  in the scanner, the existence of and the location of the residue trace is provided to the residue detection module . Residue detection module  in scanning computer  comprises software for receiving the detected presence of residue on the document from the photoreceptors in the scanner and generating instructions to scanning software in memory in data processing system  that instruct the scanning software to scan a selected area of the object based on the detected residue trace. Based on the shape and configuration of the residue deposited on the document, residue detection module  identifies the selected portion of the document to be scanned. The scanning software then instructs the scanner to scan the selected area of the object.","In one embodiment, residue detection module  may be configured by the user to interpret the traced areas in a particular manner, such as specifying that residue detection module  identify, for traces comprising closed areas, the document area located within the trace or the document area located outside of the trace for scanning. In another embodiment, scanning software in memory in data processing system  may be configured to receive the detected residue information from residue detection module  and identify the area to be scanned. The user may also specify that residue detection module  or the scanning software in memory should, for traces comprising non-closed areas, identify an area of the document for scanning based on a residue proximity rule. Based on the area identified using the residue proximity rule, scanner  may scan either the area of the document located within a certain distance of the trace, or omit scanning the area of the document located within a certain distance of the trace according to the user configuration. Residue detection module  may also be configured to apply a threshold of contiguous pixels to the detected residue trace to determine whether an area is to be considered \u201cselected\u201d.","It should be appreciated that  are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0046","num":"0045"},"figref":["FIGS. 4A-4C","FIG. 3","FIG. 3"],"b":["302","300","310","302"]},"In , document  to be scanned is shown placed on scanning surface  (i.e., viewed from the underside of scanning surface ). Prior to placing the document on scanning surface , a user identifies an area(s) of document  to be scanned by creating a trace or an outline of the desired area on document . The trace or outline of the desired area of document  may be created using the user's finger, using an object such as a pen, or using some other outlining or tracing means. The trace or outline may comprise any shape or formation, closed or unclosed. In this illustrative example, the trace or outline comprises a closed shape (rectangle) forming an enclosed area containing the desired subject for scanning. Other regular or irregular closed geometric shapes (e.g., circle, polygon, etc.) may be generated from the trace or outline. In embodiments as shown in , the trace or outline may comprise an unclosed shape. An unclosed shape is any trace that does not partition the document to be scanned into two or more separate areas. In these illustrative examples, the closed trace comprises one or more a horizontal or vertical lines, wherein the line ends terminate prior to reaching the edge of the document.","Regardless of the particular method used to trace or outline the desired area to be scanned and the particular shape of the trace or outline, the contact of the object utilized to create the trace or outline with document  deposits a detectable residue  onto the surface of document . In one example, residue  may include chemical elements such as sodium, potassium, and chlorine that are transferred from the user's skin to document  as the user creates the outline with the user's finger. In another example, residue  may include UV fluorescent ink deposited onto the document surface. The interior area defined by residue  in this example is shown to comprise a particular subject (shoes). The user then places document  face down onto scanning surface  as shown. In circumstances in which depositing the residue onto the document may alter the document, a transparent overlay may be used to maintain the quality of the document. For instance, ink residue from a pen will alter the original quality of document. The user may first place a transparent sheet over the document and use the pen to trace or outline the desired area of the document on the transparent sheet, without affecting the document itself. The document and the transparent overlay are then placed onto scanning surface .","Scanner  in  comprises a residue detection module that detects the presence and location of residue  on document  (or on the transparent overlay) using existing residue detection technology, such as micro-X-ray fluorescence. The residue detection module may inform the scanning software loaded in memory in data processing system  in  (or within the residue detection module itself) that the document to be scanned comprises residue. The scanning software may be configured by the user to define how the scanning software should interpret the residue trace or outline. The user may configure the scanning software to first determine if the residue detected by the residue detection technology is a valid (i.e., recognized) residue. In other words, the scanning software may be configured by the user to only capture a portion of document  if the residue substance detected is recognized by the scanning software as an acceptable or known residue substance. If the scanning software determines residue  is not a valid residue, the scanning software performs a traditional scan and captures a digital image of the document in its entirety. However, if residue  is determined to be a valid residue, the scanning software captures only a portion of document  based on the location of residue .","The user may also configure the scanning software by specifying which portion of document  should be captured. The user may specify that if the residue in the form of a closed shape is detected on the document, the scanning software will automatically scan only the area of document  that is encapsulated by the detected residue. Alternatively, the user may specify that the scanning software will automatically scan only the area of document  located outside of the detected residue. If the residue comprises an unclosed shape, the scanning software may be configured to scan (or omit) only the area of the document within the residue. In another embodiment, the user may configure the scanning software to implement a proximity algorithm that identifies the area of the document to be scanned as the area located within a certain distance of the residue trace. For example, the proximity algorithm may identify the area to be scanned (or omitted) as the area of the document within 5 centimeters of the trace. The proximity algorithm may also connect points in the trace to form a virtual polygon. For example, if the trace comprises an \u201cX\u201d shape, the proximity algorithm may create a virtual polygon by drawing straight lines between the residue trace to form a rectangle. The area inside or the area outside of the virtual rectangle may be scanned based on the configuration settings specified by the user. In another example, if the trace comprises separate dots on the document, the proximity algorithm may either create a virtual polygon by drawing lines between the dots and identify the area inside or outside of the polygon for scanning, or the proximity algorithm may determine the area(s) to be scanned are the areas located within a particular distance (e.g., circumference) from each dot.","The proximity algorithm may also be configured to omit scanning the area located within a certain distance of the unenclosed residue trace. For instance, if a document to be scanned includes unwanted or confidential text that should be redacted, the user may trace a line through the unwanted text with the user's finger. As the document is being scanned, the proximity algorithm will omit the area of the text located within a certain distance of the residue deposited from the user's finger.",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0052","num":"0051"},"figref":["FIG. 5","FIG. 3"],"b":["502","300","504"]},"Once the document is positioned on the scanning surface, the residue detection module within the scanner detects the presence of residue on the document to be scanned (step ). In one embodiment, the residue detection module uses micro-X-ray fluorescence to detect the chemical residue elements in the locations they have been deposited on the document by the user. In one embodiment, the residue detection module uses UV light to detect the fluorescence of UV ink in the locations deposited on the document. The scanning software loaded into memory in data processing system  in  (or the residue detection module depending upon the particular implementation used) makes a determination as to whether the particular residue detected by the residue detection module is a valid residue (step ). If the detected residue is not a valid residue (\u2018no\u2019 output of step ), the process performs a scan of the entire document in a traditional manner (step ). The scanned portion is then stored as a digital image in memory (step ), with the process terminating thereafter.","Turning back to step , if the detected residue is a valid residue (\u2018yes\u2019 output of step ), the scanning software examines the type of residue trace and determines if the trace comprises a closed shape (step ). If the residue trace is determined to comprise a closed shape (\u2018yes\u2019 output of step ), the scanning software then automatically scans and captures a digital image of only the area encapsulated within the residue trace (step ). In an alternative embodiment, the user may configure the scanning software to automatically scan only the area outside the residue trace rather than the area within the residue trace. In another embodiment, the scanning software may prompt the user to manually select whether the user wants the scanner to capture the area within the trace or capture the area outside of the trace. The scanned portion is then stored as a digital image in memory (step ), with the process terminating thereafter.","Turning back to step , if the residue trace is determined not to comprise a closed shape (\u2018no\u2019 output of step ), the scanning software determines the area of the document to be scanned using a proximity algorithm (step ). The scanning software then automatically scans and captures a digital image of only the area specified by the proximity algorithm (step ). The scanned portion is then stored as a digital image in memory (step ), with the process terminating thereafter.","The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention.
