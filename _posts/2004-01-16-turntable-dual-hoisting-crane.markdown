title: Turn-table dual hoisting crane
abstract: Containers are respectively loaded onto and delivered from two trolleys of a single crane at pick-up and delivery locations by guided travel of one of the trolleys along a fixed travel path on a boom between the delivery location at one end of the boom and a turn-table platform of the crane on which a pair of angularly related track paths are established for alternative alignment with the fixed travel path on the boom, to accommodate transfer of the trolleys between such fixed travel path and either one of the track paths on the platform.

{"@attributes":{"id":"description"},"RELAPP":[{},{}],"heading":["CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION","STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION","DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT"],"p":["This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60\/506,404 filed Sep. 26, 2003, entitled \u201cTURN-TABLE DUAL HOISTING CRANE\u201d, incorporated herein by reference.","The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.","The present invention relates to the transport of containers on a crane between land-based delivery and dockside sea vessel pick-up locations.","Current facilities for transport of containers between land and ships involve large marine terminal cranes, which typically embody one trolley traveling along the length of a boom for pick-up and delivery of the containers. While such cranes may be adequate for low demand at small scale sea ports, at larger ports such cranes are a disrupting bottleneck to terminal activities, which call for additional equipment and cranes to avoid delays in port traffic and container transfer. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for a more efficient and less time-consuming transfer of containers from trucks to ships through the aforementioned type of marine terminal crane.","Pursuant to the present invention, a single crane is provided through which repeated cycles of two simultaneously functioning trolleys may be moved along a fixed boom rail path and one of two 90\u00b0 related rail paths on a turn-table platform pivotally mounted for rotation about an axis at the intersection of such platform rail paths so as to accommodate transfer of each trolley between the fixed boom rail path and either one of the two platform rail paths positioned in alignment therewith by angular displacement of the turn-table platform. One of the trolleys may thereby be cyclically emptied or loaded from one end of the boom while the other trolley is either loaded with a container or emptied at one of the two positions underlying the platform.","Referring now to the drawing in detail,  illustrate a crane  adapted to be moved to a position for transfer of standard containers, such as a container  between pick-up and delivery locations such as a land-based pier  and dockside sea vessels . The crane  has a support frame  embodying four vertical gantry legs  interconnected in spaced relation to each other so as to support on their upper ends a rectangular central structure  in a horizontal position. An elongated boom  extends horizontally from the central structural . Opposite ends  and  of the boom  are spaced from the central structure  by different amounts. The boom end  is spaced a sufficient distance from the central structure  so as to accommodate container delivery thereat when the crane  is appropriately positioned by motorized wheel assemblies  at the lower ends of the crane gantry legs . Support cables  attached to the top of an anchor  fixed to the central structure  maintains the boom  in its horizontal position by connection of the lower ends of the cables  to the boom  adjacent to its opposite ends  and .","The container  and a spreader bar  are suspended below the boom  from one trolley  for travel along a path on the underside of the boom  between its end  and the central structure . A second container  and spreader bar  are suspended below the central structure  from a second trolley  mounted below a turntable type of switching platform  as hereinafter explained.","As shown in , the platform  is pivotally mounted by a post  and central bearing  from the structure , with the underside of the platform  exposed below the structure . Two pairs of tracks  and  are formed on such underside of the platform  to establish a pair of trolley travel paths which may be alternatively aligned with a fixed travel path established along the underside of the boom  by fixed tracks . The trolleys  and  are respectively suspended from the tracks  on the boom  and the tracks  or  on the platform  as shown in ,  and . The spreader bars  respectively connect the trolleys  and  to the containers  and . When either one of the platform tracks  and  is aligned with the fixed boom tracks  as shown in , the trolley  or  with its spreader bar  may be switched between the boom tracks  and the platform tracks  or  so as to thereby transfer the container  or  between the underside travel paths on the boom  and the platform , after which the platform  may be angularly displaced from the position shown in  toward another position at right angles thereto for realignment of the track  or  with the fixed boom track . Such angular movement of the platform  in opposite directions accommodates cyclic transfer of both of the trolleys  and  between the boom  and the platform  as hereinafter explained. The turn-table platform  has a radially outer rim  guidingly supported by bearings  on an angular track  projecting downwardly from the bottom surface of the structure  as shown in . The turn-table platform  is centrally suspended from the post  projecting downwardly from the bottom surface of the structure . The platform  rotates about a central pivot hole  guidingly supported by bearings  on post end .","An operational cycle of the crane  may be initiated for loading of the sea vessel  when one of the two trolleys  and  with its spreader bar  suspended below the platform  is picking up the container  or  at the land-based pier  from a vehicle  as shown in , while the other trolley  or  is located adjacent the end  of the boom  for container drop off onto the dockside sea vessel  at the delivery location. The trolley  or  when emptied is then moved along the fixed boom tracks  back to the platform  for transfer onto the empty platform tracks  or . The platform  is then rotated 90\u00b0 under powered drive in a counter-clockwise direction for example from its position as shown in  by motorized means to displace the emptied trolley  or  thereon out of alignment with the fixed boom tracks , while the platform tracks  with the container laden trolley  or  is brought into alignment with the fixed boom tracks  to permit the trolley  or  to begin its journey toward the forward end  of the boom  for container delivery thereat. During such rotation of the platform  the container  or  is angularly displaced through its spreader  relative to the trolley  or  to avoid obstruction thereof by the crane legs  during trolley movement along the platform tracks  or . The emptied trolley  or  on the platform  will then be positioned for container pick-up to complete one half of a cycle. The latter half-cycle process is repeated in a reverse direction to complete a full cycle with repositioning of the trolleys  and  on the crane  at the pick-up and delivery locations. Upon completion of each of such full cycles, the entire cycle may be repeated in order to accommodate container transfer between ships and piers by use of the single crane  with a significantly increased productivity. The foregoing described process may be reversed when desired with the pick-up location on the dockside sea vessel  while the land-based vehicle  is the delivery location, so as to unload the sea vessel .","Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described."],"GOVINT":[{},{}],"BRFSUM":[{},{}],"brief-description-of-drawings":[{},{}],"description-of-drawings":{"heading":"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING","p":["A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of its attendant advantages will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein:",{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0008","num":"0007"},"figref":"FIG. 1"},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0009","num":"0008"},"figref":["FIG. 2","FIG. 1"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0010","num":"0009"},"figref":["FIG. 3","FIG. 1"],"b":["3","3"]},{"@attributes":{"id":"p-0011","num":"0010"},"figref":["FIGS. 4","FIG. 2"],"b":["5","6","4","4","5","5","6","6"]}]},"DETDESC":[{},{}]}
